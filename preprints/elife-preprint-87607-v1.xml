<title>Abstract</title><p>The protein diversity of mammalian cells is determined by arrays of isoforms from genes. Protein mutation is essential in species evolution and cancer development. Accurate Long-read transcriptome sequencing at single-cell level is required to decipher the spectrum of protein expressions in mammalian organisms. In this report, we developed a synthetic long-read single-cell sequencing technology based on LOOPseq technique. We applied this technology to analyze 447 transcriptomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign liver from an individual. Through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis, we identified a panel of mutation mRNA isoforms highly specific to HCC cells. The evolution pathways that led to the hyper-mutation clusters in single human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules were identified. Novel fusion transcripts were detected. The combination of gene expressions, fusion gene transcripts, and mutation gene expressions significantly improved the classification of liver cancer cells versus benign hepatocytes. In conclusion, LOOPseq single-cell technology may hold promise to provide a new level of precision analysis on the mammalian transcriptome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian organisms are composed of numerous cells with multiple different roles. Individual cells are supported by a broad array of proteins with a variety of functions. While protein expression is dictated by the level of gene expression, the structure and function of the protein is largely determined by the isoforms of the mRNA of a given gene and are impacted by mutations or other structural alterations to the amino acids (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Faustino and Cooper, 2003</xref>). To understand the role of each cell in an organism, broad spectrum mRNA isoform and mutational gene expression analyses at the single-cell level is necessary.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, great strides in the field of long-read sequencing have enabled the quantification of mRNA isoforms in mammalian samples (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Logsdon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 2017</xref>). These sequencing technologies have been successfully employed to quantify mRNA isoforms from the bulk samples (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Athanasopoulou et al., 2022</xref>). However, little progress has been made in developing a technology to analyze mutated mRNA expressions at the single-cell level. Among the long-read sequencing solutions, LoopSeq synthetic long-read sequencing technology has been shown to produce the lowest error rate (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) and thus may be most suited for the mutational isoform expression analyses. In this report, we developed a strategy to integrate Element Biosciencesâ LoopSeq intramolecular barcoding technique with 10x Genomicsâ cell barcoding scheme to create a single-cell long-read isoform analysis vehicle. To demonstrate the utility of this methodology, we analyzed the isoforms of over 440 transcriptomes from the cells originating from a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient. The results showed evolutionary patterns of single molecule mutational gene expression from benign hepatocytes to liver cancer cells.</p>

<title>Single-cell LoopSeq strategy</title>
<p>The strategy of incorporating LoopSeq long-read technology with single-cell sequencing starts with utilizing the output of 10x Genomicsâ 3â single-cell assay. Approximately 200-300 cells from samples of both benign liver or HCC from a patient were encapsulated and unique molecular barcoded using a Gel Beads-in emulsion (GEM) system. The Gel Beads were dissolved, and any respectively associated cells were lysed prior to reverse transcription, template switching and transcript extension. The resulting 10x Adapter sequence contains a 16-base pair barcode, followed by a 12-base pair unique molecular identifier (UMI) and a 30-base pair poly(dT) sequence. Full length cDNA was then amplified from purified first-strand cDNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, blue box). A Loop adapter (containing 12-base pair unique molecular identifiers [LOOP UMI] and a 6 base pair sample index [SI]) was ligated to the 10x Genomics barcoded cDNA and subsequently enriched by exome probe sets that represent 19433 genes in the human genome. This was followed by amplification and the random intramolecular distribution of the LOOP UMIs throughout their respective cDNA molecules. The LOOP UMI distributed fragments were then subjected to short-read library preparation for sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, green box). Binned cDNA short-reads from individual LOOP UMIs were de novo assembled to generate consensus sequences of long mRNA transcripts.</p>

<p>200-300 live cells per sample were co-partitioned with Gel Beads and subsequently lysed. The captured mRNAs were reverse-transcribed and barcoded using Chromium Next GEM 3â reagent 3.1 kit (10x Genomics). The cellular barcoded cDNAs were ligated with a LoopSeq Adapter (Element Biosciences) and enriched by human core exome capturing (Twist Biosciences). This was followed by amplification and intramolecular distribution of the LOOP UMI located on the LoopSeq Adapter. The LOOP UMI barcoded cDNAs were then fragmented and ligated with an adaptor to generate a short-read sequencing library before sequencing.</p></caption>

<p>To produce sufficient long-reads for single-cell analysis, 2.985 billion short-reads were sequenced across the benign liver cells, while 3.814 billion short-reads were evaluated from the HCC cells. The assembly of these short-read sequences resulted in 5.8 million long-read transcripts for the benign liver sample and 6 million for the HCC sample. The mapping of 10x Genomics cell barcodes resulted 447 valid single cell transcriptomes (162 from the benign liver sample and 285 from the HCC sample). There were an average number of 1186 unique genes per cell and 1331 unique isoforms per cell in the benign liver sample and 1266 unique genes and 1416 unique isoforms in the HCC sample.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Mutational gene and isoform expressions in the cells from benign liver and HCC samples</title>
<p>To identify the mutational gene expressions in each cell, exome sequencing was performed on benign liver, HCC, and gallbladder samples from the same individual. The sequencing results from the gallbladder were used as a germline reference to establish whether the structural variants found in the benign hepatocytes or the HCC samples were somatic mutations. The expression data were then limited to including only non-synonymous mutations detected in the exomes of the benign liver or the HCC samples. The expressions of these mutations were further filtered by the requiring of detecting the same mutation in a minimum of three different cells. Based on these criteria, a total of 2939 mutations were found to be expressed in the HCC and benign hepatocyte samples.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of mutational gene expression in HCC development, mutated gene expression levels were normalized to âshareâ of the mutated transcripts relative to all the transcripts of a given gene, while mutational isoform expressions were normalized to âshareâ of the mutation isoforms relative to all the transcripts of a given isoform. When mutational gene expressions were compared across all the transcriptomes, variations of mutated gene expressions were found (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). To remove potential non-contributing mutational gene expressions, genes with a normalized mutated gene expression standard deviation (SD) &lt;0.4 across all the cells were removed. This resulted in 282 genes with mutated gene expression standard deviations <underline>&gt;</underline>0.4. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis was then applied to 447 transcriptomes from the HCC and benign liver samples based on these genes. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Supplemental Table 1, and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>), many cells from the HCC sample clustered to a pole position relative to the cells from the benign liver, while other cells from the HCC sample moved in proximity to the cells from the benign liver. To investigate whether mutational isoform expressions contributed to the development of HCC, similar removal of isoforms with mutated isoform expression standard deviations &lt;0.4 was performed. The resulting 205 mutational isoforms were then assessed in cells from the benign liver and HCC samples for UMAP clustering. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, Supplemental Table 2, and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2B</xref>, three distinct clusters emerged: one cluster was entirely composed of cells from the HCC sample, while the other two were mixtures of cells from the benign liver and the HCC samples, suggesting that some of these cells were in the transitional stage.</p>

<title>Mutations of genes involving antigen presentation dominated the mutation expression landscape</title>
<p>To examine the mutational characteristics of isoform expression in these transcriptomes, the clusters of the mutational isoform expressions in the UMAP were relabeled as A, B, and C groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). A total of 3335 mutation isoforms were found in cluster A, while 2175 and 1783 mutation isoforms were found in clusters B and C, respectively. The overlapping of the mutations from these three groups, as pictured in a Venn diagram (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), indicated that 1523 mutation isoforms were uniquely present in cluster A, while only 442 and 288 mutations were present in clusters B and C, respectively. These unique mutational isoforms were then combined and applied to the cluster analysis of 447 transcriptomes. The UMAP clustering generated four distinct clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), with 3 of the clusters composed entirely of cells from the HCC samples, distinctly separated from the 4<sup>th</sup> cluster, which was a mixture of cells from the benign liver and the HCC. We then limited the mutational isoforms to those that were expressed in at least 5 single-cell transcriptomes. This uncovered 113 mutations which met the established criteria (Supplemental Table 3). When UMAP analysis was performed based on these 113 mutation isoforms, eight distinctive clusters were resolved. All but one clusters contained cells co-migrated with cells of their sources (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the mutational isoform expressions in these clusters, 8 clusters were relabeled as A through H (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Among 113 mutation isoforms, the major histocompatibility complex (HLA) was the most prominent with 68 iterations (60.2%) (Supplemental Table 3, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Specifically, HLA-B NM_005514_2 mutations G283A and C44G were mostly present in cluster A. Cells in cluster B had mutations G572C, G539T, A527T, C463T, and G283A of HLA-B NM_005514_2, and cells in cluster C had mutations G379C and A167T of the same molecule. Cells in cluster D had up to 25 different mutations in HLA-DQB1 NM_002123. Cells in cluster E had partial mutations overlapped with those of clusters A and B. Surprisingly, cells in cluster F, which were from the benign liver, contained unique mutations in HLA-C NM_002117 molecule (T539G, C419T, G176A), while cells in cluster G, another cluster from the benign liver, had mutation G176A in the same molecule in addition to a mutation in ribosomal protein S9 (G525C, RPS9 NM_001013_5). Cluster H was a collection of cells with few mutations in the list. When the clusters were relabeled with mutations in HLA, all cells from clusters A through G were positive for some HLA mutations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). On the other hand, only 10 cells from group H were positive for the HLA mutation, suggesting these mutations in HLA molecules are highly cancer-specific (2.9x10<sup>-30</sup>).</p>

<title>Evolution of mutations in HLA molecules</title>
<p>Long-read sequencing enabled us to identify multiple mutations in the same molecule. Indeed, most HLA molecules contained multiple mutations. A salient example of a multi-mutation molecule is HLA-DQB1, where up to 25 missense mutations were identified in a single molecule of NM_002123 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We hypothesize that the collection of these mutations started from sporadic isolated mutations and accumulated over time in the development of HCC. To look for the origin of the mutation clusters, we searched for isolated mutation(s) that were the common denominators amongst the larger mutation clusters. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, the largest cluster (49 cells) of mutations occurred in the HLA-DQB1 NM_002123 molecule. The mutation cluster contained 25 single nucleotide variants that caused 24 amino acids changes within the single molecule. There were several possible nucleotide mutation accumulation pathways that could have led to the formation of this hypermutation cluster. One of the pathways appears to have started at aa252 with the modification of Arginine to Histidine. The spread of the mutations would have been in one direction from 3â end to 5â end in a mostly contiguous fashion. However, the main pathway of accumulation of mutations is likely to have come from the mid-segment of the molecule since many cells containing subsets of mutations in this segment were detected, albeit they have larger hops in the accumulation process. Some isolated mutations, such as R252H, S214N+R199H, occurred in cells from the benign liver sample. They were associated with malignancy when more mutations were accumulated.</p>

</fig>
<p>The stepwise accumulation of mutations in single molecules also occurred in HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1. In the HLA-B NM_005514_2 molecule, a total of 11 mutations were identified. The hypermutation cluster in the single protein started from 9 different isolated mutations. The main pathway of mutation accumulation appeared to start from the isolated mutations of W191S or A15G (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). These mutations expanded in a contiguous fashion and reached the peak at 8 mutations, as evidenced in 149 cells. One cell continued to expand its mutation repertoire up to 10 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">supplemental figure 3B</xref>). For HLA-C NM_002117, 14 different missense mutations were identified (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). The major cascade of the mutation accumulation appeared to start from the isolated mutations of L180R or S140F. The expressions of the combination of L180R and S140F mutations accounted for most cells (n=222) that contained HLA-C mutants, followed by the combination of L180, S140F and R59Q (n=147). One cell accumulated 8 mutations in the single molecule (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">supplemental figure 3D</xref>). The accumulation of these mutations appeared non-contiguous. For HLA-DRB1 NM_002124, up to 5 different mutations in a single molecule were identified (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figures 3E</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). All five isolated mutations were identified. The peak mutation accumulation (as seen in 81 cells) is the combination of S133A, A103P, A102G, and T80R. Multiple pathways were detected that might lead to this pattern of mutation accumulation.</p>

<title>Fusion gene expression in single-cell level</title>
<p>Gene fusion is one of the hallmarks of human cancers. To identify fusion gene transcripts in the sample, we applied SQANTI (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Tardaguila et al., 2018</xref>) annotation to the long-reads in order to identify transcripts that mapped to two different genes using the criteria described previously (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2014a</xref>) and in the methods. To rule out potential artificial chimera, the fusion gene must be corroborated by at least two different cells. After multilayer screening, 21 fusion genes were identified, and 3 fusion genes were selected to validate experimentally. Among these fusion genes, ACTR2-EML4 was detected only in the cancer sample (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). ACTR2 is a major component of ARP2/3 complex and is responsible for cell shape and motility, while EML4 contains WD repeats that are essential for protein-protein interaction. The fusion retains most of the WD repeat domain from EML4 while removing most of the amino acid sequence from ACTR2. The fusion protein likely functions as a decoy interference protein that negatively impacts the microtubule organization activity of EML4. PDCD6 is an EF hand domain-containing protein and has calcium and magnesium binding activity. CCDC127 is coiled-coil domain containing transcription repressor. The PDCD6-CCDC127 fusion retained most of the coiled-coil domain from CCDC127 and a single EF hand domain from PDCD6. The signaling response of the fusion protein may be altered because of the new calcium-binding motif in the molecule. Finally, the FLG-FGG fusion is a unique chromosomal translocation product where the chromosome breakpoint is located in the exons. The fusion is a truncation of plasminogen. The removal of the C-terminus from plasminogen may lead to constitutive activation of its protease and to enhance blood coagulation and other cell signaling activities of plasminogen.</p>

<title>Mutational gene expression and fusion transcript enhanced transcriptome clustering of benign hepatocytes and HCC</title>
<p>Cell clustering and segregation can be determined by the differential expression of transcripts. Our mutational gene expression analyses suggested that some benign hepatocytes harbored mutations that resembled those of malignant cells. To reduce the complexity amongst the transcriptomes, we removed genes or isoforms that across all samples had with expression standard deviations less than 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.4, respectively. As shown in <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figures 6</xref>-<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and Supplemental Tables 4-11, the segregation of two groups of cells occurred when genes or isoforms had standard deviations &gt;0.5. The segregation became more pronounced when the standard deviations were larger, with mostly malignant cells in one group and a mixture of malignant and benign hepatocytes in the other. Such cluster segregations were similarly found in either genes or isoform analyses. To examine the relationship between the isoforms and genes, the lists of isoforms and genes at each standard deviation were overlapped through Venn diagrams (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figures 8A-D</xref>). Interestingly, gene lists included all the isoforms within the same range of standard deviation. To investigate the roles of gene expression alterations that were not accompanied with isoform expression changes, UMAP analyses were performed based on the non-overlapped genes. The results indicated a dramatic reduction of segregation of cells between benign liver and HCC. In contrast, gene-based clustering using genes that showed both gene and isoform level changes had segregations between benign hepatocytes and HCC cells similar to those performed with the full lists, suggesting that the isoform alterations were the underlying causes that separated the cells between these two samples. Examination of the gene list (182, Supplemental Table 6) with standard deviations â¥1.0 showed a consistent down-expression of genes of apolipoprotein family, up-expression of genes of ribosomal protein family and HLA family in cells from the HCC sample, indicating that cancer cells were less hepatic differentiated, but more active in protein synthesis and immune evasion.</p>

<p>To investigate whether the mutation analysis improved the segregation between cells from the benign liver and HCC, UMAP analysis was performed using genes with standard deviations â¥ 1.0 (182 wild-type genes) and standard deviations <underline>&gt;</underline>0.4 (282 mutated genes). The results showed that the combination of gene and mutational gene expressions generated three clusters: with 2 clusters comprised mostly cells from the cancer sample and 1 cluster of cells mostly from the benign liver (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figures 9A-C</xref>). When the clusters were relabeled as A, B, and C. Cluster A (mostly benign hepatocyte group) had a gain of 7 cells from the benign liver sample and loss of 27 cells from the HCC sample in comparison with that of gene expression analysis alone (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting that the mutation analysis helped to reclassify some of the cells misassigned by gene expression analysis. To investigate whether fusion gene analysis would add value to the clustering of cells from HCC and benign liver, fusion genes were added to the UMAP analysis. The results showed that cluster B moved closer to the cancer cell cluster (cluster C, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>-C and Supplemental Table 12). Cluster A gained one cell from the benign liver sample and four cells from the HCC sample. Five cells from the benign liver were consistently classified as cancer by the cluster analysis. Further analysis showed that these cells had significant down-expression of genes of apolipoprotein family, up-expression of genes of ribosomal protein and HLA families, and extensive mutations in HLA molecules, suggesting that they were probably the cancer cells embedded in the benign liver sample.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Long-read sequencing is essential to detect isoform expressions from genes. Synthetic long-read sequencing offers a valuable solution to analyze isoform transcripts of a gene because of its high accuracy, low-error rate, and quantification suitability. However, due to the low-yield nature of most synthetic long-read sequencing methodologies for transcriptome analysis, analyses are mostly limited to a few targeted genes (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze broad-spectrum mutational isoform expression at the single-cell level using synthetic long-read sequencing technology. The technology described in this study may have broad utility in biology and medicine: it can be applied to quantify the diversity of isoform expression, resolve mutational gene expression and be used to discover novel fusion genes and new isoforms in any mammalian biological system. For medical research, the technology may help to determine which specific protein structure should be targeted by making the specific mutational isoform expression information available.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a lack of studies on multiple mutations in a single molecule or mutational gene expression at the single-cell level due to the absence of a reliable method. Our study suggested that mutations were mainly expressed in a specific isoform of a gene for a given cell. The lack of diversity of mutational isoform expression in a given cell may be due to the preferred splicing process of cells of different lineage or of different differentiation stages. Alternatively, mutations may have an impact on the RNA splicing process. Interestingly, mutational gene expression of antigen-presenting genes dominated the expressed mutation list from HCC cells. Most mutations occurred in the extracellular domain of the HLA molecules. For HLA-B and HLA-C, all three Î±-domains were mutated, and for HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1, both Î²-domains and the peptide binding motifs were impacted. These mutations may alter the interaction with T lymphocytes (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Kondo et al., 2004</xref>). There was a broad spectrum of somatic mutations that affected the HLA gene, since both cytosolic and endocytic pathways of antigen presentation may be blocked (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Arnaiz-Villena et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Manoury et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, the expression levels of the mutated HLA molecules also increased in comparison with wild-type alleles from the benign hepatocytes. The hypermutations of these HLA molecules may shield cancer cells from being recognized and targeted by T lymphocytes and allow the cancer cells to evade the host immune surveillance.</p>
<p>The hypermutations in several HLA molecules are of interest because they probably did not happen overnight. Several isolated mutations were also detected in cells from the benign liver samples, suggesting that these mutations accumulated through a clonal progression fashion from a relatively benign background. In the process of malignant transformation, additional mutations in the HLA molecules were acquired due to the pressure from the cellular immune response. Malignant cells with few mutations in the HLA molecules may be destroyed by T lymphocytes, while those with newer mutations evaded the attack. Presumably, the cellular immune system adapted to the new mutations of these HLA molecules and resumed the response to the cancer cells. These cycles may continue to the extent that the mutations overwhelmed the cellular immune system. However, such hyper-mutation clusters may make cancer cells highly vulnerable to artificial immune intervention such as drug conjugated (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>) or radio-isotope (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Bush, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Guleria et al., 2017</xref>) labeled humanized antibody specific for these mutations or cancer vaccine since almost all of these mutations are in the extracellular domains. CRISPR-cas9 mediated genome targeting (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) at these mutation sites could be an option.</p>

(2) Based on the Minimap2 (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2018</xref>) alignment and hg38 UCSC annotation file, fusions were called from the long-reads that were aligned to two genes. Based on all the fusion calling, the following filtering criteria were applied: (1) Eliminate the fusions where the head and tail genes were in cis-direction and were less than 40 kb apart; (2) Eliminate the fusions whose head genes have more than 2 tail partners in all the fusion callings; (3) Eliminate the fusions whose tail genes have more than 2 head gene partners in all the fusion callings; (4) Only keep those fusions whose joining points are located at the edge of the exons; (5) Fusions must be detected in at least 2 cells. These selected fusions and experimentally validated fusions were subsequently used for downstream analysis.</p>

<title>Integrative analysis to combine expression, mutation, and fusion data</title>
<p>High SD expression genes (or isoforms), high SD mutation genes (or isoforms), and selected fusion transcripts were integrated. UMAP (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>) cell visualization was applied, combining all three feature sets to perform the cell clustering. Data visualization was performed by R/Bioconductor package <italic>ComplexHeatmap (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2016</xref>)</italic> and <italic>ggplot2 (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Wickham, 2016</xref>)</italic>.</p>

<p>In the manuscript &quot;Longâread singleâcell sequencing reveals expressions of hypermutation clusters of isoforms in human liver cancer cells&quot;, S. Liu et al present a protocol combining 10x Genomics single-cell assay with Element LoopSeq synthetic long-read sequencing to study single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and gene fusions in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at singleâcell level. The authors were the first to combine LoopSeq synthetic longâread sequencing technology and 10x Genomics barcoding for single cell sequencing. For each cell and each somatic mutation, they obtain fractions of mutated transcripts per gene and per each transcript isoform. The manuscript states that these values (as well as gene fusion information) provide better features for tumor-normal classification than gene expression levels. The authors identified many SNVs in genes of the human major histocompatibility complex (HLA) with up to 25 SNVs in the same molecule of HLAâDQB1 transcript. The analysis shows that most mutations occur in HLA genes and suggests evolution pathways that led to these hypermutation clusters. Yet, very little is said about novel isoforms and alternative splicing in HCC cells, differences in isoform ratio between cells carrying different mutations, or diversity of alternative isoforms across cells. While the manuscript by Liu et al. presents a promising combination of technologies, it lacks significant insights, a comprehensive introduction, and has significant problems with data description and presentation.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>1. The introduction section is scarce. It lacks description of important previous works focused on clustered mutations in cancers (for example, PMID35140399), on deriving the process of cancer development through somatic evolution (PMID32025013, from single cell data PMID32807900). Moreover, some key concepts e.g. mutational gene expression and mutational isoform expression are not defined. The introduction and the abstract contain slang expressions e.g. &quot;protein mutation', a combination of terms I teach my students not to use.</p>
<p>2. In the results section, to select the mutations of interest, the authors apply UMAP dimensionality reduction to the mutation isoforms expression and cluster samples in UMAP space, then select the mutations that are present only in one cluster, then apply UMAP to the selected mutations only and cluster the samples again. The motivation for such a procedure seems unclear, could it be replaced with a more straightforward feature selection?</p>
<p>3. As I understand, the first &quot;mutated isoform&quot;-based UMAP clustering was built from expression levels of 205 &quot;mutational isoforms&quot;. What was the purpose and outcome of the second &quot;mutated isoform&quot;-based UMAP clustering (Figure 2E)? In the manuscript the authors just describe the clusters and do not draw any conclusions or use the results of the clustering anywhere further.</p>
<p>4. The authors just cluster the data three times based on expression levels of different sets of &quot;mutational isoforms&quot; and describe the clusters. What do we need to gather from these clustering attempts besides the set of 113 mutations used for further analysis? What was the point of the re-clusterings? Did the authors observe improvement of the classification at each step?</p>
<p>5. The alignment of short reads generated from hypermutated transcriptomes is non-trivial. The proposed approach could address the issue without need for whole genome sequencing and offer insights about the cancer development through somatic evolution. Why didn't the authors use modern phylogenetic approaches in the &quot;Evolution of mutations in HLA molecules&quot; section or at least utilize the already performed clustering to infer cell lineages?</p>
<p>6. I am not sure I understood the definition of &quot;mutated gene expression levels&quot; and &quot;mutated isoform expression levels&quot; in the &quot;Mutational gene expression and fusion transcript enhanced transcriptome clustering of benign hepatocytes and HCC&quot; section. The authors mention that gene lists included all the isoforms within the same range of standard deviation. If I understand it correctly, they are equal if there is only one expressed transcript isoform. In that case, this overlap is not surprising at all.</p>
<p>7. &quot;To investigate the roles of gene expression alterations that were not accompanied with isoform expression changes, UMAP analyses were performed based on the nonâoverlapped genes.&quot; Venn diagrams (Sup Figure 8) show that there are much less &quot;non-overlapped genes&quot; than &quot;genes that showed both gene and isoform level changes&quot; for each SD threshold (for example, for SD&gt;=0.8 59 vs 275). Could that be the reason why clustering based on the former group is worse i.e the cancer and normal cells are separated less clearly?</p>

<p>In the present study, Liu et al present an analysis of benign and HCC liver samples which were subjected to a new technology (LOOP-Seq) and paired WES.  By integrating these data, the authors find isoforms, fusions and mutations which uniquely cluster within HCC samples, such as in the HLA locus, which serve as candidate leads for further investigation.  The main appeal of the study is in the potential of LOOP-Seq as a method to present isoform-resolved data without actually performing long-read sequencing.   While this presents an exciting new method, the current study lacks systematic comparisons with other technologies/data to test the robustness, reproducibility and utility of LOOP-Seq.  Further, this study could be further improved by giving more physiologic context and examples from the analyses, thus providing a new resource to the HCC community.  A few suggestions based on these are below:</p>
<p>A primary consideration is that this seems to be the first implementation of LOOP-Seq, where the technology, while intriguing, has not been evaluated systematically.  It seems like a standard 10x workflow is performed, where exons are selectively pulled down and amplified.  Subsequent ultra-deep sequencing is assumed to give isoform-resolution of the sc-seq data.  To demonstrate the utility of the approach it would benefit the study to compare the isoform-resolved results with studies where long-read sequencing was actually performed (ex: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.lww.com/hep/Fulltext/2019/09000/Long_Read_RNA_Sequencing_Identifies_Alternative.19.aspx">https://journals.lww.com/hep/Fulltext/2019/09000/Long_Read_RNA_Sequencing_Identifies_Alternative.19.aspx</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jhep-reports.eu/article/S2589-5559(22)00021-0/fulltext">https://www.jhep-reports.eu/article/S2589-5559(22)00021-0/fulltext</ext-link>,  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010342">https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010342</ext-link>).  Presumably, a fair amount of overlap should occur to justify the usage.</p>
<p>Related to this point, the sc-seq cell types and benign vs HCC genes should be compared with the wealth of data available for HCC sc-seq  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32283-3">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32283-3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84693-w">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84693-w</ext-link>).  These seem to be important to benchmark the technology in order to demonstrate that the probe-based selection and subsequent amplification does not bias cell type definition and clustering.  In particular, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03974-6">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03974-6</ext-link> seems quite relevant to compare mutational landscapes from the data.</p>
<p>From the initial UMAP clustering, it will be important to know what the identities are of the cells themselves.  Presumably there is quite a bit of immune cells and hepatocytes, but without giving identities, downstream mechanistic interpretation is difficult.</p>
<p>In general, there are a fair amount of broad analyses, such as comparisons of hierarchical clustering of cell types, but very little physiologic interpretations of what these results mean.  For example, among the cell clusters from Fig 6, knowing the pathways and cell annotations would help to contextualize these results.  Without more biologically-meaningful aspects to highlight, most of the current appeal for the manuscript is dependent on the robustness of LOOP-seq and its implementation.</p>
<p>Many of the specific analyses are difficult and the methods are brief.  Especially given that this technology is new and the dataset potentially useful, I would strongly recommend the authors set up a git repository, galaxy notebook or similar to maximize utility and reproducibility</p>
<p>The authors claim that clustering between benign and HCC samples was improved by including isoform &amp; gene (Suppl fig 8).  This seems like an important conclusion if true, especially to justify the use of long-read implementation.  Given that the combination of isoform + gene presents ~double the number of variables on which to cluster, it would be important to show that the improved separation on UMAP distance is actually due to the isoforms themselves and not just sampling more variables from either gene or isoform</p>
<p>SQANTI implementation to identify fusions relevant for the HCC/benign comparison. How do the fusions compare with those already identified for HCC?  These analyses can be quite messy when performed on WES alone so it seems that having such deep RNA-seq would improve the capacity to see which fused genes are strongly expressed/suppressed.  This doesn't seem as evident from current analysis.  There are quite a bit of WES datasets which could be compared:  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3252">https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3252</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03276-y">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03276-y</ext-link></p>
<p>Figure 4 is fairly unclear.  The matrix graphs showing gene position mutations are tough to interpret and make out.  Usually, gene track views with bars or lollipop graphs can make these results more readily interpretable.  Also, how Figure 4 B infers causal directions from mutations is unclear.</p>

<p>The Liu, et al. manuscript focuses on the interesting topic of evaluating in an almost genome-wide-scale, the number of transcriptional isoforms and fusion gene are present in single cells across the annotated protein coding genome. They also seek to determine the occurrences of single nucleotide variations/mutations (SNV) in the same isoform molecule emanating from the same gene expressed in normal and normal and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This study has been accomplished using modified LoopSeq longâread technology (developed by several of the authors) and single cell isolation (10X) technologies. While this effort addresses a timely and important biological question, the reader encounters several issues in their report that are problematic.:</p>
<p>1. Much of the analysis of the evolution of mutations results and the biological effects of the fusion genes is conjecture and is not supported by empirical data. While their conclusions leave the reader with a sense that the results obtained from the LoopSeq has substantive biological implications. However, they are extended interpretations of the data. For example: The fusion protein likely functions as a decoy interference protein that negatively impacts the microtubule organization activity of EML4.(pg 9)... and other statements presented in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>2. LoopSeq has the advantage of using short read sequencing analyses to characterize the exome capture results and thus benefits from low error rate compared to standard long-read sequencing techniques. However, there is no evidence obtained from standard long read sequencing that the isoforms observed with LoopSeq are obtained with parallel technologies such as long read technologies. It is not made clear how much discordance there is in comparing the LoopSeq results are with either PacBio or ONT long read technologies.</p>
<p>3. There is no proteome evidence (empirically derived or present in proteome databases) from the HCC and normal samples that confirms the presence or importance of the identified novel isoforms, nor is there support that indicate that changes in levels HLA genes translate to effects observed at the protein level. Since the stability and transport differences of isoforms from the same gene are often regulated at the post-transcriptional level, the biological importance of the isoform variations is unclear.</p>
<p>4. It is unclear why certain thresholds were chosen for standard deviation (SD) &lt;0.4 (page 5), SD &gt;1.0 (pg 11).</p>
<p>5. HLA is known to accumulate considerable somatic variation. Of the many non-immunological genes determined to have multiple isoforms what are the isoform specific mutation rates in the same isoform molecule? Are the HLA genes unique in the number of mutations occurring in the same isoform?</p>
