<title>Abstract</title><p>SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been used worldwide to combat COVID-19 pandemic. To elucidate the factors that determine the longevity of spike (S)-specific antibodies, we traced the characteristics of S-specific T cell clonotypes together with their epitopes and anti-S antibody titers before and after BNT162b2 vaccination over time. T cell receptor (TCR) αβ sequences and mRNA expression of the S-responded T cells were investigated using single-cell TCR- and RNA-sequencing. Highly expanded 199 TCR clonotypes upon stimulation with S peptide pools were reconstituted into a reporter T cell line for the determination of epitopes and restricting HLAs. Among them, we could determine 78 S epitopes, most of which were conserved in variants of concern (VOCs). After the 2nd vaccination, T cell clonotypes highly responsive to recall S stimulation were polarized to follicular helper T (Tfh)-like cells in donors exhibiting sustained anti-S antibody titers (designated as “sustainers”), but not in “decliners”. Even before vaccination, S-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clonotypes did exist, most of which cross-reacted with environmental or symbiotic bacteria. However, these clonotypes contracted after vaccination. Conversely, S-reactive clonotypes dominated after vaccination were undetectable in pre-vaccinated T cell pool, suggesting that highly-responding S-reactive T cells were established by vaccination from rare clonotypes. These results suggest that <italic>de novo</italic> acquisition of memory Tfh-like cells upon vaccination may contribute to the longevity of anti-S antibody titers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The pandemic COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has expanded worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Many types of vaccines have been developed or in basic and clinical phases to combat infection and deterioration of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Among them, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines, BNT162b2/Comirnaty and mRNA-1273/Spikevax, have been approved with over 90% efficacy at 2 months post-2nd dose vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], and widely used. Pathogen-specific antibodies are one of the most efficient components to prevent infection. Yet, mRNA vaccine-induced serum antibody titer is known to be waning over 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Accordingly, the effectiveness of the vaccines decreases over time, and thus multiple doses and repeated boosters are necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>The production and sustainability of spike (S)-specific antibody could be related to multiple factors, especially in the case of humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Among them, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are critically involved in the affinity and longevity of the antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Elucidation of the key factors of T cell responses that contribute to the durable immune responses induced by vaccination would provide valuable information for the vaccine development in the future. However, the relationship between antibody sustainability and the types of antigen-specific T cells has not been investigated in a clonotype resolution.</p>
<p>Recent studies reported that S-reactive T cells pre-existed before exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Common cold human coronaviruses (HCoVs) including strains 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are considered major cross-reactive antigens that primed these pre-existing T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], while bacterial cross-reactive antigens were also reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, the functional relevance of cross-reactive T cells during infection or vaccination is still in debate.</p>
<p>In this study, both humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated at 3, 6 and 24 weeks after BNT162b2/Comirnaty vaccination. S-specific T cells before and after vaccination were analyzed on clonotype level using single cell-based T cell receptor (TCR) and RNA sequencing to determine their characteristics and epitopes in antibody sustainers and decliners. These analyses suggest the importance of early acquisition of S-specific Tfh cells in the longevity of antibodies.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine elicits transient humoral immunity</title>
<p>Blood samples were collected from a total of 43 individuals (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) who had no SARS-CoV-2 infection history when they received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. Samples were taken before and after the vaccination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Consistent with the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], most participants exhibited more severe side effects after 2nd dose of vaccination than 1st dose locally (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and systemically (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). At 3 weeks, anti-S IgG antibody titer increased in most participants. At 6 weeks, anti-S antibody titer was at its peak. S antibody titer gradually decreased over 24 weeks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The antibody titer was reduced by 56.8% on average. Donors of different genders or age groups showed no significant difference in anti-S antibody titer (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). The neutralization activity of the post-vaccinated sera showed similar tendency with the anti-S antibody titer during the study period (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The above results indicate that the mRNA vaccine effectively activated humoral immune responses in healthy individuals, but decreased by 24 weeks over time as reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>

<title>Antibody sustainers had highly expanded S-reactive Tfh clonotypes</title>
<p>To address the role of T cells in maintaining the antibody titer, we analyzed the S-responsive T cells in the post-vaccination samples from 8 donors, among whom 4 donors showed relatively sustained anti-S antibody titer during 6 weeks to 24 weeks (reduction &lt; 30%) (sustainers, donors #8, #25, #27 and #28), while the other 4 donors showed largely declined anti-S antibody titer (reduction &gt; 80%) (decliners, donors #4, #13, #15 and #17) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection of sustainers was ruled out by analyzing anti-nucleocapsid protein (N) antibody titer in the sera samples at 24 weeks (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). Antibody sustainability did not correlate with bulk T cell responses to S protein, such as IFNγ production (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To enrich the S-reactive T cells, we labeled the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a cell proliferation tracer and stimulated the PBMCs with an S peptide pool for 10 days. Proliferated T cells were sorted and analyzed by single-cell TCR- and RNA-sequencing (scTCR/RNA-seq). Clustering analysis was done with pooled samples of 3 time points from 8 donors, and various T cell subtypes were identified (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We found that, overall, the S-reactive T cells did not skew to any particular T cell subset (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, by grouping the cells from decliners and sustainers separately, we found difference in the frequency of the cells within the circled population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), and overall, the sustainer individuals had more cells in this region (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). These cells showed high Tfh signature scores and expressed characteristic genes of Tfh cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). This tendency became more pronounced when we selected highly expanded (top 16) clonotypes in each donor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). In sustainers, S-specific Tfh clusters appeared from 6 weeks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), suggesting that vaccine-induced Tfh-like cells that have potency of deriving to Tfh cells were established immediately after 2nd vaccination.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Identification of dominant S epitopes recognized by vaccine-induced T cell clonotypes</title>
<p>To elucidate the epitopes of the highly expanded clonotypes, we reconstituted their TCRs into a T cell hybridoma lacking endogenous TCRs and having an NFAT-GFP reporter gene. These cell lines were stimulated with S peptides using transformed autologous B cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The epitopes of 53 out of 128 reconstituted clonotypes were successfully determined (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4A–S4D</xref>). Epitopes of expanded Tfh cells were not limited in any particular region of S protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). About 72% of these epitopes conserved in Delta and Omicron variants (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref> and <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Within the rest of 28% of epitopes which were mutated in variants of concern (VOCs), although some mutated epitopes located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of VOCs lost antigenicity, recognition of most epitopes outside the RBD region was maintained or rather increased in the variants (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4E</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4F</xref>). These results suggest that the majority of S-reactive clonotypes after vaccination can respond to antibody-escaping VOCs.</p>

<title>Identification of S epitopes and cross-reactive antigens of pre-existing T cell clonotypes</title>
<p>Before the pandemic, T cells cross-reacting to S antigen were present in the peripheral blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. To characterize these pre-existing S-reactive cells, we analyzed the PBMCs collected from donors who consented to blood sample donation before vaccination (#4, #8, #13, #15, and #17). PBMCs were stimulated with the S peptide pool for 10 days, and proliferated T cells were sorted and analyzed by scTCR/RNA-seq. Similar to vaccine-induced S-reactive T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), characteristics of pre-existing S-reactive T cells were diverse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To track the dynamics of cross-reactive clones after vaccination, we combined the single-cell sequencing data of pre- and post-vaccinated PBMCs and analyzed the clonotypes that have more than 50 cells in total (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We did find some cross-reactive clonotypes that were further expanded by vaccination, and most of these clonotypes had cytotoxic features, being CD8<sup>+</sup> effector memory T cells (Tem) or minor CD4<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). In contrast, most of the cross-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells became minor clonotypes after vaccination.</p>

<p>We also explored the epitopes of the top 16 expanded clonotypes in each pre-vaccinated donor by reconstituting the TCRs into reporter cell lines. We identified 18 epitopes from S protein and determined some possible cross-reactive antigens (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). Most of these cross-reactive antigens originated from environmental or symbiotic microbes (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Furthermore, majority of the reactive T clonotypes showed regulatory T cell (Treg) signatures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Six of these 80 analyzed clonotypes could also be frequently detected in the public TCR database Adaptive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Notably, most of these clonotypes, except for one case, showed comparable frequencies between pre-pandemic healthy donors and COVID-19 convalescent patients (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that these clonotypes did not expand upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite they were present before the pandemic. Thus, it is unlikely that these cross-reactive T clonotypes contribute to the establishment of S-reactive T cell pools during either vaccination or infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies showed that Tfh function and germinal center development were impaired in deceased COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and Tfh cell number correlated with neutralizing antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Consistent with the above studies, we found that the donors having sustained antibody titers between 6 to 24 weeks post-vaccination had more S antigen-responsive Tfh-like clonotypes maintained in the periphery as a memory pool. As circulating Tfh clonotypes can reflect the population of germinal center Tfh cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], it is possible that these maintained S-responsive Tfh cells contribute to the prolonged production of anti-S antibodies. These results imply that Tfh polarization of S-reactive T cells in the blood after 2nd vaccination can be a marker for the longevity of serum anti-S antibodies. Although monitoring of S-specific Tfh cells in germinal center is ideal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], it is currently difficult for outpatients in clinics.</p>
<p>Since the antigen used for BNT162b2 is a full-length S protein from the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, it is important to estimate whether vaccine-induced Wuhan S-reactive T cells recognize neutralizing antibody-evading VOCs, such as Omicron variants. To investigate the dominant T cell epitopes of vaccine-developed T cells, we utilized a proliferation-based sorting strategy to enrich the S-responsive T cells. The limitation of this strategy is that a 10-day stimulation would change the transcriptional profile and repertoire of T cells. However, this strategy allowed us to select the T cell clonotypes that vigorously responded to the S antigen stimulation, while weakly responsive cells and anergic cells will be less considered, which is exactly in line with our purpose. Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], most of the epitopes determined in the current study were conserved in Delta and Omicron (BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/5) strains, suggesting that vaccine-induced T cells are able to recognize the mutated S proteins from these variants, despite the B epitopes being largely mutated in these VOCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2-recognizing T cells existed prior to exposure to the S antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], which is consistent with our observation with PBMCs from donors who were uninfected and pre-vaccinated. Among these pre-existing S-reactive clonotypes, CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T clonotypes were expanded by the vaccination, whereas most CD4<sup>+</sup> T clonotypes became less dominant after vaccination (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Currently, the reason for the opposite tendency is unclear. In the present study, we showed that pre-existing T clonotypes cross-reacting to S protein are unlikely to contribute to vaccine-driven T cell immunity. This could be due to the fact that cross-reactive T cells had relatively low avidity to S protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, considering that most of these cross-reactive T clonotypes have Treg signature (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), they could be developed to tolerate symbiotic or environmental antigens, and might be ineffective to the defense against SARS-CoV-2 and thus replaced by the other effective T clonotypes induced by vaccination. One exceptional pre-existing clonotype was #15-Pre_2, as they vigorously expanded in COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This clonotype was clustered within a CD4<sup>+</sup> Tem population and cross-reactive to environmental bacteria, <italic>Myxococcales bacterium</italic> (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Thus, in some particular settings, clonotypes primed by common bacterial antigens might potentially contribute during infection.</p>
<p>Common cold human coronavirus (HCoV)-derived S proteins are reported as potential cross-reactive antigens for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. However, the highly responding SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive clonotypes in pre-vaccinated donors did not react with HCoV S proteins in the present study (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>), which might be partly due to the difference of cohorts or ethnicities. Instead, most of those T cells cross-reacted with environmental or symbiotic bacteria. These observations suggest that these cross-reactive T cells might have been developed to establish tolerance against less harmful microbes, and thus unlikely to efficiently contribute to the protective viral immunity. Vaccination may induce opposite tendencies on T cell clonotypes that recognize the same antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], which is hardly detected by the bulk T cell analyses. The current study highlights the necessity of dynamic tracing of T cell responses in an epitope-specific clonotype resolution for the evaluation of vaccine-induced immunity.</p>
<p>The limitation of this study is the number of individuals we analyzed. However, chronological and clonological analysis of antigen-specific T cells in characteristic groups followed by epitope determination has not been performed before. This study suggests that mRNA vaccine is potent enough to prime rare T cell clonotypes that become dominant afterwards. Furthermore, we propose that the types of CD4<sup>+</sup> T clonotypes developed shortly after two doses of vaccination could be an indication of the longevity of antibodies in the following months. Tfh-inducing adjuvants or Tfh-skewing epitope would be a promising “directional” booster in the post-vaccine era when most people worldwide were exposed to the same antigen in multiple doses within a short period. Furthermore, in addition to SARS-CoV-2, this strategy can also be applicable for the prevention of other infectious diseases of which neutralizing antibody titers are effective for protection.</p>

<p>This project was approved by Osaka University Institutional Review Board (IRB) (reference No. 21487). 43 volunteers were enrolled in this project. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before the first blood sampling. Samples (serum, whole blood, and PBMCs) were collected four times at 0–7 days before 1st dose vaccination as pre-vaccination, at 14–21 days after 1st dose vaccination as 3 weeks sample, at 35–49 days after 1st dose vaccination as 6 weeks sample, and at 154–182 days after 1st dose of vaccination as 24 weeks sample. At the same time of blood sampling, adverse event information was also collected from all participants. PBMCs were isolated using BD vacutainer® CPT™ cell separation tube (Beckton Dickinson), according to manufacturers’ instructions. Isolated PBMCs were stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until use.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study by Lu et al aimed to determine the key factors of T cell responses associated with durable antibody responses following the initial two shots of COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations. By comparing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)-specific T cell subsets between &quot;Ab sustainers&quot; and &quot;Ab decliners&quot; that were present post-vaccination, the authors concluded that S-specific CD4+ T cells in &quot;Ab sustainers&quot; were enriched with Tfh cells. There is <bold>solid</bold> evidence as the authors applied multiple methods and approaches to address the key questions, and the presented data are robust.</p>

<p>• A summary of what the authors were trying to achieve.</p>
<p>The authors cultured pre- and Post-vaccine PBMCs with overlapping peptides encoding S protein in the presence of IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 for 10 days, and extensively analyzed the T cells expanded during the culture; by including scRNAseq, scTCRseq, and examination of reporter cell lines expressing the dominant TCRs. They were able to identify 78 S epitopes with HLA restrictions (by itself represents a major achievement) together with their subset, based on their transcriptional profiling. By comparing T cell clonotypes between pre- and post-vaccination samples, they showed that a majority of pre-existing S-reactive CD4+ T cell clones did not expand by vaccinations. Thus, the authors concluded that highly-responding S-reactive T cells were established by vaccination from rare clonotypes.</p>

<p>The paper aims to investigate the relationship between anti-S protein antibody titers with the phenotypes &amp; clonotypes of S-protein-specific T cells in people who receive SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines. The paper recruited a cohort of COVID-19 naive individuals who received the SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines and collected sera and PBMCs samples on different time points. Then, three sets of data were generated: 1). Anti-S protein antibody titers on all time points. 2) Single-cell RNAseq/TCRseq analysis for divided T cells after in vitro stimulation by S-protein. 3) Peptide epitopes for each expanded TCR clone. Based on these, the paper reports two major findings: A) Individuals having more sustained anti-S protein antibody response also have more Tfh-featured S-specific cells in their blood after 2nd-dose vaccination. B). S-specific cross-reactive T cells exist in COVID-19 naive individuals, but most of these T cell clones are not expanded after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.</p>
<p>The paper's strength is that it uses a very systemic strategy trying to dissect the relationship between antibody titers, T cell phenotypes, TCR clonotypes and corresponding epitopes. The conclusion is solid in general. However, the weaknesses include the relatively small sample size (4 sustainers vs. 4 decliners) and the use of in vitro stimulated cells for analysis, which may 'blur' the classification of T cell subsets. Nevertheless, it may have great impact on future vaccine design because it demonstrated that promoting Tfh differentiation is crucial for the longevity of antibody response. Additionally, this paper nicely showed that most cross-reactive clones that are specific to environmental/symbiotic microbes did not expand post- vaccination, providing important fundamental insights into the establishment of T-cell responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>A summary of what the authors were trying to achieve.</p>
<p>The authors cultured pre- and Post-vaccine PBMCs with overlapping peptides encoding S protein in the presence of IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 for 10 days, and extensively analyzed the T cells expanded during the culture; by including scRNAseq, scTCRseq, and examination of reporter cell lines expressing the dominant TCRs. They were able to identify 78 S epitopes with HLA restrictions (by itself represents a major achievement) together with their subset, based on their transcriptional profiling. By comparing T cell clonotypes between pre- and post-vaccination samples, they showed that a majority of pre-existing S-reactive CD4+ T cell clones did not expand by vaccinations. Thus, the authors concluded that highly-responding S-reactive T cells were established by vaccination from rare clonotypes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper aims to investigate the relationship between anti-S protein antibody titers with the phenotypes&amp;clonotypes of S-protein-specific T cells, in people who receive SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines. To do this, the paper recruited a cohort of Covid-19 naive individuals that receives the SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccines and collect sera and PBMCs samples on different timepoints. Then they mainly generate three sets of data: 1). Anti-S protein antibody titers on all timepoints. 2) Single-cell RNAseq/TCRseq dataset for divided T cells after stimulation by Sprotein for 10 days. 3) Corresponding epitopes for each expanded TCR clones. After analyzing these result, the paper reports two major findings&amp;claims: A) Individuals having sustained anti-S protein antibody response also have more so-called Tfh cells in their single-cell dataset. B). S-reactive T cells do exist before the vaccination, but they seems to be unable to response to Covid-19 vaccination properly.</p>
<p>The paper's strength is it uses a very systemic and thorough strategy trying to dissect the relationship between antibody titers, T cell phenotypes, TCR clonotypes and corresponding epitopes, and indeed it reports several interesting findings about the relationship of Tfh clonotypes/sustained antibody and about the S-reactive clones that exist before the vaccination. The conclusion is solid in general but some claims are overstated. My suggestion is the authors should further limit their claims in abstract, for example,</p>
<p>”Even before vaccination, S-reactive CD4+ T cell clonotypes did exist, most of which (MAY) cross-reacted with environmental or symbiotic bacteria&quot; -- The paper don't have experimental evidence to show these TCR clones respond to these epitopes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the insufficient demonstration of experimental evidence. We have added the relevant data to Fig. S5 in the newly revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;These results suggest that de novo acquisition of memory Tfh-like cells upon vaccination (LIKELY) contributes to the longevity of anti-S antibody titers.&quot; --Given the small sample size and the statistical analysis was not significant, this claim was overstated.</p>
<p>&quot;S-reactive T cell clonotypes detected immediately after 2nd vaccination polarized to follicular helper T (Tfh)-like cells (UNDER IN VITRO CULTURE)&quot;. -- the conclusion was based on vitro cultured cells, which had limitation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestion. We have corrected some sentences in line with these suggestions in the newly revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>Please note: Though most of the overstatement was removed from the original manuscript, authors still need to modify some of the statements in &quot;Abstract&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for carefully reading our manuscript and giving us detailed suggestions. We have modified these statements in “Abstract” accordingly in the newly revised manuscript.</p>
