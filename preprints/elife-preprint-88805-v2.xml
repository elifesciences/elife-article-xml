<abstract>
<p>Temporal rescaling of sequential neural activity has been observed in multiple brain areas during behaviors involving time estimation and motor execution at variable speeds. Temporally asymmetric Hebbian rules have been used in network models to learn and retrieve sequential activity, with characteristics that are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. However, in these models sequential activity is retrieved at a fixed speed. Here, we investigate the effects of a heterogeneity of plasticity rules on network dynamics. In a model in which neurons differ by the degree of temporal symmetry of their plasticity rule, we find that retrieval speed can be controlled by varying external inputs to the network. Neurons with temporally symmetric plasticity rules act as brakes and tend to slow down the dynamics, while neurons with temporally asymmetric rules act as accelerators of the dynamics. We also find that such networks can naturally generate separate ‘preparatory’ and ‘execution’ activity patterns with appropriate external inputs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Timing is a critical component in the proper planning and execution of temporally extended motor behaviors. In behaviors consisting of a single motor action, it may be desirable to control the duration of its execution. In behaviors composed of multiple actions, the precise time interval between actions can be a key determinant in the success of the behavior. How can the duration of these intervals be flexibly controlled in a network of neurons?</p>
<p>A simple mechanistic hypothesis for the regulation of motor related timing intervals posits a specialized neural circuit with network dynamics that vary in speed as a consequence of differing levels of constant external input. Several network models utilizing external input as a means of speed control have been proposed to account for cortical and striatal dynamics observed during motor execution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. To account for speed control in cortex, a recurrent neural network model has been trained to achieve temporal rescaling of network activity as a function of external input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. However, this model relies on supervised learning rules that may not be biologically plausible, and cannot generalize to other speeds from training on just one example timing interval. To explain speed control of sequential activity in striatum, a recurrent inhibitory network model has been proposed with a feedforward structure learned through anti-Hebbian plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. This model demonstrates transient winner-take-all dynamics, with short term synaptic depression facilitating transitions in activity from one group of neurons to the next, and external input controlling the duration of each group’s transient activation. While experimental evidence for the necessary type of depressive adaptation mechanism exists in the striatum, it may not be present in all cortical areas where rescaling of sequential activity is observed. Whether speed can be controlled in network models constructed using Hebbian learning without this mechanism remains unknown.</p>
<p>Network models with a connectivity generated by temporally asymmetric synaptic plasticity provide a potential framework for explaining how sequential activity can arise from local biologically plausible learning rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. In both rate and spiking networks, the temporal statistics of sequential activity in networks using this type of rule qualitatively match experimental findings made over both short and long timescales of observation in multiple tasks with timing components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. However, the speed of sequential dynamics in these models is constrained by the choice of temporal offset in the learning rule and neuronal time constant, and cannot be modulated with external input.</p>
<p>The Hebbian rules explored in this work and previous studies are approximations of various forms of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The effects of STDP can be quantified through kernels that measure the change in excitatory postsynaptic potential size at a synapse (as a proxy for synaptic strength), as a function of the timing difference between pre and postsynaptic spikes. Experimentally, a large diversity of STDP kernels have been characterized across cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Kernels measured in cortex and hippocampus typically, but not always, exhibit a temporal asymmetry, in which presynaptic activity must precede postsynaptic activity to elicit a positive change in synaptic strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Theoretical studies have shown that this temporal asymmetry can be used to store and retrieve sequences of activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. However, symmetric kernels, in which coincident activity leads to strengthening regardless of the order of pre and post-synaptic spikes, have also been observed in multiple contexts - with high frequency plasticity induction protocols in cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], in hippocampal cultures in the presence of dopamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], and at excitatory-to-excitatory synapses in hippocampal CA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Hebbian learning rules that are temporally symmetric lead instead to the creation of fixed point attractors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>].</p>
<p>It is not known to what degree temporal asymmetry varies across synapses at the scale of local networks, but analysis of a calcium-based plasticity model demonstrates that the degree of asymmetry can be controlled via adjustment of biophysical parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. We hypothesize that variability in the temporal offset expressed at a synapse may be a key ingredient in permitting the control of retrieval speed, suggesting a potential new role for the observed heterogeneity in STDP kernels.</p>
<p>In this work, we explore a generalization of previously investigated temporally asymmetric learning to multiple temporal offsets that captures this heterogeneity. Specifically, we find that varying the temporal asymmetry of the learning rule across synapses gives rise to network mechanisms that allow for the control of speed as a function of external inputs to the network. We start by considering a network with a bimodal distribution of heterogeneity in the learning rule, resulting in two distinct populations: one with a symmetric learning rule, and one with an asymmetric rule. We characterize the effect of input strength on retrieval speed and quality in these networks with connectivity generated using linear and nonlinear synaptic plasticity rules. We also find that transitions between fixed-point attractor-like “preparatory” periods and sequential “execution” phases can be realized in this model by rescaling the magnitude of external input. Finally, we demonstrate that networks with a uniform distribution of heterogeneity lead to qualitatively similar findings.</p>

<title>Degree of symmetry in learning rule determines retrieval speed</title>
<p>We explore a network model in which the firing rate dynamics of each neuron <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> in a population of size <italic>N</italic> is described by the equation
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="533836v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

where <italic>τ</italic> is the time constant of firing rate dynamics, <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is the connectivity matrix, <italic>ϕ</italic> (<italic>x</italic>) is a sigmoidal neuronal transfer function (see Methods), and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533836v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> describes the external input provided to each neuron at time <italic>t</italic>.</p>
<p>We follow a similar learning procedure as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. A sequence of <italic>P</italic> random i.i.d standard Gaussian patterns <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533836v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is presented to the network and stored in network connectivity. This sequence of patterns modifies the strength of synaptic connections <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> from neuron <italic>j</italic> to <italic>i</italic> according to a Hebbian learning rule that transforms pre and post synaptic inputs into synaptic weight changes. The resulting connectivity matrix <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is a generalization of previously studied rules which combines both temporally symmetric and asymmetric learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>],
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="533836v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is a matrix describing the structural connectivity, whose entries are given by i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, <italic>p</italic>(<italic>c</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = 1) = <italic>c, p</italic>(<italic>c</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = 0) = 1 − <italic>c</italic>, where <italic>c</italic> is the connection probability; The functions <italic>g</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) and <italic>f</italic> (<italic>x</italic>) describe how the synaptic plasticity rule depends on pre and postsynaptic input patterns during learning, respectively; The parameter <italic>A</italic> controls the overall strength of the recurrent connections. And <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ [0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] describes the degree of temporal symmetry at synapses of neuron <italic>i</italic>. A neuron with fully temporally symmetric plasticity is described by <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 1, while <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 0 indicates a neuron with fully temporally asymmetric plasticity. Note that we focus here to the case of a single sequence stored in synaptic connectivity, but such networks can also store multiple sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>We first explore the bilinear learning rule scenario (<italic>f</italic> (<italic>x</italic>) = <italic>g</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) = <italic>x</italic>) with homogeneous synaptic plasticity, i.e. <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = <italic>z</italic> for all <italic>i</italic> = 1, …, <italic>N</italic> . At the two extremes of this variable we can recover previously studied learning rules. When <italic>z</italic> = 0, only the second term in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref> is present, resulting in a purely temporally asymmetric rule. Networks with connectivity constructed using such a rule can recall a sequence of stored patterns, and their sequential retrieval dynamics have been extensively characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. When <italic>z</italic> = 1, synaptic plasticity is temporally symmetric, potentially leading to fixed point attractor dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. If <italic>z</italic> is instead fixed to a value between 0 and 1, then the asymmetric component in the plasticity rule leads to the retrieval of the whole sequence, but the speed at which the sequence is retrieved strongly depends on <italic>z</italic>. For instance, in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> we demonstrate retrieval for an intermediate value of <italic>z</italic> = 0.5. Retrieval is quantified by plotting the Pearson correlation of the instantaneous firing rate <italic>r</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) with each stored pattern <italic>ξ</italic><sup><italic>µ</italic></sup> as a function of time (see Methods). During sequence retrieval, correlations with individual patterns in the sequence increase, peak and decrease one after the other, indicating the network transiently visit states close to each of the patterns in succession. We find that in such a network, retrieval speed strongly depends on <italic>z</italic>. For the parameters in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, retrieval proceeds nearly twice as slowly as compared to a network with connectivity arising from a purely asymmetric learning rule, where retrieval speed is fixed by the time constant of the firing rate dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. However, retrieval speed is fixed by the choice of <italic>z</italic> (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> showing a linear dependence of speed on <italic>z</italic>), and cannot be dynamically modulated in response to changes in the external input<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533836v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<title>Heterogeneity in synaptic plasticity temporal asymmetry gives rise to a speed control mechanism</title>
<p>We next explored whether adding heterogeneity to this learning rule, allowing <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> to differ across synapses, can produce networks capable of both recalling stored sequences of patterns and modulating the speed of recall. We initially consider a bimodal distribution of degrees of temporal symmetry across the network. For each neuron, <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> was drawn randomly and independently as a Bernoulli random variable with probability <italic>p</italic>(<italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 1) = 0.5, <italic>p</italic>(<italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 0) = 0.5. As a result, the network of <italic>N</italic> neurons can be divided into two subpopulations of approximately equal sizes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533836v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons, according to the learning rule present at their synapses:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="533836v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="533836v2_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where the connectivity matrix is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="533836v2_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="533836v2_eqn6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and where <italic>X</italic> = <italic>a, s</italic> denotes the presynaptic population. Note that the external input <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533836v2_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> now depends on the population. To reduce the space of possible learning rules, we have assumed that the type of learning at a synapse depends only on the identity of the postsynaptic neuron. The bimodal distribution of <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> restricts synapses to only one of the two types of plasticity, but in the final section entitled “Retrieval with a broad distribution of learning rules” we relax this constraint.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, we show an example of how the stored sequence can be retrieved under different input conditions. In both the top and bottom panels of 1e, network activity is initialized to the first pattern in the sequence, and a constant external input is provided to each subpopulation (“asymmetric” input <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533836v2_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and “symmetric” input<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533836v2_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>). In the top panel, the symmetric population is effectively silenced with strongly negative input, resulting in retrieval that lasts approximately <italic>τ P</italic>, consistent with the dynamics being driven purely by the asymmetric component in the learning rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In the bottom panel, this input is no longer strongly negative, causing retrieval time to more than double, due to the effect of the symmetric population that tends to slow down the dynamics. Retrieval in both conditions is robust to noise, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, in which noisy inputs to neurons strongly perturb single neuron firing rates but leave sequence retrieval intact at both speeds (see Methods).</p>
<p>To characterize how retrieval time depends on these two sources of external input, we explored the space of the parameters defining the inputs to the network, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, we show the dependence of retrieval quality and speed on these variables. Retrieval quality is quantified by measuring the maximal correlation of the final pattern in the retrieved sequence. Retrieval speed is measured in units of the inverse of the neural time constant, <italic>τ</italic> <sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>. It is computed by measuring the average inverse time between the peaks of consecutive correlations of the network state with consecutive patterns in the sequence. For example, a speed of 0.5 corresponds to an average time difference of 2<italic>τ</italic> between the peaks of the correlations of two consecutive retrieved patterns with network state. In the upper left quadrant of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, speed depends primarily on the strength of input to the symmetric population. Moving away from this region in the direction of increasing symmetric input, retrieval speed slows down to approximately 0.5. In the lower right quadrant, retrieval speed instead depends primarily on the strength of external input provided to the asymmetric population. As this negative input grows, retrieval speed becomes approximately four times slower than the speed of the purely asymmetric network. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> we have focused on the region in which external inputs are negative. This is because in our model external inputs are expressed relative to the threshold, and this region leads to biologically plausible average firing rates that are much smaller than the maximal firing rates (see Methods). While we have focused on negative input in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, retrieval speed is also modulated by positive input. Interestingly, it is the magnitude, not sign, of the input that determines retrieval speed. Expanding the phase diagram in panel (b) to positive input shows that the same dependence holds: values for retrieval speed are approximately symmetric about the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533836v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="533836v2_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> axes (not shown).</p>

One key difference is that a much wider range of speeds can be achieved using a nonlinear rule within the same retrieval quality bounds (see Methods). In fact, retrieval speed can now be arbitrarily slowed down, and even completely stopped when the input to the asymmetric population is sufficiently negative (see white dots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). In this region, persistent activity is stable, and there exists a fixed point attractor correlated with any of the patterns in any stored sequence. There also exists a region in which sequential activity stops in the middle of retrieval and switches to stable persistent activity (see hatched diagonal lines in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).

<title>Temporally varying external inputs can lead to transitions between persistent and sequential activity</title>
<p>We next explored how this heterogeneity might be used not only to control the speed of dynamics, but also to trigger transitions between qualitatively different dynamics. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> we use the same nonlinear model as in the previous section, and present discrete, time-dependent inputs intended to achieve persistent retrieval of a single pattern, followed by sequential retrieval of the remaining patterns at a specified time. To initiate persistent activity, we briefly present the first pattern as an input to the symmetric population. This elicits persistent activity in this population, as reflected by the sustained positive correlation of the symmetric population with the first pattern during the first 200ms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). This activity does not recruit sequential activity in either population, however, as the asymmetric population responsible for that transition is presented with sufficiently strong negative input during this period. To initiate sequential activity, inhibition to the asymmetric population is released after <italic>t</italic> = 0.2s, prompting the network to retrieve the stored sequence in both populations.</p>

<caption><p>Transition from persistent activity (‘preparatory’ period) to sequence retrieval (‘execution’ period) mediated by external input <bold>a</bold>. Inputs provided to the asymmetric (black) and symmetric population (orange) consist of a “preparatory period” input lasting 200ms, followed by an “execution period” input that is fixed for the rest of the interval. During a 200ms preparatory period, a brief input is presented to the symmetric population for the first 10ms, which drives the network to a state which is strongly correlated with the first pattern in a sequence. This input is removed after 10ms, but the network remains in a persistent activity state corresponding the the first pattern, because a strong negative input is presented to the asymmetric population throughout the entire 200ms, which prevents the network from retrieving the sequence. At the end of this period, the input to the symmetric population is decreased, while the asymmetric population is increased, which leads to retrieval of the sequence (‘execution period’). Sequence retrieval can happen at different speeds, depending on the inputs to the asymmetric and symmetric populations. <bold>b</bold>.

As in a network with only a single asymmetric population, single neuron activity in this network is temporally sparse, with many neurons being active only at specific time intervals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
<p>In our network, stability of persistent activity requires the dependence of the plasticity rule on pre and/or post synaptic firing rates to be non-linear.

<title>Flexible sequence retrieval in networks with a continuous distribution of degrees of temporal symmetry</title>
<p>Up to this point, we have analyzed a network model in which neurons are separated in two discrete classes distinguished by their plasticity rule (symmetric or asymmetric). For a given postsynaptic neuron, the learning rule present at all presynaptic synapses was chosen to be either temporally symmetric or asymmetric with equal probability, defining two distinct subpopulations of neurons. Can retrieval speed still be modulated by external input when synapses do not fall into such a binary classification, but have more heterogeneous properties? To model this heterogeneity, we chose to embed a continuum of learning rules.

<title>Learning external input strengths using a reward-based plasticity rule</title>
<p>The low-dimensional external inputs used to regulate speed are unrelated to the stored sequential input patterns. This suggests that a mapping from external inputs to retrieval speed can be learned independently from a particular set of sequential patterns. We demonstrated that a reinforcement learning rule can be used to converge to external input values implementing a desired speed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). By using a reward signal measuring how similar retrieval is to the desired speed, the rule adjusts initially random external inputs to the appropriate values over the course of multiple trial repetitions (see Methods for details). Critically, once these external input values are learned, they can be used to modulate the retrieval speed of other stored sequences without having to relearn this mapping.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, we have introduced a new mechanism for flexible control of retrieval speed in networks storing sequences. This mechanism relies on heterogeneity of synaptic plasticity rules across neurons in the network, with different degrees of temporal asymmetry. Neurons with temporally symmetric plasticity act as brakes of the dynamics, as they stabilize network activity in its current state, while neurons with temporally asymmetric plasticity act instead as accelerators, as they push the network towards the next pattern in the sequence. The speed of retrieval can then be modified in a flexible way by changing external inputs driving these two types of neurons. Furthermore, we found that this mechanism can be used to gate transitions between persistent and sequential activity. We showed that appropriate inputs can be learned using a reinforcement learning scheme. Finally, we also showed that networks of spiking neurons can generate the same behavior, provided the excitatory network is subdivided in asymmetric and symmetric neurons.</p>

<title>Heterogeneity of synaptic plasticity</title>
<p>Our findings suggest a potential functional role for the experimentally observed diversity in synaptic plasticity rules [6–8, 21, 23]. In particular, a wide diversity of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) curves have been reported in various brain structures, and sometimes in the same structure. In the hippocampus, temporally asymmetric STDP is typically observed in cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] or in CA3 to CA1 connections in slices in some conditions, but temporally symmetric STDP is observed in area CA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, the degree of temporal symmetry at CA3 to CA1 connections can be modulated by extracellular calcium concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] and post-synaptic bursting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. In the cerebellum, synaptic plasticity rules with diverse temporal requirements on the time difference between parallel fiber and climbing fiber inputs have been found in Purkinje cells in different zones of this structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. While this heterogeneity has been found so far across structures or across different regions in the same structure, this heterogeneity could also be present within local networks, as current experimental methods for probing plasticity only have access to a single delay between pre and post-synaptic spikes in each recorded neuron, and would therefore miss this heterogeneity.</p>
<p>For simplicity, the degree of temporal asymmetry was chosen in our model to depend only on the identity of the postsynaptic neuron. This is consistent with the observation that a model of synaptic plasticity that depends only on the postsynaptic concentration of calcium can account for a range of experimentally observed STDP curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. This suggests that heterogeneities in temporal asymmetry could arise due to heterogeneities in biophysical parameters that control calcium dynamics in post-synaptic spines.</p>

<title>Comparison with other mechanisms of speed control</title>
<p>The mechanism investigated here is distinct from previously described models of input-driven speed control. It does not require adaptation mechanisms or delays to slow down retrieval of subsequent patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. It also does not require presentation of multiple exemplars spanning the desired range of retrieval speeds in order to find the appropriate network structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. However, the mapping between external input strength and retrieval speed must be learned in order for the network to be able to perform retrieval at desired speeds. Unlike the model explored in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], however, once this mapping is learned, it can be used to control the speed of other stored sequences.</p>
<p>Another recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] has investigated how a recurrent network could flexibly control its temporal dynamics using a different approach. They trained a low-rank recurrent network using back-propagation through time to produce specific dynamics with flexible timing, and showed that the resulting network can then be flexibly controlled by a one-dimensional input. It would be interesting to investigate whether the low-rank structure found in such a manner exhibits similarities with the synaptic connectivity structure in our model.</p>
<p>Future experimental work could analyze the evolution of neural activity across the training of interval timing tasks, and evaluate whether it is consistent with such a reinforcement-based rule.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Experimental predictions</title>
<p>This mechanism presented here makes several predictions regarding the relationship between plasticity rules, external input, and the speed of network dynamics. One prediction is that retrieval speed could be modified by providing different external inputs to each population (asymmetric and symmetric). In vivo, these populations could be identified using the dependence of mean firing rates on speed of retrieval neurons who increase their rates with slower/faster retrieval speeds would be predicted to be the symmetric/asymmetric neurons, respectively. Targeting one class of neurons or the other, using holographic techniques (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]) would then be expected to increase or decrease the speed of retrieval. Another prediction is that these cells have distinct profiles of temporal asymmetry in their synaptic plasticity. The model presented here also predicts the existence of “null” input directions, for which no change in retrieval speed is expected as external input is changed. When moving along these “null” directions, single neurons would only be expected to change their temporal firing patterns, but without affecting the speed of retrieval.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Transitions between persistent and sequential activity</title>
<p>Heterogeneity in the learning rule also provides a mechanism that enables input changes to drive transitions in activity states. An example of such a transition is frequently reported in primary motor cortex (M1) during delayed reaching tasks, where a preparatory period with persistent activity or ramping dynamics is followed by an execution period with transient, sequential dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. We demonstrated how an input change can gate such a transition in a simple network model composed of neurons with two distinct plasticity rules, the first temporally symmetric, and the second temporally asymmetric. At the start of the preparatory period, asymmetric neurons are inhibited, and a transient specific input elicits persistent activity in symmetric neurons. When inhibition is removed, asymmetric neurons become activated and drive a transition to sequential activity in both types of neurons.</p>
<p>Inhibitory gating has been previously hypothesized as a mechanism to control the initiation of execution period activity. Analysis of M1 activity suggests that local inhibitory interneurons do not engage in this gating, as putative inhibitory neurons do not appear to be preferentially active during the preparatory period compared to the execution period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. However, this does not rule out the possibility that the necessary inhibition could arise from other external inputs to M1. It is also possible that inhibition may not be required at all. Effective silencing of the asymmetric neurons could occur by a reduction of excitatory input during the preparatory period. Recent work in mice suggests that thalamocortical interactions may be a potential candidate for driving the required transition. Recorded activity in motor thalamus during a reaching task shows that at movement onset, thalamus activity is negatively correlated with premotor activity, but positively correlated with activity in M1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. In a separate directional licking task, thalamus projections were shown to be required for initiating cued movement, and mimicked presentation of the cue when optogenetically stimulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. An alternative model for transitions between preparatory and execution activity has recently been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], in which external inputs trigger a switch between a preparatory state and a nearly orthogonal execution state. However, in the model of ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], the execution epoch is described by a single pattern, and any temporal dynamics within this epoch is inherited from external inputs, while in the present paper the temporal dynamics during the execution phase is generated by the recurrent connectivity structure.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Limitations and future directions</title>
<p>We have focused here on a simple learning scenario in which a temporally asymmetric plasticity rule imprints a sequence of external input patterns into the recurrent synaptic connectivity. In real neuronal networks, one expects recurrent synaptic inputs to shape the response of a network to external inputs, and therefore how such inputs sculpt recurrent connectivity. Studying such a learning process is outside the scope of this paper, but is an important topic for future work.</p>
<p>In this paper, we have focused on Hebbian specific synaptic plasticity rules to store a sequence of input patterns. Another fruitful approach to investigate learning and memory in neural circuits was introduced by Elizabeth Gardner[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. In Gardner’s approach, the idea is to consider the space of all possible connectivity matrices that store a given set of memories as fixed point attractor states. It was later shown that the statistics of the connectivity matrix in attractor networks with sign-constrained synapses optimizing the storage capacity and/or robustness of learning is in striking agreement with cortical data - in particular, the resulting connectivity is sparse, with an over-representation of bidirectional motifs in pairs of neurons, compared to random directed Erdos-Renyi networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. However, in networks storing sequences, no such overrepresentation exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. It will be interesting to investigate the statistics of connectivity in networks with flexibility constraints, such that sequences can be retrieved at different speeds, or with a coexistence of fixed point attractor dynamics with sequential retrieval.</p>

<p>Mean-field theory can be used to further analyze retrieval speed dynamics, along the (lines of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].

To compute the boundary for successful retrieval given by the white line in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, we analyze this equation when the gains are constant: <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>.

This equation shows that the sequence can only be retrieved if <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub><italic>/</italic>(1 − <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) <italic>&gt;</italic> 1, otherwise the peak of the overlaps decay to zero with increasing <italic>l</italic>.

<p>The authors provide a <bold>valuable</bold> analysis of what neural circuit mechanisms enable varying the speed of retrieval of sequences, which is needed in situations such as reproducing motor patterns. Their use of heterogeneous plasticity rules to allow external currents to control speed of sequence recall is a novel alternative to other mechanisms proposed in the literature.

<p>While there are many models for sequence retrieval, it has been difficult to find models that vary the speed of sequence retrieval dynamically via simple external inputs. While recent works have proposed some mechanisms, the authors here propose a different one based on heterogeneous plasticity rules. Temporally symmetric plasticity kernels (that do not distinguish between the order of pre and post spikes, but only their time difference) are expected to give rise to attractor states, asymmetric ones to sequence transitions. The authors incorporate a rate-based, discrete-time analog of these spike-based plasticity rules to learn the connections between neurons (leading to connections similar to Hopfield networks for attractors and sequences).

<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed most of the points of the reviewers.</p>
<p>A major substantive point raised by both reviewers was on the biological plausibility of the learning.</p>
<p>The authors have added a section in the Discussion. This remains an open question, however the discussion suffices for the current paper.</p>

<p>Author response:</p>
<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>While there are many models for sequence retrieval, it has been difficult to find models that vary the speed of sequence retrieval dynamically via simple external inputs. While recent works [1,2] have proposed some mechanisms, the authors here propose a different one based on heterogeneous plasticity rules. Temporally symmetric plasticity kernels (that do not distinguish between the order of pre and post spikes, but only their time difference) are expected to give rise to attractor states, asymmetric ones to sequence transitions. The authors incorporate a rate-based, discrete-time analog of these spike-based plasticity rules to learn the connections between neurons (leading to connections similar to Hopfield networks for attractors and sequences). They use either a parametric combination of symmetric and asymmetric learning rules for connections into each neuron, or separate subpopulations having only symmetric or asymmetric learning rules on incoming connections. They find that the latter is conducive to enabling external inputs to control the speed of sequence retrieval.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have expertly characterised the system dynamics using both simulations and theory. How the speed and quality of retrieval varies across phases space has been well-studied. The authors are also able to vary the external inputs to reproduce a preparatory followed by an execution phase of sequence retrieval as seen experimentally in motor control. They also propose a simple reinforcement learning scheme for learning to map the two external inputs to the desired retrieval speed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors translate spike-based synaptic plasticity rules to a way to learn/set connections for rate units operating in discrete time, similar to their earlier work in [5]. The bio-plausibility issues of learning in [5] carry over here, for e.g. the authors ignore any input due to the recurrent connectivity during learning and effectively fix the pre and post rates to the desired ones. While the learning itself is not fully bio-plausible, it does lend itself to writing the final connectivity matrix in a manner that is easier to analyze theoretically.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that learning is not `fully bio-plausible’. However, we believe that extending the results to a model in which synaptic plasticity depends on recurrent inputs is beyond the scope of this work. We have added a mention of this issue in the Discussion in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) While the authors learn to map the set of two external input strengths to speed of retrieval, they still hand-wire one external input to the subpopulation of neurons with temporally symmetric plasticity and the other external input to the other subpopulation with temporally asymmetric plasticity. The authors suggest that these subpopulations might arise due to differences in the parameters of Ca dynamics as in their earlier work [29]. How these two external inputs would connect to neurons differentially based on the plasticity kernel / Ca dynamics parameters of the recurrent connections is still an open question which the authors have not touched upon.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The issue of how external inputs could self-organize to drive the network to retrieve sequences at appropriate speeds is addressed in the Results section, paragraph `Reward-driven learning’. These inputs are not `hand-wired’ - they are initially random and then acquire the necessary strengths to allow the network to retrieve the sequences at different speeds thanks to a simple reinforcement learning scheme. We have rewritten this section to clarify this issue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors require that temporally symmetric and asymmetric learning rules be present in the recurrent connections between subpopulations of neurons in the same brain region, i.e. some neurons in the same brain region should have temporally symmetric kernels, while others should have temporally asymmetric ones. The evidence for this seems thin. Though, in the discussion, the authors clarify 'While this heterogeneity has been found so far across structures or across different regions in the same structure, this heterogeneity could also be present within local networks, as current experimental methods for probing plasticity only have access to a single delay between pre and post-synaptic spikes in each recorded neuron, and would therefore miss this heterogeneity'.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Sequences of neural activity underlie most of our behavior. And as experience suggests we are (in most cases) able to flexibly change the speed for our learned behavior which essentially means that brains are able to change the speed at which the sequence is retrieved from the memory. The authors here propose a mechanism by which networks in the brain can learn a sequence of spike patterns and retrieve them at variable speed. At a conceptual level I think the authors have a very nice idea: use of symmetric and asymmetric learning rules to learn the sequences and then use different inputs to neurons with symmetric or asymmetric plasticity to control the retrieval speed. The authors have demonstrated the feasibility of the idea in a rather idealized network model. I think it is important that the idea is demonstrated in more biologically plausible settings (e.g. spiking neurons, a network with exc. and inh. neurons with ongoing activity).</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this manuscript authors have addressed the problem of learning and retrieval sequential activity in neuronal networks. In particular, they have focussed on the problem of how sequence retrieval speed can be controlled?</p>
<p>They have considered a model with excitatory rate-based neurons. Authors show that when sequences are learned with both temporally symmetric and asymmetric Hebbian plasticity, by modulating the external inputs to the network the sequence retrieval speed can be modulated. With the two types of Hebbian plasticity in the network, sequence learning essentially means that the network has both feedforward and recurrent connections related to the sequence. By giving different amounts of input to the feed-forward and recurrent components of the sequence, authors are able to adjust the speed.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>- Authors solve the problem of sequence retrieval speed control by learning the sequence in both feedforward and recurrent connectivity within a network. It is a very interesting idea for two main reasons: 1. It does not rely on delays or short-term dynamics in neurons/synapses 2. It does not require that the animal is presented with the same sequences multiple times at different speeds. Different inputs to the feedforward and recurrent populations are sufficient to alter the speed. However, the work leaves several issues unaddressed as explained below.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>- The main weakness of the paper is that it is mostly driven by a motivation to find a computational solution to the problem of sequence retrieval speed. In most cases they have not provided any arguments about the biological plausibility of the solution they have proposed e.g.:</p>
<p>- Is there any experimental evidence that some neurons in the network have symmetric Hebbian plasticity and some temporally asymmetric? In the references authors have cited some references to support this. But usually the switch between temporally symmetric and asymmetric rules is dependent on spike patterns used for pairing (e.g. bursts vs single spikes). In the context of this manuscript, it would mean that in the same pattern, some neurons burst and some don't and this is the same for all the patterns in the sequence. As far as I see here authors have assumed a binary pattern of activity which is the same for all neurons that participate in the pattern.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is currently only weak evidence for heterogeneity of synaptic plasticity rules within a single network, though there is plenty of evidence for such a heterogeneity across networks or across locations within a particular structure (see references in our Discussion). The reviewer suggests another interesting possibility, that the temporal asymmetry could depend on the firing pattern on the post-synaptic neuron. An example of such a behavior can be found in a paper by Wittenberg and Wang in 2006, where they show that pairing single spikes of pre and post-synaptic neurons lead to LTD at all time differences in a symmetric fashion, while pairing a pre-synaptic spike with a burst of post-synaptic spikes lead to temporally asymmetric plasticity, with a LTP window at short positive time differences. We now mention this possibility in the Discussion, but we believe exploring fully this scenario is beyond the scope of the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- How would external inputs know that they are impinging on a symmetric or asymmetric neuron? Authors have proposed a mechanism to learn these inputs. But that makes the sequence learning problem a two stage problem -- first an animal has to learn the sequence and then it has to learn to modulate the speed of retrieval. It should be possible to find experimental evidence to support this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our model does not assume that the two processes necessarily occur one after the other. Importantly, once the correct external inputs that can modulate sequence retrieval are learned, sequence retrieval modulation will automatically generalize to arbitrary new sequences that are learned by the network.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Authors have only considered homogeneous DC input for sequence retrieval. This kind of input is highly unnatural. It would be more plausible if the authors considered fluctuating input which is different from each neuron.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified Figure 1e and Figure 2c to show the effects of fluctuating inputs on pattern correlations and single unit activity. We find that these inputs do not qualitatively affect our results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- All the work is demonstrated using a firing rate based model of only excitatory neurons. I think it is important that some of the key results are demonstrated in a network of both excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons. As the authors very well know it is not always trivial to extend rate-based models to spiking neurons.</p>
<p>I think at a conceptual level authors have a very nice idea but it needs to be demonstrated in a more biologically plausible setting (and by that I do not mean biophysical neurons etc.).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included a new section in the discussion with an associated figure (Figure 7) demonstrating that flexible speed control can be achieved in an excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) spiking network containing two excitatory populations with distinct plasticity mechanisms.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In the introduction, the authors state: 'symmetric kernels, in which coincident activity leads to strengthening regardless of the order of pre and post-synaptic spikes, have also been observed in multiple contexts with high frequency plasticity induction protocols in cortex [21]'. To my understanding, [21]'s final model 3, ignores LTD if the post-spike also participates in LTP, and only considers nearest-neighbour interactions. Thus, the kernel would not be symmetric. Can the authors clarify what they mean and how their conclusion follows, as [21] does not show any kernels either.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this statement, we were not referring to the model in [21], but rather the experimentally observed plasticity kernels at different frequencies. In particular, we were referring to the symmetric kernel that appears in the bottom panel of Figure 7c in that paper.</p>

<p>The authors should also address the weaknesses mentioned above. They don't need to solve the issues but expand (and maybe indicate resolutions) on these issues in the Discussion.</p>
<p>For ease of reproducibility, the authors should make their code available as well.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We are not sure what the reviewer means by `non-zero ongoing activity. We show now the dynamics of the network in the presence of noisy inputs, which can represent ongoing activity from other structures (see Fig 1e and 2c).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  From the correlation (==quality) alone it is difficult to judge how well the sequence has been recovered. Authors should consider showing some examples so that the reader can get a visual estimate of what 0.6 quality may mean. High speed is not really associated with high quality (Fig 2b). So it is important to show how the sequence retrieval quality is for non-linear and heterogeneous learning rules.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that some insight into the relationship between speed and quality for the case of non-linear and heterogeneous learning rules is addressed by the correlation plots for chosen input configurations (see Fig. 3a and and 5b). We leave a full characterization for future work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  Authors should show how the retrieval and quality of sequences change when they are recovered with positive input, or positive input to one population and negative to another. In the current version sequence retrieval is shown only with negative inputs. This is a somewhat non-biological setting. The inhibitory gating argument (L367-389) is really weak.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify that with the parameters chosen in this paper, the transfer function has half its maximal rate at zero input. This is due to the fact we chose the threshold to be zero, using the fact that any threshold can be absorbed in the external inputs. Thus, negative inputs really mean sub-threshold inputs, and they are consistent with sub-threshold external excitatory inputs. We have clarified this issue in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  Authors should demonstrate how the sequence retrieval dynamics is altered when they assume a fluctuating input current for sequence retrieval instead of a homogeneous DC input.</p>

<p>-  Authors should show what are the differences in synaptic weight distribution for the two types of learning (bi-linear and non-linear). I am curious to know if the difference in the speed in the two cases is related to the weight distribution. In general I think it is a good idea to show the synaptic weight distribution before and after learning.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we do not study any learning process, but rather a network with a fixed connectivity matrix, assumed to represent the end result of learning. In this network, the distribution of synaptic weights converges to a Gaussian in the large p and cN limits, independently of the functions f and g, because of the central limit theorem, if there are no sign constraints on weights. In the presence of sign constraints, the distribution is a truncated Gaussian.</p>
