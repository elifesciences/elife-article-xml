<title>Abstract</title><p>After exocytosis, release sites are cleared of vesicular residues to be replenished with transmitter-filled vesicles. Endocytic and scaffold proteins are thought to underlie this mechanism. However, physiological significance of the site-clearance mechanism among diverse central synapses remains unknown. Here, we tested this using action-potential evoked EPSCs at fast-signaling calyx and slow-plastic hippocampal CA1 synapses in post-hearing mice brain slices at physiological temperature and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Pharmacological block of endocytosis enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx synapse, whereas it attenuated synaptic facilitation at the hippocampal synapse. Block of scaffold protein activity likewise enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx but had no effect at the hippocampal synapse. At the calyx, enhancement of synaptic depression by blocking endocytosis or scaffold activity occurred at nearly identical time courses with a time constant of several milliseconds starting immediately after the stimulation onset. Neither endocytic nor scaffold protein inhibitors prolonged the recovery from short-term depression. We conclude that endocytic release-site clearance can be a universal phenomenon supporting vesicle replenishment across fast-signaling and slow-plastic synapses, whereas presynaptic scaffold mechanism likely plays a specialized role in vesicle replenishment predominantly at fast synapses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemical synaptic transmission depends upon fusion of transmitter-filled vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. At presynaptic terminals, there are a limited number of vesicular release sites, which can become refractory while discharged vesicles are remaining at the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Katz, 1993</xref>), inhibiting subsequent vesicle fusion. Following inactivation of the temperature-sensitive endocytic protein dynamin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant <italic>Shibire</italic>, short-term depression (STD) of neuromuscular transmission is enhanced within tens of milliseconds of the onset of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that vesicular endocytosis plays a significant role in release site-clearance, in addition to its well-established role in the vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). At the calyx of Held, in slices from pre-hearing rats, pharmacological block of endocytosis slightly enhances STD and markedly prolongs the recovery from STD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, at cultured hippocampal synapses, blocking endocytosis enhances depression at high-frequency stimulation due to slow clearance of vesicular component from release-sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Hua et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic ablation of the endocytic adaptor protein AP-2<italic>μ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jung et al., 2015</xref>), synaptophysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Rajappa et al., 2016</xref>), or the secretory carrier membrane protein SCAMP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Park et al., 2018</xref>) enhances synaptic depression in cultured cells, in agreement with the site-clearance role of endocytosis.</p>
<p>The presynaptic scaffold protein intersectin is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which activates the Rho-GTPase CDC42, thereby regulating the filamentous (F) actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Hussain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Marie et al., 2004</xref>). At the calyx of Held in slices from pre-hearing rodents, genetic ablation of intersectin 1 or pharmacological block of CDC42 abolishes the fast component of the rate of recovery from STD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sakaba et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the scaffold protein cascade, comprising intersectin, CDC42 and F-actin, contributes to rapid vesicle replenishments possibly through release site-clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Japel et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the site-clearance hypothesis is well supported, its physiological significance among diverse central synapses remains unknown. To address this, we evoked EPSCs by afferent fiber stimulations in post-hearing (P13-15) mice brain slices, without intra-terminal perturbation, at brainstem calyces of Held and at hippocampal CA1 synapses at physiological temperature (PT, 37°C; Sanchez-Alavej et al., 2011) and in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 1.3 mM-Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in reference to rodent CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Jones and Keep, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Silver and Erecinska, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Inglebert et al., 2020</xref>). The post-hearing calyx of Held is a fast-signaling relay synapse that can respond to inputs up to 500 Hz without failure <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sonntag et al., 2009</xref>) and displays short-term depression during repetitive stimulation. In contrast, the hippocampal CA1 synapse is a relatively slow synapse that starts to fail transmission from Schaffer collateral (SC) to CA1 pyramidal cells (PC) at 40 Hz in slice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Combe et al., 2018</xref>) and exhibits short-term facilitation and long-term plasticity. At these different synapses, we tested the effect of blocking endocytosis or scaffold protein cascade activity on EPSCs evoked by a train of repetitive stimulations (30x) at different frequencies. These experiments indicated that the endocytosis-driven site-clearance mechanism activity-dependently supports vesicle replenishment, thereby counteracting synaptic depression at brainstem calyceal synapses and boosting synaptic facilitation at hippocampal SC-CA1 synapses. In contrast, the vesicle replenishing role of the scaffold mechanism is independent of activity and restricted to fast calyceal synapses, where it co-operates with the endocytosis-dependent site-clearance, thereby maintaining synaptic strength and enabling high-fidelity fast neurotransmission.</p>

<title>Potency of endocytic blockers on slow and fast endocytosis at the calyx of Held</title>
<p>To clarify physiological roles of endocytosis in high-frequency synaptic transmission, we first examined the effect of different endocytic inhibitors on fast and slow endocytosis, using presynaptic membrane capacitance measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>) at post-hearing calyces of Held (P13-15) at PT (37°C; Renden and von Gersdorff 2007) in aCSF containing 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) to ensure sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup>currents to induce exo-endocytosis. Dynasore is a dynamin-dependent endocytosis blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Macia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Newton et al., 2006</xref>) blocking both clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>). A second endocytosis blocker Pitstop-2 is thought to preferentially block clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">von Kleist et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lopez-Hernandez et al., 2022</xref>) but it reportedly blocks clathrin-independent endocytosis as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dutta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Willox et al., 2014</xref>). Since genetic ablation of endocytic proteins can be associated with robust compensatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Park et al., 2013</xref>), we adopted acute pharmacological block using endocytic inhibitors Dynasore and Pitstop-2.</p>

<p>At calyces of Held, a single short (5 ms) command pulse elicited an exocytic capacitance jump (<italic>Δ</italic>C<sub>m</sub>) followed by a slow endocytic decay rate (29 fF/s, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In the presence of Dynasore (100 <italic>μ</italic>M) or Pitstop-2 (25 <italic>μ</italic>M) in the perfusate (within 10-60 min of application) this slow endocytosis showed a strongly prolonged time course without accompanied by the change of <italic>Δ</italic>C<sub>m</sub> or presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (Table S1). In a repetitive stimulation protocol, the accelerating endocytosis can be induced by a 1-Hz train of 20-ms square pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>). Dynasore or Pitstop-2 significantly inhibited the maximal rate of 250 fF/s of this accelerated fast endocytosis (20 ms x 15 times at 1 Hz) to ∼ 50 % (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Table S1). In another stimulation protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), 10 command pulses (20 ms duration) applied at 10 Hz induced a fast endocytosis with a decay rate (350 fF/s) by more than 10 times faster than the slow endocytosis elicited by a 5 ms pulse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Dynasore or Pitstop-2 significantly inhibited the rate of this fast endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table S1) too. The potencies of bath-applied Dynasore or Pitstop-2 for blocking slow and fast forms of endocytosis were comparable to that of dynamin-1 proline-rich domain peptide (Dyn-1 PRD peptide) directly loaded in calyceal terminals (1mM; Figure S1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, at calyces of Held, bath-application of Dynasore or Pitstop-2 can block both fast and slow endocytosis without perturbing presynaptic intracellular milieu.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Effects of endocytic blockers on synaptic depression and recovery from depression at brainstem calyceal synapses</title>
<p>Using Dynasore or Pitstop-2, we investigated the effect of blocking endocytosis on synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held in brainstem slices from post-hearing mice (P13-15). At PT (37°) in physiological aCSF (1.3mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]), EPSCs were evoked by a train of 30 stimulations applied to afferent fibers at 10 or 100 Hz (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Neither Dynasore nor Pitstop-2 (in the perfusate, within 10-60 min of application) affected the first EPSC amplitude in the train (Figure S2A). During a train of stimulations at 10 Hz, in the presence of Dynasore (100 <italic>μ</italic>M), synaptic depression was slightly enhanced (from 45% to 52%, by 1.15 times), whereas Pitstop-2 had no effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>1). At 100-Hz stimulations, however, both Dynasore and Pitstop-2 markedly and equally enhanced synaptic depression within 10 ms from the stimulus onset, increasing the magnitude of steady state STD (averaged from #26-30 EPSCs) from 58% to 75% (1.3 times; p &lt; 0.001, t-test; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>1). These results suggest that endocytosis-dependent rapid SV replenishment operates during high-frequency transmission at the mammalian central synapses like at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>). Since glutamate released during action potential evoked EPSCs does not desensitize or saturate postsynaptic receptors at post-hearing calyces of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ishikawa et al, 2002</xref>) unlike at pre-hearing calyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yamashita et al, 2009</xref>), enhanced synaptic depression in the presence of endocytic blockers during repetitive fiber stimulations is most likely caused by pre-synaptic mechanisms. In fact, the results of endocytic block were essentially the same in the absence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) or presence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3S</xref>) of the low-affinity glutamate receptor ligand kynurenic acid (1 mM), which reduces postsynaptic receptor occupancy with glutamate.</p>

<p>At pre-hearing calyces of Held at room temperature (RT), in 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] solution, with a long command pulse stimulation under voltage-clamp, dynamin inhibitors markedly prolong the recovery of EPSCs from STD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, at post-hearing calyces in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and at PT (37°C), in the presence of the endocytic blockers, recovery of EPSCs from STD showed no prolongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>2, 2B2, Table S2). Conversely, the recovery from STD caused by 100-Hz stimulation was significantly accelerated at both fast and slow recovery time constants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>2, Table S2). To explore the reason for these different results, we raised Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in aCSF to 2.0 mM at PT (Figure S4A) or RT (Figure S4B) or raised stimulation frequency to 200 Hz at PT (Figure S4C). None of these manipulations caused significant change in the recovery from STD (Figure S4). Remaining difference may include the species and age differences between animals (pre-hearing rats <italic>vs</italic> post-hearing mice) and stimulation intensity that is stronger in the whole-cell voltage-clamp command pulse protocol than afferent fiber stimulation.

<title>Kinetic comparison of synaptic depression enhanced by endocytic blockers and scaffold cascade inhibitors and evaluation of their combined effect</title>
<p>During 100-Hz stimulation, enhancement of synaptic depression by endocytic blockers or scaffold cascade inhibitors are prominent already in the second EPSCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>1, 4B1).

</fig>
<p>Since the enhancement of synaptic depression by endocytic blockers or scaffold cascade inhibitors occurred mostly at the early phase of synaptic depression, endocytosis-and scaffold-dependent synaptic strengthening likely operate simultaneously during high-frequency transmission. To clarify whether these mechanisms are additive or complementary, we co-applied Dynasore and Latrunculin-B during 100 Hz stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The magnitude of EPSC depression by the co-application was the same as that by single Latrunculin-B application (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that endocytosis and scaffold mechanisms complementarily maintain synaptic strength during high-frequency transmission.</p>
<p>The F-actin depolymerizers Latrunculin A and Latrunculin B are widely utilized to examine presynaptic roles of F-actin. However, the results of STD and recovery can vary according to the application methods and experimental conditions (Figure S5A). At the calyx of Held, in 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at PT, Latrunculin A perfusion (20 <italic>μ</italic>M, 1h, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>1) showed a significant enhancement of STD at 100 Hz within 10-60 min of drug application (Figure S5B1, S5D), as previously reported for Latrunculin B perfusion at RT and 200 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mahapatra et al, 2016</xref>). However, 1h preincubation of slices with Latrunculin A (20 <italic>μ</italic>M) followed by perfusion with standard aCSF (∼1h, Figure S5A2) had no significant effect on STD induced by a train of 30 stimuli at 100 Hz (Figure S5B2, S5D), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Babu et al, 2020</xref>). In 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at PT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), marked STD enhancement was observed by continuous perfusion of Latrunculin B (15 <italic>μ</italic>M, Figure S5C, Figure S5D) or Latrunculin A (20 <italic>μ</italic>M, Figure S5C, Figure S5D). Thus, Latrunculin A (20 <italic>μ</italic>M) and Latrunculin B (15 <italic>μ</italic>M) are equipotent for STD enhancement in these experiments (Figure S5C, S5D).</p>
<p>When the data are compared between 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], STD levels after Latrunculin A perfusion are not different (<italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05, Figure S5D), whereas control STD level in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (∼0.4) was significantly less than 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (∼0.3; <italic>p =</italic> 0.0036, t-test; Figure S5D). Thus, physiological 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] revealed a robust STD-counteracting function of F-actin.</p>
<p>Regarding the recovery from STD, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent recovery (CDR) component of tens of ms time constant is produced by strong stimulation at the calyx of Held at RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wang and Kaczmarek, 1998</xref>) and inhibited by Latrunculin B (Lee et al, 2013). CDR is also observed after STD induced by 100 Hz stimulation at PT and blocked by Latrunculin A pretreatment (20 <italic>μ</italic>M) in 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Babu et al, 2020</xref>). However, such Latrunculin-sensitive fast recovery component was absent in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>2, Table S2). Thus, CDR may operate only when excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> enters during massive presynaptic activation.</p>

<title>Possible role of endocytosis and scaffold machineries at hippocampal synapses</title>
<p>Counteraction of synaptic depression by endocytosis or scaffold mechanism is highlighted at fast synapses of large structure such as neuromuscular junction or the calyx of Held. However, it remains open whether these mechanisms are conserved at more conventional bouton-type synapses involved in synaptic plasticity. Hence, we recorded EPSCs from hippocampal SC-CA1 pyramidal neurons evoked at high frequency (10 Hz or 25 Hz) by stimulating Schaffer collaterals (SCs) at PT and in aCSF containing 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In this physiologically optimized experimental condition, EPSCs underwent a prominent facilitation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In the presence of Dynasore (100 <italic>μ</italic>M, within 10-60 min of application in perfusate), synaptic facilitation was much less than control, which was noticeable within 300 ms (4<sup>th</sup> stimulation) at 10 Hz stimulation or within 80 ms (3<sup>rd</sup> stimulation) at 25 Hz stimulation from the onset (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, 6B). Unexpectedly, Dynasore significantly enhanced the basal EPSC amplitude (Figure S2B), whereas Pitstop-2 had no such effect (Figure S2B). Although less potent than Dynasore, Pitstop-2 significantly attenuated synaptic facilitation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, 6C). Thus, at hippocampal CA1 synapses, like at fast synapses, endocytosis strengthens synaptic efficacy during high-frequency transmission, thereby boosting short-term synaptic potentiation.</p>

<p>Strikingly, unlike endocytic blockers, neither ML141 nor Latrunculin-B affected the hippocampal short-term facilitation during stimulations at 10 Hz or 25 Hz (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, 6D). Thus, the presynaptic scaffold cascade proteins F-actin or CDC42 unlikely plays a regulatory role on short-term synaptic plasticity at hippocampal synapses. At the CA1 synapse, block of vesicle acidification is reported to enhance synaptic depression at 10-30-Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ertunc et al., 2007</xref>), presumably because of a lack of filled vesicles undergoing rapid vesicle recycling. However, at hippocampal synapses in culture, vesicle acidification block has no effect on the depression of repetitive exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Hua et al., 2013</xref>). To determine whether this enhanced depression in the presence of v-ATPase blockers in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ertunc et al., 2007</xref>) have any physiological relevance in regulating the synaptic strength during repetitive transmission, we tested the effect of v-ATPase blockers on hippocampal EPSCs. Unlike in 2.0 mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ertunc et al., 2007</xref>), in 1.3-mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at PT, EPSCs showed a prominent facilitation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Figure S6), and blocking vesicle acidification with Folimicin (67 nM) or Bafilomycin A1 (5 <italic>μ</italic>M) reduced the basal EPSC amplitudes but had no significant effect on the short-term facilitation (Figure S6). Thus, in physiological conditions, vesicle acidification has no direct effect on the short-term synaptic plasticity at hippocampal CA1 synapses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In acute slices optimized to physiological conditions, blocking endocytosis by bath-application of endocytic blockers enhanced activity-dependent depression of EPSCs evoked by high-frequency stimulation of afferent fibers at brainstem calyceal synapses. The enhancement of depression occurred immediately after the onset of stimulation and proceeded with a several millisecond time constant and then slowly merged into the control time course. Thus, the depression-counteracting effect of endocytosis was restricted to the early epoch of high-frequency transmission when many vesicles occupy the release sites. As number of vesicles undergoing exocytosis during repetitive stimulation gradually reduces, the site-clearance becomes less demanding.</p>
<p>At the calyx of Held, Dynasore or Pitstop-2 blocked both fast and slow endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The fast endocytosis is characterized with a rate of ∼350 fF/s, which was slowed by endocytic blockers to ∼150 fF/s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table S1). This reduction of endocytic rate (200 fF/s) corresponds to 2.54 vesicles/ms (1 fF = 12.7 vesicles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>; 200 fF/s x 12.7 vesicles x 1/1000 ms). Since the mean amplitude of miniature EPSCs, representing a single vesicle response, was ∼55 pA in 1.3 mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] at PT (data not shown), endocytic block is estimated to reduce EPSC amplitude by ∼1.4 nA in 10 ms (2.54 vesicles/ms x 55 pA x 10 ms x 1/1000 nA). This is close to the EPSC size difference (1.6 nA) after 10 ms at 100-Hz stimulus onset between the absence and presence of endocytic blockers. Therefore, during high-frequency transmission, the site-clearance by fast endocytosis can fully compensate the initial strong depression. However, the rate of slow endocytosis is 10 times slower than fast endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Table S1), therefore slow endocytosis unlikely contributes to the millisecond-order site-clearance. However, without slow endocytosis, vesicular membrane remaining after spontaneous exocytosis would accumulate and congest release sites. Thus, slow endocytosis may play a house-keeping role in release site-clearance.</p>
<p>At the calyx of Held, scaffold protein inhibitors significantly enhanced the early phase of synaptic depression like endocytic blockers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, 5B). Unlike endocytic blockers, scaffold protein inhibitors had no effect on endocytosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast to the effect of endocytic blockers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), the effect of scaffold protein inhibitors was independent of stimulation frequency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Co-application of endocytic and scaffold protein cascade inhibitors revealed that the synaptic strengthening effects of endocytosis and scaffold machinery are complementary rather than additive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These results together suggest that fast endocytosis quickly clears vesicle residues, whereas scaffold machinery simultaneously replenishes transmitter-filled vesicles to release sites during high frequency transmission (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Through this combinatory mechanism synaptic strength and high-fidelity neurotransmission (up to 500 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sonntag et al., 2009</xref>) can be maintained at fast synapses such as the calyx of Held auditory relay synapse.</p>

<caption><title>Hypothetical vesicle replenishment scheme by endocytosis and scaffold-machineries during repetitive transmission at fast-signaling calyx and slow-plastic hippocampal CA1 synapses.</title>
<p>During high-frequency transmission, endocytosis driven site-clearance allows activity-dependent replenishment of new vesicles to release sites. This endocytic function counteracts synaptic depression caused by vesicle depletion, thereby maintain synaptic strength, enabling high-fidelity fast neurotransmission at sensory relay synapses, like at the calyx of Held. This endocytosis driven synaptic strengthening function augments synaptic facilitation at slow-plastic synapses like hippocampal CA1 synapses that exhibit long-term plasticity, thereby boosting its induction capability for memory formation. Whereas, the presynaptic scaffold machinery plays a powerful direct vesicle replenishment role, independent of endocytosis and activity, thereby rapidly translocating new vesicles to open release sites including those just opened by endocytic site-clearance. This scaffold function is specifically devoted to fast-signaling synapses, with high release probability but not to plastic synapses, where vesicle depletion is minimal due to low release probability.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>At hippocampal CA1 synapses the roles of endocytosis and scaffold machineries in fast vesicle replenishment were different from those at the calyx of Held. In slices optimized to physiological condition, short-term plasticity was depressive at calyceal synapses, whereas facilitatory at hippocampal CA1 synapses. Endocytic blockers attenuated synaptic facilitation at this slow-plastic synapse, suggesting that endocytosis is normally boosting synaptic facilitation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Since synaptic strength at facilitatory synapses is determined by a sum of facilitation and depression mechanisms, attenuation of synaptic depression by endocytosis can boost synaptic facilitation. At hippocampal excitatory synapses, short-term facilitation of glutamate release induces long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory transmission. Thus, from physiological viewpoints, endocytosis-dependent site clearance can play an essential role in the induction of LTP underlying memory formation.</p>
<p>Strikingly, the scaffold protein inhibitor ML141 or Latrunculin B had no effect on EPSCs at hippocampal CA1 synapses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, 6D). This is surprising since Latrunculin-A blocks ultra-fast endocytosis in hippocampal culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). Since Latrunculin-B attenuates vesicle docking at parallel fiber-interneuron synapses in cerebellar slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Miki et al., 2016</xref>), presynaptic scaffold machinery likely operates at the cerebellar synapses. The scaffold machinery might play vesicle replenishing role at fast-relay synapses, but not at slow-plastic synapses. In contrast, the site-clearance role of endocytosis seems universal among synapses, irrespective of their transmission speed and plasticity.</p>

<title>Slice preparation (brainstem and hippocampal) and electrophysiology</title>
<p>Following decapitation of C57BL/6J mice under isoflurane anesthesia, brains were isolated and transverse slices (200 <italic>μ</italic>m thick) containing the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) or parasagittal slices (300 <italic>μ</italic>m) containing the hippocampus were cut using a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica) in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, see below) with reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.1 mM) and increased Mg<sup>2+</sup> (2.9 mM) concentrations and with NaCl replaced by 200 mM sucrose. Slices were incubated for 1h at 37°C in standard aCSF containing (in mM); 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 or 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 3 myo-inositol, 2 sodium pyruvate, and 0.4 sodium ascorbate (pH 7.3-7.4 when bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 285-290 mOsm). Unless otherwise noted, EPSCs were recorded in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at 37°C. During recording, a brain slice in a temperature-controlled chamber (RC-26GLP, PM-1; Warner instruments) was continuously perfused with aCSF solutions without (control) or with the pharmacological blockers using a peristaltic pump (5-6 µl/s). Recordings with or without the blockers were made from separate cells in different slices from a minimum of 3-4 animals for each set of experiment. In experiments at PT, solutions kept in a water bath (37°C) and passed through an in-line heater (SH-27B, Warner instruments) placed immediately before the recording chamber and maintained at 37°C (± 0.2°C) by a controller (TC-344C, Warner instruments). For RT experiments, no heating was used, and the temperature was within 22-24°C. Recordings in the presence of pharmacological blockers were made within 10-60 min of drug application and for control experiments a slice was kept in the recording chamber no longer than 1 h.</p>
<p>Whole-cell recordings were made using a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-10 USB, HEKA Elektronik, Germany) from the calyx of Held presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic MNTB principal neurons, or hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons visually identified with a 60X water immersion objective (LUMPlanFL, Olympus) attached to an upright microscope (BX51WI, Olympus, Japan). Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 50 kHz using Patchmaster software (for EPC-10 USB) after online filtering at 5 kHz. The patch pipettes were pulled using a vertical puller (PIP6, HEKA) and had a series resistance of 3-4 M<italic>Ω.</italic></p>

<title>Membrane capacitance recordings from presynaptic calyx terminal (at PT)</title>
<p>The patch pipettes for presynaptic capacitance recording were wax coated to reduce stray capacitance and had a series resistance of 6-15 M<italic>Ω</italic>, which was compensated by up to 60% for its final value to be 6 M<italic>Ω</italic>. To isolate presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (I<sub>Ca</sub>) during membrane capacitance measurements (C<sub>m</sub>), tetrodotoxin (1 µM) and tetra-ethyl-ammonium chloride (TEA, 5 mM) were routinely added to block Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels, respectively. Calyx terminals were voltage clamped at a holding potential of -70 mV and a sine wave (peak to peak = 60 mV at 1kHz) was applied. A single pulse (5 ms) or a train of 20 ms pulses (15 stimuli at 1 Hz or 10 stimuli at 10 Hz) to +10 mV were given to induce slow, fast-accelerating, and fast endocytosis. The capacitance trace within 450 ms after the stimulation pulse was excluded from analysis to avoid capacitance artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). The exocytic capacitance jump (ΔC<sub>m</sub>) in response to a stimulation pulse was measured as difference between baseline and mean C<sub>m</sub> at 450-460 ms after the pulse onset. The endocytic rate was measured from the C<sub>m</sub> decay phase 0.45-5.45 s from the end of 5 ms stimulation pulse, 0.45-0.95 s for 1 Hz train stimulation and 0.45-1.45 s after the last (10<sup>th</sup>) pulse for 10 Hz train stimulation. C<sub>m</sub> traces were averaged at every 10 ms (for 10 Hz train stimulation) or 20 ms (for 5 ms single or 1 Hz train stimulation).</p>

<title>EPSC recordings from brainstem and hippocampus</title>
<p>For EPSC recordings, brainstem MNTB principal neurons or hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were voltage-clamped at the holding potential of -80 mV. To evoke EPSCs a bipolar electrode was placed on afferent fibers between MNTB and midline in brainstem slices or on the Schaffer collateral fibers in the stratum radiatum near the CA1 border in hippocampal slices.</p>
<p>The patch pipettes had a series resistance of 5-15 M<italic>Ω</italic> (less than 10 M<italic>Ω</italic> in most cells) that was compensated up to 80% for a final value of ∼3 M<italic>Ω</italic> for EPSC recording from MNTB neurons. For EPSC recording from hippocampal pyramidal cells, no compensation was made, and capacitance artifacts were manually corrected. Stimulation pulses were applied through an isolator (Model 2100, A-M Systems) controlled by EPC10 amplifier (HEKA).</p>
<p>During EPSC recordings, strychnine-HCl (Sigma, 2 µM), bicuculline-methiodide (Sigma, 10 µM) and D-(-)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5, Tocris, 50 µM) were added to isolate AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs. In some experiments, to minimize AMPA receptor saturation and desensitization, kynurenic acid (Sigma, 1 mM) was added to aCSF. Unless otherwise specified, the internal pipette solution for presynaptic capacitance measurements contained (in mM): 125 Cs gluconate, 10 HEPES, 20 TEA-Cl, 5 sodium phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP and 0.5 EGTA (pH 7.2-7.3, adjusted with CsOH, adjusted to 305-315 mOsm by varying Cs-gluconate concentration). For EPSC recording, the internal pipette solution contained QX-314 bromide (2 mM) and EGTA, either 5 mM (for MNTB cells) or 0.5 mM (for pyramidal cells), but otherwise identical to the presynaptic pipette solution. Dynasore (100 µM), Pitstop-2 (25 µM), ML 141 (10 µM), Folimycin (also known as Concanamycin A; 67 nM), Latrunculin-A (20 µM), Latrunculin B (15 µM), and Bafilomycin A1 (5 µM) were dissolved in DMSO (final concentration 0.1%, except for Latrunculin-A, 0.2%). Since Latrunculin A, Latrunculin-B and Folimycin are light sensitive, precautions were taken to minimize light exposure during handling and recording. Dynamin 1 proline-rich domain (PRD) peptide (sequence: PQVPSRPNRAP; GenScript) was dissolved in presynaptic pipette solution (1 mM). Membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) recordings in the presence of Dyn-1 PRD peptide were initiated 4-5 min after whole-cell membrane rupture to allow its time of diffusion inside presynaptic terminals.</p>

<p>Following synaptic vesicle fusion events at release sites, vesicle remnants will need to be cleared in order to allow new rounds of vesicle docking and fusion. This <bold>fundamental</bold> study of Mahapatra and Takahashi examines the role of release site clearance in synaptic transmission during repetitive activity in two types of central synapses, the giant calyx of Held and hippocampal CA1 synapses. The study uses pharmacological approaches to interfere with release site clearance by blocking membrane retrieval (endocytosis). They compare the effects on short-term plasticity with those obtained by pharmacologically inhibiting scaffold protein activity. The data presented make a <bold>compelling</bold> case for fast endocytosis as necessary for rapid site clearance and vesicle recruitment to active zones. The data reveal an unexpected, fast role for local site clearance in counteracting synaptic depression.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study examines the role of release site clearance in synaptic transmission during repetitive activity under physiological conditions in two types of central synapses, calyx of Held and hippocampal CA1 synapses. After acute block of endocytosis by pharmacology, deeper synaptic depression or less facilitation was observed in two types of synapses. Acute block of CDC42 and actin polymerization, which possibly inhibits the activity of Intersectin, affected synaptic depression at the calyx synapse, but not at CA1 synapses. The data suggest an unexpected, fast role of the site clearance in counteracting synaptic depression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study uses acute block of the molecular targets with pharmacology together with precise electrophysiology. The experimental results are clear cut and convincing. The study also examines the physiological roles of the site clearance using action potential-evoked transmission at physiological Ca and physiological temperature at mature animals. This condition has not been examined.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Pharmacology may have some off-target effects, though acute manipulation should be appreciated and the authors have tried several reagents to verify the overall conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Mahapatra and Takahashi report on the physiological consequences of pharmacologically blocking either clathrin and dynamin function during compensatory endocytosis or of the cortical actin scaffold both in the calyx of Held synapse and hippocampal boutons in acute slice preparations</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Although many aspects of these pharmacological interventions have been studied in detail during the past decades, this is a nice comprehensive and comparative study, which reveals some interesting differences between a fast synapse (Calyx of Held) tuned to reliably transmit at several 100 Hz and a more slow hippocampal CA1 synapse. In particular the authors find that acute disturbance of the synaptic actin network leads to a marked frequency-dependent enhancement of synaptic depression in the Calyx, but not in the hippocampal synapse This striking difference between both preparations is the most interesting and novel finding.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, these findings concerning the different consequences of actin depolymerization are not sufficiently discussed in comparison to the literature. My only criticism concerns the interpretation of the ML 141 and Lat B data. With respect to the Calyx data, I am missing a detailed discussion of the effects observed here in light of the different RRP subpools SRP and FRP. This is very important since Lee at al. (2012, PNAS 109 (13) E765-E774) showed earlier that disruption of actin inhibits the rapid transition of SRP SVs to the FRP at the AZ. The whole literature on this important concept is missing. Likewise, the role of actin for the replacement pool at a cerebellar synapse (Miki et al., 2016) is only mentioned in half a sentence. There is quite some evidence that actin is important both at the AZ (SRP to FRP transition, activation of replacement pool) and at the peri-active zone for compensatory endocytosis and release site clearance. Both possible underlying mechanisms (SRP to FRP transition or release site clearance) should be better dissected.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Mahapatra and Takahashi addresses the role of presynaptic release site clearance during sustained synaptic activity. The authors characterize the effects of pharmacologically interfering with SV endocytosis (pre-incubation with Dynasore or Pitstop-2) on synaptic short-term plasticity (STP) at two different CNS synapses (calyx of Held synapses and hippocampal SC to CA1 synapses) using patch-clamp recordings in acute slices under experimental conditions designed to closely mimic a physiological situation (37{degree sign}C and 1.3 mM external [Ca2+]). Endocytosis blocker-induced changes in STP and in the recovery from short-term depression (STD) are compared to those seen after pharmacologically inhibiting actin filament assembly (pre-incubation with Latrunculin-B or the selective Cdc42 GTPase inhibitor ML-141). Presynaptic capacitance (Cm) recordings in calyx terminals were used to establish the effects of the pharmacological maneuvers on SV endocytosis.</p>
<p>
Latrunculin-B and ML-141 neither affect SV endocytosis (assayed by Cm recordings) nor EPSC recovery following conditioning trains, but strongly enhances STD at calyx synapses. No changes in STP were observed at Latrunculin-B- or ML-141-treated SC to CA1 synapses.</p>
<p>Dynasore and Pitstop-2 slow down endocytosis, limit the total amount of exocytosis in response to long stimuli, enhance STD in response to 100 Hz stimulation, but profoundly accelerate EPSC recovery following conditioning 100 Hz trains at calyx synapses. At SC to CA1 synapses, Dynasore and Pitstop-2 reduce the extend of facilitation and lower relative steady-state EPSCs suggesting a change in the facilitation-depression balance in favor of the latter.</p>
<p>The authors use state-of-the art techniques and their data, which is clearly presented, leads to authors to conclude that endocytosis is universally important for clearance of release sites while the importance of scaffold protein-mediated site clearance is limited to 'fast synapses'.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, and perhaps not completely unexpected in view of the pharmacological tools chosen, there are several observations which remain difficult to understand:</p>
<p>(1) Blocking site clearance affects release sites that have previously been used, i.e. sites at which SV fusion has occurred and which therefore need to be cleared. Calyces use at most 20% of all release sites during a single AP, likely fewer at 1.3 mM external [Ca2+]. Even if all those 20% of release sites become completely unavailable due to a block of release site clearance, the 2nd EPSC in a train should not be reduced by &gt;20% because ~80% of the sites cannot be affected. However, ~50% EPSC reduction was observed (Fig. 2B1, lower right panel) raising the possibility that Dynasore does more than specifically interfering with SVs endocytosis (and possibly Pitstop as well). Non-specific effects are also suggested by the observed two-fold increase in initial EPSC size in SC to CA1 synapses after Dynasore pre-incubation.</p>
<p>(2) More severe depression was observed at calyx synapses after blocking endocytosis which the authors attribute to a presynaptic mechanism affecting pool replenishment. When probing EPSC recovery after conditioning 100 Hz trains, a speed up was observed mediated by an &quot;unknown mechanism&quot; which is &quot;masked in 2 mM [Ca2+]&quot;. These two observations, deeper synaptic depression during 100 Hz but faster recovery from depression following 100 Hz, are difficult to align and no attempt was made to find an explanation.</p>
<p>(3) To reconcile previous data reporting a block of Ca2+-dependent recovery (CDR) by Dynasore or Latrunculin (measured at 2 mM external [Ca2+]) with the data presented here (using 1.3 mM external [Ca2+]) reporting no effect or a speed up of recovery from depression, the authors postulate that &quot;CDR may operate only when excessive Ca2+ enters during massive presynaptic activation&quot; (page 10 line 244). While that is possible, such explanation ignores plenty of calyx studies demonstrating fiber stimulation-induced CDR and elucidating molecular pathways mediating fiber stimulation-induced CDR, and it also completely dismisses the strong change in recovery time course after 10 Hz conditioning (single exponential) as compared to 100 Hz conditioning (double exponential with a pronounced fast component).</p>
<p>Strong presynaptic stimuli such as those illustrated in Figs. 1B,C induce massive exocytosis. The illustrated Cm increase of 2 to 2.5 pF represents fusion of 25,000 to 30,000 SVs (assuming a single SV capacitance of 80 aF) corresponding to a 12 to 15% increase in whole terminal membrane surface (assuming a mean terminal capacitance of ~16 pF). Capacitance measurements can only be considered reliable in the absence of marked changes in series and membrane conductance. Documentation of the corresponding conductance traces is therefore advisable for such massive Cm jumps and merely mentioning that the first 450 ms after stimulation were skipped during analysis or referring to previous publications showing conductance traces is insufficient.</p>
<p>
All bar graphs in Figures 1 through 6 and Figures S3 through S6 compare three or even four (Fig. 5C) conditions, i.e. one control and at least two treatment data sets. It appears as if repeated t-tests were used to run multiple two-group comparisons (i.e. using the same control data twice for two different comparisons). Either a proper multiple comparison test should be used or a Bonferroni correction or similar multiple-comparison correction needs to be applied.</p>
<p>Finally, the terminology of contrasting &quot;fast-signaling&quot; (calyx synapses) and &quot;slow-plastic&quot; (SC synapses) synapses seems to imply that calyx synapses lack plasticity, as does the wording &quot;conventional bouton-type synapses involved in synaptic plasticity&quot; (page 11, line 251). I assume, the authors primarily refer to the maximum frequencies these two synapse types typically transmit (fast-signaling vs slow-signaling)?</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment:</bold></p>
<p>This important study combines a comparative approach in different synapses with experiments that show how synaptic vesicle endocytosis in nerve terminals regulates short-term plasticity. The data presented support the conclusions and make a convincing case for fast endocytosis as necessary for rapid vesicle recruitment to active zones. Some aspects of the description of the data and analysis are however incomplete and would benefit from a more rigorous approach. With more discussion of methods and analysis, this paper would be of great interest to neurobiologists and biophysicists working on synaptic vesicle recycling and short-term plasticity mechanisms.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>To acutely block vesicle endocytosis, we utilized two different pharmacological tools, Dynasore and Pitstop-2, after testing their blocking spectra and potencies at the calyx presynaptic terminals and collected data of their common effects on target functions. Since the recovery from STD was faster at the calyx synapses in the presence of both endocytic blockers in physiological 1.3 mM [Ca2+] (Figure 2B), but not in 2.0 mM [Ca2+] (Figure S4), they might facilitate vesicle mobilization in physiological condition.</p>

<p>The concept of FRP and SRP are derived from voltage-clamp step-depolarization experiments at calyces of Held in pre-hearing rodents at RT, which cannot be directly dissected in data of action-potential evoked EPSCs at post-hearing calyces at physiological conditions. However, we dissected as much by referring to related literatures in new paragraphs in Result section (p9-10), particularly on the different effects of Latrunculin application and experimental conditions by adding a new supplementary Figure (now S5). Regarding F-actin role in vesicle replenishment at cerebellar synapses, we added sentences in Discussion section (p14, last paragraph).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>General comments:</p>
<p>(1) While Dynasore and Pitstop-2 may impede release site clearance due to an arrest of membrane retrieval, neither Latrunculin-B nor ML-141 specifically acts on AZ scaffold proteins. Interference with actin polymerization may have a number of consequences many of which may be unrelated to release site clearance. Therefore, neither Latrunculin-B nor ML-141 can be considered suitable tools for specifically identifying the role of AZ scaffold proteins (i.e. ELKS family proteins, Piccolo, Bassoon, α-liprin, Unc13, RIM, RBP, etc) in release site clearance which was defined as one of the principal aims of this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we focused our analysis on the downstream activity of scaffold protein intersectin by comparing the common inhibitory effects of CDC42 and actin polymerization, by use of ML141 and Latrunculin B, respectively, on vesicle endocytosis and synaptic depression/ facilitation without addressing diverse individual drug effects. To avoid confusion we removed “AZ” from scaffold protein.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Initial EPSC amplitudes more than doubled in the presence of Dynasor at hippocampal SC-&gt;CA1 synapses (Figure S2). This unexpected result raises doubts about the specificity of Dynasor as a tool to selectively block SV endocytosis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is possible that Dynasore might have unknown or off-target effects. However, the main conclusion is backed up by Pitstop-2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In this study, the application of Dynasore and Pitstop-2 strongly decreases 100 Hz steady-state release at calyx synapses while - quite unexpectedly - strongly accelerates recovery from depression. A previous study found that genetic ablation of dynamin-1 actually enhanced 300 Hz steady-state release while only little affecting recovery from depression (Mahapatra et al., 2016). A similar scenario holds for the Latrunculin-B effects: In this study, Latrunculin-B strongly increased steady-state depression while in Babu et al. (2020), Latrunculin-B did not affect steady-state depression. In Mahapatra et al. (2016), Latrunculin-B marginally enhanced steady-state depression. The authors need to make a serious attempt to explain all these seemingly contradicting results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The latrunculin effect on STD can vary according to the condition of application and external [Ca2+], which we show in a new supplemental Figure S5. The latrunculin effect on the recovery from STD also varies with temperature, [Ca2+], and animal age, which affect Ca2+-dependent fast recovery component from depression. We added paragraphs for this issue in Results section (p9-10).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The experimental conditions need to be better specified. It is not clear which recordings were obtained in 1.3 mM and which (if any?) in 2 mM external Ca. It is also unclear whether 'pooled data' are presented (obtained from control recordings and from separate recordings after pre-incubation with the respective drugs), or whether the data actually represent 'before'/'after' comparisons obtained from the same synapses after washing in the respective drugs. The exact protocol of drug application (duration of application/pre-incubation?, measurements after wash-out or in the continuous presence of the drugs?) needs to be clearly described in the methods and needs to be briefly mentioned in Results and/or Figure legends.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added methodological explanations and reworded sentences in the text to be clear for pharmacological data derived from non-sequential separate experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors compare results obtained in calyx with those obtained in SC-&gt;CA1 synapses which they considered examples for 'fast' and 'slow' synapses, respectively. There is little information given to help readers understand why these two synapse types were chosen, what the attributes 'fast' and 'slow' refer to, and how that may matter for the questions studied here. I assume the authors refer to the maximum frequency these two synapse types are able to transmit rather than to EPSC kinetics?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the “fast and slow” naming features maximum operating frequency these synapses can transmit. We reworded “fast and slow” to “fast-signaling and slow-plastic” and added explanation in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Strong presynaptic stimuli such as those illustrated in Figures 1B and C induce massive exocytosis. The illustrated Cm increase of 2 to 2.5 pF represents a fusion of 25,000 to 30,000 SVs (assuming a single SV capacitance of 80 aF) corresponding to a 12 to 15% increase in whole terminal membrane surface (assuming a mean terminal capacitance of ~16 pF). Capacitance measurements can only be considered reliable in the absence of marked changes in series and membrane conductance. Since the data shown in Figs. 1 and 3 are central to the argumentation, illustration of the corresponding conductance traces is mandatory. Merely mentioning that the first 450 ms after stimulation were skipped during analysis is insufficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Conductance trace is shown with a trace of capacitance change induced by a square pulse in our previous paper (Yamashita et al, 2005 Science).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) It is essential for this study to preclude a contamination of the results with postsynaptic effects (AMPAR saturation and desensitization). AMPAR saturation limits the amplitudes of initial responses in EPSC trains and hastens the recovery from depression due to a 'ceiling effect'. AMPAR desensitization occludes paired-pulse facilitation and reduces steady-state responses during EPSC trains while accelerating the initial recovery from depression. The use of, for example, 1 mM kynurenic acid in the bath is a well-established strategy to attenuate postsynaptic effects at calyx synapses. All calyx EPSC recordings should have been performed under such conditions. Otherwise, recovery time courses and STP parameters are likely contaminated by postsynaptic effects. Since the effects of AMPAR saturation on EPSC_1 and desensitization on EPSC_ss may partially cancel each other, an unchanged relative STD in the presence of kynurenic acid is not necessarily a reliable indicator for the absence of postsynaptic effects. The use of kynurenic acid in the bath would have had the beneficial side effect of massively improving voltage-clamp conditions. For the typical values given in this MS (10 nA EPSC, 3 MOhm Rs) the expected voltage escape is ~30 mV corresponding to a change in driving force of 30 mV/80 mV=38%, i.e. initial EPSCs in trains are likely underestimated by 38%. Such large voltage escape usually results in unclamped INa(V) which was suppressed in this study by routinely including 2 mM QX-314 in the pipette solution. That approach does, however, not reduce the voltage escape.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Glutamate released during AP-evoked EPSCs does not saturate or desensitize postsynaptic receptors at post-hearing calyces of Held (Ishikawa et al, 2002; Yamashita et al, 2003) although it does in pre-hearing calyces (Yamashita et al, 2009). In fact, as shown in Figure S3, our results are essentially the same with or without kynurenate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In the Results section (pages 7 and 8), the authors analyze the time course into STD during 100 Hz trains in the absence and presence of drugs. In the presence of drugs, an additional fast component is observed which is absent from control recordings. Based on this observation, the authors conclude that '... the mechanisms operate predominantly at the beginning of synaptic depression'. However, the consequences of blocking or slowing site clearing are expected to be strongly release-dependent. Assuming a probability of &lt;20% that a fusion event occurs at a given release site, &gt;80% of the sites cannot be affected at the arrival of the second AP even by a total arrest of site clearance simply because no fusion has yet occurred. That number decreases during a train according to (1-0.2)^n, where n is the number of the AP, such that after 10 APs, ~90% of the sites have been used and may potentially be unavailable for new rounds of release after slowing site clearance. Perhaps, the faster time course into STD in the presence of the drugs isn't related to site clearance?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Enhanced depression at the beginning of stimulation indicates the block of rapid SV replenishment mechanism, which includes endocytosis-dependent site-clearance and scaffold-dependent vesicle translocation to release sites.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) In the Discussion (page 10), the authors present a calculation that is supposed to explain the reduced size of the second calyx EPSC in a 100 Hz train in the presence of Dynasore or Pitstop-2. Does this calculation assume that all endocytosed SVs are immediately available for release within 10 ms? Please elaborate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not assume rapid endocytosed vesicle reuse within 10 ms as it requires much longer time for glutamate refilling (7s at PT; Hori &amp; Takahashi, 2012). Instead, already filled reserved vesicles can rapidly replenish release sites if sites are clean and scaffold works properly. Results shown in Figure S6 also indicate that block of vesicle transmitter refilling has no immediate effect on synaptic responses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) It is not clear, why the bafilomycin/folimycin data is presented in Fig. S5. The data is also not mentioned in the Discussion. Either explain the purpose of these experiments or remove the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These v-ATPase blockers, which block vesicular transmitter refilling, are reported to enhance EPSC depression at hippocampal synapses at RT and 2 mM [Ca2+] presumably because of lack of filled vesicles undergoing rapid vesicle recycling (eg Kiss &amp; Run). We thought it important to determine whether these data have physiological relevance since such a mechanism might also regulate synaptic strength during repetitive transmission. However, our results did not support its physiological relevance. Since these results are not within our main questions, the negative results are shown it in supplementary Figure 6 and explained in the last paragraph of Result section (p11), but were not discussed further in Discussion section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The scheme in Figure 7 is not very helpful.</p>

<p>We updated the scheme to summarize our conclusion that vesicle replenishment through endocytosis-dependent site-clearance and scaffold-dependent mechanism independently co-operate to strengthen synaptic efficacy during repetitive transmission at calyx fast-signaling synapses. However, endocytic site clearance is solely required to support facilitation at slow-plastic hippocampal SC-CA1 synapses.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>First, my deep apologies for the long delay in reviewing your paper. All reviewers are now in agreement that the paper has valuable new information, but some methods are not described well and some results appear to be incompatible with previous results in the literature. The discussion of previous literature is also incomplete and not well-balanced. With more discussion of methods and literature strengthened this paper would be of great interest to neurobiologists and biophysicists working on synaptic vesicle recycling and short-term plasticity mechanisms. We ask that you address the comments and revise your paper before we can fully recommend the paper as being an important contribution with compelling evidence and a strong data set that supports the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We explained methods more explicitly. Apparent incompatibility with previous results is now explained and discussed with new supplementary data.</p>

<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) In this study, the application of Dynasore and Pitstop-2 strongly decreased 100 Hz steady-state release at calyx synapses while - quite unexpectedly - it strongly accelerated recovery from depression. A previous study found that genetic ablation of dynamin-1 actually enhanced 300 Hz steady-state release while only little affecting recovery from depression (Mahapatra et al., 2016). A similar scenario holds for the Latrunculin-B effects: In this study, Latrunculin-B strongly increased steady-state depression while in Babu et al. (2020), Latrunculin-B did not affect steady-state depression. In Mahapatra et al. (2016), Latrunculin-B marginally enhanced steady-state depression. The authors need to make a serious attempt to explain all these seemingly contradicting results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Lack of change in the recovery from depression in dynamin-1 knockout mice by Mahapatra et al (2016) is consistent with results in Figure S4 in 2 mM [Ca2+], whereas accelerated recovery by Dynasore (Figure 2B2) is observed in 1.3 mM [Ca2+] suggesting that it is masked in 2 mM [Ca2+] but revealed in physiological [Ca2+] (p7, top paragraph). In both cases, however, recovery from STD is not prolonged unlike Hosoi et al (2009).</p>
<p>The latrunculin issues are discussed in Results section with newly added Supplementary Figure S5 (p9-10).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The experimental conditions need to be better specified. It is not clear which recordings were obtained in 1.3 mM and which (if any?) in 2 mM external Ca. It is also unclear whether 'pooled data' are presented (obtained from control recordings and from separate recordings after pre-incubation with the respective drugs), or whether the data actually represent 'before'/'after' comparisons obtained from the same synapses after washing in the respective drugs. The exact protocol of drug application (duration of application/pre-incubation?, measurements after wash-out or in the continuous presence of the drugs?) needs to be clearly described in the methods and needs to be briefly mentioned in Results and/or Figure legends.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We made these points clearer in Method section and Result section.</p>

<p>(3) Please cite and discuss briefly previous papers that have shown fast endocytosis in the calyx of Held with membrane capacitance measurements like Renden and von Gersdorff, J Neurophysiology, 98:3349, 2007 and Taschenberger et al., Neuron, 2002. These papers first showed exocytosis and endocytosis kinetics in more mature (hearing) mice calyx of Held and at higher physiological temperatures.</p>

<p>(4) The findings concerning the different consequences of actin depolymerization are not sufficiently discussed in comparison to the literature. My only criticism concerns the interpretation of the ML 141 and Lat B data. With respect to the Calyx data, I am missing a detailed discussion of the effects observed here in light of the different RRP subpools SRP and FRP. This is very important since Lee et al. (2012, PNAS 109 (13) E765-E774) showed earlier that disruption of actin inhibits the rapid transition of SRP SVs to the FRP at the AZ. The whole literature on this important concept is missing. Likewise, the role of actin for the replacement pool at a cerebellar synapse (Miki et al., 2016) is only mentioned in half a sentence. There is quite some evidence that actin is important both at the AZ (SRP to FRP transition, activation of replacement pool) and at the peri-active zone for compensatory endocytosis and release site clearance. Both possible underlying mechanisms (SRP to FRP transition or release site clearance) should be better dissected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added discussions on the issue of latrunculin in Result section by quoting previous literatures (p9-10).  Since there is no direct evidence (by vesicle imaging) for the presence of FRP and SRP, these definitions derived from voltage clamp step-depolarization studies are difficult to incorporate into the dissection of synaptic depression in physiological conditions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have no major comments, but the following issues may be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) The term &quot;fast and slow&quot; synapses may be relative and a bit confusing. I do not think hippocampal synapses are slow synapses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have replaced “fast and slow” by “fast-signaling and slow-plastic” to represent their functions and added explanation in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Off-target effects of pharmacological effects may be discussed. In this respect, bafilomycin experiments can be used to argue against the slow effects of vesicle cycling such as endocytosis, and vesicle mobilization. However, the effects on rapid vesicle mobilization cannot be excluded entirely. Because I cannot exclude the absence of off-target effects either (can be addressed by looking at single vesicle imaging at nano-scale, which is hard to do or looking at EM level quantitatively?), I feel this is a matter of discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is possible that Dynasore might have unknown or off-target effects. However, the main conclusion is backed up by Pitstop-2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Fig2 A2, B2 and Fig 4 A2 and B2. It is easier to plot the recovery only normalized to the initial value. Subtracting steady-state is somewhat confusing because the recovery looks faster after deeper depression, but this may be just apparent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have given values for both types of plots in Table 2, which indicates no essential difference in the recovery parameters.</p>

<p>Since blockers of intersectin downstream protein activity has no effect on vesicle endocytosis (Figure 3 and Sakaba et al, 2013), we called it (presynaptic) scaffold protein instead of endocytic scaffold protein.</p>

<p>Minor comments</p>
<p>Page 1, Title: I don't think the presented data address the role of the presynaptic scaffold in SV replenishment. In addition, 'SV replenishment' and 'site clearance' should not be used synonymously as it seems to be implied here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this study our focus was on the downstream activity of scaffold protein intersectin and since block of its downstream effector proteins CDC42 and actin activities do not obstruct the endocytic activity (Fig 3, and Sakaba et al., 2013), instead of naming it as “endocytic scaffold protein”, we adopted “presynaptic scaffold protein”.</p>
