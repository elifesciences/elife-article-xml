<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Bacterial membranes are complex and dynamic, arising from an array of evolutionary pressures. One enzyme that alters membrane compositions through covalent lipid modification is MprF. We recently identified that <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> MprF synthesizes lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG) from anionic PG, and a novel cationic lipid, lysyl-glucosyl-diacylglycerol (Lys-Glc-DAG), from neutral glycolipid Glc-DAG. This unexpected result prompted us to investigate whether Lys-Glc-DAG occurs in other MprF-containing bacteria, and whether other novel MprF products exist. Here, we studied protein sequence features determining MprF substrate specificity. First, pairwise analyses identified several streptococcal MprFs synthesizing Lys-Glc-DAG. Second, a restricted Boltzmann machine-guided approach led us to discover an entirely new substrate for MprF in <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, diglucosyl-diacylglycerol (Glc2-DAG), and an expanded set of organisms that modify glycolipid substrates using MprF. Overall, we combined the wealth of available sequence data with machine learning to model evolutionary constraints on MprF sequences across the bacterial domain, thereby identifying a novel cationic lipid.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lipids are ubiquitous and diverse group of hydrophobic and amphiphathic compounds that are critical for fundamental biological processes, including the formation of cell membranes, protection, and cargo delivery; energy storage; and cell signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. They are relatively smaller than other complex biomolecules, such as proteins, thereby allowing a larger portion of their surface to interact with other macromolecules. Chemical modifications to lipids, including changes in fatty acid tails (saturated and unsaturated) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], modifications of head groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], and alterations to lipid charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], impact these interactions, as well as the physicochemical properties of membranes. Commonly, bacteria synthesize lipids that are negatively charged or neutral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Some bacteria modify the negatively charged lipids with amino acids to make them positively charged to confer resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides and cationic antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The bacterial domain is a rich source of natural lipids that are likely co-evolved for specific interactions with host tissues and other cells, yet the full extent of this chemical diversity remains unexplored. Finding bacteria that possess unique lipids can be useful for biotechnology. For example, natural lipids found in bacteria can be used for drug delivery. A study by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] used low cytotoxic outer membrane vesicles (OMV) that contained a modified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to deliver siRNA to targeted cancer cells. This delivery mechanism had success and demonstrates the possibility of using naturally occurring bacterial lipids for future drug delivery processes to eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p>One enzyme responsible for modifying lipids in bacteria is the multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF). MprF modifies lipids through the transfer of amino acids from charged tRNAs to the head group of the anionic membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The MprF protein is comprised of two domains: an N-terminal flippase domain responsible for moving aminoacylated lipids from the inner membrane leaflet to the outer leaflet and a C-terminal synthase domain responsible for the aminoacyl transfer from tRNA to lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Recently, in <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> (Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, GBS) it was found that MprF can modify two different substrates with lysine (Lys) – the glycolipid glucosyl-diacylglycerol (Glc-DAG) and the phospholipid, PG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], generating Lys-Glc-DAG, as well as Lys-PG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). An <italic>S. agalactiae mprF</italic> deletion mutant no longer synthesizes Lys-Glc-DAG or Lys-PG and expression of <italic>S. agalactiae mprF</italic> in the heterologous host <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic> conferred Lys-Glc-DAG and Lys-PG synthesis to <italic>S. mitis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. This was the first time MprF was demonstrated to add lysine onto a neutral glycolipid (Glc-DAG).</p>

<p>The synthesis of Lys-Glc-DAG by <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> MprF illustrated a unique lipid substrate and product by the enzyme that had not been characterized before, highlighting the possibility for further exploration into unknown lipids and lipid substrates by MprF of different bacterial species. We sought to investigate the molecular determinants of enzyme specificity and identify other bacterial species that may have this novel specificity. This investigation led us from the standard methodology of BLASTp queries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], which are based on single residue amino acid substitution frequencies, to a more modern statistical method called a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], which captures global statistical patterns within natural sequence data. In this work, we develop a general strategy for combining this high-powered statistical model with lipidomic analysis to discover MprF variants with unique enzymatic activity. This process led us to the discovery of an uncharacterized lipid substrate for MprF, diglucosyl-diacylglycerol (Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG), which is present in several strains identified by the parameters of the statistical model. These models also provide interpretable and actionable information for use in further enzyme characterization, and we show that this application is a useful companion tool for experimental work.</p>

<title>Simple pairwise sequence statistics identify streptococcal MprF enzymes that synthesize Lys-Glc-DAG</title>
<p>Utilizing a method based on the amino acid sequence of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> MprF, we identified four streptococcal MprFs with high sequence identity to <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> COH1 MprF (WP 000733236.1). A BLASTp analysis found that <italic>Streptococcus sobrinus</italic> ATCC 27352 MprF (WP 019790557.1) had 61.4% amino acid identity to the <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> MprF, <italic>Streptococcus salivarius</italic> ATCC 7073 MprF (WP 002888893.1) had 43.09% amino acid identity, <italic>Streptococcus ferus</italic> MprF (WP 018030543.1) had 61.88% amino acid identity, and <italic>Streptococcus downei</italic> (WP 002997695.1) had 61.03% amino acid identity (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Plasmids were designed to express the <italic>S. sobrinus mprF</italic> (pSobrinus), <italic>S. salivarius mprF</italic> (pSalivarius), <italic>S. ferus mprF</italic> (pFerus), and <italic>S. downei mprF</italic> (pDownei) genes. The plasmids were transformed into the expression host <italic>S. mitis</italic> NCTC12261 (SM61). The empty vector (pABG5Δ <italic>phoZ</italic>, referred to as pABG5 here) was also transformed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). <italic>S. mitis</italic> does not natively encode <italic>mprF</italic> but synthesizes lipids (Glc-DAG; PG) that are substrates for <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> MprF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], making it an appropriate heterologous host for expressing streptococcal MprFs. Previously, a plasmid expressing <italic>S. agalactiae mprF</italic> (pGBSMprF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] was generated and transformed into <italic>S. mitis</italic>.

<title>Restricted Boltzmann Machines can provide sensitive, rational guidance for sequence classification</title>
<p>We set out to understand which specific MprF amino acid residues are involved in enzyme specificity for either the PG or Glc-DAG substrate. To this end, we employed a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), a probabilistic graphical model which aims to model the probability of data in a data set through statistical connections between the features of the data and a set of hidden units (weights) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. This class of models is closely related to another model, the Boltzmann Machine, which has been very successful in elucidating important residues in protein structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], one example being the careful tuning of enzyme specificity in bacterial two-component regulatory systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The Boltzmann Machine formulation from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], termed Direct-Coupling Analysis (DCA), stores patterns in the form of a pairwise coupling matrix and local field matrix (shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Equation 2</xref>), which has been useful in understanding how likely pairs of residues are to interact in physical space. We hypothesize that <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> MprF and other MprF enzymes that utilize glycolipid substrates have unique patterns of interacting residues relative to those enzymes that use only PG as a substrate.</p>
<p>While modeling how pairs of residues covary is powerful, many important features of enzyme function like allostery or enzyme specificity (which is the purpose of this analysis) may involve more than two residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], and in these situations it can be difficult to connect sets of residues using solely pairwise parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Therefore, a more global approach is required to address our hypothesis. To this end, a RBM has recently been developed for use in the learning of protein sequence data, with special attention given to producing a model which produces sparse, interpretable, and biologically meaningful representations of these higher-order statistical couplings within the hidden units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The design of this RBM (see the marginal distribution form shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Equation 3</xref>) allows the following useful properties: higher-order couplings between residues (sets of coupled residues instead of pairs); bimodal hidden unit outputs given the training data set (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref>); sparse, interpretable configurations of the weights (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>μ</italic></sub>) (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Equation 5</xref>) and a compositional representation of weights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], where input sequences are modeled largely through combinations of hidden units instead of single, highly activating units.</p>
<p>The compositional representation is a critical feature of this method, allowing us to find independently coupled sets of residues which in combination describe these protein sequences, and it is achieved through the particular choices of training parameters. More details on the training parameter choices are found in <italic>Methods and Materials</italic>. In particular, we focus on the scoring of sequences using individual weights <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>μ</italic></sub>:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="562061v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <bold>v</bold> is an input sequence vectorized through one-hot encoding, to produce an output score (a single number) which depends on the input sequence residues at position <italic>i</italic> and the value of the weight matrix for that residue at that position.</p>
<p>We used this methodology to study the sequences in the family of MprF, which is a large protein composed of independent flippase and synthase domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. In our analysis, we restrict ourselves to the cytosolic region (see yellow box in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>), also known as the aminoacyl-PG synthase domain, which constituted the Pfam family DUF2156 (now renamed LPG synthase C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. One weight in particular is highlighted, where we find bimodal activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>) of the hidden unit (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>) when <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref> is evaluated with the training sequences. Interpreting the sequence histograms, a positive value output in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> corresponds to a sequence containing combinations of the residues listed in the positive portion of the weight diagram in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, whereas a negative output corresponds to residues in the negative portion. For display purposes, the residues shown in all of our weights correspond to the positions where the magnitude of the visible positions <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>iμ</italic></sub> are greater than some threshold proportional to the largest magnitude position (position 212); the weight has values for all possible amino acids in the entire protein length, but they are considerably smaller than this threshold and generally very low.</p>

<title>RBM weights identify plausible sequence residues for functional characterization</title>
<p>After filtering the data set and training another model, we set out to find weights which could describe MprF specificity. To this end, we identify weights which are sparse, have high overall magnitude, and involve residues which could be plausibly linked to the lipid binding specificity (see Methods for more details). Through this search method we identified the two hidden units shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>. They both have high sparsity and high magnitude relative to the majority of other weights in the model, and importantly they correspond to residues localized to regions of the catalytic domain that had been previously identified through Autodock experiments using a PG molecule with side chains C5:0/C8:0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] (highlighted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). The scoring of the training set of sequences with these weights is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>, and we see a clear separation between the cytosolic domain sequences which produces Lys-Glc-DAG (from <italic>S. agalactiae</italic>) and two domain variants which produce only aminoacylated-PG (from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>B. licheniformis</italic>). Importantly, these output scores depend on a greatly reduced subset of the full sequence and do not correspond to clustering on total sequence identity (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Enterococcal MprF enzymes synthesize Lys-Glc-DAG, Lys-PG, and a novel cationic glycolipid Lys-Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG</title>
<p><italic>Enterococcus dispar</italic> ATCC 51266 was identified as a possible candidate for novel lipid synthesis through the analyses described above. Remarkably, our lipidomic analysis found that <italic>E. dispar</italic> synthesizes a novel cationic lipid, lysyl-diglucosyl(Glc<sub>2</sub>)-diacylglycerol (Lys-Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a,b</xref>), as well as Lys-Glc-DAG and Lys-PG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). The structural identification of Lys-Glc-<sub>2</sub>-DAG was supported by exact mass measurement ([M+H]<sup>+</sup> observed at <italic>m/z</italic> 1047.730; calculated <italic>m/z</italic> 1047.731) and tandem MS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>). Lys-Glc-<sub>2</sub>-DAG is unusually polar and charged for a lipid; chromatographically, Lys-Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG is highly retentive on a silica-based normal phase column and elutes off the column at the very end of the gradient (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). The use of an amino-based HPLC column led to much improved elution profiles for Lys-Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG and other glyco- and lysine lipids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>)</p>

<p>The discovery of Lys-Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG in <italic>Enterococcus dispar</italic> led us to analyze other <italic>Enterococcus</italic> strains: <italic>E. faecium</italic> 1,231,410, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> T11 and OG1RF <italic>E. gallinarium</italic> EG2, <italic>E. casseliflavus</italic> EC10, and <italic>E. raffinosus</italic> Er676. All <italic>Enterococcus</italic> strains examined were found to synthesize Lys-PG, Lys-Glc-DAG and Lys-Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG at varying levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). MprF-dependent Lys-PG production by <italic>E.faecalis</italic> and <italic>E. faecium</italic> was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], but cationic glycolipids production has not been previously reported. <italic>E. gallinarium</italic> EG2 and <italic>E. casseliflavus</italic> EC10 encode a single copy of <italic>mprF</italic> gene, while the other enterococci we tested encode two distinct <italic>mprF</italic> genes (<italic>mprF</italic> 1 and <italic>mprF</italic> 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. When these MprF sequence variants are plotted using our chosen RBM weights, we see that the two single copy strains plot in quadrant two (Q2), while for the two copy sequences, each MprF variant maps to separate coordinates (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). Both <italic>E. raffinosus</italic> Er676 MprF variants plot to quadrant two (with the lowest Weight 2 value being 0.34). The <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> variants have copies plotting directly in quadrant one and variants plotting farther out from the sequence cluster; we note that the two displaced variants are both lacking the characteristic aspartic acid and glutamic acid amino acids at positions 100 and 48 in the weights (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>), which are the dominant contributions for determining quadrant one occupancy. To clarify which variants were determinants of the novel cationic lipid production, lipidomic analysis on an <italic>E. faecalis</italic> OG1RF mini-mariner (EfaMarTn) transposon mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] with a transposon insertion within OG1RF 10760 <italic>mprF</italic> (referred to as <italic>mprF</italic> 2 in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]; OG1RF 10760::Tn) revealed that Lys-PG, Lys-Glc-DAG and the newly identified Lys-Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG were absent when the synthase domain of the gene was disrupted (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>, <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). This led us to the conclusion that <italic>E. faecalis mprF</italic> 2 is necessary for the synthesis of the three Lys-lipids in <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. When the empty vector (pABG5) was transformed into OG1RF 10760::Tn, no Lys-lipids synthesis was observed as expected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>). This phenotype was complemented by expression of <italic>E. faecalis mprF</italic> 2 from a plasmid (pOGMprF2) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>). Additionally, expression of <italic>E. faecium mprF1</italic> (EFTG 00601) (pEfMprF1) restored Lys-PG and Lys-Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG synthesis to the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> OG1RF 10760::Tn strain (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>), while <italic>E. faecium mprF2</italic> (EFTG 02430) did not rescue Lys-lipid synthesis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7f</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that <italic>E. faecalis</italic> MprF2 (OG1RF 10760) and <italic>E. faecium</italic> MprF1 (EFTG 00601), like <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> MprF, act on both phospholipid and glycolipids substrates, additionally synthesizing the novel cationic glycolipid, Lys-Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG.</p>

<title>Weight 2 is correlated with Glc<sub><italic>N</italic></sub>-DAG substrate activity in MprF</title>
<p>When we started our RBM analysis, we had substrate specificity information for only the quadrants one and three, and through identifying the novel substrate in <italic>E. dispar</italic> we expanded our testing to quadrant two by testing <italic>Enterococcus</italic> strains.

We conducted lipid analysis on <italic>Ligilactobacillus salivarius</italic> ATCC 11741, <italic>Levilactobacillus brevis</italic> ATCC 14869, <italic>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</italic> ATCC 7469, <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> ATCC 393, and <italic>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</italic> ATCC 25302.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The utilization of the <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> MprF amino acid sequence as a query for BLASTp was a simple method to identify various streptococcal MprFs and further our understanding of MprF specificity. This allowed us to identify three MprFs that can synthesize the highly cationic Lys-Glc-DAG. Importantly, although highly similar to <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> MprF, this method did not identify other streptococcal MprFs capable of lysine addition to both glycolipid and phospholipid substrates (generating Lys-Glc-DAG and Lys-PG) nor did it lead to the identification of a novel cationic glycolipid found in <italic>Enterococcus</italic>. Sequence logos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] may identify important sequence features, but largely in instances where amino acids are highly conserved. When amino acids must interact to produce a specific function, yet the exact identity of those amino acids is not a requirement, methods which model the strength of amino acid coevolution in sequence sets can find important signals which in the sequence logo might appear to be negligible. For this reason we used the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], which can model statistical connectivity of residues at multiple sites in the protein sequence.</p>
<p>The RBM can be used in a number of ways to study sequence data. Firstly, it allowed us to filter the sequence data using hidden units (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>); the two weights which formed the basis of our specificity analysis were not found in models trained on the Pfam dataset when it was initially pulled from Pfam, and this was potentially due to the presence of sequences without relevant catalytic function adding noise to the dataset. The most prominent feature for our purposes is the ability to use the hidden units learned through RBM training to classify sequences. The bimodal nature of this particular model provides a relatively simple interpretation which is straightforward to use for prediction. We show in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> that the combination of clustering and interpretable weight structure allows us to identify a small subset of residues within a structure, grounding our statistical clustering in MprF’s structural features. The combination of experimental evidence and evolutionary information provided a strong rationale for selecting organisms for further study, ultimately leading to the discovery of novel cationic lipid biosynthesis in <italic>Enterococcus dispar</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>One goal of this study was to find the structural determinants of Glc<sub><italic>N</italic></sub>-DAG activity by MprF, and we found that Weight 2 from our RBM analysis was predictive of this. However, there are notable exceptions such as the <italic>E. faecium</italic> allele EGTF 00601, which has sequence features placing it in quadrant one yet has Glc<sub><italic>N</italic></sub>-DAG activity. Therefore, identifying the exact sequence determinants of Glc<sub><italic>N</italic></sub>-DAG specificity remains to be fully elucidated. One explanation could be our exclusion of the N-terminal flippase domain and the non-cytosolic region of the C-terminal domain in the RBM analysis, where important residue interactions determining specificity could occur and is under further investigation. Additionally, a challenge in experimental validation will be to standardize the method of studying <italic>mprF</italic> alleles from diverse organisms. When using native organisms, lipids produced may vary during the growth phase of the organisms, the media they are grown in, and whether a membrane stressor is present (i.e. inducible production of specific lipids). For this study we used stationary phase cultures of equal volume and bacteria were grown in their respective standard laboratory media. The use of a heterologous host for expression of <italic>mprF</italic> alleles is a method of standardization, but may result in not identifying novel lipids that would be found in their native bacteria since the appropriate lipid substrates may not be present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. A combination of both approaches (native organisms and heterologous hosts) may be required. Ultimately, mutational studies of the residues identified by the RBM will allow for identification of the residues critical for specificity, though likely the residues will depend in part on the primary sequence being altered.</p>
<p>The general method of RBM-guided exploration has applications in enzyme design, for example, in enhancing methods like directed evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Concretely, the residues identified through weights can be thought of as templates for mutational exploration, greatly reducing the search space for assessing which residues are critical for specificity determination. Enzymes like MprF that produce lipids of modified charge have potential applications in biotechnology and therapeutics, where the design of lipid nanoparticles with different charge and chemical properties of the head group have important physiological implications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Notably, the identification of Lys-Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG opens new research avenues, particularly in the fields of antibiotic resistance and host-pathogen interactions, wherein lipid modification and cationic lipids play key roles. With respect to human health, it would be relevant to investigate whether Lys-Glc<sub>2</sub>-DAG plays a role in enterococcal resistance to the last-line membrane-active antibiotic, daptomycin.</p>

Gibson assemblies were completed using a 2x HI-FI Assembly master mix following the manufacturer’s protocol (New England Biolabs). PCR clean-up was done using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per manufacturer protocol. Plasmid extractions were performed per manufacturer protocol using the GeneJET Plasmid miniprep kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All plasmid constructs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing at the Massachusetts General Hospital CCIB DNA Core facility or by Illumina sequence at SeqCenter. DNA concentrations were measured using Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Quibit 2.0 (Invitrogen by Life Technologies). Optical Density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600<italic>nm</italic></sub>) was measured in a disposable cuvette (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Genesys 30).</p>

<title>Acidic Bligh-Dyer Lipid Extractions</title>
<p>Bacteria were grown for approximately 16 hours overnight in 15 mL of an appropriate culture medium. After growth, OD<sub>600<italic>nm</italic></sub> measurements were taken, and cells were pelleted at 4,280 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature in a Sorvall RC6+ centrifuge. The supernatant was tipped out, and the cell pellet was washed and resuspended in 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). The cells were pelleted again, and all the supernatant was aspirated out. The cell pellet was stored at −80°C until lipid extraction. An acidic Bligh-Dyer lipid extraction was performed as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 0.8 mL of 1x Dulbecco’s PBS (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were transferred to a 9 mL glass tube with a Teflon-lined cap (Pyrex). 1 mL chloroform (MilliporeSigma) and 2 mL methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to create the single-phase Bligh-Dyer. Tubes were vortexed every 5 minutes for 20 minutes, then centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred to a new 9 mL glass tube. 100 <italic>μ</italic>L of Hydrochloric acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added followed by 1 mL of chloroform and 0.9 mL of 1x Dulbecco’s PBS to create the two-phase Bligh-Dyer. Tubes were gently mixed and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature. After centrifuging, the bottom layer was extracted to a new tube and dried under nitrogen gas and stored at −80°C prior to lipidomic analysis. Lipid analyses were repeated in biological triplicate aside, from OG1RF 10760::Tn extractions, which were performed once.</p>

<title>Analysis of lysine lipids by an amino column-based Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI MS): A new method</title>
<p>An amino column-based normal phase LC-ESI MS was performed using an Agilent 1200 Quaternary LC system coupled to a high-resolution TripleTOF5600 mass spectrometer (Sciex, Framingham, MA). A Unison UK-Amino column (3 <italic>μ</italic>m, 25 cm × 2 mm) (Imtakt USA, Portland, OR) was used. Mobile phase A consisted of chloroform/methanol/aqueous ammonium hydroxide (800:195:5, v/v/v). Mobile phase B consisted of chloroform/methanol/water/ aqueous ammonium hydroxide (600:340:50:5, v/v/v/v). Mobile phase C consisted of chloroform/methanol/water/aqueous ammonium hydroxide (450:450:95:5, v/v/v/v). The elution program consisted of the following: 100% mobile phase A was held isocratically for 2 min and then linearly increased to 100% mobile phase B over 8 min and held at 100% B for 5 min. The LC gradient was then changed to 100% mobile phase C over 1 min and held at 100% C for 3 min, and finally returned to 100% A over 0.5 min and held at 100% A for 3 min. The total LC flow rate was 300 <italic>μ</italic>l/min. The MS settings were as follows: Ion spray voltage (IS) = 5000 V, Curtain gas (CUR) = 20 psi, Ion source gas 1 (GS1) = 20 psi, De-clustering potential (DP) = 50 V, and Focusing Potential (FP) = 150 V. Nitrogen was used as the collision gas for MS/MS experiments. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Analyst TF1.5 software (Sciex, Framingham, MA).</p>

<title>Boltzmann Machines and Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Protein Sequences</title>
<sec id="s4f1">
<title>Formulation of models</title>
<p>The Boltzmann Machine, as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], is defined as:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="562061v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which is a probability distribution defined on the pairwise interactions (the couplings <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>) between the positions (<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>) in an input sequence (<bold>v</bold>) and a local field term <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. The pairwise coupling matrix is akin to a covariance matrix, and the local fields are similar to single site frequency measures.</p>
<p>The joint probability distribution of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] is as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="562061v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Here, the vector <bold>v</bold> again represents the input sequence data, <italic>g</italic>(<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) is a local field which controls the conditional probability of the input data, <italic>𝒰</italic><sub><italic>μ</italic></sub> is the hidden unit potential/activation, and the terms <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>iμ</italic></sub>(<italic>v</italic>) couple the input variables with the hidden unit variables. In this way, interactions between residues are mediated by a relatively smaller set of hidden units which do not interact directly with each other, leading to a bipartite structure as opposed to the Boltzmann machine’s fully connected pair based formulation.</p>
<p>Particularly important is the potential function <italic>𝒰</italic>, which in this work is the dRELU function defined as:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="562061v2_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The four parameters <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>μ,±</italic></sub>, <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>μ,±</italic></sub> are learned through the inference procedure, and allow the positive and negative components of the weights <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>μ</italic></sub> to be separately gated, which allows learning of bimodal distributions for the output <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>μ</italic></sub>. Another key feature is the sparsity regularization on the weights applied during model inference:
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="562061v2_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>q</italic> is the number of amino acids plus a gap character (21) and the hyperparameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="562061v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> can be increased to induce sparsity and lower weight magnitude. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equations 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">5</xref> together guide the representation of the hidden units to bimodal outputs with interpretable features.</p>

<title>Dataset acquisition and preprocessing</title>
<p>Multiple sequence alignment used for model training was the DUF2156 domain acquired from Pfam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] (in later revisions renamed LPG synthase C). Starting with this MSA, it was processed to include only amino acid characters and gaps, excluding sequences with ambiguous or non-standard characters. Additionally, sequences with contiguous strings of gaps greater than 20% of the full sequence’s length were removed. This left 11,507 sequences with a length of 298. After the data cleaning process described in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, a total of 7,890 sequences were used to train our final model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f3">
<title>Model training</title>
<p>The model previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] was utilized, specifically the Python 2.7 version freely available on Github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jertubiana/ProteinMotifRBM">https://github.com/jertubiana/ProteinMotifRBM</ext-link>). Extensive testing of the combinations of the number of hidden units, <italic>L</italic>2<italic>/L</italic>1 regularization, and learning rate were performed. Models were trained in triplicate with different random seeds, as the training procedure converges to slightly different weight values depending on their initial random configuration. Training was considered successful when the model consistently produced similar sets of weights across different random seeds, and the weights had the previously mentioned sparsity and magnitude indicating compositional representation. The final model used in this work was trained for 2000 epochs with a learning rate of 0.1, a learning rate decay of 0.33, <italic>L</italic>2<italic>/L</italic>1 parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="562061v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> set to 1.0, and 300 hidden units.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f4">
<title>Model Weight selection</title>
<p>To find weights which were relevant to function we computed the <italic>L</italic>1 norm of each weight individually, then ranked them. The weights with the largest magnitude were looked at first, and these were typically the sparsest of all weights. Weights were chosen which involved sequence coordinates implicated in our function of interest. Specifically, locations identified through Autodock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] where the lipid was likely to interact, and a small radius around this region to select a small set of coordinates.</p>

<p>This study reports <bold>important</bold> findings on identifying sequence motifs that predict substrate specificity in a class of lipid synthesis enzymes. It sheds light on a mechanism used by bacteria to modify the lipids in their membrane to develop antibiotic resistance. The evidence is <bold>convincing</bold>, with a careful application of machine learning methods, validated by mass spectrometry-based lipid anlaysis experiments. This interdisciplinary study will be of interest to computational biologists and to the community working on lipids and on enzymes involved in lipid synthesis or modification.</p>

<p>The basic approach is that the authors first train an RBM on all MprF sequences, and then use this analysis to identify a subset of the family that catalyzes the addition of amino acids to PG. Then a second RBM is trained on this subset.</p>
<p>In the initial RBM training a particular hidden unit is identified that has a sparse and bimodal activation in response to the input sequences. The contribution of individual resides is shown in Figure 3c, which highlights one of the strengths of this RBM implementation - it is interpretable in a physically meaningful way. However, there are several decisions here, the justification of which is not entirely clear.</p>
<p>i) Some of the residues in Fig 3c are stated as &quot;relevant&quot; for aminoacylated PG production. But is this the only such hidden unit? Or are there others that are sparse, bimodal, and involve &quot;relevant&quot; AA?</p>
<p>
ii) In order to filter the sequences for the second stage, only those that produce an activation over +2.0 in this particular hidden unit were taken. How was this choice made?</p>
<p>
iii) How many sequences are in the set before and after this filtering? On the basis of the strength of the results that follow I expect that there are good reasons for these choices, but they should be more carefully discussed.</p>
<p>
iv) Do the authors think that this gets all of the aminoacylated PG enzymes? Or are some missed?</p>
<p>The authors show that they can classify members of the family by training a second RBM on the filtered sequences. They do this by identifying two hidden unit activations in particular (Figure 5b) which seem to be useful for determining lipid substrate specificity, and they test several variants that obtain different responses of these two hidden units by experimentally determining what lipids they produce (Table 2). However, some similar criticisms from the last point occur here as well, namely the selection of which weights should be used to classify the enzymes' function. Again the approach is to identify hidden unit activations that are sparse (with respect to the input sequence), have a high overall magnitude, and &quot;involve residues which could be plausibly linked to the lipid binding specificity.&quot;</p>
<p>i) Two hidden units are identified as useful for classification, but how many candidates are there that pass the first two criteria? Indeed, how many hidden units are there?</p>
<p>
ii) The criterion &quot;involve residues which could be plausibly linked to the lipid binding specificity&quot; is again vague. Do all of the other candidate hidden units *not* involve significant contributions from substrate-binding residues? Maybe one of the other units does a better job of discriminating substrate specificity. (As indicated in Figure 8, there are examples of enzymes that confound the proposed classification.) Why combine the activations of two units for the classification, instead of 1 or 3 or...?</p>

<p>In &quot;Lipid discovery enabled by sequence statistics and machine learning&quot; Christensen et al. address an important question: how can bacteria modify lipid charges to produce cationic lipids, prone to confer resistance to cationic antibiotics? One of the enzymes involved in this process is MprF, which can, through the transfer of amino acids, in particular, lysine, from charged tRNA modify the charge of anionic membrane phospholipid from negative to positive. Recent works have shown that MprF can also modify another substrate, glycolipid glucosyl-diacylglycerol, which is neutral. These findings immediately raise two questions: what are the determinants in the MrpF sequence controlling the lipid substrates it can modify? Are there other substrates for MrpF, so far unknown?</p>
<p>Christensen et al. address both of these questions in an elegant way, combining sequence analysis with machine-learning methods and experimental characterisation of the enzymatic products through mass spectrometry. Using restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), an unsupervised architecture extracting statistical features from the sequence data, they identify putative amino-acid motifs along the MprF sequences possibly related to the substrate identity, select some bacterial species whose wild-type sequence contains those motifs, and validate the biological role of the motifs by identifying the produced lipids. Remarkably, with this approach, the authors find a novel cationic lipid with two glucosyl groups.</p>
<p>Besides these new results on MrpF and its operation, the present work is appealing, as it shows that the functional characterisation of a very small number of proteins (here, three!) combined with the guided classification of homologous sequence data with appropriate machine-learning methods can lead to the discovery of new functionalities.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
After the previous identification that the Streptococcus agalactiae MprF enzyme can synthesize also lysyl-glucosyl-diacylglycerol (Lys-Glc-DAG), besides the already known lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG), the authors aim for the current manuscript was to investigate the molecular determinants of MprF lipid substrate specificity in a variety of bacterial species.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- In general, the manuscript is well constructed and easy to follow, especially taking into account the multidisciplinary aspect of it (computational machine learning combined with lipid biology).</p>
<p>
-The added value of the Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) approach, in comparison to standard computational pairwise sequence statistics, becomes evident. This is exemplified by a successful, although not perfect, classification and categorization of MprF activity.</p>
<p>
- The MS analysis (monoisotopic mass, plus fragmentation pattern), convincingly shows the identification of a novel lipid species Lys-Glc2-DAG.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
-In many of the analyzed strains, the presence of the lipid species Lys-PG, Lys-Glc-DAG, and Lys-Glc2-DAG is correlated to the presence of the MprF enzyme(s), but one should keep in mind that a multitude of other membrane proteins are present that in theory could be involved in the synthesis as well. Therefore, there is no direct evidence that the MprF enzymes are linked to the synthesis of these lipid species. Although, it is unlikely that other enzymes are involved, this weakens the connection between the observed lipids and the type of MprF.</p>
<p>
-Related to this, in a few cases MprF activity is tested, but the manuscript does not contain any information on protein expression levels. Heterologous expression of membrane proteins is in general challenging and due to various reasons, proteins end up not being expressed at all. As an example, the absence of activity for the E. faecalis MprF1 and E. faecium MprF2 could very well be explained by the entire absence of the protein.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors largely achieved their goals, as the applied RBM approach led to specific sequence determinants in MprF enzymes that could categorize the specificity of these enzymes. The experimental data could largely confirm this categorization, although a stronger connection between synthesized lipids and enzyme activity would have further strengthened the observations.</p>
<p>The work now focuses only on MprF enzymes, but could in theory be expanded to other categories of lipid-synthesizing enzymes. In other words, the RBM approach could have an impact on the lipid synthesis field, if it would be a tool that is easily applicable. Moreover, the lipids synthesized by MprF (Lys-PG, but also other cationic lipids) play an important role in bacterial resistance against certain antibiotics.</p>
