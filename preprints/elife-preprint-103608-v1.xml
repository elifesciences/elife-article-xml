<title>Abstract</title><p>Evidence indicates that transposable elements (TEs) can contribute to the evolution of new traits, despite often being considered deleterious. In vertebrates, some KRAB-ZNF proteins repress TEs, offering genomic protection. Notably, KRAB-ZNF genes evolve rapidly and exhibit diverse expression patterns in primate brains, where TEs remain active. This prompts questions about their interactions in primate brains and potential roles in human brain evolution and disease. For a systematic comparative analysis of TE interactions with other genes, we developed the tool TEKRABber, and focused on strong and experimentally validated cases. Our bipartite network analysis revealed significantly more interactions between KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs in humans than in other primates, especially with recently evolved, i.e. Simiiformes specific, TEs. Notably, ZNF528, under positive selection in humans, shows numerous human-specific TE interactions. Most negative interactions in our network, indicative of repression by KRAB-ZNF proteins, entail Alu TEs, while links to other TEs are generally positive. In Alzheimer’s patients, a subnetwork involving 21 interactions with an Alu module appears diminished or lost. Our findings suggest that KRAB-ZNF and TE interactions vary across TE families, have increased throughout human evolution, and may influence susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive DNA sequences capable of migrating and inserting into new locations within the host genome. When transposed, TEs may induce phenotypic changes in the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bourque et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schrader and Schmitz 2019</xref>). One well-known textbook example is the development of an industrial melanization mutant phenotype in the British peppered moth, <italic>Biston betularia</italic>, which has been linked to increased expression of the <italic>cort</italic> transcript due to a TE insertion in its first intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hof et al. 2016</xref>). Another classic example for primate evolution is the retrovirus insertion in the salivary amylase gene, <italic>AMY1C</italic>, with this sequence being essential for primates to evolve as one of the few mammals capable of expressing amylase in saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Ting et al. 1992</xref>). A further recent example is the evolutionary loss of tails in humans and apes, which is associated with the insertion of an Alu retrotransposon into the intron region of the <italic>TBXT</italic> gene. This insertion creates an alternative splice site with an ancestral Alu retrotransposon in the sequence, leading to the excision of the middle exon and the formation of an isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Xia et al. 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>TEs comprise one third to one half of the mammalian genome and are not randomly distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Platt et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Qu et al. 2023</xref>). In fact, some TE insertions can be deleterious such as the insertion of an L1 element initiating colorectal cancer in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Scott et al. 2016</xref>). Therefore, a variety of host factors are employed to regulate TE expression, such as small RNAs, chromatin and DNA modification pathways, and KRAB zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Colonna Romano and Fanti 2022</xref>). KRAB-ZNF proteins are the largest family of transcription factors in higher vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Huntley et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ecco et al. 2017</xref>), characterized by fast evolution and contributing to gene expression differences between primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nowick et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nowick et al. 2013</xref>). KRAB-ZNF proteins bind to the interspersed DNA sequences of TEs and repress their expression upon recruiting the cofactor KAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Groner et al. 2010</xref>). Fast evolution was also reported for TEs, which led to hypothesizing an evolutionary arms-race model, in which mutated TEs have the chance to escape the repression from KRAB-ZNF proteins until the KRAB-ZNF proteins evolve again with a suitable recognition ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jacobs et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Imbeault et al. 2017</xref>). For instance, in primates, coevolution between a family of TEs, retroelements in endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), and the evolving tandem repeats in KRAB-ZNF genes has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Thomas and Schneider 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Studying the expression of KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs in the evolution of the human brain has crucial relevance, since some TEs are actively transcribed in the development of the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bodea et al. 2018</xref>), including L1 subfamilies, and primate-specific Alu subfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hancks and Kazazian 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Larsen et al. 2018</xref>). Furthermore, TE-derived promoters play a role in gene transcription within the human brain, which in turn suggests the significance of TEs in gene regulation during neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Playfoot et al. 2021</xref>). Interestingly, a substantial number of differentially expressed primate-specific KRAB-ZNF genes were detected in the adult prefrontal cortex, comparing humans to chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nowick et al. 2009</xref>) and newly evolved KRAB-ZNF genes were predominantly detected in the developing human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhang et al. 2011</xref>). Therefore, analyzing the interplay between TEs and KRAB-ZNF genes in the context of primate brain evolution could provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms shaping human brain development and function.</p>
<p>The dysregulation of TE expression has also been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the primary cause of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Ravel-Godreuil et al. 2021</xref>). One of the biomarkers of AD, the Tau protein, appears to induce the expression of at least some TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Guo et al. 2018</xref>), and the presence of TE products in the cytosol and endosomes induces neuroinflammation in AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Evering et al. 2023</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that cognitive skills are related to zinc finger genes and proteins. For instance, patients carrying the schizophrenia-risk allele of <italic>ZNF804A</italic> showed differences in their reading and spelling performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Becker et al. 2012</xref>). Lead poisoning causes lead ions to compete with zinc ions in zinc finger proteins, affecting proteins such as DNMT1, which are related to the progression of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ordemann and Austin 2016</xref>). Additionally, the single nucleotide polymorphism of a KRAB-ZNF gene, <italic>ZNF224</italic>, is associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shulman et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the study of the regulatory networks involving KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs is expected to provide insights into the evolution of the human brain and the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we present results from two independent RNA-seq datasets: one comparing different brain regions between humans and multiple non-human primates (NHPs) (Primate Brain Data), and the other comparing human control samples with AD samples (Mayo Data). These datasets collectively encompass a total of 514 samples from different species, brain regions, and disease states. Since it is very challenging to quantify and normalize expression of TEs for across species comparison, we developed the TEKRABber R package for the systematic and comparative analysis of TE subfamilies (abbreviated as TEs in the following content). TEKRABber can further be used to explore expression correlations between TEs and any genes in any species of interest. Here we used it to explore correlations with KRAB-ZNF genes in primates. Our work reveals an intricate network of TEs and KRAB-ZNF genes in the brain that changed during evolution and is modified in AD brains.</p>

<title>TEKRABber: A software for cross-species comparative analysis of orthologs, TEs, and their co-expression</title>
<p>While computational tools for the analysis of TE expression in samples of a given species have already been developed (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), to our knowledge no tool exists yet that can compare TE expression across species, hampering the investigation of the impact of TEs on species evolution. Whereas the expression of orthologous genes can be compared between closely related species relatively easily, this task is more challenging for TEs, because the same TEs can be located in different regions on chromosomes and have different sequence lengths. Additionally, differences in the copy number of TEs between species can further complicate these comparisons. To gain functional evolutionary insights, it is further desired to estimate pairwise correlations between TEs and genes, which can be used to derive and compare regulatory networks involving TEs across species. We are aware of one method, TEffectR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Karakülah et al. 2019</xref>), that by providing mapping BAM files and specific locus regions, can be used for calculating TE and gene expression. Using a linear regression model with TE expression values it subsequently predicts the impact of the TE on proximal gene expression in one species. However, it is not designed for contrasting correlations between pairwise orthologous genes and TEs across species directly from RNA-seq expression data. To better enable evolutionary studies on TEs, we developed an R Bioconductor software called TEKRABber (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.TEKRABber">10.18129/B9.bioc.TEKRABber</ext-link>). As a first use case for this new software, we investigated the interplay between TEs and KRAB-ZNF proteins, which can repress TE expression; hence the name TEKRABber. In a broader scope, TEKRABber addresses two primary challenges: comparing TE expression across species and efficiently calculating pairwise correlations between selected orthologous genes and TEs. With these features it provides functionality not yet implemented in other tools (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It can also be used for exploring correlations of TEs with any other genes in any other species with genomes with TE annotations.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>TEKRABber is designed to handle various types of transcriptomic read counts and offers two distinct modes of analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In the first mode, tailored for interspecies comparison, we utilized the Primate Brain Data as a demonstration. Initially, it retrieves annotations from Ensembl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Harrison et al. 2024</xref>) for orthologs and from RepeatMasker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Smit et al. 2013</xref>) for TEs to estimate normalizing factors, ensuring comparable expression levels between species. This approach minimizes the likelihood that differences in fold change for differential expression are caused by TE or gene length variations. It also guarantees that only orthologs and TEs with high orthology confidence are included in the comparison, avoiding bias toward any particular species (<xref rid="d1e1571" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). Subsequently, users can employ the output data object to conduct differential expression (DE) analysis and identify one-to-one correlations based on selected parameters. We demonstrate that the impact of scaling is most pronounced for comparisons between the most distantly related species in our study, with about 30% of TEs being detected as DE or not between humans and rhesus macaques, depending on whether the expression data were scaled or not for the comparison (<xref rid="d1e1571" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). Notably, TEKRABber (from version 1.8, Bioc3.19) includes a parallel computing option, significantly enhancing computational efficiency based on the number of cores a device can provide. The second mode is designed for comparing different conditions, such as control and disease states within the same species. In this scenario, we used the Mayo Data as an example. Users can bypass the interspecies normalization steps and directly generate data objects for differential expression and correlation analyses. Furthermore, TEKRABber offers an interactive user interface, providing users with an initial overview of their results before delving into the details (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>In our study, we used TEKRABber to explore the putative functional connections between KRAB-ZNFs and TEs in the context of human brain evolution and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We conducted an analysis of KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs expression patterns and networks using two independent RNA-seq datasets: Primate Brain Data and Mayo Data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="d1e1564" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S1-S3</xref>). The Primate Brain Data contains genome-wide expression information from 33 brain regions classified into seven groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Khrameeva et al. 2020</xref>) of four primate species, while the Mayo Data includes data from two brain regions (temporal cortex and cerebellum) of AD patients and controls. In brief, expression of all genes and TEs was quantified and normalized across samples of each dataset, and subsequently differential expression and correlations between KRAB-ZNFs and TEs were calculated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Dynamics of expression across species and brain regions: Strong species differences especially of evolutionary young KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs</title>
<p>We obtained normalized expression values of KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs and assessed their variance across different species using t-SNE clustering (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The data labeled by species revealed distinct boundaries of variance, demonstrating clustering based on species. Specifically, humans and macaques formed their own clusters, while chimpanzees and bonobos were grouped in the same cluster, which agrees with phylogenetic distances among species. This finding indicated that clear differences in KRAB-ZNF genes and TE expression can be detected across species. For example, there were 12 upregulated and 42 downregulated KRAB-ZNF genes, along with 31 upregulated and 22 downregulated TEs in humans compared to chimpanzees in the primary and secondary cortices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; see <xref rid="d1e1564" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref> for information on Brodmann areas included in the group “primary and secondary cortices”). In contrast to the clear species differences, expression patterns of KRAB-ZNFs and TEs differed less across brain regions within the same species.</p>

<p>Certain TEs are primate-specific and have been extensively used in phylogenetic studies. For example, a subset of recently evolved Alu subfamilies is found only in Simiiformes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Xing et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Williams et al. 2010</xref>). We next investigated whether expression patterns differ between Simiiformes specific KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs (called evolutionary <bold>young</bold> from here on), and KRAB-ZNFs and TEs that have also orthologs outside Simiiformes (called evolutionary <bold>old</bold> from here on). To this end, we dated these genomic elements and classified them into the two groups based on their inferred evolutionary age (see methods). The old group consists of 234 KRAB-ZNF genes and 955 TEs that evolved prior to the emerge of Simiiformes (&gt; 44.2 million years ago (mya)), while the young group consists of 103 KRAB-ZNF genes and 309 TEs that evolved less than 44.2 mya (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <bold>S2</bold> and <bold>S3</bold>). We first found that the young KRAB-ZNFs and young TEs exhibited significantly lower expression levels across all brain regions, regardless of species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <bold>S4</bold>). Next, there were proportionally more young KRAB-ZNF genes and young TEs differentially expressed between humans and chimpanzees compared to old KRAB-ZNF genes and old TEs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The same holds true when comparing humans to all NHPs, implying that young TEs and young KRAB-ZNFs are still more dynamically changed between different primates.</p>
<p>We further investigated if there are KRAB-ZNFs and TEs that are specifically changed in humans compared to the three NHPs. We detected 36 such KRAB-ZNF genes and 18 such TEs in the primary and secondary cortices. KRAB-ZNFs showed a trend towards more downregulation in humans, such as <italic>ZNF337</italic> and <italic>ZNF394</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Unlike this trend, some KRAB-ZNFs linked to cognitive disorders were human specifically upregulated, e.g. <italic>ZNF778</italic>, a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorder and cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Willemsen et al. 2010</xref>), and <italic>ZNF267</italic>, which is upregulated in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Patel et al. 2021</xref>). TEs tended to be more upregulated in humans compared to NHP. On the other hand, the LTR12B subfamily is one of the most downregulated TEs in humans. LTR12-related endogenous retrovirus subfamilies had been reported to be repressed by ZNF676 and ZNF728 in early human development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Iouranova et al. 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Changes in correlations between TEs and KRAB-ZNF genes: Increased connectivity in the human brain co-expression network with an enrichment for evolutionary young correlations</title>
<p>To systematically analyze the putative functional relationships between TEs and KRAB-ZNF genes, we conducted pairwise Pearson’s correlation analysis using normalized expression levels in seven clustered brain regions (<xref rid="d1e1564" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Khrameeva et al., 2020</xref>). We first analyzed the human samples. There were 324 KRAB-ZNFs and 895 TEs expressed in Primate Brain Data. In humans, we found 100,987 positive and 26,810 negative significant correlations between TEs and KRAB-ZNFs in the primary and secondary cortices and 38,295 positive and 11,475 negative significant correlations in the limbic and association cortices (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01), while the other clusters have fewer or no correlations detected (<xref rid="d1e1564" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). We will thus mainly focus on the primary and secondary cortices and the limbic and association cortices for our subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>The numbers of correlations between TEs and KRAB-ZNFs are significantly more than expected by chance, as gauged by repeating the correlation analysis with randomly picked genes and TEs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; see Methods; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="d1e1571" ref-type="fig">&gt;S5</xref>), indicating that putative functional relationships between TEs and KRAB-ZNFs can be detected in the data. The high number of positive correlations might be surprising, given that KRAB-ZNFs are considered to repress TEs. However, the dataset contains in general more positive correlations, even when choosing random genes, and KRAB-ZNFs still have more negative correlations to TEs than random genes.</p>

<p>To remove weak correlations, we set a threshold with absolute correlation coefficients greater than 0.4 and adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value below 0.01 (Benjamini-Hochberg correction) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="d1e1571" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>). In addition, we sought for independent experimental confirmation of our detected putative relationships by overlapping the correlations with experimental ChIP-exo data obtained from KRAB-ZNF proteins in human embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Imbeault et al. 2017</xref>). Note that although ChIP-exo was performed in different cell types than the brain samples we analyzed, the overlap was significant by calculating their Jaccard similarity (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This result supports that our correlations have significantly captured the interplay between TEs and KRAB-ZNFs. Focusing on the ChIP-exo confirmed correlations, we obtained 869 correlations in the primary and secondary cortices and 399 correlations in limbic and association cortices. Of those, 201 positive correlations and 166 negative correlations overlapped between these two brain region groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>To better understand the complexity of the interactions between TEs and KRAB-ZNFs, we represented the one-to-one pairwise correlations of TE and KRAB-ZNF (denoted as TE:KRAB-ZNF in the following content) in a bipartite network. In this bipartite network, nodes belong to one of two classes, TEs or KRAB-ZNFs, and only links between nodes of different classes are present. Our bipartite network of human primary and secondary cortices reveals 354 nodes connected by 869 links (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) and the human limbic and association cortices have 247 nodes with 399 links (<xref rid="d1e1571" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7</xref>). To identify the hubs in the network, we first calculated their normalized degree distributions, considering the unequal numbers of TEs and KRAB-ZNFs. Our analysis revealed that KRAB-ZNF nodes connect to more TEs than TE nodes connect to KRAB-ZNFs, indicating that KRAB-ZNF nodes are more likely to act as hubs with higher connectivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). For investigating the structure of the network, we calculated the bipartite modularities based on the correlation coefficients. Our finding revealed that the network of the primary and secondary cortices is clustered into 5 modules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), while the network of the limbic and association cortices clusters into 13 modules (<xref rid="d1e1571" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
<p>We divided TE:KRAB-ZNF into evolutionary young and old, calling a correlation as <bold>young</bold> when one of the nodes is evolutionary young and <bold>old</bold> when both nodes are evolutionary old (<xref rid="d1e1571" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>). Taking also the correlation coefficients into account, all links can be classified into four categories: positive-old (P-O), positive-young (P-Y), negative-old (N-O) and negative-young (N-Y). We found that the links are non-randomly distributed in the network. In particular, Alu, ERV1, ERVK, ERVL, L1, TcMar-Tigger, and SVA have significantly different interactions with KRAB-ZNF than the other TE subfamilies (Chi-squared test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). For example, in a module with Alu subfamilies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), we observed that most of the correlations specifically belong to N-Y, while SVA had many P-Y correlations with KRAB-ZNFs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we compared the TE:KRAB-ZNF between species and only considered the 178 KRAB-ZNFs and 836 TEs, which were expressed in all four species. Since the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Khrameeva et al. 2020</xref>) included four human individuals but only three individuals per NHP species, we performed a leave-one-out analysis of the human samples. For a fair comparison across species, we required that a correlation between KRAB-ZNFs and TEs in humans needed to be significantly detected in all human leave-one-out combinations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="d1e1564" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). We then repeated our test of whether KRAB-ZNFs are more likely to correlate with TEs compared to randomly selected genes, and found that human KRAB-ZNF still have a significantly higher number of correlations with TEs. In contrast, in NHPs, KRAB-ZNFs did not have more correlations to TEs than randomly selected genes (<xref rid="d1e1571" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We subsequently determined human-specific and conserved TE:KRAB-ZNF interactions by assessing whether an interaction seen in humans also existed in any NHP. Remarkably, the results we obtained show that humans have a higher number of correlations and connectivity compared to NHPs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). This finding is not confounded by a lack of gene/TE annotations nor sample size, given that we only included KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs expressed in all four species, and that we used the same number of individuals per species; being even more conservative by requiring that all four permutations of human triples show a significant correlation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that some correlations had opposite signs between species. For example, 276 TE:KRAB-ZNF with positive correlations in humans were negatively correlated in bonobos (the seventh column in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Although not significant, out of the 276 TE:KRAB-ZNF, 104 were also negatively correlated in chimpanzees and rhesus macaque and might represent human-specific changes in the sign of the correlation. Constructing a network of those 276 TE:KRAB-ZNF we detected that <italic>ZNF112</italic> and <italic>ZNF528</italic> are two hubs connected to TEs with mostly old links and young links, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). We asked whether sequence differences exist between the orthologous zinc finger proteins that might explain this putative functional change. For ZNF112, there were 21 zinc finger domains. However, among 14 amino acid differences, none of them affected a position within the zinc finger domains (−1, 3, and 6) that directly contacts the DNA. Between the orthologs of human and bonobo ZNF528, we discovered an amino acid difference in one position that directly contacts nucleotides of the DNA (−1 position of the 15th zinc finger domain) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). While in bonobo’s ZNF528 there is a Histidine at this position, it is a Glutamine in human ZNF528. For other KRAB-ZNF proteins it has been demonstrated that replacing DNA-contacting amino acids to Alanine or Glutamine reduces their repressor potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nunez et al. 2011</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that variations in the zinc finger domain of ZNF528, specifically at position 588, may explain why human ZNF528 is not as negatively correlated with TEs as bonobo ZNF528 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, this changed position represents a very rare human polymorphism (rs373201614), which seems to be under positive selection in humans including Denisovans and Neanderthals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Harrison et al. 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>The distribution of young and old links was not random in the 276 TE:KRAB-ZNF bipartite network (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). For instance, TcMar-Tc2 and Gypsy had only old interaction with KRAB-ZNFs, while most of the ERVK correlations were classified as young (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Last, we checked the species-specific correlations based on TE subfamilies. For example, there are 24,063 positive and 2,455 negative correlations in humans that were not detected in NHPs (the first column and the fifth column in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, these human-specific correlations were all evolutionary young links and many of them represented negative correlations involving TEs of the Alu subfamilies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>

<title>Alterations in TE and KRAB-ZNF expression in brains of Alzheimer’s patients: Variance in TE and KRAB-ZNF gene expression reflects the brain region differences</title>
<p>Several KRAB-ZNFs and TEs with human-specific expression patterns or correlations have been associated with AD.

We thus hypothesized that the regulatory network of KRAB-ZNFs and TEs might be severely altered in the brains of AD patients.

<p>To investigate if there were differences in the expression patterns of TEs and KRAB-ZNFs comparing different brain regions and disease status, we conducted t-SNE analysis using their expression levels from the temporal cortex and cerebellum of human control individuals and AD patients.

<title>Human-specific correlations limited to the healthy human temporal cortex: 21 TE:KRAB-ZNFs not detected in AD</title>
<p>To select significant correlations (TE:KRAB-ZNF) between control and AD samples in the temporal cortex and cerebellum, we employed the same filtering criteria as described in the Primate Brain Data analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>), requiring an adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.01, absolute correlation coefficients higher than 0.4, and TE:KRAB-ZNF pairs detected in ChIP-exo data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Imbeault et al. 2017</xref>). The overlaps of TE:KRAB-ZNF pairs are depicted in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, demonstrating a higher number of correlations in the control group. Next, we selected 21 TE:KRAB-ZNF, which are detected from the temporal cortex both in human Primate Brain Data and the healthy controls in Mayo Data, but not detected in any NHPs in Primate Brain Data. These correlations represented a subset of TE:KRAB-ZNF, which were specific to healthy adult human brain samples but not detected in AD progression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Among these 21 TE:KRAB-ZNF, there are 14 evolutionary young and 7 evolutionary old interactions, and we found that Alu subfamilies accounted for 11 of these 21 interactions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). We further investigated why these TE:KRAB-ZNF were not detected in AD samples and found that most of the correlations were not significant based on our defined threshold.

<p>Subsequently, we conducted a bipartite network analysis using the 21 TE:KRAB-ZNF pairs specific to the healthy human samples in the temporal cortex.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we conducted systematic examinations of TEs and KRAB-ZNFs expression and correlation patterns in the brain and compared them between humans and NHPs as well as between healthy human samples and AD. We demonstrated high divergence in the expression of TEs and KRAB-ZNF genes between species, suggesting a prominent evolutionary signature in the regulation of TEs and KRAB-ZNF genes in primates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We also found that evolutionary younger members of both, TEs and KRAB-ZNF genes, exhibit significantly lower expression levels compared to older members (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), proposing that newly emerged genetic elements might be subjected to more stringent regulatory mechanisms, potentially avoiding disruption at the organismal level. To represent the complexity of interactions between TEs and KRAB-ZNFs we derived bipartite networks. We showed that humans had higher connectivity in these networks compared to NHPs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). This observation is in line with previous findings that humans also have higher connectivity in the transcription factor networks of the brain compared to NHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nowick et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bakken et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berto and Nowick 2018</xref>). A substantial proportion of young TE:KRAB-ZNF seems to be human-specific, pointing to recent additions to the TE:KRAB-ZNF network in the human lineage and presumably an increase in the complexity of gene regulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). The network of the 21 TE:KRAB-ZNF that were only discovered in the healthy human temporal cortex but not in other NHPs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>) indicates potential loss of control of some TE expression in AD brains. These collective findings suggest an important role of the TE:KRAB-ZNF network in shaping the evolution and in maintaining the putative functionality of the healthy human brain, and particularly highlight the co-expression involving evolutionary young TEs and young KRAB-ZNFs.</p>
<p>Given the generally acknowledged role of KRAB-ZNF proteins as repressors on TE expressions, we expected to observe many negative correlations between KRAB-ZNFs and TEs. Indeed, many evolutionary young and human specific correlations involving especially TEs of the Alu subfamilies are negative. However, we also observed numerous positive correlations between KRAB-ZNFs and TEs. Keeping in mind that correlations do not indicate direction of the causation and can also be caused by indirect relationships and other factors, several plausible explanations could be offered for these positive interactions. Firstly, some TEs can function as <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements capable of influencing the expression of nearby genes, which have been mentioned to be tissue-specifically co-opted TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sentmanat and Elgin 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wolf et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Coronado-Zamora and González 2023</xref>). Secondly, it is conceivable that the expression levels of KRAB-ZNF genes themselves are influenced by the presence and activity of TEs within the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pontis et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Senft and Macfarlan 2021</xref>). Another perspective is that primate-specific KRAB-ZNFs can bind to gene promoters, regulating gene expression in the primate brain without necessarily targeting TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Farmiloe et al. 2020</xref>); observed correlations could then stem from indirect regulation. We should note, however, that 19.43% (446/2,296) of positively correlated pairs overlap significantly with the ChIP-exo results, i.e. exist in the presence of a KRAB-ZNF protein binding to the TE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, we discovered that all the human-specific correlations are evolutionary young correlations. Notably, different TE subfamilies interact with KRAB-ZNFs differently, for example Alu subfamilies are the only TEs, which have more negative correlations than positive ones and LTR subfamilies have only positive correlations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Therefore, we encourage future research focusing on primate evolution to take these factors into account.</p>
<p>TEs have also been observed to be dysregulated in certain diseases. Here, we observed that the variances in expression levels of TEs and KRAB-ZNFs were more distinct across various brain regions than between control and AD samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This finding points out the difficulties to identify differences between control and AD samples solely through the consideration of differential expression. This is also illustrated by the detection of only 6 and 10 differentially expressed KRAB-ZNFs and TEs, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Upon combining expression data with correlation results and an evolutionary perspective, we determined 21 human-specific TE:KRAB-ZNFs that were not detectable in AD brains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>), suggesting considerable alterations of connections in the context of a human-specific disease. By comparing healthy and disease samples, we discovered evolutionary young Alu subfamilies that are downregulated in AD patients, such as AluYh9 and AluSp subfamilies, which have been found to be negatively associated with Tau pathologic burden in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Guo et al. 2018</xref>). The AluY and AluSx subfamilies derived Alu-mediated in-frame deletions of the exons 9 and 10 in mutated forms of <italic>PSNE1</italic>, which was associated with early-onset AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Le Guennec et al. 2017</xref>). Alu subfamilies have further been shown to regulate the expression of <italic>ACE</italic> in neurons from Alu insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu et al. 2013</xref>) and to play a role in A-to-I RNA editing during neurogenesis in the central nervous system and mitochondrial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Larsen et al. 2018</xref>). Thus, we suggest the dysregulation of modules of Alu subfamilies with their connected KRAB-ZNFs in the regulatory network (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>) plays a role in AD progression.</p>
<p>With respect to the arms-race hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jacobs et al. 2014</xref>), we observed a higher number of negative correlations between young TEs and young KRAB-ZNF genes in humans compared to NHPs. This suggests increased repression from young KRAB-ZNFs on young TEs in the human brain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Still, our findings only weakly support the arms-race hypothesis. Firstly, we noted that young TEs exhibit lower expression levels than old TEs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), which might not be expected if they had recently escaped repression. However, it is challenging to discern at which stage of a potential arms race the TE:KRAB-ZNF pair is presently, i.e. whether the TE is on the rise with its expression or already repressed by the KRAB-ZNF. Additionally, some young TEs were also negatively correlated with old KRAB-ZNF genes, leading to weak assortativity regarding age inference, which would also not be in line with the arms-race idea. This suggests to us that the evolution of the interplay between TEs and KRAB-ZNFs is more complex than previously proposed.</p>
<p>In response to the need for systematically comparing expression profiles of orthologous genes and TEs across diverse species or conditions, we developed TEKRABber, an R Bioconductor package which equips users to effortlessly adapt its comprehensive pipeline for their analyses. Our pipeline takes care of normalizing expression data across species from transcriptomic data by extending the usage of the scaling-based normalization method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhou et al. 2019</xref>). To optimize computational efficiency and parallel computing during the calculations of pairwise correlations, we harnessed the capabilities of RCpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Eddelbuettel and François 2011</xref>) and doParallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Corporation and Weston 2011</xref>). This approach allows for effective scaling, accommodating larger datasets and leveraging additional computational resources as needed. Taking these advantages, users can adapt the TEKRABber’s pipeline to analyze selected orthologous genes and TEs from their expression data within an acceptable time frame. Taking one of the examples in this study, calculating pairwise correlations of 178 orthologs with 836 TEs (neglecting sample number) can be executed in approximately five minutes on standard hardware (Intel Core i7 2.6GHz, 16GB memory). Future studies could use TEKRABber for instance to investigate correlations between TEs and all genes, to identify candidates of genes whose expression is influenced by certain TEs. Another option would be to explore which factors might repress TE expression in invertebrates, which lack KRAB-ZNF proteins.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is crucial to recognize that our present approach is constrained by certain limitations. These constraints primarily stem from variations in gene lengths and positions of the same TE across individual genomes of the same species, leaving some room for improving the normalization of TE expression levels. We only used the available reference genomes for our analysis; however, it becomes increasingly clear that substantial individual differences in the presence of TEs exist, which are not covered by a single reference genome of a species. Currently, there are emerging methods designed to detect TE expression, including tools for advancements in sequencing resolution like long-read sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Marx 2023</xref>), de novo TE annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Storer et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Orozco-Arias et al. 2023</xref>) and locus-specific expression detection in single-cell RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rodríguez-Quiroz and Valdebenito-Maturana 2022</xref>). These developments hold promise for achieving a more precise depiction of the variations between samples and the reference, ultimately enhancing our understanding of TE-associated expression patterns. Hence, we acknowledge the significant potential of integrating improved TE orthologous information into our method.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, our findings underscore the intricate network of interactions between TEs and KRAB-ZNFs in both human evolution and neurodegenerative disease. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of TEs and KRAB-ZNFs functions, it is not enough to only examine expression levels, but network analysis as facilitated by TEKRABber needs to be leveraged. In primate evolution, the human brain exhibits a notably denser TE:KRAB-ZNF network compared to NHPs, particularly for more recently evolved TEs and KRAB-ZNFs. The healthy human brain TE:KRAB-ZNF network contains a distinct module composed exclusively of Alu subfamilies, which is an evolutionary novelty not observed in AD brains. These insights highlight the nuanced dynamics of TE:KRAB-ZNF interactions and their relevance in both evolutionary and disease contexts. We emphasize that TEs can have a role in species evolution and provide a tool, TEKRABber, to further investigate this across a larger number of taxa.</p>

<p>For comparing humans with NHPs, we used published RNA-seq data (GSE127898) including 422 brain samples from biological replicates that consisted of 4 humans, 3 chimpanzees, 3 bonobos, and 3 macaques (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Samples from each individual were from 33 different brain regions, and total RNA was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 system with a 150 bp paired-end sequencing protocol.

<p>The Mayo RNA-seq study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allen et al. 2016</xref>) was utilized to compare human control and Alzheimer’s disease samples. Total RNA was sequenced from both control and AD samples collected from the temporal cortex and cerebellum. The reprocessed FASTQ files, which include only control and AD samples in the temporal cortex and cerebellum, were downloaded via Synapse consortium studies (accession: syn5550404).

<p>Adapters and low-quality reads were removed from the FASTQ files using fastp v0.12.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al. 2018</xref>) with default parameters. The selected FASTQ files from both datasets were then mapped to their respective references downloaded from UCSC Table Browser, including hg38, panTro6, panPan3, and rheMac10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Karolchik 2004</xref>), using STAR v2.7.10b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dobin et al. 2013</xref>) with the parameters ‘--outFilterMultimapNma× 100 --withAnchorMultimapNma× 100’. These parameters were chosen to increase the likelihood of capturing TE mapping by allowing for multiple alignments of reads and more loci anchors for mapping. The resulting BAM files were used to quantify counts of TEs and genes using TEtranscripts v2.2.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jin et al. 2015</xref>) with the ‘--sortByPos’ parameter to determine the expression levels of genes and TEs. Gene and TE indices were created using UCSC gene annotations and the RepeatMasker track, enabling reads to match with these intervals. If a read was overlapped with both a gene exon and a TE, it would be checked to determine whether it had a unique alignment or multiple locations in the genome. If an annotation existed, the uniquely aligned read was assigned to the gene. Otherwise, it was assigned to the TE. For reads with ambiguous mappings, they were evenly weighted across TE or gene annotations using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dempster et al. 1977</xref>). Differentially expressed genes and TEs were quantified using DESeq2 v1.4.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Love et al. 2014</xref>) utilizing an absolute log2FoldChange threshold greater than 1.5 (adjusted <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, the Mayo Data adopted an absolute log2FoldChange threshold greater than 0.5 due to a lower number of detected differentially expressed genes and TEs.

<title>Inferences about the evolutionary age of KRAB-ZNFs and TEs</title>
<p>A total of 337 KRAB-ZNF genes were identified using the comprehensive KRAB-ZNF catalog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Huntley et al. 2006</xref>). The evolutionary age of these genes was inferred through annotations provided by GenTree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Shao et al. 2019</xref>), which employed a synteny-based pipeline to date primate-specific protein-coding genes and depicted their origins using a branch view. For KRAB-ZNF genes lacking direct dating annotations in GenTree, we incorporated complementary information from annotations of primate orthologs across 27 species, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jovanovic et al. 2021</xref>). This approach allowed us to assign evolutionary ages to all 337 KRAB-ZNF genes for our downstream analysis (<xref rid="d1e1571" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>). The evolutionary age of transposable elements (TEs) was derived from Dfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Storer et al. 2021</xref>) by extracting species-specific information for each TE subfamily (<xref rid="d1e1571" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>). Alu elements, which are primate-specific, have been extensively used in phylogenetic studies, and a subset of recently evolved Alu subfamilies is found in all Simiiformes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Xing et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Williams et al. 2010</xref>). For downstream analyses, we classified both KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs into young and old groups based on their emergence around the divergence of Simiiformes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Development of pipeline software, TEKRABber</title>
<p>To compare the expression of orthologous genes and TEs across species, we concatenated steps including normalization, differential expression, and correlation analysis into an R Bioconductor package, TEKRABber. The name was derived from the idea that TEs are bound (“grabbed”) by KRAB-ZNF proteins. TEKRABber adapted the scale-based normalization method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhou et al. 2019</xref>) to normalize orthologous genes for comparison between two species. In brief, the conserved orthologous gene lengths from two species were selected from Ensembl data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Harrison et al. 2024</xref>) and combined with the expression data to find an optimal scaling factor that can normalize the data to achieve a minimization of deviation between empirical and nominal type I error in a hypothesis testing framework. The normalization step for TEs followed a similar concept. However, instead of using orthologous genes, we used the subset of TEs including LTR, LINE, SINE, SVAs, and DNA transposons (as defined by RepeatMasker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Smit et al. 2013</xref>)), for which homologues can be found in other species, for scaling to normalize the expression of TEs (<xref rid="d1e1571" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). After normalization, differentially expressed orthologous genes and TEs were analyzed using DESeq2 v1.4.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Love et al. 2014</xref>). The one-to-one correlations between selected orthologous genes and TEs from each species were estimated. In this analysis, we used Pearson’s correlations with an adjusted <italic>p-value</italic> using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Benjamini and Hochberg 1995</xref>) to obtain significant correlations.</p>

<sec id="s5f">
<title>Correlation analysis</title>
<p>To obtain significant correlations of KRAB-ZNFs and TEs for down-stream analysis, we used a workflow including the following steps. We first applied Pearson’s correlations on one-to-one gene and TE, using their normalized expression levels. Then, we tested whether KRAB-ZNFs statistically had more correlations with TEs than other random selected genes (1000 iterations, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001). Next, we investigated the relationships between the number of correlations and correlation coefficient values. We decided a threshold with an absolute value of 0.4 coefficient with adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.01 from the distribution. Lastly, we cross-validated our results by comparing the pairs found with experimentally determined TE and KRAB-ZNF relationships using ChIP-exo data from human embryonic stem cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Imbeault et al. 2017</xref>) and testing different correlations strengths. For notation, we employed TE:KRAB-ZNF to signify a correlation between a TE and a KRAB-ZNF gene. For AluYc:<italic>ZNF441</italic> indicates a significant correlation between the expression of AluYc and <italic>ZNF441</italic>.</p>

<title>Network analysis</title>
<p>TE:KRAB-ZNF networks were analyzed as bipartite networks, consisting of two classes of nodes, KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs, with connections existing only between the two classes and no edges between elements from the same class. Node properties were first checked using a bipartite module in NetworkX software v2.8.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hagberg et al. 2008</xref>). These values included bipartite degree centrality, bipartite strength centrality, and bipartite betweenness centrality for each KRAB-ZNF and TE node. The top 5% scores were selected as hubs (bipartite degree and bipartite strength centrality). For cluster detection, leading eigenvector community methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Csárdi et al. 2023</xref>) were used to specify unipartite community structures, and then bipartite modularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barber 2007</xref>) was calculated with CONDOR v1.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Platig et al. 2016</xref>).

<p>The authors present new expression analysis software (TEKRABber) to help analyze expression correlations between transposable elements (TEs) and KRAB zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) genes in experimentaly validated datasets. The authors use this method to decipher the regulatory networks of KRAB-ZNFs and TEs during human brain evolution and in Alzheimer's disease. The direction of the work is <bold>important</bold>, with potentially significant interest from others looking for a tool for correlative gene expression analysis across individual genomes and species. However, identified biases and shortcomings in the current analysis pipeline could lead to an unacceptable number of false positive and negative signals and thus impact the conclusions, leaving this work in its current form <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>The authors present their new bioinformatic tool called TEKRABber, and use it to correlate expression between KRAB ZNFs and TEs across different brain tissues, and across species. While the aims of the authors are clear and there would be significant interest from other researchers in the field for a program that can do such correlative gene expression analysis across individual genomes and species, the presented approach and work display significant shortcomings. In the current state of the analysis pipeline, the biases and shortcomings mentioned below, for which I have seen no proof that they are accounted for by the authors, are severely impacting the presented results and conclusions. It is therefore essential that the points below are addressed, involving significant changes in the TEKRABber program as well as the analysis pipeline, to prevent the identification of false positive and negative signals, that would severely affect the conclusions one can raise about the analysis.</p>
<p>My main concerns are provided below:</p>
<p>One important shortcoming of the biocomputational approach is that most TEs are not actually expressed, and others (Alus) are not a proxy of the activity of the TE class at all. I will explain: While specific TE classes can act as (species-specific) promoters for genes (such as LTRs) or are expressed as TE derived transcripts (LINEs, SVAs), the majority of other older TE classes do not have such behavior and are either neutral to the genome or may have some enhancer activity (as mapped in the program they refer to 'TEffectR'. A big focus is on Alus, but Alus contribute to a transcriptome in a different way too: They often become part of transcripts due to alternative splicing. As such, the presence of Alu derived transcripts is not a proxy for the expression/activity of the Alu class, but rather a result of some Alus being part of gene transcripts (see also next point). The bottom line is that the TEKRABber software/approach is heavily prone to picking up both false positives (TEs being part of transcribed loci) and false negatives (TEs not producing any transcripts at all), which has a big implication for how reads from TEs as done in this study should be interpreted: The TE expression used to correlate the KRAB ZNF expression is simply not representing the species-specific influences of TEs where the authors are after.</p>
<p>With the strategy as described, a lot of TE expression is misinterpreted: TEs can be part of gene-derived transcripts due to alternative splicing (often happens for Alus) or as a result of the TE being present in an inefficiently spliced out intron (happens a lot) which leads to TE-derived reads as a result of that TE being part of that intron, rather than that TE being actively expressed. As a result, the data as analysed is not reliably indicating the expression of TEs (as the authors intend to) and should be filtered for any reads that are coming from the above scenarios: These reads have nothing to do with KRAB ZNF control, and are not representing actively expressed TEs and therefore should be removed. Given that from my lab's experience in the brain (and other) tissues, the proportion of RNA sequencing reads that are actually derived from active TEs is a stark minority compared to reads derived from TEs that happen to be in any of the many transcribed loci, applying this filtering is expected to have a huge impact on the results and conclusions of this study.</p>
<p>Another potential problem that I don't see addressed is that due to the high level of similarity of the many hundreds of KRAB ZNF genes in primates and the reads derived from them, and the inaccurate annotations of many KZNFs in non-human genomes, the expression data derived from RNA-seq datasets cannot be simply used to plot KZNF expression values, without significant work and manual curation to safeguard proper cross species ortholog-annotation: The work of Thomas and Schneider (2011) has studied this in great detail but genome-assemblies of non-human primates tend to be highly inaccurate in appointing the right ortholog of human ZNF genes. The problem becomes even bigger when RNA-sequencing reads are analyzed: RNA-sequencing reads from a human ZNF that emerged in great apes by duplication from an older parental gene (we have a decent number of those in the human genome) may be mapped to that older parental gene in Macaque genome: So, the expression of human-specific ZNF-B, that derived from the parental ZNF-A, is likely to be compared in their DESeq to the expression of ZNF-A in Macaque RNA-seq data. In other words, without a significant amount of manual curation, the DE-seq analysis is prone to lead to false comparisons which make the strategy and KRABber software approach described highly biased and unreliable.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that there are differences in expression and activity of KRAB-ZNFs and TEs respectively that may have had important evolutionary consequences. However, because all of the network analyses in this paper rely on the analyses of RNA-seq data and the processing through the TE-KRABber software with the shortcomings and potential biases that I mentioned above, I need to emphasize that the results and conclusions are likely to be significantly different if the appropriate measures are taken to get more accurate and curated TE and KRAB ZNF expression data.</p>
<p>Finally, there are some minor but important notes I want to share:</p>
<p>The association with certain variations in ZNF genes with neurological disorders such as AD, as reported in the introduction is not entirely convincing without further functional support. Such associations could merely happen by chance, given the high number of ZNF genes in the human genome and the high chance that variations in these loci happen to associate with certain disease-associated traits. So using these associations as an argument that changes in TEs and KRAB ZNF networks are important for diseases like AD should be used with much more caution.</p>
<p>There are a number of papers where KRAB ZNF and TE expression are analysed in parallel in human brain tissues. So the novelty of that aspect of the presented study may be limited.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The aim was to decipher the regulatory networks of KRAB-ZNFs and TEs that have changed during human brain evolution and in Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This solid study presents a valuable analysis and successfully confirms previous assumptions, but also goes beyond the current state of the art.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The design of the analysis needs to be slightly modified and a more in-depth analysis of the positive correlation cases would be beneficial. Some of the conclusions need to be reinterpreted.</p>

As a result, the data as analysed is not reliably indicating the expression of TEs (as the authors intend to) and should be filtered for any reads that are coming from the above scenarios: These reads have nothing to do with KRAB ZNF control, and are not representing actively expressed TEs and therefore should be removed. Given that from my lab's experience in the brain (and other) tissues, the proportion of RNA sequencing reads that are actually derived from active TEs is a stark minority compared to reads derived from TEs that happen to be in any of the many transcribed loci, applying this filtering is expected to have a huge impact on the results and conclusions of this study.</p>

<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for highlighting the potential issues of false positives and negatives in TE quantification. The reviewer provided valuable examples of how different TE classes, such as Alus, LTRs, LINEs, and SVAs, exhibit distinct behaviors in the genome. To our knowledge, specific tools like ERVmap (Tokuyama et al., 2018), which annotates ERVs, and LtrDetector (Joseph et al., 2019), which uses k-mer distributions to quantify LTRs, could indeed enhance precision by treating specific TE classes individually. We acknowledge that such approaches may yield more accurate results and appreciate the suggestion.</p>
<p>In our study, we used TEtranscripts (Jin et al., 2015) prior to TEKRABber. TEtranscripts applies the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to assign ambiguous reads as the following steps. Uniquely mapped reads are first assigned to genes, and reads overlapping genes and TEs are assigned to TEs only if they do not uniquely match an annotated gene. The remaining ambiguous reads are distributed based on EM iterations. While this approach may not be as specialized as the latest tools for specific TE classes, it provides a general overview of TE activity. TEtranscripts outputs subfamily-level TE expression data, which we used as input for TEKRABber to perform downstream analyses such as differential expression and correlation studies.</p>
<p>We understand the importance of adapting tools to specific research objectives, including focusing on particular TE classes. TEKRABber is designed not to refine TE quantification at the mapping stage but to flexibly handle outputs from various TE quantification tools. It accepts raw TE counts as input in the form of dataframes, enabling diverse analytical pipelines. In the revised version of our manuscript, we will emphasize this distinction in the discussion and provide examples of how TEKRABber can integrate with other tools to enhance specificity and accuracy.</p>

<p>(2) Another potential problem that I don't see addressed is that due to the high level of similarity of the many hundreds of KRAB ZNF genes in primates and the reads derived from them, and the inaccurate annotations of many KZNFs in non-human genomes, the expression data derived from RNA-seq datasets cannot be simply used to plot KZNF expression values, without significant work and manual curation to safeguard proper cross species ortholog-annotation: The work of Thomas and Schneider (2011) has studied this in great detail but genome-assemblies of non-human primates tend to be highly inaccurate in appointing the right ortholog of human ZNF genes. The problem becomes even bigger when RNA-sequencing reads are analyzed: RNA-sequencing reads from a human ZNF that emerged in great apes by duplication from an older parental gene (we have a decent number of those in the human genome) may be mapped to that older parental gene in Macaque genome: So, the expression of human-specific ZNF-B, that derived from the parental ZNF-A, is likely to be compared in their DESeq to the expression of ZNF-A in Macaque RNA-seq data. In other words, without a significant amount of manual curation, the DE-seq analysis is prone to lead to false comparisons which make the strategy and KRABber software approach described highly biased and unreliable.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that there are differences in expression and activity of KRAB-ZNFs and TEs respectively that may have had important evolutionary consequences. However, because all of the network analyses in this paper rely on the analyses of RNA-seq data and the processing through the TE-KRABber software with the shortcomings and potential biases that I mentioned above, I need to emphasize that the results and conclusions are likely to be significantly different if the appropriate measures are taken to get more accurate and curated TE and KRAB ZNF expression data.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for raising the important issue of accurately annotating the expanded repertoire of KRAB-ZNFs in primates, particularly the challenges of cross-species orthology and potential biases in RNA-seq data analysis. Indeed, we have also addressed this challenge in some of our previous papers (Nowick et al., 2010, Nowick et al., 2011 and Jovanovic et al., 2021).</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we will include more details about our two-step strategy to ensure accurate KRAB-ZNF ortholog assignments. First, we employed the Gene Order Conservation (GOC) score from Ensembl BioMart as a primary filter, selecting only one-to-one orthologs with a GOC score above 75% across primates. This threshold, recommended in Ensembl’s ortholog quality control guidelines, ensures high-confidence orthology relationships, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/compara/Ortholog_qc_manual.html#goc">http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/compara/Ortholog_qc_manual.html#goc</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Second, we incorporated data from Jovanovic et al. (2021), which independently validated KRAB-ZNF orthologs across 27 primate genomes. This additional layer of validation allowed us to refine our dataset, resulting in the identification of 337 orthologous KRAB-ZNFs for differential expression analysis (Figure S2).</p>
<p>We acknowledge that different annotation methods or criteria may for some genes yield variations in the identified orthologs. However, we believe that this combination provides a robust starting point for addressing the challenges raised, while we remain open to additional refinements in future analyses.</p>

<p>(3) The association with certain variations in ZNF genes with neurological disorders such as AD, as reported in the introduction is not entirely convincing without further functional support. Such associations could merely happen by chance, given the high number of ZNF genes in the human genome and the high chance that variations in these loci happen to associate with certain disease-associated traits. So using these associations as an argument that changes in TEs and KRAB ZNF networks are important for diseases like AD should be used with much more caution.</p>
<p>There are a number of papers where KRAB ZNF and TE expression are analysed in parallel in human brain tissues. So the novelty of that aspect of the presented study may be limited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully acknowledge the concern that, given the large number of KRAB-ZNFs and their inherent variability, some associations with AD or other neurological disorders could occur by chance. This highlights the importance of additional functional studies to validate the causal role of KRAB-ZNF and TE interactions in disease contexts. While previous studies have indeed analyzed KRAB-ZNF and TE expression in human brain tissues, our study seeks to expand on this foundation by incorporating interspecies comparisons across primates. This approach enabled us to identify TE:KRAB-ZNF pairs that are uniquely present in healthy human brains, which may provide insights into their potential evolutionary significance and relevance to diseases like AD.</p>
<p>In addition to analyzing RNA-seq data (GSE127898 and syn5550404), we have cross-validated our findings using ChIP-exo data for 159 KRAB-ZNF proteins and their TE binding regions in human (Imbeault et al., 2017). This allowed us to identify specific binding events between KRAB-ZNF and TE pairs, providing further support for the observed associations. We agree with the reviewer that additional experimental validations, such as functional studies, are critical to further establish the role of KRAB-ZNF and TE networks in AD. We hope that future research can build upon our findings to explore these associations in greater detail.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The aim was to decipher the regulatory networks of KRAB-ZNFs and TEs that have changed during human brain evolution and in Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This solid study presents a valuable analysis and successfully confirms previous assumptions, but also goes beyond the current state of the art.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The design of the analysis needs to be slightly modified and a more in-depth analysis of the positive correlation cases would be beneficial. Some of the conclusions need to be reinterpreted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the thoughtful summary, positive evaluation of our study, and constructive feedback. We appreciate the recognition of the strengths in our analysis and the valuable suggestions for improving its design and interpretation.</p>
<p>We would like to briefly comment on the suggested modifications to the design here, and will provide a detailed point-by-point review later with our revised manuscript.</p>
<p>The reviewer recommended considering a more recent timepoint, such as less than 25 million years ago (mya), to define the &quot;evolutionary young group&quot; of KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs when discussing the arms-race theory. This is indeed a valuable perspective, as the TE repressing functions by KRAB-ZNF proteins may have evolved more recently than the split between Old World Monkeys (OWM) and New World Monkeys (NWM) at 44.2 mya we used.</p>
<p>Our rationale for selecting 44.2 mya is based on certain primate-specific TEs such as the Alu subfamilies, which emerged after the rise of Simiiformes and have been used in phylogenetic studies (Xing et al., 2007 and Williams et al., 2010). This timeframe allowed us to investigate the potential co-evolution of KRAB-ZNFs and TEs in species that emerged after the OWM-NWM split (e.g., human, chimpanzee, bonobos, and macaques used for this study). However, focusing only on KRAB-ZNFs and TEs younger than 25 million years would limit the analysis to just 9 KRAB-ZNFs and 92 TEs expressed in our datasets. While we will not conduct a reanalysis using this more recent timepoint, we will integrate the recommendation into the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we greatly appreciate the reviewer's detailed insights and suggestions for refining specific descriptions and interpretations in our manuscript. We will address these points in the revised version to ensure the content is presented with greater precision and clarity.</p>
<p>Once again, we thank both reviewers for their valuable feedback, which provides significant input for strengthening our study.</p>
