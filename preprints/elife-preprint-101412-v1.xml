<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease with fatal outcome and a poorly understood pathogenesis. The lysosomal protein transmembrane 4 beta (LAPTM4B), a multi-transmembrane endo-lysosomal membrane protein, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases. However, its involvement in IPF remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the role of LAPTM4B in lung fibrosis and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that LAPTM4B was significantly reduced in IPF and mouse fibrotic lungs. In vivo studies showed that the deficiency of LAPTM4B exacerbated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, while the restoration of LAPTM4B alleviated fibrosis. Mechanistically, LAPTM4B recruits the NEDD4 like E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (NEDD4L) to endosomes, leading to increased ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of TGFRB2 and active SMAD2/3, thereby blocking the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. Overall, our data provided a novel insight for a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF, supporting the therapeutic potential of restoration of LAPTM4B as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease involves a complex interplay of cell types and signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). With a median survival time of only 3-5 years from diagnosis, IPF carries a prognosis worse than that of most malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Various risk factors, including genetic predisposition, smoking, male gender predominance, and aging, have been implicated in the development of IPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Despite extensive research efforts, the precise pathological mechanisms underlying IPF remain elusive. It is widely postulated that recurrent injuries to alveolar epithelial cells and dysregulated epithelial repair processes are pivotal, with fibroblasts serving as the primary effector cells responsible for aberrant extracellular matrix production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Currently, treatment options of IPF are limited, and management without transplant primarily revolves around supportive care measures such as oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). While pharmacological therapies pirfenidone and nintedanib have been shown to mitigate disease progression, their long-term efficacy and tolerability remain uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). With ever-increasing incidence due to the expanding global aging population, addressing this unmet clinical challenge requires a deeper understanding of pathogenesis of IPF through continued research endeavors.</p>
<p>Endocytosis-mediated cellular signaling is a fundamental process that modulates cellular signal transduction via multiple molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Endosomes regulate receptor internalization, recycling, and degradation, thereby modulating the transmission of extracellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). In addition, endosomes function as signaling platforms, recruiting and activating specific signaling molecules within endocytic vesicles, influencing intracellular signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that the endocytosis and trafficking of TGF-β receptors play a crucial role in regulating their fate and, consequently, the transduction of TGF-β/SMAD signaling and pro-fibrotic responses in IPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that Nestin, a type VI intermediate filament protein, acts as a central regulator of the intracellular vesicular trafficking system and facilitates Rab11-dependent recycling of TGFBR1, thereby sustaining TGF-β/SMAD signaling and promoting fibrogenesis in IPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Despite these advances, a comprehensive understanding of endocytosis-mediated cellular signaling in IPF is essential for elucidating the pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutic strategies for the disease.</p>
<p>The lysosomal protein transmembrane (LAPTM) family comprises essential endo-lysosomal proteins, including LAPTM4A, LAPTM4B, and LAPTM5. Among these, LAPTM4B has been extensively studied. Previous research has demonstrated that LAPTM4B plays a critical role in regulating intracellular vesicle trafficking, sphingolipid homeostasis, nutrient sensing, and lysosomal function, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). It has been reported that LAPTM4B inhibits EGF-induced EGFR intraluminal sorting and lysosomal degradation, resulting in enhanced and prolonged EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Furthermore, LAPTM4B is upregulated in various cancers and plays a pivotal role in tumor initiation and progression, particularly in mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Beyond cancer research, a recent study demonstrated that LAPTM4B mitigates experimental ischemia/reperfusion injury by promoting autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). However, the involvement of LAPTM4B in fibrotic diseases has not yet been reported.</p>
<p>Our initial analysis suggests that LAPTM4B may play a role in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Building upon this hypothesis, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of LAPTM4B in the pathogenesis of IPF and to elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. Through this research, we aim to provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of IPF and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>LAPTM4B protein levels are reduced in IPF and bleomycin-induced fibrotic lungs</title>
<p>To investigate the potential role of LAPTM4B in pulmonary fibrosis, we examined LAPTM4B expression in fibrotic lungs. Histological examination revealed a notable decrease in LAPTM4B protein expression in lung sections from IPF subjects compared to non-IPF donors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistently, immunofluorescence staining highlighted reduced LAPTM4B expression in bleomycin-treated fibrotic lungs compared to control counterparts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), along with an increase in the mesenchymal marker Vimentin and a decrease in the alveolar epithelial cell marker Advanced Glycation End-product Receptor (AGER). Western blot analysis confirmed the reduced level of LAPTM4B in the lung homogenates from bleomycin-challenged fibrotic lungs, accompanied by elevated Collagen1 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Additionally, LAPTM4B expression was reduced in mouse acute lung injury (ALI) models induced by both bleomycin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E&amp;F</xref>) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G&amp;H</xref>). However, reanalysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database GSE124685 revealed no significant changes in LAPTM4B mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 1A), and GSE150910 showed higher LAPTM4B mRNA levels in IPF lungs compared to controls (Supplementary Fig. 1B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Similarly, Laptm4b mRNA expression was not significantly altered in bleomycin-induced fibrotic lungs (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Additionally, analyzing the single-cell RNA-seq data from the Human Lung Cell Atlas revealed that LAPTM4B is widely expressed in the lung, with relatively higher expression in airway epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, and fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I-K</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). This observation was further confirmed through immunofluorescence staining of normal lung tissue from <italic>Sftpc-</italic>tdTomato mice, where LAPTM4B was found to be distributed in puncta and partially co-localized with <italic>Sftpc</italic>-positive ACE2 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>).</p>

<p>However, AAV-sh-<italic>Laptm4b</italic> exposed mice displayed more severe lung injury, and increased lung collagen deposition after the BLM challenge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Additionally, there is a significant increase in the Ashcroft scores (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), total white blood cell (WBC) counts in BALF(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), lung-to-body weight ratios, and lung hydroxyproline content of AAV-sh-<italic>Laptm4b</italic> exposed mice following bleomycin challenge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed a significant reduction in Laptm4b expression after AAV-sh-<italic>Laptm4b</italic> exposure and demonstrated a notable elevation in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins Fibronectin and Collagen 1, as well as the myofibroblast marker α-SMA in the lung homogenates of AAV-sh-<italic>Laptm4b</italic> exposed mice following bleomycin challenge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H&amp;I</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the loss of Laptm4b exacerbates lung injury and fibrosis induced by BLM.</p>

<title>LAPTM4B plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial and fibroblast cell homeostasis by restraining TGF-β1-induced pro-fibrotic phenotypes</title>
<p>To assess the impact of LAPTM4B deficiency in vitro, we constructed stable LAPTM4B-knockdown A549 cell lines using two different short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), sh-<italic>LAPTM4B</italic> or sh-NC, with lentiviral vectors.. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed significant changes in cell morphology in sh-<italic>LAPTM4B</italic> cells, accompanied by a loss of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin and increased fluorescence intensity of Vimentin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, cell migration was promoted in sh-<italic>LAPTM4B</italic> A549 cells, as evaluated by wound healing assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B&amp;C</xref>). Western blot results further confirmed the reduced LAPTM4B expression and loss of E-cadherin, as well as increased expression of the pro-fibrotic markers N-cadherin and Vimentin in sh-<italic>LAPTM4B</italic> A549 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D&amp;E</xref>). Similarly, siRNA-mediated LAPTM4B knockdown induced the formation of α-SMA-positive actin fibers in human embryonic lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Western blot analysis further confirmed the induction of Fibronectin, Collagen1, and α-SMA by siRNA-mediated LAPTM4B knockdown in MRC-5 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G&amp;H</xref>), indicating that this was not a cell type-specific result. Conversely, LAPTM4B overexpression reduced the elevation of Fibronectin, Collagen1, and α-SMA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I&amp;J</xref>) induced by TGF-β1. Additionally, LAPTM4B inhibited TGF-β1-induced cell contractility (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K&amp;L</xref>), while siRNA-mediated knockdown of LAPTM4B enhanced TGF-β1-induced cell contractility in MRC-5 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M&amp;N</xref>).</p>

To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the influence of LAPTM4B on the homeostasis of epithelial and fibroblast cells, we aim to investigate its effect on the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. Upon shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous LAPTM4B, we observed a significant increase in TGF-β1-mediated rapid phosphorylation of SMAD2 in stable LAPTM4B-knockdown A549 cell lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A&amp;B</xref>). This finding was further confirmed by siRNA-mediated LAPTM4B-knockdown in MRC-5 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C&amp;D</xref>). Conversely, transient overexpression of LAPTM4B in cells suppressed TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of SMAD2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E&amp;F</xref>). Additionally, AKT activation was not affected in LAPTM4B-knockdown or overexpressed A549 after TGF-β1 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 3A&amp;B). Immunofluorescence analysis provided additional evidence showing that shRNA-mediated knockdown of LAPTM4B expression resulted in spontaneous nuclear translocation of ectopically expressed HA-SMAD3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). In contrast, ectopic expression of LAPTM4B suppressed TGF-β1-mediated nuclear translocation of SMAD3 in A549 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Accordingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of LAPTM4B increased TGF-β-inducible Smad binding element (SBE) luciferase activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>), whereas LAPTM4B overexpression suppressed TGF-β-induced SBE activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>).</p>

<title>LAPTM4B interacts with TGFBR2 and destabilizes active SMAD2/3</title>
<p>Consistently with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), we observed that Flag-tagged LAPTM4B partially overlaps with the early endosome marker EEA1 and co-localizes with the late endosome/lysosome marker RAB7 (Supplementary Fig. 4A&amp;B). Given that the intracellular trafficking of the TGF-β receptor is known to influence downstream signaling dynamics, we aim to investigate whether LAPTM4B affects the intracellular trafficking of TGF-β receptors. Remarkably, TGFBR2-HA exhibited a high degree of co-localization with endogenous LAPTM4B that nearly all vesicles containing LAPTM4B also labeled for TGFBR2-HA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure. 5A</xref>). Interestingly, LAPTM4B expression in cells was stochastic, with some cells displaying high levels and others low levels of LAPTM4B. Notably, TGFBR2-HA predominantly localized to vesicles in cells with high LAPTM4B levels, rather than being distributed in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm as seen in cells with low LAPTM4B levels. Furthermore, TGF-β1 stimulation has no effect on the rates of TGFBR2-HA internalization into LAPTM4B-positive vesicles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure. 5A</xref>). The co-localization between LAPTM4B and TGFBR2 was further confirmed by transient co-transfection of LAPTM4B-Flag and TGFBR2-HA constructs and visualization using N-SIM microscopy and revealed that the co-localization of the two proteins occurred not only on the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure. 5B</xref>, inset 1) but also within LAPTM4B-containing vesicles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure. 5B</xref>, insets 1 and 2). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the physical interaction between LAPTM4B and TGFBR2, irrespective of TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, SMAD3 was recruited to LAPTM4B-positive vesicles in the presence of TGF-β1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, Supplementary Figure. S4C). Furthermore, LAPTM4B promoted the ubiquitination of SMAD3 under TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). The proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored the reduced phosphorylation of SMAD2 in response to LAPTM4B overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F&amp;G</xref>). In addition, in vitro ubiquitination assays using ubiquitin mutants (K48O or K63O) indicated that LAPTM4B promoted K48-linked ubiquitination of both TGFBR2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>) and SMAD3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>) in the presence of TGF-β1.</p>

<title>LAPTM4B-mediated recruitment of NEDD4L to endosomes facilitates ubiquitination of active SMAD2/3</title>
<p>The LAPTM family member LAPTM5 has previously been shown to interact with NEDD4 like E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (NEDD4L) through its C-terminal PY motifs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Since PY motifs are also present in LAPTM4B, we aim to investigate their potential to bind NEDD4L. Indeed, despite being predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm, HA-NEDD4L was also observed in LAPTM4B-Flag-positive puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The co-localization between LAPTM4B and NEDD4L was further confirmed by visualizing exogenously expressed LAPTM4B-Flag and endogenous NEDD4L using N-SIM microscopy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay using HEK293T cells transiently co-transfected with HA-tagged NEDD4L and Flag-tagged LAPTM4B indicated that LAPTM4B physically binds to NEDD4L (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Furthermore, transfection with the HA-NEDD4L construct did not affect the levels of endogenous LAPTM4B, suggesting that LAPTM4B may not serve as a substrate for NEDD4L (Supplementary Figure S4A). Similar to LAPTM4B, overexpression of NEDD4L increased the ubiquitination level of SMAD3 under TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Exogenous expression of NEDD4L decreased TGF-β1-induced SMAD2 phosphorylation in A549 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Conversely, depletion of NEDD4L by siRNA transfection enhanced TGF-β1-induced SMAD2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Additionally, depletion of NEDD4L by siRNA transfection restored the suppressed phosphorylation level of SMAD2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G&amp;H</xref>) and the activity of SBE luciferase reporter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>) induced by LAPTM4B overexpression after TGF-β1 stimulation.

<title>AAV-mediated overexpression of Laptm4b alleviates BLM-induced lung fibrosis</title>
<p>Finally, the therapeutic potential of LAPTM4B was evaluated in the bleomycin-induced mouse model of lung fibrosis. Mice were administered adenovirus overexpressing Laptm4b (AAV-Laptm4b), while adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (AAV-Vector) served as the control. Fourteen days later, the mice were challenged with BLM for an additional 14 days (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Mice exposed to AAV-Laptm4b exhibited less weight loss following the BLM challenge (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).

Additionally, H&amp;E and Masson’s trichrome staining demonstrated that mice treated with AAV-Laptm4b had better-preserved lung architecture compared to those treated with AAV-Vector (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). These mice also showed significant reductions in Ashcroft scores (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>), inflammatory cells in BALF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>), lung weight-to-body weight ratios (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>), and lung hydroxyproline levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>) after the BLM challenge.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>IPF is a chronic and progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix, leading to lung scarring and respiratory impairment. Despite extensive research, the underlying molecular mechanisms driving IPF pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. In this study, the role of LAPTM4B in modulating the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway in the context of IPF was investigated. Present findings reveal a novel interaction between LAPTM4B and NEDD4L, shedding light on the regulatory mechanisms governing TGF-β-mediated fibrotic responses in IPF.</p>
<p>In the present study, LAPTM4B was found to be drastically reduced in the lung tissue of IPF subjects and in mice with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. This reduction was also observed in acute lung injury models induced by bleomycin or LPS, suggesting that the decrease in LAPTM4B may occur early after the initial injury and inflammation phase, and persist during disease progression. However, the mRNA level of LAPTM4B remained unaffected in these mouse models. Additionally, most bulk gene expression analysis datasets based on microarray or RNA-seq of IPF subjects did not show significant changes or yielded contradictory results regarding LAPTM4B mRNA levels. The inconsistent protein and mRNA levels of LAPTM4B and other LAPTM family members have been well documented in other diseases or animal models. For instance, in a murine model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, the level of Laptm4b protein, but not mRNA, in the heart was significantly downregulated compared to the sham control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Similarly, in Neonatal Rat Cardiac Myocytes (NRCMs) during hypoxia/reoxygenation, while protein level reduced significantly, the mRNA level of LAPTM4B remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). In another case, despite a significant decline at the protein level, the mRNA levels of LAPTM5 were not affected in both mouse model of Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and palmitic acid stimulated hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). These observations suggest that the loss of LAPTM4B in pulmonary fibrosis, as in other injury-related diseases, is limited to the protein level rather than the transcription level. This phenomenon may be related to the rapid turnover nature of LAPTM family proteins.</p>
<p>The present study demonstrated that normal levels of LAPTM4B are crucial for maintaining homeostasis in lung-derived epithelial and fibroblast cells, and suppress TGF-β1-induced fibrotic responses in both cell types. The TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway is the most prominent regulator of pro-fibrotic responses. In canonical TGF-β/SMAD signaling, TGF-β1 binds to TGFBR2, leading to the recruitment and phosphorylation of TGFBR1, which in turn phosphorylates downstream effector proteins known as SMADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Once phosphorylated, SMAD2 and SMAD3 form complexes with SMAD4, translocate into the nucleus, and regulate the transcription of target genes involved in fibrogenesis, including Collagen, Fibronectin, and α-SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several fibrotic disorders, particularly pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Aberrant activation of the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway promotes myofibroblast differentiation, excessive ECM deposition, and ultimately tissue scarring. Recent research has found that the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) enhances TGF-β/SMAD signaling and promotes profibrotic responses by disrupting the binding between SMAD7 and TGFBR1, reducing the ubiquitination and degradation of TGFBR1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Another research demonstrated that thioredoxin domain containing 5 (TXNDC5), an ER protein disulfide isomerase, is highly upregulated in IPF lungs and promotes fibrogenesis by enhancing TGF-β1 signaling through direct binding with and stabilization of TGFBR1 in lung fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). These findings highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying the TGF-β/SMAD pathway and underscore the potential for targeting these interactions to develop new therapeutic strategies for pulmonary fibrosis.</p>
<p>Ubiquitination plays a critical role in regulating the turnover and activity of key components of TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). For instance, ubiquitination of TGF-β receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2) can regulate their stability and endocytic trafficking, thereby influencing the duration and intensity of TGF-β signaling. Moreover, ubiquitination of SMAD proteins can regulate their transcriptional activity, stability, and subcellular localization, affecting downstream gene expression and cellular responses to TGF-β. E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as Smurf1, WWP1, NEDD4L and Arkadia, have been implicated in the ubiquitination and degradation of SMAD proteins, thereby acting as important regulators of TGF-β signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). The dynamic interplay between ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes finely tunes the activity of the TGF-β/SMAD pathway, contributing to the downstream cellular processes including fibrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Further investigation into the specific ubiquitination events and their functional consequences within the TGF-β/SMAD signaling cascade will provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying its physiological and pathological roles.</p>
<p>Indeed, LAPTM4B has been implicated in both receptor intracellular sorting and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). For instance, it impedes EGFR sorting by promoting the ubiquitination of Hrs (ESCRT-0 subunit), thus hindering Hrs from binding to ubiquitinate EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Consequently, this process effectively curtails EGF-induced EGFR intracellular sorting and lysosomal degradation, resulting in amplified and prolonged EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Moreover, a very recent study demonstrated LAPTM4B suppress the phosphorylation and ubiquitination degradation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in hepatocellular carcinoma, thereby preserving the stemness of the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). In the present observation, LAPTM4B interacts with TGFBR2, augmenting ubiquitination of TGFBR2 and active SMAD2/3, thus limited TGF-β/SMAD signaling. Given LAPTM4B is lack of inherent ubiquitin ligase activity, its participation in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation hinges on its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. Notably, several ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as SMURF1, SMURF2, NEDD4L, and WWP1, have been implicated in directly ubiquitination of TGF-β receptors and SMAD2/3, thereby contributing to the regulation of the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Members of the LAPTM family, including LAPTM5, LAPTM4A, and LAPTM4B, have been demonstrated to direct interact with NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase family proteins via their C-terminal PY motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). In current study, we demonstrated the co-localization and direct binding between LAPTM4B and NEDD4L, and clarifying that LAPTM4B is not a substrate for NEDD4L.</p>
<p>Previous researches have demonstrated declined NEDD4L expression in lung tissues from both IPF patients and bleomycin-induced mouse model of lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Conditional deletion of Nedd4l in lung epithelial cells causes progressive pulmonary fibrosis in both neonatal and adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Recent investigations have shown that NEDD4L exerts anti-fibrotic effects by facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) and TGFBR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) in lung fibroblasts. Similarly, we confirmed that NEDD4L reduced TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 by promoting ubiquitination of phosphorylation of SMAD2/3.</p>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that NEDD4L is primarily localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm. The current observation indicates that in addition to the cell membrane and cytoplasm, NEDD4L also accumulates in LAPTM4B-positive vesicular structures. Given our observation that TGFBR2 also localizes to LAPTM4B-positive vesicles and that SMAD2/3 aggregates in LAPTM4B-positive vesicles following TGF-β1 treatment, we speculated that LAPTM4B anchors NEDD4L and TGFBR2 on the membrane of endocytic vesicles, thereby reducing the spatial distance between NEDD4L and activated SMAD2/3. This may facilitates NEDD4L to more efficiently ubiquitinate the activated TGF-β receptor-SMAD2/3 complex, thereby negatively regulating the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. This hypothesis was further supported by LAPTM4B and NEDD4L are functionally interdependent.</p>
<p>Despite being an attractive target for IPF therapy, few candidates targeting the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway have even reached early-phase clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). This may attribute to the ubiquitous distribution of TGF-β receptors in various cell types and the vital role of TGF-β/SMAD in pleiotropic functions, including cellular proliferation, differentiation, and normal repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Therefore, finding more precise cellular and molecular targets to intervene is urgently needed. Despite NEDD4L also being found reduced in IPF and experimental fibrosis, we demonstrated that the protein level of LAPTM4B was nearly null at the very early stage after the initial lung injury. Loss of LAPTM4B may represent a rapid-response NEDD4L-mediated TGF-β/SMAD signaling switch which activates lung repair processes. On the other hand, preserved LAPTM4B levels in undamaged tissue and organs may block the action of paracrine and circulating TGF-β, thereby preventing the onset of fibrogenesis in unwanted areas. Thus, forced expression of LAPTM4B may offer the possibility to hijack the pathologically enhanced TGF-β/SMAD signaling in fibrotic areas to limit disease progression and to avoid the risk of severe side effects associated with direct inhibition. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that overexpression of Laptm4b exert therapeutic effects in bleomycin-induced mouse lung fibrosis.</p>
<p>This study has certain limitations that need to be addressed. Our in vivo research relied on the single-dose bleomycin mouse model, while this model closely mimics various pathological processes and characteristics observed in IPF, it cannot fully replicate the complexity of the disease due to our limited understanding of its mechanisms and inherent species differences between mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Moreover, although it has been demonstrated that tracheal instillation significantly reduces the systemic effects of AAV outside the lung, this cannot be completely ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Additionally, although our study explored the interplay between LAPTM4B and NEDD4L, the specific mechanisms underlying this interaction, particularly the role of PY motifs, have not been independently verified.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have elucidated a novel role of LAPTM4B in modulating the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway through its interaction with NEDD4L. This interaction impacts the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of key signaling molecules such as TGFBR2 and phosphorylated SMAD2/3, thereby regulating downstream responses associated with pulmonary fibrosis. These findings are of high interest because it may provide a possibility to curtail TGF-β-mediated fibrogenesis with minimum impact to healthy tissue. Further exploration of to identify the upper regulative mechanism of LAPTM4B level in repose to lung injury and fibrosis will add valuable insights into the complete LAPTM4B-NEDD4L-TGF-β/SMAD axis of IPF and may identify potential therapeutic targets IPF.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>Male wild-type C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old, weighing 18–22 g) were procured from Charles River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Male mice are exclusively used in the study because previous research has consistently shown that BLM-induced lung injury and fibrosis are more pronounced in male mice. This is a well-documented phenomenon that has led to the common practice of using only one gender in most studies. The mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment with controlled temperature and humidity, and a 12-hour light/dark cycle, and were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water. After acclimating to the environment for 1 week, the mice were subjected to gene knockdown or overexpression experiments in vivo. For gene knockdown, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and challenged with adeno-associated virus serotype 2/9 (AAV2/9) adenoviral particles (50 μL, 1.8×10<sup>^12</sup> Vg/mL, <italic>i.t.</italic>) containing plasmid vector (pAAV-U6-sh-<italic>Laptm4b</italic>-CMV-EGFP-WPRE, Ref Seq: NM_033521, target sequence: 5’-CCCGTTCTTCTGTTACCAGAT-3’) or equivalent adenoviral particles loaded with a non-target control vector (pAAV-U6-shRNA(NC2)-CMV-EGFP-WPRE, sequence: 5’-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTAA-3’), obtained from OBiO Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). For gene overexpression, 50 μL (2.0×10<sup>^12</sup> Vg/mL, <italic>i.t.</italic>) AAV2/9 adenoviral particles containing plasmid vector (pAAV-CMV-MCS-<italic>Laptm4b-</italic>3×Flag-EF1-GdGreen-WPRE, Ref Seq: NM_033521), or equivalent adenoviral particles loaded with pAAV-CMV-MCS-EF1-GdGreen-WPRE as control were administered. For inducing fibrosis, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and administered bleomycin (50 µL, 1.5 U/kg.bw, <italic>i.t.</italic>) or equivalent 0.9% saline as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Finally, 14 days after the BLM challenge, the mice were euthanized with 20% Ethyl Carbamate (800 mg/kg, <italic>i.p.</italic>) (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected via tracheal insertion, and lung samples were collected. For inducing acute lung injury (ALI), the mice were anesthetized and challenged with bleomycin (1.5 U/kg.bw, <italic>i.t.</italic>) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (4 mL/kg.bw, <italic>i.t.</italic>; Sigma-Aldrich), lung samples were collected 24 hours after the challenge. For marking ACE2s in vivo, <italic>Sftpc</italic>-CreERT2 and <italic>Rosa26R-CAG-lsl</italic>-tdTomato (<italic>R26R</italic>-tdTomato) mice were given 3-4 doses of tamoxifen (100 mg/kg, <italic>i.p.</italic>; Sigma-Aldrich).</p>

<title>Micro-CT Imaging</title>
<p>Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) imaging was performed prior to euthanasia of the mice, following a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Briefly, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and positioned in the supine orientation. Micro-CT imaging was conducted using a SkyScan 1276 micro-CT system (Bruker, Kontich, Belgium) with scanning parameters set at 60 kV X-ray tube voltage, 200 µA anode current, and a 0.5 mm aluminum filter. Subsequently, the obtained images underwent reconstruction and superimposition using Insta-Recon software (Version 2.1.0.00).</p>

<title>Lung histological analysis and immunohistochemical staining</title>
<p>For histological analysis, human lung tissue samples or mouse left lung lobes were fixed for 24 hours in 4% phosphate-buffered formalin (PFA), dehydrated using a gradient ethanol solution and xylene, and embedded in paraffin. The tissues were then sliced into 4 μm sections. Tissue slides were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with descending concentrations of ethanol solution, and rinsed with deionized water. Masson’s trichrome stain and H&amp;E stain were performed using a Masson’s trichrome staining kit (G1340, Solarbio, Beijing, China) or an H&amp;E staining kit (G1120, Solarbio), respectively, following the manufacturer’s protocols. For Ashcroft score analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>), five fields were randomly selected from each H&amp;E-stained lung section under 100× magnification. The average score for each field was independently determined by two pathologists in a blinded manner. For immunohistochemical staining, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating sections in a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution at room temperature for 30 min after antigen retrieval. The slides were then blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 1 hour. Primary antibodies were applied as indicated and incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 60 min at room temperature. Visualization was achieved by DAB staining, and counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. Images were captured using an Olympus BX43 upright microscope (Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<title>Hydroxyproline Assay</title>
<p>The quantification of hydroxyproline content in mouse lungs was conducted using a Hydroxyproline Assay Kit (MAK008, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Initially, fresh right mouse lungs were homogenized in 100 μL of deionized water for every 10 mg of tissue. Subsequently, an equal volume of 12 N HCl aqueous was added to the homogenate, and hydrolysis took place at 120°C for 3 hours in Teflon-capped vials. Following hydrolysis, the samples underwent centrifugation at 10,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min to eliminate any residues. Next, 10 μL of each sample was carefully transferred to a 96-well plate and evaporated at 60°C until completely dry. Subsequently, 100 μL of the Chloramine T/Oxidation buffer mixture was added to each sample, followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 min. This was followed by the addition of p-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde reagent (100 μL), and the mixture was further incubated for 90 min at 60°C. The absorbance at λ=560 nm of each well was measured using a BioTek ELX800 plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The hydroxyproline content in the samples was calculated based on the standard curve plotted using the hydroxyproline standard. The data were presented as µg of hydroxyproline per right lung.</p>

<title>Stable Cell Lines</title>
<p>To establish stable knockdown of LAPTM4B in A549 cells, we utilized independent small hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences specifically designed to target LAPTM4B (Ref Seq: NM_033521). The sh-<italic>LAPTM4B</italic> 1# sequence (TRCN0000150679) had the target sequence 5’-GATGATGTCATGTCAGTGAAT-3’, while the sh-<italic>LAPTM4B</italic> 2# sequence (TRCN0000150864) had the target sequence 5’-GATATGTGCTATGGCTACTTA-3’. These shRNA sequences were incorporated into the pLKO.1 vector. As a control, the pLKO.1 vector expressing a non-targeting shRNA (SHC016, Sigma-Aldrich) was used (sh-NC). The transfection of lentiviral plasmids containing the shRNA sequences, along with packaging plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2.G), was carried out using PEI on 293T cells. After 48-72 hours post-transfection, the lentiviral supernatant containing viral particles was collected and subsequently filtered through a 0.45 µm filter to remove cell debris. A549 cells were transduced with shRNA lentiviral particles in the presence of 5 mg/mL polybrene. Following transduction, positive selection was performed using puromycin (2 μg/mL; HY-B1743A, MCE) for duration of 7 days. Subsequently, the cells were maintained in completed medium supplemented with 2 μg/mL puromycin. This rigorous selection and maintenance process ensured the establishment of stable cell lines exhibiting LAPTM4B knockdown for further experimentation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors propose that LAPTM4B plays a role in suppressing the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway and suggest that enhancing LAPTM4B function could be a potential therapeutic strategy for alleviating BLM-induced lung fibrosis. Their data show that LAPTM4B knockdown exacerbates fibrosis phenotypes, both in vivo and in vitro, while LAPTM4B overexpression mitigates these effects by recruiting NEDD4L to destabilize SMAD proteins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings are significant for the lung disease field, and the data presented support the authors' conclusions. This work would be of even higher interest after sufficiently addressing the weaknesses listed below.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several issues need to be addressed. First, it is unclear why the authors chose to focus on LAPTM4B specifically, rather than other members of the LAPTM family, such as LAPTM4A or LAPTM5. Additionally, the manuscript does not address whether lysosomes are involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated LAPTM4B.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>It was previously documented that lysosomal localization of the Lysosomal transmembrane proteins LAPTM4 or 5 (including LAPTM4b) is regulated by Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases, and independently, that Nedd4l regulates IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) in mouse lungs via regulation of the TGFb pathway (ie, Nedd4l lung-specific KO mice develop IPF due to reduced ability to suppress the TGFb pathway -PMID: 32332792 ). Here, Xu et al investigated the role of LAPTM4b in IPF and suggested that the suppression of IPF by LAPTM4b, which they discovered here, is mediated via its interaction with Nedd4L, which normally suppresses TGFb signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting paper that identified for the first time a suppressive role of LAPTM4b in IPF, using both in vivo mouse models and cell culture studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The most obvious shortcoming of this study is the lack of experimental evidence that the suppressive effect of LAPTM4b on IPF is mediated by Nedd4l.</p>
<p>(2) Along the same lines, despite the authors' claim, overexpression of Nedd4L in cells does not increase SMAD3 ubiquitination (Fig 6D), which is a marker of TGFbR activation. Likewise, in Fig 5E, SMAD2 seems to be ubiquitinated similarly in the presence or absence of LAPTM4b (despite claims that LAPTM4b promotes ubiquitination of SMAD2). Same for K48 ubiquitination of TGFbR (Figure 5H).</p>
<p>(3) How does LAPTM4b interact with SMAD2 or 3, or TGFbR?</p>
<p>(4) All immunofluorescence (IF) studies depict 1 or 2 cells, with no quantification or statistics.</p>
<p>(5) Some of the Western blots (WB) are also not quantified, so any claims of an effect cannot be evaluated without such quantification and statistics.</p>
<p>(6) In the IF studies showing lung tissue (eg Figure 1B), why is LAPTM4b (wildtype) localized to the plasma membrane instead of lysosomes/endosomes?</p>
