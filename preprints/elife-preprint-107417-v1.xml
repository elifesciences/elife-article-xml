<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> is a global pathogen responsible for Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat, causing substantial yield losses and producing the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which poses a threat to both human and animal health. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Misato-Like protein (DML1) plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial function, yet its function in filamentous fungi remains unexplored. In this study, we characterized FgDML1 in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. FgDML1 interacts with the mitochondrial fission and fusion protein FgDnm1 to maintain mitochondrial stability, thereby positively regulating acetyl-CoA levels and ATP synthesis, which influences toxisome formation and ultimately affects DON toxin biosynthesis. Additionally, FgDML1 is involved in the regulation of toxin biosynthetic enzyme expression. In the ΔFgDML1 mutant, Complex III enzyme activity decreased, overexpression of complex III assembly factors <italic>FgQCR2</italic>, <italic>FgQCR8</italic>, and <italic>FgQCR9</italic> may induce conformational changes in the Qi-site protein, specifically altering the sensitivity of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to respiratory inhibitor cyazofamid not Qo-site inhibitor pyraclostrobin and other fungicides. Furthermore, the loss of FgDML1 leads to defects in nutrient utilization, as well as in asexual and sexual reproduction, and pathogenicity. In conclusion, this study identifies a novel regulatory role for FgDML1 in DON toxin biosynthesis and cyazofamid sensitivity in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Our study provides a theoretical framework for understanding DON biosynthesis regulation in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and identifies potential molecular targets for FHB control.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>, is a devastating fungal disease that affects cereal crops, leading to significant yield losses in wheat-growing regions worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dean et al., 2012</xref>). This disease is particularly concerning due to the production of various mycotoxins, including trichothecenes and zearalenone, during fungal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hai et al., 2023</xref>). Among these, deoxynivalenol (DON), a type of trichothecene, is the most commonly detected mycotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Merhej et al., 2011a</xref>). The DON toxin poses a serious threat to both human and animal health, significantly compromising immune and reproductive systems(EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) et al., 2017). Chronic exposure to DON can lead to anorexia, neurological disorders, and immune dysregulation, while acute high-dose exposure may result in vomiting, diarrhea, neurological disturbances, and even miscarriage or stillbirth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sumarah, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). Studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between elevated DON levels and the prevalence of FHB in infected crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bönnighausen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ilgen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mudge et al., 2006</xref>). As FHB continues to spread and its severity increases, DON contamination is emerging as a critical global concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Duan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). This highlights the need for effective strategies to manage and mitigate the impact of both the disease and the associated mycotoxin contamination.</p>
<p>The absence of resistant cultivars necessitates reliance on chemical methods as the primary approach for controlling FHB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). However, the inappropriate application of fungicides has led to the emergence of resistance, particularly against carbendazim, tebuconazole, and pyraclostrobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrade et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhou et al., 2024</xref>). Notably, carbendazim has been demonstrated to stimulate the biosynthesis of deoxynivalenol (DON) toxin, especially in fungicide-resistant populations of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, pyraclostrobin significantly promotes DON biosynthesis, with no selectivity between resistant and sensitive strains. Although tebuconazole has not been directly implicated in inducing DON production, it is classified as a fungicide with a moderate risk of resistance development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Duan et al., 2020</xref>). Field observations have revealed diverse resistance mechanisms to tebuconazole, complicating management efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). The potential evolution of resistance to tebuconazole is particularly concerning, as it could undermine its efficacy and exacerbate the challenge of controlling DON contamination. There is an urgent need for a fungicide that has not yet been used in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to address the DON toxin contamination caused by fungicide resistance. Cyazofamid is a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III inhibitor with demonstrated efficacy in controlling fungal diseases. It specifically binds to the Qi site of complex III, blocking the reduction of ubiquinone and inhibiting ATP synthesis, thereby exerting its fungicidal effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mitani et al., 2001</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether other proteins within the intricate regulatory network of the respiratory chain play a role in modulating fungal sensitivity to cyazofamid. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the potential involvement of these regulatory components.</p>
<p>The synthesis of deoxynivalenol (DON) toxin is primarily regulated by genes involved in trichothecene biosynthesis, known as <italic>FgTRIs</italic>. Many of these <italic>FgTRI</italic> genes have been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Merhej et al., 2011b</xref>). The initial step in DON synthesis is catalyzed by the trichothecene synthase <italic>FgTri5</italic>, which facilitates the cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to form trichodiene (TDN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>). However, before this catalytic process can occur, the organism must first obtain sufficient ATP from the mitochondria. ATP is critical not only for the basic cellular functions but also for driving several key reactions in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. Specifically, ATP is required for the enzymatic conversion of precursors, leading to the production of FPP, a vital intermediate in the trichothecene biosynthesis pathway. The availability of ATP therefore directly impacts the efficient synthesis of FPP, which, in turn, regulates the downstream production of DON toxin. Without an adequate supply of ATP, these biosynthetic pathways cannot proceed efficiently, thus hindering the synthesis of both the precursor molecules and the final toxin product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Misato-Like protein (DML1) encodes a Misato-like protein in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, an essential factor involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance. In addition to its role in mtDNA maintenance, DML is implicated in mitochondrial compartmentalization and chromosome segregation. The protein shares structural features with members of the GTPase family, suggesting potential involvement in GTP-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gurvitz et al., 2002</xref>). In <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, the DML protein is localized to the mitochondria, where silencing of DML results in a transition from a networked mitochondrial morphology to a fragmented form. This indicates that DML plays a critical role in mitochondrial distribution, morphological fusion, and overall mitochondrial dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kimura and Okano, 2007a</xref>). In prokaryotes, the homologous protein FtsZ, which shares functional similarities with DML, has been identified as a target for antimicrobial agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Vollmer, 2006</xref>). However, despite these insights from studies in the aforementioned organisms, the exact role of DML in filamentous fungi remains undetermined.</p>
<p>This study systematically characterized the functional roles of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Misato-Like protein (FgDML1) in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, including mycelial growth, asexual development, and sexual reproduction. More importantly, we found that FgDML1 reduces DON toxin synthesis by decreasing the enzyme activity of complex III, reducing ATP synthesis, and lowering acetyl-CoA accumulation. Furthermore, the deletion of FgDML1 results in compensatory upregulation of complex III assembly factors, which may alter the conformation of the Qi site protein and subsequently modulates sensitivity to cyazofamid.</p>

<title>Identification, deletion, and complementation of FgDML1</title>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Misato-Like (DML1) protein from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was used as a query for a BLAST search against the Fusarium genome database, resulting in the identification of the putative DML1 gene FgDML1 (FGSG_05390) in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. The FgDML1 gene is 1455 bp in length, contains three introns, and encodes a 484-amino acid protein with 23.88% homology to its counterpart in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using DML1 sequences from other species obtained via NCBI, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Structural analysis revealed the presence of the Misat_Tub_SegII and Tubulin_3 domains. Furthermore, subcellular localization studies confirmed that FgDML1 localizes to mitochondria, as demonstrated by colocalization with a mitochondria-specific dye (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the function of FgDML1, ΔFgDML1 deletion mutant was constructed and validated via PCR and Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2</xref>), confirming the mutant as a single-copy knockout. To ensure that the observed phenotypes were specifically attributable to the deletion of FgDML1, an in situ complemented mutant, ΔFgDML1-C, was generated to restore FgDML1.</p>

<title>FgDML1 is essential for virulence</title>
<p>To investigate the role of FgDML1 in virulence, pathogenicity assays were performed on wheat coleoptiles and wheat leaves. The results revealed that ΔFgDML1 caused only restricted infection at the inoculation site on wheat coleoptiles and failed to induce systemic infection, in contrast to PH-1 and ΔFgDML1-C, which exhibited extensive colonization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Similarly, ΔFgDML1 displayed a near-complete loss of virulence on wheat leaves (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). These findings demonstrate that FgDML1 is a critical positive regulator of virulence in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>

<title>FgDML1 is indispensable for DON toxin synthesis</title>
<p>To evaluate whether the deletion of FgDML1 influences DON production, DON levels were measured under toxin-inducing conditions. The results revealed that DON production in ΔFgDML1 was reduced by nearly 80% compared to PH-1 and significantly lower than that of both PH-1 and ΔFgDML1-C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). To further elucidate the regulatory relationship between FgDML1 and DON biosynthesis, the transcriptional levels of <italic>FgTri5</italic> and <italic>FgTri6</italic> were analyzed and found to be significantly downregulated in ΔFgDML1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Moreover, examination of toxisomes in the mutant demonstrated that their formation was severely impaired, with almost no detectable toxisomes in ΔFgDML1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Western blot analysis of the DON toxin marker protein FgTri1 further conirmed its markedly reduced levels in ΔFgDML1 compared to PH-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). These findings suggest that FgDML1 is essential for regulating DON production in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>

<title>The deletion of FgDML1 results in reduced synthesis of both ATP and acetyl-CoA</title>
<p>The results showed that ATP levels in ΔFgDML1 were significantly lower compared to PH-1 and ΔFgDML1-C (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Previous studies have established a positive correlation between ATP levels and acetyl-CoA. Consistent with this, acetyl-CoA levels in ΔFgDML1 were also significantly reduced compared to the controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In conclusion, the deletion of FgDML1 leads to a reduction in both the key energy molecule ATP and the DON precursor acetyl-CoA.</p>

<title>FgDML1 regulates mitochondrial morphology by interacting with FgDnm1</title>
<p>To assess whether the loss of FgDML1 induces mitochondrial alterations, mitochondria-specific dyes were utilized, revealing fragmented mitochondria in the ΔFgDML1 mutant, whereas PH-1 and ΔFgDML1-C displayed a typical network-like mitochondrial distribution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Further analysis via TEM identified damaged mitochondrial structures in the ΔFgDML1 mutant, in contrast to the well-preserved mitochondrial morphology observed in the control strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Given that FgDnm1 is known to be a critical protein for mitochondrial fission, the interaction between FgDML1 and FgDnm1 was verified through co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).

<p>Since Complex III is involved in the action of both cyazofamid (targeting the QI site) and pyraclostrobin (targeting the QO site) fungicides, the sensitivity of ΔFgDML1 to trifloxystrobin was investigated. The results showed that the deletion of FgDML1 did not alter sensitivity to a pyraclostrobin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). ΔFgDML1 was subsequently treated with pyraclostrobin or cyazofamid, and Complex III enzyme activity was measured. After pyraclostrobin treatment, no significant change in enzyme activity was observed in ΔFgDML1 compared to PH-1 and ΔFgDML1-C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). However, when treated with cyazofamid, a significant increase in Complex III enzyme activity was observed in ΔFgDML1, while the control groups maintained relatively low enzyme activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). These findings, combined with the upregulation of assembly factors, suggest that the elevated expression of assembly factors alters the protein conformation at the QI site, modulating sensitivity to cyazofamid.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Misato Protein was originally identified in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where it was reported to play essential roles in mitochondrial DNA inheritance, cell division, and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Miklos et al., 1997</xref>). However, its functional characterization in filamentous fungi remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified and analyzed the homolog FgDML1 in the phytopathogenic fungus <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. The FgDML1 protein contains conserved Misato_Tub_SegII and Tubulin_3 domains, with high homology observed among species within the <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus but significant genetic divergence from other taxa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, DML1 is a critical regulator of mitochondrial fission and fusion dynamics, maintaining intracellular energy homeostasis by modulating mitochondrial morphology and distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gurvitz et al., 2002</xref>). Our study demonstrated that FgDML1 localized to mitochondria in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Deletion mutants of FgDML1 exhibited phenotypes indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction, including fragmented mitochondrial morphology (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). TEM further confirmed structural and dynamic damage to mitochondria in the ΔFgDML1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Structural analysis suggests that DML1 shares similarities with GTPase family proteins, indicating potential GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gurvitz et al., 2002</xref>). GTPases primarily hydrolyze GTP, but their activity is intricately linked to ATP production and utilization. These enzymes regulate critical cellular processes such as energy metabolism, signal transduction, protein synthesis, and cytoskeletal remodeling, all of which influence ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mrnjavac and Martin, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pb et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rogne et al., 2018</xref>). In agreement with this, we observed a significant reduction in ATP content in the FgDML1 deletion mutant, underscoring its role in mitochondrial energy metabolism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, DML1 also localizes to mitochondria, where its silencing results in fragmented and aggregated mitochondria with reduced network continuity and fusion activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kimura and Okano, 2007b</xref>). Our findings indicate that FgDML1 plays a conserved role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy homeostasis. Notably, FgDML1 was found to interact with FgDnm1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), FgDnm1 is a key dynamin-related protein mediating mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Griffin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kang et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that FgDML1 may form a complex with FgDnm1 to regulate mitochondrial fission and fusion processes. To our knowledge, this is the first report documenting an interaction between DML1 and Dnm in any fungal species, including model organisms such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This novel finding provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dynamics in filamentous fungi.</p>
<p>The silencing of ATP synthase subunit α (AtpA) has been shown to reduce ATP synthesis and inhibit the biosynthesis of TcdA and TcdB toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marreddy et al., 2024</xref>). In plants, the production of secondary metabolites often demands substantial energy, with ATP serving as the primary energy carrier within cells. When ATP levels are depleted, plants may prioritize growth and development by reducing the synthesis of certain secondary metabolites, including toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Xiao et al., 2024</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, deoxynivalenol (DON) toxin, a highly harmful mycotoxin and secondary metabolite, requires sufficient energy for its biosynthesis. In our study, the ATP content in the FgDML1 deletion mutant was significantly lower, and DON production was markedly reduced, compared to the wild-type PH-1 and the complementary mutant ΔFgDML1-C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Reduced ATP levels disrupt the formation of toxisomes, which are critical for DON toxin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tang et al., 2018</xref>), and the ΔFgDML1 strain is unable to form functional toxisomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Western blot analysis also confirmed a significant reduction in the protein expression of FgTri1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). DON production is predominantly regulated by Tri genes, with <italic>Tri5</italic> and <italic>Tri6</italic> serving as critical components in the biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kimura et al., 2001</xref>). Tri5 encodes trichodiene synthase, the key enzyme catalyzing the first step of DON biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Huang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, the expression levels of <italic>FgTri5</italic> and <italic>FgTri6</italic> were significantly downregulated in the FgDML1 deletion mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). To our knowledge, no research has yet elucidated a regulatory role for DML in gene expression in either <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> or <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. However, given its established functions in cell division and microtubule organization, FgDML1 might indirectly influence gene expression by modulating chromatin structure or cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Schulze and Wallrath, 2007</xref>). Investigating this hypothesis will be a key focus of our future research. Given this substantial reduction in DON production, we investigated whether the precursor for DON biosynthesis, acetyl-CoA, was also affected. Results revealed a significant decrease in acetyl-CoA levels in the ΔFgDML1 mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In conclusion, reduced ATP levels impair toxin body formation, leading to lower toxin production. Additionally, decreased acetyl-CoA disrupts the availability of essential precursors for DON toxin synthesis, further decreasing its production. The combined effects of these factors result in a significant reduction in DON toxin biosynthesis.</p>
<p><italic>F. graminearum</italic> is a highly destructive pathogen that poses a significant threat to wheat production worldwide. Cyazofamid is an effective fungicide commonly used to control plant pathogenic fungi. Cyazofamid specifically targets the Qi site of complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bolgunas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mitani et al., 2001</xref>). Complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex, plays a critical role in the electron transport chain by transferring electrons from ubiquinone to cytochrome c and pumping protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fernández-Ortuño et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sarewicz et al., 2013</xref>). This complex consists of several core subunits, including cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and iron-sulfur proteins, as well as multiple assembly factors. It contains two quinone binding sites: the Qo site (quinone oxidation site) and the Qi site (quinone reduction site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Vercellino and Sazanov, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zara et al., 2009</xref>). In our study, we observed that the deletion of FgDML1 significantly reduced the sensitivity of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to cyazofamid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), while its sensitivity to pyraclostrobin remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In the ΔFgDML1 mutant, we detected a decrease in complex III enzyme activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) and noted the upregulation of assembly factors <italic>FgQCR2</italic>, <italic>FgQCR7</italic>, and <italic>FgQCR8</italic> following cyazofamid treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Further enzyme activity assays revealed that after pyraclostrobin treatment, ΔFgDML1 exhibited a 73.06% reduction in complex III activity, compared to an 80.38% decrease in the wild-type strain PH-1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Interestingly, after cyazofamid treatment, the decrease in enzyme activity in ΔFgDML1 was only 36.31%, while PH-1 showed a dramatic 83.46% reduction in complex III activity. <italic>FgQCR2</italic>, <italic>FgQCR7</italic>, and <italic>FgQCR8</italic> are critical assembly factors that play essential roles in the proper assembly of complex III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhan et al., 2024</xref>). These factors stabilize the core subunit structure, promoting correct folding and functional operation of complex III, particularly during the assembly of the Qi site. This ensures the proper formation and function of the Qi site, thus supporting the normal operation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain(Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zara et al., 2007</xref>). Given the role of FgDML1 in mitochondrial homeostasis, we further evaluated the sensitivity of the ΔFgDML1 mutant to other commonly used respiratory chain inhibitors, including pydiflumetofen, fluxapyroxad, fluopyram, and trifloxystrobin. The results indicated that FgDML1 deletion had no impact on the sensitivity of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to these fungicides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S3</xref>). In conclusion, our findings suggest that the overexpression of assembly factors <italic>FgQCR2</italic>, <italic>FgQCR7</italic>, and <italic>FgQCR8</italic> in ΔFgDML1 alters the conformation of the Qi site, which specifically modulates the sensitivity of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to cyazofamid.</p>
<p>In <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, mutations or deletions in DML1 are associated with mitochondrial diseases characterized by early-onset myopathy and cerebellar ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nasca et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, the deletion of FgDML1 in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> resulted in significant defects in vegetative growth, including a markedly reduced growth rate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) and an aberrant, excessively curved hyphal morphology (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Notably, the loss of FgDML1 rendered <italic>F. graminearum</italic> incapable of completing sexual reproduction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), thereby potentially reducing its primary inoculum sources. Additionally, the deletion of FgDML1 impaired asexual reproduction and pathogenicity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), critical factors for fungal survival and host infection. Furthermore, the ΔFgDML1 mutant exhibited altered responses to various stress conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), suggesting a broader role for FgDML1 in regulating fungal stress tolerance.</p>
<p>In the present study, FgDML1 is localized to the mitochondria and interacted with FgDnm1, a key regulator of mitochondrial morphology, positively regulates ATP and acetyl-CoA levels, influences toxin body formation, and ultimately leads to a significant reduction in DON toxin biosynthesis. Furthermore, deletion of FgDML1 impairs the enzymatic activity of Complex III, which subsequently induces the upregulation of the assembly factors FgQCR2, FgQCR8, and FgQCR9, resulting in conformational changes at the Qi site of Complex III and decreased sensitivity to cyazofamid. In addition, the absence of FgDML1 has profound effects on pathogenicity, fungal development, and mitochondrial morphology. Based on these findings, we propose a working model delineating the role of FgDML1 in regulating DON toxin biosynthesis and cyazofamid sensitivity in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This study not only provides a theoretical basis for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying toxin biosynthesis in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> but also identifies potential molecular targets for the development of novel agents to control FHB.</p>

To investigate toxisome morphology, the ΔFgDML1::Tri1+GFP mutant was cultured in TBI medium at 28°C with shaking for 36 hours, and the structural dynamics of toxisomes within the mycelium were visualized using Tri1-GFP fluorescence under confocal microscopy. Additionally, mitochondrial morphology was evaluated by culturing PH-1, ΔFgDML1, and ΔFgDML1-C in YEPD medium under identical conditions, followed by staining with MitoTracker Red CMXRos and confocal microscopy analysis to assess mitochondrial structural alterations, distribution, and dynamics. For ultrastructural observations, mycelial samples were fixed and dehydrated according to standard protocols, embedded, sectioned, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was examined using a Tecnai G2 Spirit Bio electron microscope (Thermo, MA, USA) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV to compare the structural integrity and morphological differences among the strains.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and RT-qPCR assays</title>
<p>The test strains were transferred to liquid AEA medium and incubated at 25°C for 48 hours, with cyazofamid added to a final concentration of 20 µg/mL. The control group was not treated with any fungicide. To measure the transcriptional levels of genes involved in DON biosynthesis, the test strains were transferred to TBI medium and incubated for 3 days. Mycelium was collected and total RNA was extracted following the instructions provided by the kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China). cDNA synthesis was performed using Evo M-MLV Mix Kit (Accurate, Hunan, China). reverse transcription. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out using the QuantStudio 6 Flex real-time PCR system (Thermo, Fisher Scientific, USA) to assess the relative expression of three subunits of Complex III (<italic>FgCytb</italic>, <italic>FgCytc1</italic>, <italic>FgISP</italic>), five assembly factors (<italic>FgQCR2</italic>, <italic>FgQCR6</italic>, <italic>FgQCR7</italic>, <italic>FgQCR8</italic>, <italic>FgQCR9</italic>), and DON biosynthesis-related genes (<italic>FgTri5</italic> and <italic>FgTri6</italic>). The <italic>FgCox1</italic> gene was used as the reference gene for <italic>FgCytb</italic>, while <italic>FgGapdh</italic> was used as the reference for the other genes. Relative transcript levels were calculated using the 2<sup>-ΔΔCT</sup> method.</p>

<title>Western Blot assay and Co-IP assay</title>
<p>Total protein extraction was performed according to previously established protocols, and the extracted proteins were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Billerica, USA). The membrane was probed with GFP antibody D191040 (BBI, Shanghai, China) and Flag antibody 30501ES60 (Yeasen, Shanghai, China). The FgDnm1-3×Flag construct was introduced into PH-1 and FgDML1-GFP, respectively. All tagged mutant strains were subjected to triple validation, including PCR, sequencing, and Western blot analysis. Total protein from tagged strains was incubated with ChromoTek GFP-Trap® Magnetic Agarose (ChromoTek, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany) beads. Proteins eluted from the beads were further co-incubated with GFP or Flag antibodies for detection. Gapdh antibody 60004-1-Ig (Proteintech, Rosemont, USA) was used as an internal control for protein normalization. Chemiluminescent detection was performed following incubation with the corresponding secondary antibody.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their study, the authors investigated the F. graminearum homologue of the Drosophila Misato-Like Protein DML1 for a function in secondary metabolism and sensitivity to fungicides.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Generally, the topic of the study is interesting and timely, and the manuscript is well written, albeit in some cases, details on methods or controls are missing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, a major problem I see is with the core result of the study, the decrease in the DON content associated with the deletion of FgDML1. Although some growth data are shown in Figure 6, indicating a severe growth defect, the DON production presented in Figure 3 is not related to biomass. Also, the method and conditions for measuring DON are not described. Consequently, it could well be concluded that the decreased amount of DON detected is simply due to decreased growth, and the specific DON production of the mutant remains more or less the same.</p>
<p>To alleviate this concern, it is crucial to show the details on the DON measurement and growth conditions and to relate the biomass formation under the same conditions to the DON amount detected. Only then can a conclusion as to an altered production in the mutant strains be drawn.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Mitochondrial Protein FgDML1 Regulates DON Toxin Biosynthesis and Cyazofamid Sensitivity in Fusarium graminearum by affecting mitochondrial homeostasis&quot; identified the regulatory effect of FgDML1 in DON toxin biosynthesis and sensitivity of Fusarium graminearum to cyazofamid. The manuscript provides a theoretical framework for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of DON toxin biosynthesis in F. graminearum and identifies potential molecular targets for Fusarium head blight control. The paper is innovative, but there are issues in the writing that need to be addressed and corrected.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors speculate that cyazofamid treatment caused upregulation of the assembly factors, leading to a change in the conformation of the Qi protein, thus restoring the enzyme activity of complex III. But no speculation was given in the discussion as to why this would lead to the upregulation of assembly factors, and how the upregulation of assembly factors would change the protein conformation, and is there any literature reporting a similar phenomenon? I would suggest adding this to the discussion.</p>
<p>(2) Would increased sensitivity of the mutant to cell wall stress be responsible for the excessive curvature of the mycelium?</p>
<p>(3) The vertical coordinates of Figure 7B need to be modified with positive inhibition rates for the mutants.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript &quot;Mitochondrial 1 protein FgDML1 regulates DON toxin biosynthesis and cyazofamid sensitivity in Fusarium graminearum by affecting mitochondrial homeostasis&quot; describes the construction of a null mutant for the FgDML1 gene in F. graminearum and assays characterising the effects of this mutation on the pathogen's infection process and lifecycle. While FgDML1 remains underexplored with an unclear role in the biology of filamentous fungi, and although the authors performed several experiments, there are fundamental issues with the experimental design and execution, and interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>FgDML1 is an interesting target, and there are novel aspects in this manuscript. Studies in other organisms have shown that this protein plays important roles in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance, mitochondrial compartmentalisation, chromosome segregation, mitochondrial distribution, mitochondrial fusion, and overall mitochondrial dynamics. Indeed, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mutation is lethal. The authors have carried out multi-faceted experiments to characterise the mutants.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, I have concerns about how the study was conceived. Given the fundamental importance of mitochondrial function in eukaryotic cells and how the absence of this protein impacts these processes, it is unsurprising that deletion of this gene in F. graminearum profoundly affects fungal biology. Therefore, it is misleading to claim a direct link between FgDML1 and DON toxin biosynthesis (and virulence), as the observed effects are likely indirect consequences of compromised mitochondrial function. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that the production of all secondary metabolites is affected to some extent in the mutant strains and that such a strain would not be competitive at all under non-laboratory conditions. The order in which the authors present the results can be misleading, too. The results on vegetative growth rate appeared much later in the manuscript, which should have come first, as the FgDML1 mutant exhibited significant growth defects, and subsequent results should be discussed in that context. Moreover, the methodologies are not described properly, making the manuscript hard to follow and difficult to replicate.</p>
