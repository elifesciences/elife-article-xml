<title>Abstract</title><p>The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape the evolution of life. During this process, the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. To further understand the interaction between viruses and receptors, our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA in vertebrates. Firstly, the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation response (HDGCR) being the main pathway. Our further analysis suggested that MDA5, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA and bind STING for signal transduction, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. In summary, our study has revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, which providing valuable insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can be classified into three main groups: toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-induced RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). The PRRs recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs, including proteins, lipids and nucleotides, resulting in activation of innate immune responses of host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. TLRs are located on the cell membrane and recognize PAMPs outside the cell, while RLRs and NLRs are located within the cytoplasm and recognize PAMPs inside the cell. RLRs are a specific group of PRRs belonging to the family of DExD/H-box RNA helicases, and they play a crucial role in the innate antiviral response. There are three members in the RLR family: retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2). RIG-I and MDA5 exhibit similar signaling characteristics and structural homology, including two N-terminal caspase-recruitment domains (CARDs), a DExD/H box RNA helicase domain, and a C-terminal repressor domain (RD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, LGP2 lacks CARD domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The specific roles of RIG-I and MDA5 in response to virus stimulation are not redundant: RIG-I detects short blunt-end RNA with a 5’-triphosphate motif (5’ppp-RNA), while MDA5 specifically recognizes long forms of viral dsRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In contrast, the involvement of LGP2 in cytosolic RNA sensing remains a topic of debate. Some studies have proposed that LGP2 is crucial for the production of type L interferon (IFN-L) in response to several RIG-I- and MDA5-dependent viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, whereas others have described LGP2 as a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. However, surprisingly, despite the important immune functions of RLR members, they have been lost from the genome in many species including mammals, birds, and fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>5’ppp-RNA contains a wide variety of RNA viruses, including Flaviviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. These viruses widely infect all kinds of life and cause various harmfulness and serious diseases, and the infected hosts range from the highest vertebrates to the lowest vertebrate, teleost fish. In mammals, the harmfulness and serious diseases caused by many 5’ppp-RNA viruses in mammals are well known. For example, the genus <italic>Lyssavirus</italic> which belongs to the rhabdovirus infect only mammals and can cause fatal encephalitis (rabies)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, the coronavirus is a highly infectious virus that can cause respiratory infections and potentially lead to severe health conditions, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. While in non-mammalian vertebrates, the interactions with the host by the 5’ppp-RNA viruses are not well known. 5’ppp-RNA viruses are expected to be recognized and trigger an antiviral immune response by RIG-I. However, RIG-I is lacking in many non-mammalian vertebrates, so who then recognizes 5’ppp-RNA in these species? One candidate gene that may play this role is yet unknown. When a gene is functionally inactive or lost, other genes or pathways may undergo genetic compensation response (GCR) to maintain organismal balance. One important mechanism to achieve GCR is through homology-dependent genetic compensation response (HDGCR), organisms often have the ability to intelligently evolve and utilize homologous genes to compensate for the functional loss caused by the loss of a certain gene. The pressure from viral infections has led to the evolution of the immune system, and the loss of RIG-I may be accompanied by functional substitution by homologous genes in order to compensate for the loss of RIG-I function.</p>
<p>For millions of years, viruses have coevolved with their hosts, leading to the development of various mechanisms for immune evasion in response to the mutual evolutionary pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. These mechanisms involve the utilization of viral genes, proteins, and miRNA elements to counteract the host’s innate immune response, cell apoptosis, and adaptive immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Innate immunity functions as the initial defense against viral infection by identifying pathogenic components through PRRs. Consequently, the exploration of how viruses employ evolutionary strategies to evade different components of innate immunity, particularly through evasion of IFN responses, has garnered significant attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. According to reports, viruses can employ various strategies to evade the immune system, including hiding their own genomic material, inhibiting critical host proteins, and modulating phosphorylation and ubiquitination pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. For example, the encapsidation of the viral RNA by the viral nucleoprotein and polymerase prevents RIG-I binding and its subsequent activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, many viruses encode dsRNA-binding proteins (such as influenza virus NS1, vaccinia virus E3L, Ebola virus VP35, reovirus s3, bunya virus NSs, or herpes virus US11), which have been postulated to sequester the viral dsRNA from cellular dsRNA sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In fish, there are also examples of viral immune escape, where they can utilize the immune evasion strategies mentioned above to escape IFN-mediated immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Recently, it is reported that N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification also plays a crucial role in enabling viruses to evade the interferon (IFN) response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is an important epigenetic modification that involves the dynamic and reversible process of RNA methylation, regulated by methylase (writer), demethylase (eraser), and reader proteins that recognize m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Viruses can not only use m<sup>6</sup>A modification to hide themselves and avoid recognition by host receptors but also manipulate host gene expression through m<sup>6</sup>A modification to enable immune evasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Fish and birds are commonly observed to exhibit “RIG-I deficiency” phenomena, and they are also the most abundant groups of aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates respectively, giving them certain evolutionary advantages. As a result, they are considered as a model group for studying the arms race between MDA5 receptors and 5’ppp-RNA, and researching the immune evolution of them helps us to understand the immune evolution of the entire vertebrates. Meanwhile, fish and birds are major source of high-quality protein for human consumption, viral diseases in aquaculture and livestock industry pose serious obstacles to the industry’s healthy development. Among them, the 5’ppp-RNA virus, as mentioned earlier, is a highly pathogenic group. Within this group, siniperca cheats rhabdovirus (SCRV) is an important pathogen that can cause huge economic losses and serious threats to aquaculture in freshwater and marine fish. Therefore, in this study, we selected teleost fish miiuy croaker (<italic>Miichthys miiuy</italic>) and bird chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>), two vertebrates lacking RIG-I, to investigate the evolutionary strategies and interactions between 5’ppp-RNA virus and host. The final results demonstrated that fish MDA5 can recognize SCRV(one 5’ppp-RNA virus) and initiate signal transduction to activate IFN immune response, and the MDA5 of fish and birds lacking RIG-I both evolved the ability to recognize 5’ppp-RNA. In addition, SCRV can in turn utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A strategy to degrade MDA5 for immune evasion. In summary, these findings shed light on the functional diversity of innate antiviral activity and unveil a complex arms race between virus replication and the innate immunity of its reservoir hosts in vertebrates. In addition, since the loss of RIG-I in vertebrates is a widespread event, our research also provides a new perspective for vertebrate groups that have lost RIG-I.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>A genetic compensation response model for RIG loss</title>
<p>In previous studies, it has been reported that a few vertebrates lost the RIG-I gene during evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To investigate this further, we utilized the recent advancements in available and comprehensive genomic data of vertebrates from the NCBI and Ensemble websites. By analyzing the genomes of various species, we determined the presence and absence of the RIG-I gene. As depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, the absence of the RIG-I gene does not appear to be uncommon in vertebrates, with at least three independent loss events observed in mammals, birds and fish, respectively. These gene-loss events occurred over a long evolutionary timescale. Based on the minimum age of the common ancestor of RIG-I-missing species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.timetree.org/">http://www.timetree.org/</ext-link>), the oldest recorded losses occurring in species like <italic>Erpetoichthys calabaricus</italic>, can be traced back to approximately 330 million years ago (MYA). Conversely, the detected loss in <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> took place less than 42 MYA. To gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of vertebrate RIG-I, we explored the conservation of the genes surrounding RIG-I. We analyzed the genome sequences of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, <italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, and <italic>M. miiuy</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar to the slow-evolving <italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic>, humans possess RIG-I with TOPORS and ACO1 as its upstream and downstream genes, respectively. As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. <italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, and <italic>M. miiuy</italic> do not have RIG-I. Interestingly, zebrafish has a RIG-I with its upstream gene being TOPORSb, seemingly a result of chromosome fragment duplication. However, the downstream gene of TOPORSa is missing a RIG-I, indicating that one of the RIG-I copies has been lost in zebrafish, similar to <italic>M. miiuy</italic>.</p>

<p>RIG-I plays a critical role in the innate immune system’s response to viral infection, specifically by detecting 5’ppp-RNA viruses which are highly detrimental to vertebrate animals, thus the depletion of this gene is anticipated to greatly affect the immune response. Therefore, understanding the biological effects of RIG-I deficiency in vertebrates is essential for comprehending the origin and development of innate immunity. Homology-dependent genetic compensation response (HDGCR) is one of the important mechanisms through which GCR is achieved, and organisms often evolve the intelligent ability to compensate for the loss of a gene by utilizing homologous genes to compensate for the functional loss. In this study, we observed that teleost fish <italic>M. miiuy,</italic> one lower vertebrate, lacks the RIG-I gene. We conducted a protein structure analysis on <italic>M. miiuy</italic> MDA5 and LGP2, which are homologues of RIG-I, and observed that LGP2 lacks the CARD domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), potentially rendering it unable to transmit signals but instead functioning as an intermediate regulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. RIG-I’s specific recognition of 5’ppp-RNA prompted us to investigate whether MDA5, a structurally similar homolog to RIG-I, can substitute for RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA in vertebrates without RIG-I (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.2</label><title>MDA5 promotes host antiviral innate immunity</title>
<p>To further investigate the alternative immune function of MDA5, we first investigated the fish MDA5-mediated signaling pathway in response to 5’ppp-RNA SCRV and double-stranded mimetic poly(I:C) infection. Two siRNA molecules (si-MDA5-1 and si-MDA5-2) were designed to assess the function of MDA5. si-MDA5-1 demonstrated higher inhibitory efficiency compared to si-MDA5-2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, si-MDA5-1 (referred to as si-MDA5) was selected for subsequent experiments. Subsequently, we constructed the MDA5 expression plasmid and confirmed its cytoplasmic localization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). MDA5 is capable of binding not only to MAVS but also to STING to effectively transmit signals after virus infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Considering that mammalian MDA5 activates NF-κB and IRF3/IRF7 to induce IFNs, we investigated whether fish MDA5 could impact these pathways. Dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that knockdown of MDA5 significantly inhibits NF-κB, IRF3, IRF7, and IFN-1 reporter genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, we investigated the role of MDA5 in regulating the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are crucial effectors. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-1H</xref>, we observed that knockdown or overexpression of MDA5 can significantly inhibit or promote the expression levels of IFN-1, Mx1, ISG15, and Viperin upon SCRV or poly(I:C) infection. To visually represent the biological significance of MDA5 in SCRV-induced host cells, we utilized the virus plaque and qPCR methods to examine whether it could influence viral replication. As demonstrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I-1L</xref>, knockdown of MDA5 led to a significant increase in viral plaque formation and promoted SCRV replication in SCRV-infected cells, while overexpression had the opposite effect. Overall, these findings indicate that MDA5 plays a positive role in regulating the antiviral responses of teleost.</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>RD domain is required for MDA5 to recognize SCRV</title>
<p>We investigated whether <italic>M. miiuy</italic> MDA5, in the absence of RIG-I, can directly bind to the RNA of SCRV, a 5’ppp-RNA virus. To address this question, we precipitated the MDA5 protein from SCRV-infected MKC cells that were transfected with MDA5-Flag and pcDNA3.1-Flag. The bound RNA was then amplified using SCRV-specific primers or β-actin primers as a control. Our results showed that MDA5 interacted with SCRV, while β-actin mRNA did not associate with MDA5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) of RIG-I binds to viral RNA in a triphosphate-dependent manner, to determine if the RD domain of MDA5 has similar functions, we generated truncated mutations called MDA5-ΔRD and Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of MDA5 and MDA5-ΔRD plasmids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We subsequently noted that MDA5-ΔRD exhibited an inability to interact with SCRV, which was supported by the loss of its immunological capability in inhibiting SCRV viral replication. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-3E</xref>). We also examined the effects of MDA5 and its mutant on antiviral factors in both uninfected and SCRV-infected MKC cells. In the absence of infection, overexpression of both MDA5 and MDA5-ΔRD stimulated the expression of antiviral genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). However, when cells were infected with SCRV, only the overexpression of MDA5, not MDA5-ΔRD, significantly increased the expression of antiviral genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). In summary, these findings provided evidence that MDA5 may recognize 5’-triphosphate-dependent RNA (5’ppp-RNA) through its RD domain.</p>

<label>2.4</label><title>MDA5 recognizes 5’ppp-RNA in vertebrates lacking RIG-I</title>
<p>To provide specific evidence of MDA5 recognition of 5’ppp-RNA in vertebrates lacking RIG-I, we synthesized 5’ppp-RNA and purified recombinant MDA5 of <italic>Miichthys miiuy</italic> and <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> (two species of vertebrates lacking RIG-I). 62 nt 5’ppp-RNA from the negative-strand RNA virus Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) and 112 bp dsRNA from the MDA5 gene sequence was generated through in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase. Gel analysis and nuclease sensitivity confirmed the generation of a single RNA product of the expected size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The RNA pull-down experiment showed that 5’ppp-RNA can be recognized by <italic>Miichthys miiuy</italic> MDA5 (mmiMDA5), similar to 112 bp blunt end dsRNA which is one known MDA5 ligand (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, biotin-labeled 5’ppp-RNA captured mmiMDA5, while the biotin-labeled mutant types (5’-OH-RNA and 5’pppGG-RNA) did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Additionally, when recombinant mmiMDA5 was subjected to an electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a biotin-labeled 5’ppp-RNA probe, a clear complex was detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). This complex formation was inhibited by adding an excess of cold 5’ppp-RNA but not 5’-OH-RNA and 5’pppGG-RNA, demonstrating the direct interaction between mmiMDA5 and 5’ppp-RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Next, we investigated whether <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> MDA5 (ggaMDA5) shares the ability to recognize 5’ppp-RNA seen in fish, the RNA pull-down and EMSA experiments provided evidence that ggaMDA5 can also recognize 5’ppp-RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-4H</xref>). Overall, our findings demonstrated that MDA5 detection of RNA in RIG-I deficient vertebrates is guided by the RNA 5’-triphosphate end and is disrupted when RNA is capped at the 5’-triphosphate end or dephosphorylated.</p>

<label>2.5</label><title>Increased m<sup>6</sup>A modification and expression of MDA5 upon SCRV infection</title>
<p>As stated in the previous results, MDA5 has evolved to possess immune recognition abilities that take over the role of RIG-I, significantly enhancing the host’s ability to resist viral infections. However, evolution is a continuous battle between hosts and viruses, to counteract receptor recognition and immune responses by the host, viruses often evolve complex escape mechanisms to evade immune surveillance and destruction. Recently, studies have shown that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification mechanism is a way that viruses can utilize to evade the immune response. To investigate the impact of SCRV infection on the overall methylation dynamics of fish hosts, we utilized methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq, GenBank accession number: PRJNA819945) to measure changes in m<sup>6</sup>A modification of host transcripts during SCRV infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). From the results shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, we identified 3060 differentially m<sup>6</sup>A methylated peaks (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) and 2082 differentially expressed genes (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) between the non-infected and SCRV-infected group, indicating that infection significantly alters the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of specific host transcripts. It is worth noting that hyper-methylated m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were also observed in the MDA5 mRNA transcripts during SCRV infection (fold change &gt;1.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and the expression level of MDA5 was higher in the infection group compared to the control group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Further analysis of the m<sup>6</sup>A-seq data showed that MDA5 contained m<sup>6</sup>A sites in the exon1 region which were markedly higher in the infection group than that in the control group (Untreated VS SCRV: <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Next, we tested the concrete m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites of MDA5 mRNA. We used the SRAMP database to predict potential m<sup>6</sup>A sites in MDA5-exon1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Four potential sites were predicted and two specific primers were designed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), then m<sup>6</sup>A quantitative real-time PCR and semiquantitative PCR were performed. In line with the m<sup>6</sup>A-seq data, the results further confirmed that m<sup>6</sup>A sites exactly exist in MDA5 exon1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). After being infected with SCRV or poly(I:C), the methylation level of MDA5 increased in MKC cells, further confirming the sequencing data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Next, MDA5 was found to be upregulated in spleen and kidney tissues infected with SCRV (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). We further explored the mRNA and protein levels of MDA5 in MKC cells infected with SCRV and poly(I:C) and found that their expression all first significantly increased and then returned to the normal level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref>). Overall, our results suggested that both the m<sup>6</sup>A modification and expression levels of MDA5 are increased upon SCRV infection.</p>

<label>2.6</label><title>m<sup>6</sup>A-modification weakens MDA5 mRNA stability and antiviral ability</title>
<p>SCRV infection can increase the methylation level of MDA5, and this mechanism is expected to have a regulatory effect on MDA5. To investigate this, the regulatory effects of METTL3 and METTL14, the main components of the methyltransferase complex, on MDA5 were explored. Three siRNAs targeting METTL3 and METTL14 were designed, and si-METTL3-2 and si-METTL14-3 showed higher knockdown efficiency (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). METTL3 and METTL14-overexpressing plasmids were also constructed, and the interaction between them confirmed their cooperative role in m<sup>6</sup>A modification (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Subsequently, the global m<sup>6</sup>A levels were measured in cells after knockdown or overexpression of METTL3 and METTL14. Consistent with expectations, the knockdown of METTL3 and METTL14 significantly decreased the global m<sup>6</sup>A level, while their overexpression significantly increased the overall methylation level (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). To investigate their role in the process of virus infection, we used the virus plaque and qPCR methods to explore whether it could affect SCRV replication. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>, overexpression of METTL3 or METTL14 significantly enhances viral plaque formation and promotes SCRV replication in SCRV-infected cells. And as m<sup>6</sup>A writers, METTL3 and METTL14 can directly regulate the methylation level of MDA5 and induce MDA5 degradation by reducing its mRNA stability (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-6I</xref>). We further inserted the MDA5-exon1 into pmirGLO and mVenus-C1 vector, and results showed that si-METTL3&amp;14 can reduce the luciferase activity of pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1, and METTL3&amp;14 could suppress the levels of GFP, further indicating the presence of methylation sites in MDA5-exon1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-figure supplement 1A and 1D). To investigate the potential sites on MDA5-exon1, we constructed mutant MDA5-exon1 reporter plasmids. For the mutant form of MDA5-exon1 reporter genes, four predicted adenosine bases in m<sup>6</sup>A consensus sequences (DRACH) were replaced by uracil, thus canceling m<sup>6</sup>A decoration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-figure supplement 1B). As expected, our results showed that the luciferase activity of wild-type pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1 reporter, but not of mutant pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1 reporter, was markedly increased upon METTL3&amp;14 knockdown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-figure supplement 1C). Furthermore, we found that the use of cycloleucine (CL, an amino acid analogue that can inhibit m<sup>6</sup>A modification) hindered the degradation of MDA5 by METTL3 and METTL14, indicating that these proteins regulate MDA5 expression through a methylation mechanism (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6K</xref>). Additionally, MDA5 expression was degraded by METTL3&amp;14 in both SCRV-infected and uninfected groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L</xref>). To investigate the impact of this mechanism on viral infection, we co-transfected METTL3&amp;14 and MDA5 plasmids and found that METTL3&amp;14 partially suppressed the antiviral immune benefit of MDA5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M-6O</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that METTL3&amp;14-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A methylation of MDA5 inhibits its mRNA stability and expression levels, thus suppressing the antiviral capabilities of MDA5.</p>

<label>2.7</label><title>Detailed m<sup>6</sup>A regulatory mechanism of MDA5</title>
<p>The m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism is jointly regulated by writers, erasers, and readers. The m<sup>6</sup>A modification of mRNA recruits m<sup>6</sup>A-binding proteins (readers) which have the function of recognizing m<sup>6</sup>A sites and accelerating mRNA decay. In this study, we hypothesized that YTHDF readers (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3) may recognize m<sup>6</sup>A-modified MDA5 and destabilize it. We examined the binding ability of YTHDF proteins to MDA5 mRNA and found that YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 exhibited stronger binding compared to YTHDF1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). We then designed two siRNAs targeting YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3 respectively, and selected si-YTHDF1-1, si-YTHDF2-si-2, si-YTHDF3-2 with better knockdown effects for subsequent experiments (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Results showed that the knockdown or overexpression of YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 led to the increase or decrease of the expression levels of MDA5, whereas YTHDF1 did not appear to influence MDA5 expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, 7D, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-figure supplement 1A and 1C). In addition, overexpression of YTHDF2&amp;3 can increase the luciferase activity of wild-type pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1 reporter, but not of mutant pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1 reporter (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-figure supplement 1B). We then found that si-METTL3&amp;14 can counteract the negative impact of YTHDF2&amp;3 on MDA5 mRNA, protein, and stability (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>). Since the m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism is reversible, we then studied the regulation of MDA5 by two major erasers. Results showed that FTO, not ALKBH5, can upregulate MDA5 expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Moreover, the overexpression of FTO can reverse the inhibitory effect of YTHDF2&amp;3 on MDA5 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref>).

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have identified multiple independent loss events of RIG-I throughout vertebrate evolution. Specifically, we have observed at least three independent loss events in mammals, birds, and fish, respectively. Regarding the loss of RIG-I in avian species, previous studies have provided more comprehensive and accurate information than ours, indicating that birds have experienced more than 16 instances of RIG-I loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. However, it should be noted that we have not found the loss of RIG-I in reptiles and amphibians (not displayed). But this does not imply that there has been no loss event among them, but rather, there is insufficient information regarding the genomes of reptiles and amphibians to draw the conclusions. As the abundance of genomic data continues to grow, there will be an increasing amount of evidence available to verify the presence or absence of RIG-I in these taxonomic groups. Additionally, the presence of RIG-I in current species does not guarantee that RIG-I loss has not occurred previously. For instance, our research has indicated that zebrafish may have experienced RIG-I loss. However, prior to the loss event, the zebrafish RIG-I has undergone repetitive events. These findings collectively highlight that the loss of RIG-I is not a random occurrence, but rather bears significant biological and evolutionary implications that deserve further investigation.</p>
<p>The loss of RIG-I might be expected to have a great impact on immune response, and the evolutionary loss of it raises the question of a possible compensation of its function by other gene products. In this study, we characterized the consequences resulting from the loss of RIG-I in the vertebrate and provided direct functional evidence for the alternative immune recognition function of MDA5. Firstly, our results suggest that MDA5 of fish can bind to and recognize SCRV virus, leading to the activation of the RLR pathway and subsequent upregulation of antiviral factors, thereby enhancing the host’s antiviral immune capacity. SCRV belongs to the class of rhabdovirus, which is a negative-strand virus with a non-segmented genome and initiate both replication and transcription de novo leading to 5′-triphosphate RNA in the cytosol, was expected to trigger an IFN response without the need for replication and presumed dsRNA formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Consequently, we reasonably speculate that the recognition of SCRV by MDA5 depends on the 5’triphosphate of virus RNA in vertebrates that lacking RIG-I. Secondly, to further illustrate the above viewpoints, we synthesized 5’ppp-RNA and its dephosphorylated and capped forms and purified recombinant MDA5 of <italic>Miichthys miiuy</italic> and <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> (two representative species of vertebrates lacking RIG-I). Results demonstrated that MDA5 detection of RNA in RIG-I deficient vertebrates is guided by the RNA 5’-triphosphate and is disrupted when RNA is capped at the 5’-triphosphate end or dephosphorylated. Thirdly, the recognition of RNA by MDA5 depends on its RD domain, which not only indicates that the RD domain of MDA5 has evolved functions similar to RD domain of RIG-I, but also excludes the possibility of MDA5 binding to SCRV RNA through intermediate ligands. Furthermore, in vertebrates that possess RIG-I, STING exclusively binds to RIG-I rather than MDA5. In contrast, just like tree shrews and chickens lacking RIG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, the MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> can also interact with STING protein, proving that in vertebrates lacking RIG-I, MDA5 can utilize STING to facilitate signal transduction in the antiviral response. Finally, by linking the immune replacement ability evolved by MDA5 with the common RIG-I loss event in vertebrates, we propose a straightforward explanation for this evolutionary event: In the lengthy process of vertebrate evolution, MDA5 gradually acquired new functionalities to effectively detect viruses such as 5’ppp-RNAs, which were initially recognized by RIG-I. As a result, there was functional redundancy of RIG-I, which eventually led to its gradual disappearance from the vertebrate genome. This hypothesis is supported by two viewpoints: first, MDA5 and RIG-I can both recognize overlapping viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>; secondly, in fish without RIG-I deficiency, MDA5 has stronger antiviral ability compared to RIG-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Viruses are constantly co-evolving with hosts. Our available data suggested that the vertebrate has evolved MDA5 with alternative functions to recognize and resist 5’ppp-RNA in the absence of RIG-I. As a response, virus has also evolved to use the m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism to evade the host immune response. Previous study indicated that m<sup>6</sup>A modification plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis in the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. During the infection process, the virus may disrupt the m<sup>6</sup>A level and disrupt the immune balance, thereby facilitating its own replication and invasion. Viruses may utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism in two ways to evade immunity. On the one hand, many studies suggested a role for m<sup>6</sup>A in shielding RNA species from detection by PRRs. There are numerous viruses recognized in RIG-I dependent manner, but m<sup>6</sup>A modification increases the possibility of immune evasion. For example, the loss of m<sup>6</sup>A site or removing m<sup>6</sup>A from human metapneumovirus may weaken its immune evasion ability, prevent it from evading detection by RIG-I, and result in higher levels of IFN release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, it has been reported that the RNA containing m<sup>6</sup>A modifications binds to RIG-I poorly, and it failed to trigger the RIG-I conformational changes associated with downstream immune signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. On the other hand, m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated viral strategies for inhibiting IFN induction pathways appear to exist. For instance, following infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the IFN-β transcript was modified by m<sup>6</sup>A, and this methylation decreased its half-life, suggesting that HCMV can exploit this control of IFN-β expression to facilitate its replication by increasing m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the IFN-β transcript and thus decreasing its production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Similarly, a previous study has reported that m<sup>6</sup>A modification levels significantly increase after T-cell infection with HIV-1, and this modification can enhance the replication and nucleation ability of the virus itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In summary, viruses can utilize m<sup>6</sup>A to evade the immune response by shielding the recognition of RIG-I or reducing the host’s immune reaction, thus counteracting the host’s defense mechanisms. In our previous study, we discovered that SCRV infection can not only increase overall cellular methylation levels but also upregulate the expression of METTL3, thereby suggesting its potential to regulate host gene expression through the m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that SCRV virus infection alters m<sup>6</sup>A modification of specific cellular transcripts, including MDA5. MDA5 plays a crucial role as a receptor in recognizing the SCRV virus and controlling IFN activation. The aberrant m<sup>6</sup>A levels of MDA5 subsequently affect the expression of antiviral genes, thereby compromising its ability to mount an effective antiviral immune response. It is plausible that SCRV also impacts the production of antiviral genes, such as IFN-1 or other cytokines, by manipulating m<sup>6</sup>A modification on the transcripts of cytokines or molecules involved in their production. This interesting aspect warrants further investigation in future research.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated a co-evolutionary arms race between 5’ppp-RNA and virus receptors in vertebrates. Specifically, we conducted an evolutionary analysis and provided functional evidence to confirm that MDA5 of teleost fish and birds has acquired an additional function of sensing 5’ppp-RNA and enhancing the antiviral signaling pathway, thus compensating for the loss of RIG-I. Additionally, we found that SCRV infection can regulate the m<sup>6</sup>A level of MDA5 in the host, leading to its degradation and subsequently affecting the immune response for immune evasion. Fish and birds, as the most abundant aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates respectively, are also the two lineages with the most frequent occurrence of RIG-I deficiency, the investigation of host-pathogen interactions of them offers valuable insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.</p>

<p>The authors present evidence suggesting that MDA5 can substitute as a sensor for triphosphate RNA in a species that naturally lacks RIG-I. The key findings are potentially <bold>important</bold> for our understanding of the evolution of innate immune responses, but the evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold>, as additional biochemical and functional experiments are needed to unambiguously assign MDA5 as a bona fide sensor of triphosphate RNA in this model. This also leaves the title as overstating its case.</p>

<p>This study offers valuable insights into host-virus interactions, emphasizing the adaptability of the immune system. Readers should recognize the significance of MDA5 in potentially replacing RIG-I and the adversarial strategy employed by 5'ppp-RNA SCRV in degrading MDA5 mediated by m6A modification in different species, further indicating that m6A is a conservational process in the antiviral immune response.</p>
<p>However, caution is warranted in extrapolating these findings universally, given the dynamic nature of host-virus dynamics. The study provides a snapshot into the complexity of these interactions, but further research is needed to validate and extend these insights, considering potential variations across viral species and environmental contexts.</p>

<p>This manuscript by Geng et al. aims to demonstrate that MDA5 compensates for the loss of RIG-I in certain species, such as teleofish miiuy croacker. The authors use siniperca cheats rhabdovirus (SCRV) and poly(I:C) to demonstrate that these RNA ligands induce an IFN response in an MDA5-dependent manner in m.miiuy derived cells. Furthermore, they show that MDA5 requires its RD domain to directly bind to SCRV RNA and to induce an IFN response. They use in vitro synthesized RNA with a 5'triphosphate (or lacking a 5'triphosphate as a control) to demonstrate that MDA5 can directly bind to 5'-triphosphorylated RNA. The second part of the paper is devoted to m6A modification of MDA5 transcripts by SCRV as an immune evasion strategy. The authors demonstrate that the modification of MDA5 with m6A is increased upon infection and that this causes increased decay of MDA5 and consequently a decreased IFN response.</p>
<p>The key message of this paper, i.e. MDA5 can sense 5'-triphosphorylated RNA and thereby compensate for the loss of RIG-I, is novel and interesting, yet there is insufficient evidence provided to prove this hypothesis. Most importantly, it is crucial to test the capacity of in vitro synthesized 5'-triphosphorylated RNA to induce an IFN response in MDA5-sufficient and -deficient cells. In addition, a number of important controls are missing, as detailed below. The authors describe an interaction between MDA5 and STING which, if true, is very interesting. However, the functional implications of this interaction are not further investigated in the manuscript. Is STING required to relay signalling downstream of MDA5? The second part of the paper is quite distinct from the first part. The fact that MDA5 is an interferon-stimulated gene is not mentioned and complicates the analyses (i.e. is there truly more m6A modification of MDA5 on a per molecule basis, or is there simply more total MDA5 and therefore more total m6A modification of MDA5).</p>
<p>Finally, it should be pointed out that several figures require additional labels, markings, or information in the figure itself or in the accompanying legend to increase the overall clarity of the manuscript. There are frequently details missing from figures that make them difficult to interpret and not self-explanatory. These details are sometimes not even found in the legend, only in the materials and methods section. The manuscript also requires extensive language editing by the editorial team or the authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

In this manuscript, the authors investigated the interaction between the pattern recognition receptor MDA5 and 5'ppp-RNA in a teleost fish called Miiuy croaker. They claimed that MDA5 can replace RIG-I in sensing 5'ppp-RNA of Siniperca cheats rhabdovirus (SCRV) in the absence of RIG-I in Miiuy croaker. The recognition of MDA5 to 5'ppp-RNA was also observed in the chicken (Gallus gallus), a bird species that lacks RIG-I. Additionally, they reported that the function of MDA5 can be impaired through m6A-mediated methylation and degradation of MDA5 mRNA by the METTL3/14-YTHDF2/3 regulatory network in Miiuy croaker under SCRV infection. This impairment weakens the innate antiviral immunity of fish and promotes the immune evasion of SCRV.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
These findings provide insights into the adaptation and functional diversity of innate antiviral activity in vertebrates.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
However, there are some major and minor concerns that need to be further addressed. Addressing these concerns will help the authors improve the quality of their manuscript.</p>
<p>One significant issue with the manuscript is that the authors claim to be investigating the role of MDA5 as a substitute for RIG-I in recognizing 5'ppp-RNA, but their study extends beyond this specific scenario. Based on my understanding, it appears that sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 do not strictly adhere to this particular scenario. Instead, these sections tend to investigate the functional involvement of Miiuy croaker MDA5 in the innate immune response to viral infection. Furthermore, the majority of the data is focused on Miiuy croaker MDA5, with only a limited and insufficient study on chicken MDA5. Consequently, the authors cannot make broad claims that their research represents events in all RIG-I deficient species, considering the limited scope of the species studied.</p>
<p>The current title of the article does not align well with its actual content. It is recommended that the focus of the research be redirected to the recognition function and molecular mechanism of MDA5 in the absence of RIG-I concerning 5'ppp-RNA. This can be achieved through bolstering experimental analysis in the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology, as well as enhancing theoretical research on the molecular evolution of MDA5. It is advisable to decrease or eliminate content related to m6A modification.</p>
<p>Additionally, the main body of the writing contains several aspects that lack rigor and tend to exaggerate, necessitating significant improvement.</p>
