<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Host-directed therapy (HDT) is an emerging approach to overcome antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic microorganisms. Specifically, HDT targets host-encoded factors required for pathogen replication and survival without interfering with microbial growth or metabolism, thereby eliminating the risk of resistance development. By applying HDT and a drug repurposing approach, we demonstrate that (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87, a clinical-stage anti-cancer drug and potent inhibitor of mammalian deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), mitigates <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> abscess formation in organ tissues upon invasive bloodstream infection. Mechanistically, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 shields phagocytes from staphylococcal death-effector deoxyribonucleosides that target dCK and the mammalian purine salvage pathway-apoptosis axis. In this manner, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated protection of immune cells amplifies macrophage infiltration into deep-seated abscesses, a phenomenon coupled with enhanced pathogen control, ameliorated immunopathology, and reduced disease severity. Thus, pharmaceutical blockade of dCK represents an advanced anti-infective intervention strategy against which staphylococci cannot develop resistance and may help to fight fatal infectious diseases in hospitalized patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hospital- and community-acquired infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens represent a global public health threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wenzel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">GBD 2019 Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators, 2022a</xref>; b). Specifically, infections caused by multidrug-resistant microbes are often associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as compared to infections caused by antibiotic-sensitive strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Klevens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yaw et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">GBD 2019 Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators, 2022a</xref>; b). In addition, the pathology of various bacterial infections includes multifactorial manipulation of host multicellular assemblies that enable pathogen replication, dissemination of disease, and adaptation to new hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Foster, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Finlay and McFadden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Okumura and Nizet, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Thammavongsa et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, prevention and therapy of such infections represent a major challenge in clinical practice and frequently require administering last-resort antibiotics such as vancomycin, linezolid, or colistin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chambers and Deleo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">McKenna, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tong et al., 2015</xref>). However, many clinically relevant pathogens have already developed resistance-mechanisms against many of these drugs thereby rendering antibiotic therapy of appropriate infections often ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Meka and Gold, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chambers and Deleo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">GBD 2019 Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators, 2022a</xref>). Moreover, the rapid exchange of antibiotic resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer events, along with the large-scale usage of antimicrobials in hospitals and in the animal industry, continuously triggers the emergence of new drug-resistant and globally spreading bacterial clones, highlighting the desperate need for novel treatment options to fight infectious diseases in human or animal hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chambers and Deleo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nubel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jian et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are frequently associated with local and life-threatening infections in both, hospital environments and in the general community. Of particular concern are Mycobacteria, certain Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive bacteria including <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, a notorious pathogen that colonizes approximately 30% of the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lowy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kuehnert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> causes skin and soft tissue infections and is a widespread cause of endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, bacteremia, and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lowy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fridkin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, this microbe triggers toxic shock syndrome, food poisoning, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and associated infections of the respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lowy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Torres et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, a hallmark of staphylococcal disease is the formation of suppurative abscesses, where <italic>S. aureus</italic> provokes inflammatory responses that attract neutrophils, macrophages, and other immune cells to the site of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lowy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Spaan et al., 2013</xref>). Abscess formation is further accompanied by liquefaction necrosis, the release of purulent exudates into circulating body fluids, and several defensive host responses designed to limit staphylococcal replication and spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). For example, staphylococcal invasion of host tissues and abscess formation includes deposition of structural fibrin clusters, which shield healthy tissues from disseminating staphylococci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, neutrophils combat <italic>S. aureus</italic> by powerful mechanisms which involve phagocytosis, generation of reactive oxygen species, and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Spaan et al., 2013</xref>). NETs represent an extracellular matrix composed of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA spiked with antimicrobial peptides, cell-specific proteases, and granular proteins that together ensnare and kill microbial invaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>). However, <italic>S. aureus</italic> rapidly evades NET-mediated killing due to the secretion of a potent nuclease (Nuc) capable of disrupting these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berends et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">von Kockritz-Blickwede and Winstel, 2022</xref>). Intriguingly, Nuc-mediated degradation of NETs leads to the release of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates that can be converted by the staphylococcal cell surface protein AdsA (adenosine synthase A) into death-effector deoxyribonucleosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Thammavongsa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tantawy et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, AdsA-derived death-effector deoxyribonucleosides such as deoxyadenosine (dAdo) and deoxyguanosine (dGuo) display toxigenic properties and contribute to immune cell death during acute and persistent <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Thammavongsa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Winstel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tantawy et al., 2022</xref>). More precisely, dAdo and dGuo-triggered phagocyte cell death involves the uptake of dAdo and dGuo via human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), intracellular phosphorylation of dAdo and dGuo by adenosine kinase (ADK) and deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and subsequent imbalanced expansion of intracellular dATP and dGTP pools which trigger caspase-3-dependent immune cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Winstel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tantawy et al., 2022</xref>). Of note, genetic disruption of this metabolic cascade rendered macrophages resistant to AdsA-derived death-effector deoxyribonucleosides, leading to the accumulation of phagocytes within the deeper cavity of abscesses and accelerated clearance of staphylococci <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Winstel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Winstel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tantawy et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, elements of the mammalian purine salvage pathway represent attractive targets for the design of novel host-directed therapeutics that aim at boosting macrophage survival during acute and persistent <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections. In particular, pharmacological inhibition of dCK by small molecule inhibitors may terminate the intracellular conversion of <italic>S. aureus</italic>- and AdsA-derived death-effector deoxyribonucleosides into deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates and subsequent accumulation of apoptosis-triggering deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates in host phagocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). If so, <italic>S. aureus</italic>- and dAdo/dGuo-mediated macrophage cell death may efficiently be prevented thereby aiding in the clearance of staphylococci during abscess formation and persistent infections.</p>

<title>(<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated blockade of mammalian dCK protects host immune cells from staphylococcal death-effector deoxyribonucleosides</title>
<p>To analyze whether pharmacological inhibition of mammalian dCK may represent a suitable strategy to protect host phagocytes from staphylococcal death-effector deoxyribonucleosides, we initially took advantage of various tissue culture model systems and pre-incubated human U937 monocytes (U937) or U937-derived macrophages (U937 MÐ¤) with (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87. Controls received vehicle only. Following pre-incubation, U937 or U937 MÐ¤ were exposed to dAdo or dGuo and analyzed for viability rates 48 hours post-intoxication. Of note, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated inhibition of mammalian dCK in U937 or U937 MÐ¤ efficiently prevented dAdo- or dGuo-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-D</xref>; supplementary Figure 1A-D). Moreover, these effects resembled the phenotype of dCK-deficient U937 or U937 MÐ¤, which were found to be refractory to dAdo- or dGuo-mediated cytotoxicity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Winstel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tantawy et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, we observed that pre-treatment of primary human CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes or human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) with (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 blocked dAdo- or dGuo- triggered cytotoxicity suggesting that dCK inhibition may suppress the toxigenic properties of staphylococcal death-effector deoxyribonucleosides (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-H</xref>). To test this conjecture, we expressed a soluble and affinity-tagged recombinant form of <italic>S. aureus</italic> AdsA (hereafter termed rAdsA) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which was purified, released of its affinity tag, and subsequently used for cytotoxicity assays. Particularly, we incubated rAdsA with either dAMP or dGMP according to a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tantawy et al., 2022</xref>) and added the resulting, dAdo- or dGuo-containing and filter-sterilized reaction products to U937 or U937 MÐ¤ that received (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 or were left untreated prior to intoxication. While enzymatic reactions that contained rAdsA and purine deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates triggered cell death of human monocytes or macrophages in this approach, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-exposed cells were fully protected against the cytotoxic effect of dAdo and dGuo further indicating that inhibition of mammalian dCK helps to neutralize AdsA-derived death-effector deoxyribonucleosides (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I-J</xref>). In this regard, we also wondered whether these results can be recapitulated by using live bacteria and took advantage of previously described methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Thammavongsa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Winstel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Winstel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tantawy et al., 2022</xref>). More precisely, we incubated wild-type <italic>S. aureus</italic> Newman or its <italic>adsA</italic> variant in the presence or absence purine deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates (dAMP or dGMP) to obtain conditioned culture media, which were filter-sterilized and added to vehicle- or (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-exposed human U937 macrophages. In line with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Thammavongsa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Winstel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Winstel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tantawy et al., 2022</xref>), macrophage killing required purine deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate-conditioned media and <italic>adsA</italic>-proficient staphylococci as only wild-type <italic>S. aureus</italic> Newman and dAMP- or dGMP-supplemented media triggered phagocyte cell death in this approach (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K-L</xref>). However, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-exposed cells could not be killed in these experiments supporting the idea that pharmacological inhibition of host dCK can shield macrophages from <italic>S. aureus</italic>- and AdsA-driven cell death (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K-L</xref>). Collectively, these initial data demonstrate that (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 is a suitable small molecule dCK inhibitor capable of preventing host immune cell death induced by toxigenic products of the staphylococcal Nuc/AdsA pathway.</p>

<p>Earlier work demonstrated that staphylococcal dAdo and dGuo target the mammalian purine salvage pathway to trigger an exaggerated biogenesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, thereby igniting caspase-3-dependent host immune cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Winstel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Winstel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tantawy et al., 2022</xref>). Since the accumulation of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and associated apoptotic signaling via cleavage of caspase-3 exclusively occurs in dCK-proficient monocytes or macrophages upon intoxication with death-effector deoxyribonucleosides such as dAdo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Winstel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tantawy et al., 2022</xref>), it seemed plausible to us at this stage that administration of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 and inhibition of dCK may suppress dAdo- or dGuo-mediated activation of the programmed cell death machinery. To test this hypothesis, U937 or U937 MÐ¤ were pre-incubated with (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87, exposed to dAdo or dGuo, and used to generate cell extracts for evaluation of caspase-3 activity by measuring the hydrolysis of the caspase-3-specific peptide substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA. As expected, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-treatment of U937 or U937 MÐ¤ significantly decreased dAdo- or dGuo-mediated activation of caspase-3 activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>). Since caspase-3 represents the key modulator of the apoptosis signaling pathway, these data suggest that (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated dCK inhibition selectively prevented dAdo- or dGuo-mediated induction of apoptotic cell death in host immune cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>). To verify these results further, cell extracts were also probed with a specific antibody capable of detecting the inactive pro-form and cleaved (active) form of human caspase-3. In agreement with the enzymatic activity assay, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-treatment of U937 or U937 MÐ¤ prevented caspase-3 activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref>). Moreover, we exposed U937 phagocytes to (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 and assessed dAdo- or dGuo-mediated activation of apoptotic signaling via immunofluorescence microscopy. Microscopy-based analysis of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87- and death-effector deoxyribonucleoside-exposed macrophages confirmed that (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 inhibited activation of programmed cell death and apoptosis as positive signals for annexin-V/PI were strongly decreased in samples that have been exposed to the dCK inhibitor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-H</xref>). Of note, similar findings were also obtained with primary HMDMs, suggesting that (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 is a suitable agent to block death-effector deoxyribonucleoside-mediated induction of apoptosis in host phagocytes (supplementary Figure 2). Together, these data indicate that administration of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 and associated inhibition of mammalian dCK prevents apoptotic cell death in phagocytes caused by <italic>S. aureus</italic> AdsA-derived death-effector deoxyribonucleosides.</p>

<title>Pharmacological inhibition of host dCK diminishes <italic>S. aureus</italic> abscess formation in a mouse model of bloodstream infection</title>
<p>To evaluate the therapeutic value of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 in live animals, initial <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments aimed at analyzing the safety of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 in mice following continuous dCK inhibitor treatment. Thus, cohorts of female C57BL/6 mice were treated from day 0 onwards with either vehicle (40% Captisol) or (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 (75 mg/kg) via oral gavage in 12-hour intervals according to a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2022a</xref>). On day 16, peripheral blood was collected from both cohorts of mice and subjected to a FACS-based immuno-phenotyping approach (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Continuous treatment of animals with (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 did not alter the immune cell composition of peripheral blood (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Likewise, endpoint analysis (day 23) uncovered no developmental errors or differences in lymphocyte development as immune cell profiles of spleen tissues along with organ cellularity or mouse body weights were unaffected by (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref>; supplementary Figure 3). Further, administration of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 to mice did not cause any other obvious phenotype during this procedure but led to the accumulation of deoxycytidine, the natural substrate of dCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Reichard, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arner and Eriksson, 1995</xref>), in plasma suggesting that (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 not only represents a safe but also highly selective inhibitor of host dCK (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Next, we sought to investigate whether (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated protection of mammalian phagocytes may represent a valuable strategy to prevent staphylococcal diseases and tested the therapeutic efficacy of the compound in a mouse model of <italic>S. aureus</italic> bloodstream infection. In this model, C57BL/6 mice were treated with (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 (75 mg/kg) or vehicle (40% Captisol) via oral gavage every 12 hours and challenged with a single dose of 1.0 x 10<sup>7</sup> CFU <italic>S. aureus</italic> Newman, a human clinical isolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duthie and Lorenz, 1952</xref>). Five days post-infection, mice were euthanized. Livers and kidneys were dissected and analyzed for visible abscess lesions. Subsequently, tissue homogenates were prepared and plated on agar plates to measure bacterial loads in infected organs. Notably, abscess numbers and bacterial loads were significantly reduced in livers and kidneys in (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-treated animals as compared to control mice validating (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 as a novel host-directed and anti-infective drug that protects against staphylococcal abscess formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-I</xref>). To test whether <italic>S. aureus</italic> exploits the activity of dCK along with the purine salvage pathway during infection, cohorts of mice were also challenged with the <italic>S. aureus</italic> Newman <italic>adsA</italic> mutant. (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-treated animals no longer displayed increased resistance to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>-I). Moreover, infection with <italic>S. aureus adsA</italic>-deficient bacteria phenocopied (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated inhibition of dCK, in line with the concept that AdsA is required for establishing persistent infections in host tissues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-I</xref>). In light of these findings, infected organs were also fixed with formalin, embedded into paraffin, thin-sectioned, and analyzed for histopathology. As expected, histopathological analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained liver or renal tissues revealed that wild-type <italic>S. aureus</italic> Newman formed structured abscesses in vehicle-treated mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). However, lesions obtained from (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-treated animals appeared smaller in size and typically did not harbor a discernable organization of staphylococci, further demonstrating that administration of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 represents a medically valuable strategy to mitigate <italic>S. aureus</italic> abscess formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). Presumably, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-treatment protects macrophages against AdsA-derived death-effector deoxyribonucleosides and therefore enhances phagocyte survival during abscess formation as (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 neither improved the killing of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in human or mouse blood, nor it displayed antimicrobial activity (supplementary Figure 4A-B; supplementary Table 1).

<title>(<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-treatment amplifies macrophage infiltration into staphylococcal infectious foci</title>
<p>Previous studies revealed that macrophages with defects in the purine salvage pathway-apoptosis axis are refractory to staphylococcal dAdo or dGuo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Winstel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Winstel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tantawy et al., 2022</xref>). As a result, death-effector deoxyribonucleoside-resistant tissue macrophages were found to accumulate within deep-seated abscesses of <italic>S. aureus</italic>-challenged mice, a phenomenon that contributed to accelerated clearance of staphylococci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Winstel et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of host dCK might augment phagocyte infiltration into <italic>S. aureus</italic>-derived abscesses, thereby explaining reduced bacterial burdens in (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-treated laboratory animals. To pursue this possibility, we established an immunofluorescence microscopy-based approach to detect macrophages in liver or renal tissues of <italic>S. aureus</italic> Newman wild type-infected C57BL/6 mice that were treated with (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 or vehicle only. As expected, immunofluorescence staining of tissue abscesses obtained from vehicle-treated animals revealed that F4/80-positive macrophages resided at the periphery of infectious foci (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-D</xref>). On the contrary, lesions derived from mice that received (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 differed as they contained infiltrates of F4/80-positive macrophages within the neutrophil cuff, suggesting that (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated inhibition of host dCK terminates macrophage exclusion from staphylococcal infectious foci (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-H</xref>). To further delineate whether these results correlate with AdsA and staphylococcal death-effector deoxyribonucleoside-mediated manipulation of host dCK in phagocytes, tissues of <italic>S. aureus</italic> Newman <italic>adsA</italic> mutant-infected mice, which received either (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 or vehicle, were also examined via immunofluorescence microscopy and analyzed for the presence of F4/80-positive macrophages. Of note, <italic>adsA</italic> mutant-derived tissue lesions were also characterized by increased infiltration rates of F4/80- positive phagocytes, irrespectively of whether animals were treated with (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 or vehicle during the course of the infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I-P</xref>). Thus, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated blockade of host dCK phenocopied the <italic>adsA</italic> mutation in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Lastly, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87- or vehicle-treated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) that were isolated from female animals were analyzed for survival rates upon exposure to dAdo or dGuo. Compared to vehicle-treated cells, which were susceptible to death-effector deoxyribonucleosides, BMDMs exposed to (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 displayed increased resistance toward dAdo and dGuo presumably explaining their abundance in infectious foci obtained from wild-type <italic>S. aureus</italic> Newman-challenged and dCK inhibitor-treated mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Q-R</xref>). Similar findings were also obtained for male animal-derived BMDMs suggesting that sex might not impact the efficacy of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 in laboratory animals (supplementary Figure 5A-B). In summary, these data suggest that (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-treatment protects macrophages from staphylococcal death-effector deoxyribonucleosides and therefore boosts their infiltration into persistent abscesses in organ tissues (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Bacterial infectious diseases are typically treated with specific or broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, many microbial pathogens have developed resistance mechanisms against these drugs and other antimicrobial agents either via mutational changes within the drug target or by importing resistance genes from other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Klevens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yaw et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nubel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">GBD 2019 Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators, 2022a</xref>). Accordingly, infections by multidrug-resistant microbes are frequently associated with failure of therapy and increased mortality in both, industrialized and developing countries around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Klevens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yaw et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">GBD 2019 Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators, 2022a</xref>; b). Each year, several million people die due to infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria such as <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, or <italic>S. aureus</italic> underscoring the very urgent need of new therapeutics and anti-infective compounds against which bacteria cannot develop resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">GBD 2019 Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">b</xref>).</p>
<p>Host-directed therapy is an emerging therapeutic concept that eliminates the possibility of drug resistance development in microbial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>). This innovative approach aims at targeting specific host determinants and signaling cascades bacterial or other pathogenic microorganisms may attack or exploit to establish acute and persistent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, this strategy seeks to ameliorate host immunity, immune cell survival, and immunopathology, as well as pathogen control without interfering with microbial replication, growth, or metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>). By applying this concept along with a drug-repurposing approach, we here report that administration of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87, a soluble, orally active, and high-affinity inhibitor of host dCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Poddar et al., 2020</xref>), reduces <italic>S. aureus</italic> abscess formation in a mouse model of bloodstream infection. In particular, we show that (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated blockade of host dCK prevents staphylococcal death-effector deoxyribonucleoside-triggered apoptotic cell death in phagocytes of human and animal origin. Accordingly, oral administration of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 in mice rendered host phagocytes refractory to AdsA-derived dAdo and dGuo thereby leading to an accumulation of <italic>S. aureus</italic>-eliminating macrophages within deeper cavities of infectious foci along with accelerated phagocytic clearance of staphylococci. Since dCK is a rate-limiting enzyme of the nucleoside salvage pathway that catalyzes the intracellular conversion of deoxyribonucleosides into deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arner and Eriksson, 1995</xref>), (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated inhibition of dCK most likely suppresses an uncontrolled biogenesis of deoxyribonucleoside di- and triphosphates that may trigger replication errors and apoptosis in host cells. Consistent with this model, earlier work suggested that dCK deficiency in phagocytes or other cells such as lymphoblasts prevents an overload of intracellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates upon exposure to death-effector deoxyribonucleosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gudas et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Winstel et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, inhibition of host dCK represents an attractive host-directed therapeutic intervention strategy that terminates a refined immuno-evasive maneuver <italic>S. aureus</italic> has evolved to establish persistent infections in mammalian hosts. The technological advantage of this therapeutic approach, beyond the clinical importance and long-term economic benefits for the medical-therapeutic sector, is undoubtedly the exploitation of an already existing, highly selective, and clinical-stage compound that can easily be administered to dampen metastatic abscess formation in organs upon staphylococcal bloodstream infection. In particular, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 does not exhibit detrimental side effects as (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-exposed laboratory animals neither lost weight during long-term treatment nor displayed any other adverse effects that may negatively affect host immune responses. Specifically, the immune cell composition profile of mice that received (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 was not altered when compared to mice that received the vehicle control. This suggests that patrolling neutrophils known to play a significant role during staphylococcal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Spaan et al., 2013</xref>) along with other crucial elements of the host immune system are fully functional in (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-treated hosts, thereby offering tremendous opportunities to improve infection outcomes in hospitalized or critically ill patients. Further, usage of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 represents a host-directed and anti-infective therapeutic approach to which <italic>S. aureus</italic> and other multidrug-resistant bacteria cannot develop resistance mechanisms. In this regard, we note that many other medically highly relevant bacterial pathogens including streptococci, <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, and multidrug-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus pseudintermedius</italic> synthesize effector-nucleosides in order to modulate host immune cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Thammavongsa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bunsow et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated inhibition of dCK may also help to protect host cells from apoptotic cell death or other adverse effects during other bacterial diseases in human or animal hosts. Even polymicrobial infections caused by various microbial pathogens and other infectious agents that manipulate the purine salvage pathway-apoptosis axis during infection can eventually be prevented, attenuated, or treated by using (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87. Nevertheless, administration of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 did not completely abolish disease development and abscess formation during sub-lethal bloodstream infection in mice. Thus, double-pronged therapies which cover the usage of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 combined with antibiotics, various anti-infective agents, or monoclonal antibodies, some of which are known to neutralize predominant staphylococcal virulence determinants, including secreted toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ragle and Bubeck Wardenburg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hua et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Thomsen et al., 2017</xref>), protein A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2022b</xref>), and specific surface antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bennett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">de Vor et al., 2022</xref>) along with usage of other host-directed therapeutics that impede <italic>S. aureus</italic> disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bravo-Santano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alphonse et al., 2021</xref>), may essentially improve disease progression during staphylococcal infections. Ultimately, combinatorial therapies that involve usage of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 may even help to enhance outcomes of life-threatening septicemia or other fatal bacterial infectious diseases and should therefore be considered for pre-clinical tests in animal models.</p>
<p>Overall, (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87-mediated inhibition of dCK is a novel host-directed therapeutic concept to mitigate staphylococcal abscess formation in organ tissues upon bloodstream infection. Since (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 is extremely well tolerated in humans (personal communication; Kenneth A. Schultz, Trethera Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA) and currently being investigated in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of non-communicable diseases, including cancer and multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Poddar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2022a</xref>), this compound already meets the requirements for a prompt launch of clinical studies in individuals that suffer local or invasive staphylococcal infections. Optimization of (<italic>R</italic>)-DI-87 or any medically acceptable derivatives thereof may further accelerate this process and concurrently could also aid in the design of pre-exposure prophylactic agents for hospitalized or high-risk patients, with the primary aim to enhance infection control and public health.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Winstel and colleagues test if the deoxycytidine kinase inhibitor, (R)-DI-87 provides therapeutic benefit during infection with Staphylococcus aureus. The premise behind the current work is a series of prior studies that found that S. aureus can disable functional immune clearance by generating NET-derived deoxyribonucleosides to induce macrophage apoptosis via purine salvage. Here, the authors use in vitro and in vivo experiments with (R)-DI-87 to demonstrate that inhibition of deoxycytidine kinase prevents S. aureus-induced deoxyribonucleoside-mediated macrophage cell death, to bolster immune cell function and promote more effective clearance during infection. The authors conclude that (R)-DI-87 represents and potentially important Host-Directed Therapy (HDT) with good potential to promote natural clearance of infection without targeting the bacterium. Overall, the study represents an important next step in the exploration of purine salvage and deoxyribonucleoside toxicity as a targetable pathway to bolster infection clearance and provides early-stage evidence of the therapeutic potential of (R)-DI-87 during S. aureus infection.</p>

<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful suggestions for improvement of our manuscript.
Specific details and comments on all raised concerns can be found below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study has several strengths that support its conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) Well-controlled in vitro studies that firmly establish (R)-DI-87 is capable of blocking deoxyribonucleoside-mediated apoptosis of immune cell lines and primary cells.</p>
<p>(2) Solid evidence to support that administration of (R)-DI-87 can have therapeutic benefits during infection (reduced number of abscesses and reduced CFU).</p>
<p>(3) Controls included to ascertain the degree to which (R)-DI-87 might have secondary effects on immune cell distribution.</p>
<p>(4) Controls included to ascertain whether or not (R)-DI-87 has intrinsic antibacterial properties.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, there are several important weaknesses related to the rigor of the research and the conclusions drawn. The most relevant weaknesses noted by this reviewer are:</p>
<p>(1) Drawing firm conclusions about the therapeutic potential of (R)-DI-87 using only S. aureus strain Newman, a methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, that while a clinical isolate is not clearly representative of the strains of S. aureus causing infection in hospitals and communities. Newman also harbors an unusual mutation in a regulator that dramatically changes virulence factor gene expression. While the data with Newman remains valuable, the absence of consideration of other strains, including MRSA, makes it more difficult to support the relatively broad conclusions about therapeutic potential made by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We assume that this is a misunderstanding. S. aureus Newman is a patient-derived isolate and not a regulator mutant and/or laboratory strain (Duthie and Lorenz LL 1952, J Gen Microbiol 6(1-2), 95107). Its genome is fully sequenced (Baba et al. 2008, J Bacteriol 190(1):300-10) and it is highly virulent in mouse or human ex vivo models (e.g. Alonzo 3rd et al. 2013, Nature 493(7430):51-5.; DuMont et al. 2011, Mol Microbiol 79(3):814-25; Skaar et al. 2004, Science 305(5690):1626-8). Moreover, S. aureus Newman has served as a gold standard to study abscess formation in the past (e.g. Thammavongsa et al. 2013, Science 342(6160):863-6; Cheng et al. 2009, FASEB J 23(10):3393-404; Corbin et al. 2008, Science 319(5865):962-5) and has further also been used multiple times to test the therapeutic efficacy of antimicrobial or anti-infective agents in various animal models of infectious disease (e.g. Buckley et al. 2023, Cell Host Microbe 31(5):751-765.e11; Zhang et al. 2014, PNAS 111(37):13517-22; Richter et al. 2013, PNAS 110(9):3531-6). Apart from this, it is crucial to note that methicillin-sensitive isolates such as S. aureus Newman are typically more frequently isolated in hospitals as compared to MRSA. Specifically, public health system- and population-based surveillance studies clearly indicate that annual incidence rates for MSSA infections are dominant over those associated with MRSA infections (e.g. Gagliotti et al. 2021, Euro Surveill 26(46):2002094; Jackson et al. 2020, Clin Infect Dis 70(6):1021-1028; Laupland et al. 2013, Clin Microbiol Infect 19(5):465-71), even in groups at elevated risk (e.g. McMullan et al. 2016, JAMA Pediatr et al., 170(10):979-986; Ericson et al. 2015, JAMA Pediatr 169(12):1105-11). Although we understand and agree with the reviewer that certain MRSA clones can be a dominant cause of staphylococcal disease in specific geographic areas, we believe that S. aureus Newman adequately reflects staphylococcal isolates that cause the majority of infections in humans. In this regard, we would also like to highlight once more that (R)-DI-87 targets host dCK and not the bacterium. Accordingly, the antibiotic resistance status of S. aureus is not expected to impact our main findings and conclusions as (R)-DI-87 exclusively inhibits dCK, a key element of the mammalian purine salvage pathway.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In vitro (R)-DI-87 efficacy studies with dAdo and dGuo are strong, however, the authors do not test the in vitro efficacy of (R)-DI-87 using S. aureus. They have done this type of work in prior studies (See doi: 10.1073/pnas.1805622115 - Figure 5). If included it would greatly strengthen their argument that (R)-DI87 is directly affecting the S. aureus --&gt; Nuclease --&gt; AdsA macrophage-killing pathway. Without it, the evidence provided remains indirect, and several conclusions may be overstated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We highly appreciate this comment and agree with the reviewer that such an experiment would support our main findings. Thus, we have performed additional experiments and took advantage of a previously described approach (Tantawy et al. 2022, Front Immunol 13:847171) to demonstrate that (R)DI-87-mediated inhibition of host dCK enhances macrophage survival upon treatment with culture media that had been conditioned by incubation with adsA-proficient or adsA-deficient staphylococci in the presence or absence of purine deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates. Our findings are described in the main text and in a new figure (Fig. 2K-L). Based on these new findings and together with our rAdsA-based approach (Fig. 2I-J), we are confident that (R)-DI-87 represents a suitable small molecule inhibitor of host dCK which can prevent host immune cell death induced by toxigenic products associated with the S. aureus Nuc/AdsA pathway.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Caspase-3 immunoblot experiments seem to suggest an alternative conclusion to what was made by the authors. They point out that Caspase-3 cleavage does not occur upon treatment with (R)-DI-87. However, the data seem to argue that there is almost no caspase-3 present in (R)-DI-87 treated cells (cleaved or uncleaved). Might this suggest that caspase-3 is not even produced when cells are not experiencing deoxyribonucleoside toxicity? Perhaps the authors could reconsider the interpretation of this data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We believe that this is a misunderstanding. Our immunoblots (Fig. 3E-F) show only the processed forms of caspase-3. The antibody we have used can recognize full-length caspase-3 along with the p17 and p19 subunits that can result from cleavage. To clarify this point, we have slightly modified our main figure and provide the full immunoblots (Source data file) which clearly demonstrate that unprocessed caspase-3 (pro-caspase-3) is present in all samples. In this regard, we further note that caspase-3 can also form heterocomplexes with other proteins, presumably explaining some of the unknown bands in samples obtained from cells that have been exposed to death-effector deoxyribonucleosides. Additional bands are probably a result of cross-reactivity of the antibody and/or unspecific degradation of pro-caspase in cellular lysates.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) There are some concerns over experimental rigor and clarity of the experimental design in the methods. The most important points noted by this reviewer are included here. (a.) There is no description of the number of replicates or representation of the Western blots and no uncropped blots are provided. (b.) the methods describing the treatment conditions for in vivo studies are not sufficiently clear. For example, it is hard to tell when (R)-DI-87 is first administered to mice. Is it immediately before the infection, immediately after, or at the same time? This has important implications for interpreting the results in terms of therapeutic potential. (c.) There are several statements made that (R)-DI-87 does not have a negative impact on the mice however, it is not sufficiently clear that the studies conducted are sufficient to make this broader claim that (R)-DI-87 has no impact on the animal, except as it relates to the distribution of immune cells, which is directly tested. (d.) there are no quantitative measures of apoptosis or macrophage infiltration, which impacts the rigor of these imaging experiments. (e.) only female mice are used in the in vivo studies. There is no justification provided for this choice; however, the rigor of the study design and the ability to draw conclusions about therapeutic potential is impacted in the absence of consideration of both sexes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you for raising these points here. (a) We have modified our figure legend and provide the full immunoblots (Source data file) in order to clarify this point. (b) Moreover, we now provide more experimental details on the treatment conditions that were used to administer (R)-DI-87 to mice (methods section). (c) Furthermore, we have conducted new experiments in order to demonstrate that administration of (R)-DI-87 has no impact on laboratory animals. Specifically, we provide new data along with additional text on organ cellularity following long-term exposure of mice to (R)-DI-87. In this regard, we have also applied our immuno-phenotyping approach to spleen tissues samples derived from mice that received (R)-DI-87 or vehicle. As outlined in our new results, neither developmental errors nor differences in lymphocyte development have been observed (new Fig. 4B-C; new supplementary Fig. 3). Together with our data on mouse body weight along with our immuno-phenotyping approach of blood cells (Fig. 4A and 4D) and the fact that (R)-DI-87 is extremely well tolerated in humans (personal communication; Kenneth
A. Schultz, Trethera Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA), we are very confident that application of (R)-DI87 is safe and has no detrimental impact on the host. (d) Lastly, we would like to point out that due to the densely packed and extremely sticky cuff of immune cells within staphylococcal abscesses, it is technically not possible to extract enough abscess material required for a reliable quantification of apoptotic macrophages within infectious foci. Such an analysis would also not allow us to differentiate between lesion-infiltrating macrophages and macrophages that may reside at the periphery of the abscess. For these reasons, we have established a fluorescence microscopy-based approach to demonstrate increased macrophage infiltration rates into abscesses formed in organs of mice that have been treated with the dCK-specific inhibitor (R)-DI-87 (Fig. 5A-P). Nonetheless, we have slightly modified our figure and its legend in order to help the readership to localize S. aureus-derived tissue lesions and the periphery of abscesses in these images. (e) Finally, publicly available databases indicate that dCK is equally well expressed in various tissues in both sexes. Moreover, dCK is not encoded on a sex chromosome, neither in mice nor in humans. Thus, we believe that it is justified to test the in vivo efficacy of (R)-DI-87 in female mice. Nonetheless, we have conducted additional in vitro experiments to test whether (R)-DI-87 can protect male animal-derived BMDMs from death-effector deoxyribonucleosides in a manner similar to cells derived from female mice. As expected, we did not observe a sex-specific effect (new supplementary Fig. 5), and hope that this adequately addresses this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Animal studies show significant disease burden (CFU) even after administration of (R)-DI-87. Given the absence of robust clearance of infection, the author's claims read as an overstatement of the data. The authors may wish to reframe their conclusions to better highlight the potential benefit of this therapy at reducing severe disease but also to point out relevant limitations, especially considering that it does not lead to clearance in this model. In general, the consideration of the limitations of the proposed therapeutic approach, as uncovered by the data, is not present. A more nuanced consideration of the data and its interpretations, including both strengths and limitations, would greatly help to frame the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thank you for raising this point here. To highlighting the limitations of our approach, we have modified several passages in the main text. Moreover, we have adjusted our discussion section accordingly.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In vivo experiments, the dose given to mice was 75mg/kg. How did the author determine the dose of this drug?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this question, which gives us the chance to clarify this point. The experimental condition used to block host dCK in mice has been adopted from a previous publication (Chen et al. 2023, Immunology 168(1):152-169). To improve the overall quality of our current manuscript, we now included more background information addressing this point. Specifically, we have added additional in vivo and biochemical data along with more conclusive text to our results section to better explain the reason for the dose given to mice (new Fig. 4E).</p>

<p>(2) The author established a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus blood infection in vivo and divided four groups for related experiments. It is suggested that the authors should supplement the survival rate of mice in each group so that readers can understand the effect of the drug on the survival of mice with bloodstream infection.</p>

<p>Response: While this is an interesting suggestion by the reviewer, we believe that this is beyond the scope of our study. In particular, the current study focused on analyzing the capacity of the dCK-specific inhibitor (R)-DI-87 to improve macrophage survival during staphylococcal abscess formation in an effort to lower bacterial loads in infected organ tissues. However, we agree with the reviewer that (R)-DI-87 might also help to improve further clinical syndromes of staphylococcal infections, including lethal bloodstream infection. We therefore modified parts of our discussion to address this point.</p>

<p>(3) In the in vivo experiment, the author administered the drug by intragastric administration, but the treatment was for the bloodstream infection of Staphylococcus aureus, so the author needed to determine the actual effective concentration of the drug in the blood of mice.</p>

<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that inclusion of more background information and data would be a valuable addition to our manuscript. As outlined above, we have designed our in vivo experiments based on the methodology of a previous publication (Chen et al. 2023, Immunology 168(1):152-169). Similar to Chen and colleagues, we have also used a dose of 75 mg/kg of (R)-DI-87 that allows complete inhibition of host dCK in vivo. In this regard, we have now performed additional in vivo experiments to address this point. More precisely, we took advantage of a highly sensitive and LC-MS/MSbased method to measure accumulation of deoxycytidine, the natural substrate of host dCK, in mouse plasma upon administration of the dCK-specific inhibitor. As shown in our new Fig. 4E, administration of (R)-DI-87 at a dose of 75 mg/kg strongly increased deoxycytidine levels in mouse plasma thereby indicating that host dCK activity is completely blocked under these experimental conditions.</p>

<p>(5) This work is to reduce the apoptosis of macrophages through drug inhibition of dck, but not directly inhibit the related virulence of Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, it is suggested that the author modify the title to summarize the whole paper more accurately.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that our manuscriptâs title might be a bit misleading as (R)-DI-87 does not directly target the bacterium or staphylococcal virulence factors. Thus, we have modified the title of our revised manuscript to: âTargeting host deoxycytidine kinase mitigates Staphylococcus aureus abscess formationâ.</p>
