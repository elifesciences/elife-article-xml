<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Bacteria in biofilms secrete potassium ions to attract free swimming cells. However, the basis of chemotaxis to potassium remains poorly understood. Here, using a microfluidic device, we found that <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> can rapidly accumulate in regions of high potassium concentration on the order of millimoles. Using a bead assay, we measured the dynamic response of individual flagellar motors to stepwise changes in potassium concentration, finding that the response resulted from the chemotaxis signaling pathway instead of the motor response to changes in the proton motive force (PMF). To characterize the chemotactic response to potassium, we exposed the bacteria to a range of potassium concentrations and measured the dose-response curve and adaptation kinetics via a FRET assay, finding that the chemotaxis pathway exhibited a sensitive response and fast adaptation to potassium. We further found that the two major chemoreceptors Tar and Tsr respond differently to potassium. Tar receptors exhibit a biphasic response, whereas Tsr receptors respond to potassium as an attractant. These different responses were consistent with the responses of the two receptors to intracellular pH changes. Therefore, bacteria may sense the change in potassium concentration by sensing the change in intracellular pH. The sensitive response and fast adaptation allow bacteria to sense and localize small changes in potassium concentration. As the ratio of the two major chemoreceptors changes with bacterial growth stages, the differential responses of Tar and Tsr receptors to potassium suggest that cells at different growth stages respond differently to potassium and may have different requirements for potassium.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Potassium is an important ion in the normal physiological process of organisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Potassium ions are a major component in establishing the resting membrane potential and thus ensure proper function of the muscles and nerves. Potassium deficiency can affect many biological functions, such as human heartbeat <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and photosynthesis and respiration of plants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In prokaryotes, such as bacteria, potassium ions play a critical role in maintaining the osmotic pressure, pH value and membrane potential of cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, both the expression of genes and the activities of enzymes are also regulated by potassium ions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Because of its central role in maintaining the normal physiological state of cells, organisms have evolved a series of regulatory systems to control the intracellular concentration of potassium ions, such as Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATP pumps in higher organisms and potassium transport systems in prokaryotes. Most of the studies on potassium have focused on its effects on cell physiology or the dynamics of potassium transport systems. In contrast, studies on the behavioral response to environmental potassium concentration changes and the signaling pathways involved are very limited for bacteria.</p>
<p>Bacteria sense and respond to chemicals via the chemotaxis signaling pathway. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, chemo stimuli are detected by transmembrane receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The sensed signal is then transmitted to the associated cytoplasmic histidine kinase CheA, affecting its autophosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. CheA transfers its phosphoryl group to the response regulator CheY and the methylesterase CheB, yielding CheY-P and CheB-P, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. CheY-P binds to the base of the flagellar motor, increasing the probability of motor rotating clockwise (CW), namely motor CW bias, and thus increasing the cell tumble frequency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The phosphatase CheZ binds to CheY-P and accelerates its dephosphorylation. CheB-P and CheR demethylate and methylate the receptors, respectively, to accomplish robust adaptation in chemotaxis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Conventional stimuli are sensed by <italic>E. coli</italic> directly or indirectly. The former suggests that the ligand can bind to the periplasmic domain of the corresponding receptor directly and modify kinase activity, such as MeAsp and serine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The latter requires the help of binding proteins, such as maltose sensed by the Tar receptor with the help of periplasmic maltose binding protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, and peptides sensed by the Tap receptor with the help of peptide binding proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, the detailed mechanism of bacterial sensing and response to ionic stimuli, such as the chemotactic repellent, nickel ions, is not clear <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The chemotactic response of other ions also remains to be studied.</p>
<p>It was discovered recently that bacteria in biofilms secrete potassium into their surroundings through ion channels on the cell membrane, thereby affecting the behavior of distant free bacteria and attracting them <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. However, how limited changes in potassium concentration regulate the movement of bacteria, especially after long-distance diffusion, is still unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we constructed a linear concentration gradient of potassium ions with a microfluidic device, and found obvious taxis to the region of high concentration for wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic>. To determine the origin of this taxis, we measured the response of motor speed and CW bias to a stepwise increase in potassium concentration. The motor CW bias exhibits an attractant-like response, while the motor speed remains constant, which suggests a constant proton motive force (PMF). The chemotaxis-defective strain did not respond to this stimulus. This confirmed that the CW bias response of motors resulted from the upstream chemotaxis signaling pathway. To further characterize the response of the chemotactic signal to potassium, we directly measured the response of kinase activity to different concentrations of potassium chloride by monitoring the FRET between CheY-eYFP and CheZ-eCFP. We ruled out the possibility of osmotaxis by comparing the responses to 30 mM potassium chloride and 60 mM sucrose. The dose-response curve and step response of kinase activity to potassium suggested a sensitive sensing process and fast adaptation. Further experiments with mutants expressing Tar, Tsr or no receptor suggested that this chemotactic response may result from the increase in intracellular pH. Our findings suggest a new mechanism of chemotactic response to ionic stimuli. Employing a coarse-grained chemotaxis model with parameters extracted from our measurements, we performed stochastic simulation of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in a potassium gradient generated by a biofilm producing an oscillating potassium signal, and demonstrated the delayed periodic attraction of the cells to the biofilm.</p>

<title>Chemotaxis in a linear concentration gradient of potassium</title>
<p>It has been reported that potassium ions work as a communication agent in swarms and biofilms for both <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. A high concentration of potassium chloride (300 mM) could attract swimming cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. To study the chemotactic response of <italic>E. coli</italic> to potassium, we set up a linear concentration profile of potassium chloride with a microfluidic device designed as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, a five-channel diffusion device was constructed. 2% (w/v) agarose was injected into the two resistance channels through port (<bold><italic>b</italic></bold>) to block the passage of cells without influencing the diffusion of potassium. A 100 mM potassium chloride solution, prepared in the potassium-depleted motility buffer, flows through the source channel from port (<bold><italic>a</italic></bold>) to (<bold><italic>a’</italic></bold>), while potassium-depleted motility buffer flows through the sink channel from port (<bold><italic>c</italic></bold>) to (<bold><italic>c’</italic></bold>). Potassium diffuses from the source channel to the sink channel and forms a linear concentration gradient in the observation channel <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The wild-type strain HCB1 was sealed in the observation channel through port (<bold><italic>p</italic></bold>) with a drop of hot agarose (2% w/v). The movements of the cells were recorded by a high-speed CMOS camera. Four movies were recorded. An example video is shown in Movie S1. We calculated the displacement of the mean cell position for each movie. The average results are plotted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>. The shaded area denotes SEM. We also computed the cell density profile along the <italic>y</italic>-axis in the observation channel at the initial time of <italic>t</italic> = 1 s and steady state (<italic>t</italic> = 300 s). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, the green squares and blue dots are experimental data. The error bars denote SEM. We found that the distribution of cells is exponential at steady state, similar to the results of logarithmic chemotactic sensing in a linear MeAsp gradient <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The red solid line denotes the exponential fit, with a fitted decay constant of 0.0085±0.0004 μm<sup>-1</sup>. As reported previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, the fitted exponential decay constant equals <italic>vd</italic>/<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, where <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> and <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> denote the drift velocity and cell motility constant, respectively.

<p>According to our results, the wild-type strain exhibited significant movement toward the area of high concentration in a linear concentration gradient of potassium chloride, which was similar to its chemotaxis in a typical attractant concentration gradient <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>E. coli</italic> could be attracted by potassium and perform a trend movement in a linear gradient field on the order of millimoles. We sought to further investigate the characteristics and mechanisms of this attractant-like response.</p>

<title>The response of the motor rotational signal to potassium</title>
<p>Potassium is important for maintaining cell membrane potential, which is one of the two components of PMF. PMF is the energy source for the flagellar motor. The absolute value of the transmembrane electrical potential will decrease when the concentration of extracellular potassium increases. This may lead to a change in PMF and affect bacterial chemotaxis by directly changing the motor behavior. However, earlier studies found that a sudden change in membrane potential in <italic>E. coli</italic> would result in a reverse change in the transmembrane proton concentration difference, thus keeping PMF virtually constant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To test whether the chemotactic response of <italic>E. coli</italic> to potassium resulted from possible PMF changes, we monitored the motor response of the wild-type strain (JY26-pKAF131) to a stepwise addition of 30 mM potassium chloride using a bead assay. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, the cell body was attached to a 0.01% poly-l-lysine-coated cover slide. A 1-μm-diameter bead was marked on the truncated filament. We used a high-speed CMOS camera to record the rotation of the bead. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, the typical traces of motor rotational speed (blue line) and CW bias (purple line) were calculated. The positive and negative values of speed denote CCW (counter-clockwise) and CW (clockwise) rotation, respectively. The CW bias is positively correlated with the intracellular concentration of CheY-P <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, and the rotational speed is proportional to the PMF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The stimulus (30 mM KCl) was added at <italic>t</italic> =120 s and removed at <italic>t</italic> = 480 s. The average trace of 83 motors is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>. The moments of addition and removal of stimulus were shifted to <italic>t</italic> = 0, which are marked by the purple dashed line and green dashed line, respectively. The CW bias decreased upon addition of potassium chloride, and then it adapted to a higher level than the pre-stimulus value. Such over adaptation was similar to the response of CW bias to sucrose in osomotaxis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. However, the motor speed remained constant during this process, confirming that the PMF remained constant, which was different from the osmotaxis response of motors. The results suggested that the response of motor CW bias to potassium was not due to PMF change. We performed further experiments with the chemotaxis-defective strain (HCB901-pBES38). The average result of 22 motors exhibited no response to 30 mM potassium chloride for either CW bias or speed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), especially on the time scale of the chemotactic response as seen in the wild-type cells. These results confirmed that the CW bias response of the motor to potassium resulted from the upstream chemotaxis signaling pathway.</p>

<title>The response of the chemotaxis signal to potassium</title>
<p>To directly measure the response of the chemotaxis signal to potassium ions, we monitored the receptor kinase activity <italic>in vivo</italic> by monitoring the FRET between CheY-eYFP and CheZ-eCFP.</p>
<p>Using the FRET setup described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, we measured the chemotactic response of a cell population with the wild-type strain (HCB1288-pVS88). We measured the response of the same sample to potassium chloride at different concentrations and to 100 μM MeAsp (a typical saturated attractant for the Tar receptor in <italic>E. coli</italic>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, potassium (blue solid line) induces a significant chemotaxis response as an attractant. Compared with 100 μM MeAsp, 30 mM KCl resulted in a larger response and faster adaptation. Moreover, the chemotaxis signal exhibits an imprecise adaptation. This is different from the over adaptation exhibited by motor CW bias. To exclude the effect of chloride ion, we quantitatively compared the response of the chemotaxis signal to 10 mM KCl and 5 mM K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, both of which contain 10 mM potassium ion with or without chloride ion. As shown in Fig. S1, they induce similar responses. We also measured the response of the motor rotational signal to 15 mM K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> using the bead assay and compared it with the response to 30 mM KCl (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The results are shown in Fig. S2. The response of CW bias to 15 mM K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> exhibited an attractant response, characterized by a decreased CW bias upon the addition of K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, followed by an over-adaptation that is qualitatively similar to the response to 30 mM KCl. Thus, the chemotactic response mainly resulted from potassium ions rather than chloride ions.</p>

Here, we obtained a similar over adaptation in the CW bias response of motors as that of osmotaxis.

The results are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>. In our measurements, 60 mM sucrose induced a repellent-like response, which is consistent with previous work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, whereas 30 mM KCl induced an attractant response. Thus, the chemotactic response of <italic>E. coli</italic> to KCl did not result from osmotaxis.

<title>Quantitative characterization of the chemotaxis response to potassium</title>
<p>To quantitively describe the response of receptor-kinase activity to potassium ions, we measured the dose-response curve of HCB1288-pVS88 to potassium chloride.

<title>The chemotactic response to potassium may result from the intracellular pH increase</title>
<p>We showed that the attractant-like response of the chemotaxis signal to potassium does not result from osmotaxis. Moreover, the PMF or motor speed did not change during that process. Considering that the absolute value of the transmembrane potential deceases as the concentration of extracellular potassium ions increases, the intracellular pH will increase to maintain a constant PMF. To confirm this, we monitored the intracellular pH using the pH-sensitive fluorescent protein pHlourin2, by computing the ratio of emitted fluorescence intensities with 405 nm and 488 nm excitations (the ratio increases with pH value) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.

<p>It was reported that Tar and Tsr mediate opposite responses to the changes in intracellular pH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Therefore, we measured the chemotaxis response of strains expressing only the Tar or Tsr receptor via the FRET assay. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, four different concentrations of KCl were added and removed successively, and the kinases activity of the Tsr-only strain exhibited an attractant response. Its imprecise adaptation is apparent as the potassium concentration increases. In contrast, the Tar-only strain exhibited a biphasic response, with kinase activity increasing sharply and then decreasing rapidly below the prestimulus level upon addition of potassium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Such a biphasic response was also observed in the response of the Tar-only strain to 40 mM sodium benzoate at pH of 7.0 (Fig. S3). Note that the cytoplasmic pH deceases upon addition of sodium benzoate at pH of 7.0, so that the response to addition of sodium benzoate is opposite to the response to addition of potassium for the Tar-only strain. Therefore, the different responses of the Tar- and Tsr-only strains to potassium were consistent with the responses to the increase in intracellular pH.</p>
<p>We noted that both major receptors exhibited imprecise adaptation to stepwise addition of potassium. To investigate whether this was due to chemotactic sensing, we monitored the response of the strain with no chemoreceptors to stepwise addition of potassium. Upon addition of potassium, the FRET value decreased and remained at a constant value similar to the adapted level for the strains with chemoreceptors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). This indicated that the imprecise adaptation seen for the wild-type, Tar-only and Tsr-only strains was not due to chemosensing. As the solution pH affects the brightness of fluorescent proteins, we hypothesize that this apparent imprecise adaptation was due to the differential change in eCFP and eYFP brightness when the cytoplasmic pH changed. To test this hypothesis, we bleached the eYFPs of the no-receptor strain (HCB1414-pVS88), eliminating possible FRET between CheY-eYFP and CheZ-eCFP, and compared the response of CFP fluorescence intensity to 30 mM KCl before and after bleaching. As shown in Fig. S4A, the CFP intensity showed similar amount of increase upon addition of KCl (i.e., increase of cytoplasmic pH) before and after YFP bleaching. Thus, such a response did not result from FRET, but from changes in fluorescence intensity due to an increase in intracellular pH. We calculated the ratio of CFP fluorescence intensity <italic>P</italic> = <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> = 1.056 without FRET, where <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> and <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> were the CFP intensity for cells in 30 mM KCl and motility medium, respectively. From this ratio we could calculate the theoretical enhancement in CFP intensity due to pH increase for the wild-type strain (HCB1288-pVS88) after adding 30 mM KCl (red dashed line in Fig. S4B), which we found was similar to the adapted level of the CFP signal. This further proved that the apparent imprecise adaptation in the FRET signal was due to changes in eCFP and eYFP brightness when the cytoplasmic pH changed.</p>

<title>Revised FRET responses by correcting the pH effects on the brightness of eCFP and eYFP</title>
<p>To minimize the impact of pH-changes altering the fluorescent protein brightness on FRET measurements of chemotactic response and adaptation to potassium, we measured the full potassium response curve for the no-receptor mutant (HCB1414-pVS88), as shown in Fig. S5. We characterized the pH effects on CFP and YFP channels at different concentrations of KCl, and the relationship between the ratio of the signal post- to pre-KCl addition and the KCl concentration was established for both channels, as shown in Fig. S5C. The pH-corrected signal after KCl addition for strains with receptors was obtained by dividing the original signal after KCl addition by this ratio at the specific KCl concentration. This procedure was applied to both CFP and YFP channels. The pH-corrected responses for the Tar-only and Tsr-only strains are represented by red dots in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5BC</xref>.</p>
<p>We recalculated the FRET responses to stepwise addition of KCl, with an example depicted by the red dots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>. The corrected response magnitude to 30 mM KCl is similar to that of 100 μM MeAsp, being 1.06 ± 0.10 times as large, as shown by the red bar in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>. We also calculated the dose-response curve and the adaptation curve from the pH-corrected signals, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. The FRET signal also exhibits over-adaptation, similar to the bead assay, when we recalculated the response by correcting the CFP and YFP channels. The fitted Hill coefficient for the dose-response curve is 0.88 ± 0.14 (mean ± SD), which is close to the response to MeAsp (∼1.2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, and the concentration for half-maximal response (<italic>K</italic><sub>0.5</sub>) was 0.33 ± 0.06 mM (mean ± SD).</p>
<p>Our results indicated that the increase in the extracellular concentration of potassium leads to an increase in the intracellular pH. The Tar and Tsr receptors respond to the increase in intracellular pH differently. The wild-type strain exhibits a similar response to the Tsr-only strain due to the larger amount of Tsr than Tar receptors. These responses could be adapted via methylation and demethylation of receptors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Potassium ions play a critical role in many physiological processes of bacteria. Bacteria in biofilms release potassium ions to their surroundings through ion channels on the cell membrane, thus influencing the behavior of surrounding bacteria and attracting distant free bacteria to swim toward them. However, the mechanism of bacterial sensing and response to potassium ions was unclear. Here, we found that <italic>E. coli</italic> senses the concentration change of extracellular potassium ions sensitively via the chemotaxis signaling pathway, and this chemotactic sensing is achieved through changes in intracellular pH.</p>
<p>We found that <italic>E. coli</italic> could quickly converge to the area with a higher concentration of potassium under a linear concentration profile. The measurements of the response of individual motors to stepwise addition and removal of 30 mM KCl via the bead assay demonstrated that the attractant response resulted from the chemotaxis signaling pathway instead of the possible PMF effect on the motor itself. We also demonstrated that the PMF remained unchanged when KCl was added or removed.</p>
<p>To directly measure the chemotactic response of <italic>E. coli</italic> to potassium ions, we measured the response to different concentrations of potassium via FRET between CheY-eYFP and CheZ-eCFP. After correcting the pH effects on the brightness of CFP and YFP proteins, we found that the chemotactic response of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> to 30 mM KCl was 1.06 ± 0.10 times that to 100 μM MeAsp. The response to 60 mM sucrose was - 0.30 ± 0.05 times that to 100 μM MeAsp. This suggested that the attractant response to potassium was independent of the osmolality response. To quantitatively describe the chemotactic response to potassium, we systematically measured the dose-response curve and the step responses. We obtained a Hill coefficient of 0.88±0.14 and a concentration of 0.33±0.06 mM for the half-maximal response. This showed that <italic>E. coli</italic> had a very sensitive response to potassium ions and could sense weak changes in potassium concentration. We also found that <italic>E. coli</italic> adapts quickly to potassium concentration changes in the range of 0.01 mM-100 mM, which promotes cell localization to the peak of a potassium concentration profile.</p>
<p>For other strong attractant stimuli such as high concentrations of MeAsp, the step response typically shows a low plateau before it adapts. However, in the case of potassium, the FRET signal does not typically display an obvious plateau following the stimuli. To observe the low plateau before adaptation, a saturating amount of attractant should be added in a stepwise manner. According to the dose-response curve we measured for potassium, a saturating amount of potassium would be close to 100 mM. In fact, there is a small segment of the low plateau in the step response to 30 mM KCl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). To observe more of this low plateau, we could have used a higher concentration of KCl. However, a stimulation higher than 30 mM KCl will induce substantial physiological changes in the cell, resulting in a significant decrease in fluorescence for both channels (Fig. S7). Therefore, the range of KCl concentration that can be reliably applied in FRET measurements is limited.</p>
<p>While keeping the PMF unchanged, addition of potassium decreases the membrane potential and thus increases the intracellular pH. This was demonstrated by intracellular pH measurements. We also measured the chemotaxis response of mutant strains expressing only Tsr or Tar to different concentrations of potassium. The Tsr-only strain responded to potassium as an attractant, whereas the Tar-only strain exhibited a biphasic response (a repellent-like followed by an attractant-like response). The different responses of Tar and Tsr to potassium were consist with their responses to changes in intracellular pH. We further demonstrated the biphasic response of the Tar-only strain to 40 mM sodium benzoate with pH of 7.0 that induced a decrease in intracellular pH. The differential responses of the Tsr and Tar receptors to potassium may be a strategy by which bacteria adjust their response to potassium at different growth stages during which bacteria express different ratios of Tsr to Tar receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. For the growth stage used in our measurements here, the amount of Tsr was more than that of Tar in the wild-type strain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, so the response to potassium was dominated by Tsr.</p>
<p>The response of the Tar-only strain to potassium warrants further discussion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). This strain shows a repellent response to stepwise addition of low concentrations of potassium, specifically less than 10 mM. This is consistent with previous observations of the response of Tar to changes in intracellular pH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Interestingly, it exhibits a biphasic response to high potassium concentrations of 10 mM and above. This biphasic response might result from additional pH-effects on the activity of intracellular enzymes such as CheRB and CheA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, which may have a different timescale and response from the Tar receptor.</p>
<p>Based on the potassium sensing mechanism we established here, we performed stochastic simulation of bacterial taxis in a biofilm-produced potassium gradient, demonstrating that <italic>E. coli</italic> cells can be periodically attracted by the biofilm. Moreover, we observed a time delay between the positions of the cells and the electric signal of the biofilm. Specifically, we found that the oscillation of <italic>E. coli</italic> cell displacement lags the potassium source by 11.7±0.5 min, 14.7±0.7 min, 14.8±0.9 min and 14.2±1.0 min (mean±SD) for driving periods of 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours, respectively. Remarkably, these values closely resemble the 9 to 35-min lag observed in biofilm experiments for <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, despite the potential variations in the potassium sensing mechanisms among these bacterial species.

Strains JY26 (Δ<italic>filC</italic>), HCB33, HCB901 (Δ<italic>cheZ fliC</italic>, Ptrc420 <italic>cheY</italic><sup>1<italic>3DK</italic>1<italic>06YW</italic></sup>), HCB1288 (Δ<italic>cheY cheZ</italic>), and HCB1414 (Δ<italic>tar tsr tap trg aer cheY cheZ</italic>) were derived from <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 strain RP437. The plasmid pKAF131 constitutively expresses FliC<sup>sticky</sup>. The plasmid pBES38 constitutively expresses both LacI<sup>q</sup> and the sticky filament FliC<sup>sticky</sup>. The promoters used for the constitutive expression of LacI<sup>q</sup> and FliC<sup>sticky</sup> were the I<sup>q</sup> promotor and the native promoter of <italic>fliC</italic>, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. The FRET pair CheY-eYFP and CheZ-eCFP was expressed from plasmid pVS88 under an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter. The plasmid pVS18 was used to express CheY-eYFP under an IPTG-inducible promoter. The plasmids pLC113 and pPA114 were used to express Tar and Tsr receptors under a salicylate-inducible promoter, respectively. The gene <italic>pHluorin2</italic> was cloned into pTrc99a under an IPTG-inducible promoter, yielding pTrc99a_pHluorin2.

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>All cells were grown at 33 °C in 10 ml T-broth (1% tryptone and 0.5% NaCl) to an OD<sub>600</sub> between 0.45-0.50 with appropriate antibiotics and inducers, collected by centrifugation and washed twice with potassium-depleted motility buffer (10 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM methionine, 10 mM lactate, pH 7.0). Cells of HCB1 were centrifuged for 6 min at 1200 ×g. Cells of JY26-pKAF131 were grown with 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. HCB901-pBES38 cells were grown with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 23 μM IPTG. Both were centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 ×g. Cells of HCB1288-pVS88 and HCB1414-pVS88 were grown with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μM IPTG in the dark. Cells of HCB1414-pLC113-pVS88 and HCB1414-pPA114-pVS88 were grown with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 100 μM IPTG and 1 μM salicylate in the dark. Cells of HCB33-pTrc99a_pHlourin2 were grown with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μM IPTG. Cells were stored at 4 °C before use. All experiments were carried out at 23 °C. The KCl solution used in this work was prepared in the potassium-depleted motility buffer.</p>

<title>Microfluidics</title>
<p>We constructed a 100-μm-depth microfluidic device similar to that described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The design is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. There are two auxiliary channels and three primary channels. The width of the auxiliary channels is 100 μm, while the width of the primary channels is 400 μm. The source and sink channels were used to flow 100 mM KCl and potassium-depleted motility buffer, respectively, and the observing channel was used to observe the motion of cells. The auxiliary channels were filled with 2% agarose gel at a temperature of 68°C and cooled down. In our measurement, we kept the flow at a rate of 5 ml/min in both source and sink channels with a syringe pump (Pump-22; Harvard Apparatus). The potassium ions could diffuse from the source channel to the sink channel and form a linear gradient in the observing channel. Cells of HCB1 were sealed in the observing channel, and their movement was recorded by a fast CMOS camera (Flare 2M360-CL, IO Industries) equipped on a Nikon Ti-E microscope at a magnification of 20×. The chemotaxis migration coefficient (CMC), as an indicator of the mean cell position (49), was calculated as the average of (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> - <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>)/194, where <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the <italic>x</italic>-position of the <italic>i</italic>th cell, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is the <italic>x</italic>-position of the center of the observing channel, and 194 μm is the half-width of the observed region.</p>

<title>Bead assay</title>
<p>We sheared the sticky filaments of the washed cell suspensions by passing them 200 times between two syringes equipped with 23-gauge needles and connected by a 7-cm-long polyethylene tube (0.58 mm inside diameter, no.0427411; Becton Dickinson), and condensed them into 300 μl in potassium-depleted motility buffer. To measure motor rotation, sheared cells were immobilized on a coverslip coated with poly-L-lysine (0.01%, P4707; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) assembled on a flow chamber <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, and allowed to stand for 5 min. Then, 1-μm-diameter polystyrene beads (0.27%, no. 0731; Polysciences) were flowed to replace the suspension and attached to the sheared filament stubs by allowing it to stand for 4 min. The rotation of beads was recorded by a fast CMOS camera (Flare 2M360-CL, IO Industries) equipped on a Nikon Ti-E inverted phase-contrast microscope at a magnification of 40×. The CW bias and rotational speed were calculated with a 20-s time window and 1-s time slide.</p>

<title>FRET assay</title>
<p>The experimental setup used in FRET measurements was the same as that described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The FRET setup was based on a Nikon Ti-E microscope equipped with a 40× 0.60 NA objective. The illumination light was provided by a 130-W mercury lamp, attenuated by a factor of 1024 with neutral density filters, and passed through an excitation bandpass filter (FF02-438/24-25, Semrock) and a dichroic mirror (FF458-Di02-25x36, Semrock). The epifluorescent emission was split into cyan and yellow channels by a second dichroic mirror (FF509-FDi01-25x36, Semrock). The signals in the two channels were then filtered by two emission bandpass filters (FF01-483/32-25 and FF01-542/32-25, Semrock) and collected by two photon-counting photomultipliers (H7421-40, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan), respectively. Signals from the two photomultipliers were recorded at a sampling rate of 1 Hz using a data-acquisition card installed in a computer (USB-1901(G)-1020, ADlink, New Taipei, Taiwan).</p>
<p>The washed cell suspension was concentrated 45 times and flowed into a flow chamber equipped with a poly-L-lysine-coated coverslip, allowing it to stand for 20 min. Then, the chamber was maintained under a constant flow (500 μ1/min) of potassium-depleted motility buffer by a syringe pump (Pump-22; Harvard Apparatus). The same flow was used to add and remove stimulus. All data analysis was performed using custom scripts in MATLAB 2018b (MathWorks). The FRET value was calculated as the ratio of YFP to CFP intensities, normalized by the prestimulus value. The impact of pH on the original signals for both CFP and YFP channels was corrected by

The pH-corrected FRET response is then calculated as the ratio of the pH-corrected YFP to the pH-corrected CFP, normalized by the pre-stimulus ratio.</p>
<p>For the YFP photobleaching assay, we measured the background of the CFP channel by recording the intensity of the CFP channel for the strain expressing only CheY-eYFP (HCB1288-pVS18). We monitored the response of the CFP signal to 30 mM KCl before and after bleaching YFP. The bleaching was carried out with a YFP filter set (C-FL YFP BP HYQ535, #41028, Chroma) under mercury lamp illumination without attenuation and sustained for 50 minutes. All these measurements were performed under the same conditions.</p>

<title>Intracellular pH measurements</title>
<p>The washed cells of HCB33-pTrc99a_pHluorin2 were immobilized on a coverslip assembled on a flow chamber and coated with poly-L-lysine. Then, a constant flow (500 μ1/min) was applied to the cells. The samples were illuminated periodically with two lasers. In each period, the laser with a wavelength of 405 nm was illuminated for 200 ms and stopped for 400 ms, and the laser with a wavelength of 488 nm was illuminated for another 200 ms and stopped for another 400 ms. The emission light passed through the T495lp dichroic mirror and AT495lp longpass filter and was collected by an EMCCD (Andor DU897) equipped on a Nikon Ti-E inverted phase-contrast microscope at a magnification of 100×. The changes in intracellular pH could be characterized by the ratio of emitted fluorescence between the two excitation lasers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper shows that E. coli exhibits a chemotactic response to potassium by measuring both the motor response (using a bead assay) and the intracellular signaling response (CheY phosporylation level via FRET) to step changes in potassium concentration. They find increase in potassium concentration induces a considerable attractant response, with amplitude comparable to aspartate, and cells can quickly adapt (and generally over-adapt). The authors propose that the mechanism for potassium response is through modifying intracellular pH; they find both that potassium modifies pH and other pH modifiers induce similar attractant responses. It is also shown, using Tar- and Tsr-only mutants, that these two chemoreceptors respond to potassium differently. Tsr has a standard attractant response, while Tar has a biphasic response (repellent-like then attractant-like). Finally, the authors use computer simulations to study the swimming response of cells to a periodic potassium signal secreted from a biofilm and find a phase delay that depends on the period of oscillation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The finding that E. coli can sense and adapt to potassium signals and the connection to intracellular pH is quite interesting and this work should stimulate future experimental and theoretical studies regarding the microscopic mechanisms governing this response. The evidence (from both the bead assay and FRET) that potassium induces an attractant response is convincing, as is the proposed mechanism involving modification of intracellular pH. The updated manuscript controls for the impact of pH on the fluorescent protein brightness that can bias the measured FRET signal. After correction the response amplitude and sharpness (hill coefficient) are comparable to conventional chemoattractants (e.g. aspartate), indicating the general mechanisms underlying the response may be similar. The authors suggest that the biphasic response of Tar mutants may be due to pH influencing the activity of other enzymes (CheA, CheR or CheB), which will be an interesting direction for future study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The measured response may be biased by adaptation, especially for weak potassium signals. For other attractant stimuli, the response typically shows a low plateau before it recovers (adapts). In the case of potassium, the FRET signal does not have an obvious plateau following the stimuli of small potassium concentrations, perhaps due to the faster adaptation compared to other chemoattractants. It is possible cells have already partially adapted when the response reaches its minimum, so the measured response may be a slight underestimate of the true response. Mutants without adaptation enzymes appear to be sensitive to potassium only at much larger concentrations, where the pH significantly disrupts the FRET signal; more accurate measurements would require the development of new mutants and/or measurement techniques.</p>
<p>Note added after the second revision: The authors made a reasonable argument regarding the effects of adaptation, which were estimated to be small.</p>

<p>We acknowledge and appreciate the reviewer's concerns regarding the potential impact of adaptation on the measured response magnitude. We have estimated the effect of adaptation on the measured response magnitude. The half-time of adaptation at 30 mM KCl was measured to be approximately 80 s, corresponding to a time constant of t = 80/ln(2) = 115.4 s, which is significantly longer than the time required for medium exchange in the flow chamber (less than 10 s). Consequently, the relative effect of adaptation on the measured response magnitude should be less than 1-exp(-10/t) = 8.3%. Even for the fastest adaptation (at the lowest KCl concentration) we measured, the effect should be less than 20%, which is within experimental uncertainties. Nevertheless, we agree that developing new techniques to measure the dose-response curve more precisely would be beneficial.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Zhang et al investigated the biophysical mechanism of potassium-mediated chemotactic behavior in E coli. Previously, it was reported by Humphries et al that the potassium waves from oscillating B subtilis biofilm attract P aeruginosa through chemotactic behavior of motile P aeruginosa cells. It was proposed that K+ waves alter PMF of P aeruginosa. However, the mechanism was this behaviour was not elusive. In this study, Zhang et al demonstrated that motile E coli cells accumulate in regions of high potassium levels. They found that this behavior is likely resulting from the chemotaxis signalling pathway, mediated by an elevation of intracellular pH. Overall, a solid body of evidence is provided to support the claims. However, the impacts of pH on the fluorescence proteins need to be better evaluated. In its current form, the evidence is insufficient to say that the fluoresce intensity ratio results from FRET. It may well be an artefact of pH change.</p>
<p>The authors now carefully evaluated the impact of pH on their FRET sensor by examining the YFP and CFP fluorescence with no-receptor mutant. The authors used this data to correct the impact of pH on their FRET sensor. This is an improvement, but the mathematical operation of this correction needs clarification. This is particularly important because, looking at the data, it is not fully convincing if the correction was done properly. For instance, 3mM KCl gives 0.98 FRET signal both in Fig3 and FigS4, but there is almost no difference between blue and red lines in Fig 3. FigS4 is very informative, but it does not address the concern raised by both reviewers that FRET reporter may not be a reliable tool here due to pH change.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for not making the correction process clear. We corrected the impact of pH on the original signals for both CFP and YFP channels by</p>

The pH-corrected FRET response is then calculated as the ratio of the pH-corrected YFP to the pH-corrected CFP signals, normalized by the pre-stimulus ratio.</p>
<p>As shown in Author response image1, which represents the same data as Fig. 3A and Fig. S5A, the original normalized FRET responses to 3 mM KCl are 0.967 for the wild-type strain (Fig. 3) and 0.981 for the no-receptor strain (Fig. S5). The standard deviation of the FRET values under steady-state conditions is 0.003. Thus, the difference in responses between the wild-type and no-receptor strains is significant and clearly exceeds the standard deviation. The pH correction factors CpH at 3 mM KCl are 1.004 for the YFP signal and 1.016 for the CFP signal. Consequently, the pH-corrected FRET responses are 0.967´1.016/1.004=0.979 for the wild-type and 0.981´1.016/1.004=0.993 for the no-receptor strain. The reason the pH-corrected FRET response for the no-receptor strain is 0.993 instead of the expected 1.000 is that this value represents the lowest observed response rather than the average value for the FRET response.</p>
<p>The detailed mathematical operation for correcting the pH impact has now been included in the “FRET assay” section of Materials and Methods.</p>

<p>The authors show the FRET data with both KCl and K2SO4, concluding that the chemotactic response mainly resulted from potassium ions. However, this was only measured by FRET. It would be more convincing if the motility assay in Fig1 is also performed with K2SO4. The authors did not address this point. In light of complications associated with the use of the FRET sensor, this experiment is more important.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We agree that additional confirmation with a motility assay is important. To address this, we have now measured the response of the motor rotational signal to 15 mM K2SO4 using the bead assay and compared it with the response to 30 mM KCl. The results are shown in Fig. S2. The response of motor CW bias to 15 mM K2SO4 exhibited an attractant response, characterized by a decreased CW bias upon the addition of K2SO4, followed by an over-adaptation that is qualitatively similar to the response to 30 mM KCl. However, there were notable differences in the adaptation time and the presence of an overshoot. Specifically, the adaptation time to K2SO4 was shorter compared to that for KCl, and there was a notable overshoot in the CW bias during the adaptation phase. These differences may have resulted from the weaker response to K2SO4 (Fig. S1B) and additional modifications due to CysZ-mediated cellular uptake of sulfate (Zhang et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1838,1809–1816 (2014)). The faster adaptation and overshoot complicated the chemotactic drift in the microfluidic assay as in Fig. 1, such that we were unable to observe a noticeable drift in a K2SO4 gradient under the same experimental conditions used for the KCl gradient.</p>
<p>The response of motor rotational signal to 15 mM K2SO4 has been added to Fig. S2.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The response curve and adaptation level/time in the main text (Fig. 4) should be replaced by the corrected counterparts (currently in Fig. S5). The current version is especially confusing because Fig. 6 shows the corrected response, but the difference from Fig. 4 is not mentioned.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now merged the results of the original Fig. S5 into Fig. 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>a. The discussion of the uncorrected response with small hill coefficient and potentially negative cooperativity was left in the text (lines 223-234), but the new measurements show this is not true for the actual response. This should be removed or significantly rephrased.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now removed the statement about potentially negative cooperativity and added the corrected results for the actual response.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It may be helpful to restate the definition of f_m in the methods (near Eq. 3-4).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now restated the definition of fm and fL below Eq. 3-4: “In the denominator on the right-hand side of Eq. 3, the two terms within the parentheses of exponential expression represent the methylation-dependent (fm) and ligand-dependent (fL) free energy, respectively.”</p>
