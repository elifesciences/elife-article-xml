<title>Abstract</title><p>The cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin (CDH2) is a membrane component of adherens junctions which regulates tissue morphogenesis and architecture. In the follicles of mammalian ovaries, N-cadherin adherens junctions are present between granulosa cells, cumulus cells and at the interface of cumulus cell transzonal projections and the oocyte. We demonstrate a mechanosensory role of N-cadherin integrating tissue structure and hormonal regulation of follicular morphogenic events including expansion of the cumulus oocyte complex (COC) matrix, oocyte maturation and ovulation. Two small molecule N-cadherin antagonists inhibited COC maturation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Transcriptome profiling revealed that targets of β-catenin and YAP1 pathways were dysregulated by N-cadherin antagonists. <italic>In vivo</italic>, N-cadherin antagonist significantly reduced ovulation in mice compared to controls (11 vs 26 oocytes/ovary; p=5.8×10<sup>-6</sup>). Ovarian follicles exhibited structural dysgenesis with granulosa and cumulus cell layers becoming disorganised and the connection between cumulus cells and the oocyte disrupted and the transcriptome again indicated altered mechanical sensing causing dysregulation of the Hippo/YAP and β-catenin pathways and ECM reorganization. Granulosa specific N-cadherin depletion in Cdh2<sup>Fl/FL</sup>;Amhr2-Cre also showed significantly altered mechanosensitive gene expression and reduced ovulation. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for N-cadherin in ovarian follicular development and ovulation, and the potential to inhibit ovulation through targeting this signalling mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Classical (type I) cadherins are calcium dependent cell adhesion molecules that form intercellular adherens junctions thereby regulating cell-cell recognition and the assembly of tissues. These cadherins control a myriad of biological processes including cell migration, proliferation, death and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. They consists of extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains. The intracellular domain interacts with a complex composed of β-catenin, α-catenin, p120 and α-actinin that links the Type I cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The formation of adherens junctions requires interaction of cadherins within the same membrane to form lateral or <italic>cis</italic>-dimers. These <italic>cis</italic>-dimers then promote intercellular adhesive dimerization or <italic>trans</italic>-dimers of cadherins on adjacent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] to form adherens junctions. Intracellular signalling pathways are activated by mechanical force generated through cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Two types of cell surface receptors, cadherins and integrins directly mediate cell adhesion and activate intracellular pathways such as β-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Cross-talk between the classical cadherin, N-cadherin (CDH2) and the Hippo signalling pathway is another mechanosensitive signalling axis that regulates cell proliferation and determines organ size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The Hippo-YAP1 signalling is regulated by numerous upstream signals including organ size, extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and cell polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Ovarian follicles are complex multilayered structures required for the development and maturation of oocytes. Follicles also serve as an endocrine organ coordinating the female reproductive cycle, augmenting oocyte maturation and ovulation (the release of the oocyte) at the appropriate time for fertilization. In growing follicles, the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte provide essential metabolites and maintain oocyte meiotic arrest through transfer of cAMP and cGMP from cumulus cells to oocyte. This communication requires thin cytoplasmic projections known as transzonal projections (TZPs) that extend from the cumulus cells, through the thick ECM of the zona pellucida to contact the oocyte plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Gap junctions at the cumulus-oocyte cellular contacts transport small molecules such as glucose metabolites, ATP and cAMP between the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Adherens junctions have been proposed to stabilise these cumulus cell-oocyte contacts as a necessary precursor to gap junction formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], and the contacts are selectively uncoupled just prior to ovulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Contacts between cumulus and granulosa cell layers are critical for the progressive development of ovarian follicles and maturation of oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. N-cadherin is present on the intercellular junctions between granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and β-catenin has been observed on granulosa and cumulus cell membranes, while another Type I cadherin, E-cadherin (CDH1) is expressed on oocyte membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. β-catenin is also a transcription factor which plays an important role during follicle development and granulosa cell specification in the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Constitutive activation of β-catenin in Sertoli cells of the mouse testis drives their trans-differentiation toward ovarian granulosa cell lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], while in ovaries constitutive β-catenin induces elevated expression of the estrogen synthesising gene <italic>Cyp19a1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. YAP1 also plays a critical role in mediating regulation of follicle development through mechanical cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. In granulosa cells YAP1 is required for proliferation and promotes differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, the respective roles of N-and E-cadherin regulation of β-catenin and YAP1 pathways during ovarian folliculogenesis or oocyte maturation and ovulation has not been investigated.</p>
<p>Ovulation is initiated by a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary, inducing dramatic remodelling of the ovarian follicle ECM, and differentiation of cells. The intercellular junctions between cumulus cells and the oocyte are disrupted as the COC undergoes dynamic expansion of a unique viscoelastic ECM through gene induction in granulosa and cumulus cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. This COC matrix expansion is essential for ovulation and fertilization-potential of oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The expanded COC acquires an adherent and migratory cell phenotype and can be shown to robustly adhere to ECM components such as fibronectin and collagens that are abundant in the follicle wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The localisation of N-cadherin on granulosa cells was recently shown to be involved in primordial follicle formation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]), and N-cadherin antagonists have also been shown to cause apoptosis of cultured granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. We now report previously undiscovered roles for N-cadherin in granulosa cell responses to hormones, as well as COC expansion, oocyte meiotic maturation, and ovulation. Two recently developed, small molecule N-cadherin antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] were shown to disrupt the interaction between TZPs and oocytes, and to dysregulate β-catenin and YAP1 signalling pathways in mouse COCs, blocking oocyte meiotic maturation. Furthermore, treatment of mice <italic>in vivo</italic> with an N-cadherin antagonist blocked ovulation with pervasive effects on β-catenin and YAP1 pathways leading to altered response to ovulation stimulus. Our findings demonstrate a role for N-cadherin mechanosensing to maintain ovarian tissue architecture, and hence the hormone responsiveness essential for oocyte maturation and ovulation.</p>

<title>N-cadherin antagonists block acquired periovulatory COC adhesion</title>
<p>Through screening a small molecule library, we identified two compounds that block the adhesion of periovulatory COCs to fibronectin using the xCELLigence<sup>TM</sup> system. Two potent COC adhesion blocking compounds were; (S)-1-(3,4-Dichlorophenoxy)-3-(4-((S)-2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenoxy) propylamino) piperidin-1-yl)propan-2-ol (CRS-066) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] and 5[3,4 dichlorobenzyl)sulfanyl]4H 1,2,4 triazol 3 amine (LCRF-0006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], both of which are small molecule N-cadherin antagonists. Dose-dependent inhibition of COC adhesion to fibronectin, compared to vehicle controls, was confirmed at doses above 1μM for CRS-066 (IC50=0.4μM) and above 36μM for LCRF-0006 (IC50=38 μM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Analogues of both compounds were synthesised with substitutions of two key active chloride side chains on the aromatic ring structure, which abolished the COC adhesion blocking activity at the same concentrations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We confirmed the N-cadherin blocking action of the active compounds by showing they reduced N-cadherin abundance at intercellular contacts in N-cadherin expressing SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Again, significant effects of CRS-066 and LCRF-0006 were observed with 1 μM and 36 μM respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b-e</xref>). Additionally, N-cadherin dependent spheroid formation in 67NR mouse breast cancer cells expressing exogenous N-cadherin was blocked by the N-cadherin antagonists (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f, g</xref>), while there was no effect on N-cadherin negative cells (Supplementary Fig. S1a, b).</p>

<p>Together, these data reveal that N-cadherin plays a hitherto unappreciated role in periovulatory COCs and that these new N-cadherin antagonists can disrupt adhesion of periovulatory COCs to substratum (i.e. fibronectin) as well as blocking cell-cell adhesion in other non-ovarian, N-cadherin expressing cells.</p>

<p>N-cadherin and β-catenin proteins were abundant on granulosa and cumulus cell surfaces at intercellular junctions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> indicated by arrows) from primordial follicle stage and throughout folliculogenesis and ovulation. In contrast, both theca interna and externa had no detectable N-cadherin. N-cadherin and β-catenin were also abundant along cumulus cell TZPs extending across the zona pellucida and contacting the oocyte membrane (arrowheads <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Interestingly, N-cadherin and E-cadherin were shown to co-localise at the oocyte plasma membrane by co-staining in wholemount COCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
<p>The assembly of functional adherens complexes at granulosa cell interfaces was confirmed using proximity ligation assay (PLA) which showed that N-cadherin and β- catenin are present in the same protein complexes at points of intercellular contact in cultured granulosa cells (Supplementary Fig. S2a). Likewise, in whole-mount COCs the cumulus cells showed numerous foci of interacting N-cadherin and β-catenin at cell-cell contacts between cumulus cells (Supplementary Fig. S2b). Notably, we also found PLA signals for N-cadherin and β-catenin interaction at the oocyte plasma membrane indicating adherens complex formation containing N-cadherin and β- catenin at the cumulus cell-oocyte interfaces (Supplementary Fig. S2c). Since the oocyte contains only E-cadherin, this suggests that heterotypical adherens complexes of N-cadherin and E-cadherin form at the cumulus cell-oocyte interface. Furthermore, we found that cumulus cell N-cadherin is required to stabilise oocyte membrane E-cadherin and β-catenin by incubating COCs with 1μM CRS-066 or DMSO control for 4h. Wholemount immunostaining showed β-catenin and E-cadherin localization at the oocyte membrane in controls, while treatment with CRS-066 caused decreased β- catenin on cumulus cell surface, as well as on the oocyte membrane and a concomitant loss of E-cadherin on oocyte membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether the loss of oocyte membrane β-catenin and E-cadherin upon N-cadherin inhibitor treatment disrupts the bi-directional communication between cumulus cells and the oocyte we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation (IVM) in the presence of the N-cadherin antagonists or vehicle controls and assessed COC expansion and oocyte meiotic maturation.</p>
<p>Increasing concentrations of LCRF-0006 (36 – 360 μM) dose dependently reduced cumulus expansion index at the end of 12 h IVM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). This inhibition of COC expansion after treatment with LCRF-0006 was not due to impaired response to the FSH and EGF stimulus or activation of critical genes. Expression of hyaluronan synthase (<italic>Has2</italic>) which produces the key cumulus matrix component hyaluronan, was in fact dose-dependently increased by LCRF-0006 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Expression of known mediators of COC expansion amphiregulin (<italic>Areg</italic>) and the prostaglandin synthase enzyme (<italic>Ptgs2</italic>), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] were either increased or unaffected by LCRF-0006 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). mRNA for connective tissue growth factor (<italic>Ctgf</italic>), a canonical YAP1 target, was significantly reduced by the two highest doses of LCRF-0006.</p>

<p>The other N-cadherin antagonist, CRS-066, had a similar effect, leading to a dose-dependent reduction in cumulus expansion during IVM, from 0.1 – 1.0 μM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d, e</xref>). Again, the response to IVM stimulus and induction of critical COC expansion genes was not prevented. The expression of <italic>Areg, Ptgs2,</italic> and <italic>Ctgf</italic> were significantly increased by CRS-066 while <italic>Has2</italic> remained unaltered (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>
<p>RNA-Seq was performed to determine the effect of the N-cadherin antagonists CRS-066 n on global gene expression during maturation of COCs. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed separate clusters of gene expression in CRS-066 treated and vehicle controls, indicating a consistent effect on cell signalling by the antagonist (Supplementary Fig. S3a). Differential expression analysis confirmed 168 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (adjusted p-value &lt;1×10<sup>-6</sup>, log2 fold change ≥ ±0.5), with 37 genes downregulated and 131 upregulated in CRS-066 treated COCs (Supplementary Fig. S3b). Gene ontology analyses of the DEGs down-regulated by CRS-066 treatment showed that regulation of cell migration and ECM reorganisation were the most over-represented biological pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Protein-lysine 6-oxidase activity, an enzyme responsible for cross-linking of collagens, was the most over-represented molecular function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified the β-catenin and Hippo signalling pathways canonical downstream signalling pathways of N-cadherin were significantly enriched in CRS-066 treated COC DEGs (Fig.3i, j). In agreement with the qPCR analysis, the RNA-seq results showed treatment with CRS-066 increased the expression of Hippo-pathway responsive genes including <italic>Areg</italic> and <italic>Ctgf</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3k</xref>). In contrast, the expression of critical granulosa cell-specific and β-catenin responsive genes <italic>Foxl2</italic> and <italic>Cyp19a1</italic>, were significantly downregulated in COCs with CRS-066 treatment.</p>
<p>To confirm the notion that YAP1 is required for COC maturation we assessed the effect of YAP1 inhibition on cumulus expansion during IVM. Treatment with YAP inhibitor, Verteporfin (3 μM), significantly reduced COC expansion with concomitant decrease in the canonical YAP1 target <italic>Ctgf</italic> as well as <italic>Areg</italic>, and <italic>Ptgs2,</italic> while <italic>Has2</italic> expression remained unaffected. These gene expression changes are all consistent with increased YAP1 activity in CRS-066 treated COCs (Supplementary Fig. S3c).</p>
<p>Our findings that N-cadherin is present in intercellular junctions between cumulus cells and oocytes, and that N-cadherin antagonists alter cumulus cell response during IVM, led us to investigate the impact of the antagonists on oocyte meiotic maturation. Both CRS-066 and LCRF-0006 treatment during IVM dose dependently reduced the proportion of oocytes undergoing germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and the proportion reaching MII stage, as determined by the presence of an extruded polar body after 12 h IVM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The stage of meiotic arrest was determined by visualizing meiotic spindles and cortical actin in oocytes by labelling β-tubulin, actin staining (phalloidin), and chromosomes (Hoechst). In untreated and vehicle treated controls &gt;90% of oocytes reached MII stage, as demonstrated by successful assembly of the metaphase II spindle and extrusion of the sister chromatid into polar bodies. Increasing doses of CRS-066 caused more oocyte arrest at GV-intact or MI stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a-c</xref>). Specifically, 0.3 μM CRS-066 significantly reduced polar body extrusion (PBE) to 57%, with over 30% oocytes arrested in MI, while 1.0 μM CRS-066 resulted in more than 50% oocytes arresting at GV and the remainder after GVBD. Oocytes exhibiting MI spindle formation were rarely observed. LCRF-0006 treatment also caused oocyte arrest in early meiosis, with 20% arrested in GV stage at the lowest 36 μM dose and almost all oocytes arresting with intact GVs at the highest (360 μM) dose (Fig.4d-f).</p>

<title>N-cadherin antagonist CRS-066 inhibits ovulation in mice</title>
<p>Given the robust effect of CRS-066 and LCRF-0006 on COC adhesion, expansion and meiotic maturation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we hypothesised that these N-cadherin antagonists may interfere with ovulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. To assess this, stimulated ovulation was performed in prepubertal (3-week old) female mice in conjunction with administration of 2x daily i.p. injections of CRS-066 (50 mg/kg), or LCRF-0006 (100 mg/kg) or vehicle for 4 days (Supplementary Fig. S4a).</p>
<p>CRS-066 treatment significantly compromised the number of oocytes retrieved from oviducts after 16 hCG treatment (11.6 ± 7) compared to vehicle treated control mice (26.2 ± 6 ovulations / ovary, p&lt;1×10<sup>-5</sup>, n=6 mice per group) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Histological analysis showed the presence of multiple ovulated luteinized structures in vehicle-treated mice, while CRS-066 treated mice had unruptured antral follicles with entrapped oocytes, confirming that ovulation was specifically disrupted by CRS-066 treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Next, RNA-Seq and differential gene expression analysis in CRS-066 and vehicle-treated whole ovary RNA was performed. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of RNA-sequencing data identified distinct gene expression profiles in CRS-066 treated compared to control ovaries (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). A total of 330 significant DEGs were identified with (adjusted p-value &lt;1×10<sup>-6</sup>, log2 fold change ≥ ±0.5), with 136 genes upregulated and 194 genes down-regulated (Supplementary Fig. S4b). Gene ontology analyses of genes downregulated by CRS-066 treatment showed that ECM organisation and cell-cell adhesion, migration and motility were the most affected pathways (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Integrin binding and cadherin binding were the most affected molecular functions with CRS-066 treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed a profile enriched for both β-catenin target gene set and Hippo signalling pathways (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f, g</xref>). Of note, CRS-066 repressed the expression of a group of ovarian genes known to be in the β-catenin/Wnt signalling pathway, including <italic>Cyp19a1</italic> (gene encoding aromatase which is involved in estrogen synthesis) that was repressed &gt;2 fold, while <italic>Foxl2</italic>, a forkhead transcription factor specifically expressed in granulosa cells, and Amh, a granulosa specific hormone were upregulated &gt;1.5 fold. Other β-catenin/Wnt signalling pathway genes, including Wnt inhibitory factor (<italic>Wif1</italic>), and Glycogen synthase kinase (<italic>GSK3β</italic>) which phosphorylates β-catenin were also down-regulated after CRS-066 treatment (not shown). CRS-066 treatment also repressed Hippo pathway genes <italic>Areg</italic> and <italic>Ctgf</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with transcriptomic analysis, qPCR showed that genes involved in granulosa cell hormone responsiveness including the gonadotropin receptor genes (<italic>Fshr</italic>, <italic>Lhcgr</italic>) were unaffected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref>), while an elevation in <italic>Amh</italic> and <italic>Foxl2</italic> ((<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5k</xref>) expression in whole ovary RNA likely indicates elevated granulosa cells numbers in CRS-066 treated ovaries that fail to ovulate.

<p>The numbers of follicles at each developmental stage were equivalent in CRS-066 and vehicle treated mice. Ovaries from mice treated in the same manner and collected either before hCG treatment (eCG 44 h) or 11 h after hCG (1 h before ovulation) showed equivalent numbers of follicles at each stage of development from primary to antral. Typical periovulatory follicle morphology and number confirmed that the response to hCG was normal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5l</xref>). Immunostaining of N-cadherin showed a disruption to the normal organisation of N-cadherin at intercellular boundaries in the granulosa layers, loss of N-cadherin in the TZPs and dissociation of cumulus cells from the cumulus – oocyte interface in follicles of mice treated <italic>in vivo</italic> with CRS-066 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5m</xref>). Proliferation and apoptosis in granulosa cells, assessed by Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) immunostaining were not significantly different between ovaries of vehicle and CRS-066-treated mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5n</xref>). The effects of CRS-066 treatment on expression of specific genes in ovaries collected 44h after eCG confirmed a normal response to hormone treatments with expression of Cyp19a1 high in preovulatory (eCG 44 h treated) ovaries, and repressed by hCG stimulation of ovulation, while Ptgs2 expression was low at preovulatory stage, but induced by hCG 11 h. Treatment with CRS-066 at both pre-and periovulatory stages of folliculogenesis caused a significant reduction in Cyp19a1 and Ptgs2, but an increase in Amh expression compared to vehicle controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5o</xref>), consistent with the observations in hCG 16 h post-ovulatory ovaries.</p>
<p>Treatment of mice with 100 mg/kg LCRF-0006 for 4 days prior to ovulation resulted in similar numbers of ovulated oocytes retrieved from oviducts (23.9 ± 11.2) compared to vehicle controls (25.6 ± 5.3 ovulations per ovary.

<title>Granulosa specific N-cadherin knockout inhibits ovulation in mice</title>
<p>To verify that N-cadherin is the specific target of the antagonists that modulate mechanosensitive gene expression and ovulation, we generated granulosa-specific Cdh2 knockout.

Likewise, immunofluorescence of ovarian sections showed dramatically reduced N-cadherin protein in ∼80-90% of granulosa cells in all follicles. A mosaic pattern was observed with 10-20% of granulosa cells in antral follicles showing approximately normal levels of N-cadherin immunostaining (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b-e</xref>), consistent with other reports of incomplete penetrance of the Amhr2-cre transgene expression in granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. The N-cadherin depleted areas of follicles showed multiple regions of detached cells suggesting a loss of intercellular adhesion. The expression of putative N-cadherin mechanoresponsive genes Areg and Ptgs2 were significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced 2-3-fold respectively in the granulosa-specific Cdh2 mutants, and Cyp19a1 showed trending (P=0.08, 2.5-fold) reduced expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>), similar to the reduced Cyp19a1 expression reported in <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Fl/FL</sup>;Amhr2<sup>Cre</sup></italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study shows, for the first time, that N-cadherin plays a central role during late follicular morphogenesis. Specifically, N-cadherin antagonists, or Cdh2 gene mutation disrupt intercellular contacts between granulosa cells, as well as oocyte-cumulus cell contacts leading to impaired COC expansion, oocyte maturation and ovulation. Likewise, even incomplete disruption of the Cdh2 gene expression led to a similar disruption to mechanoresponsive gene expression and ovulation. Broad transcriptional changes indicate cross-talk between N-cadherin with β-catenin and Hippo/YAP pathways mediating a mechanical signal that integrates with the hormone actions to regulate genes required for oocyte maturation and ovulation.</p>
<p>There is evidence that the ovarian follicle is a mechanosensitive organ. Either excess or inadequate tissue rigidity profoundly affects folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation. This is evident in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), a prevalent infertile condition where excess rigid ECM prevents follicle and oocyte growth progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. It is also shown <italic>in vitro</italic>, where isolated follicles in different bioengineered support matrices exhibit reduced follicle growth and viability in soft or rigid environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Our findings suggest that N-cadherin is a key mechanosensor and transducer of growth and differentiation of granulosa cells, cumulus cells and oocytes. Consistent with this, dysregulation of β-catenin and Hippo/Yap1 has been shown in conditions of disrupted follicle growth including PCOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], as well as Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Further studies are required to determine the interplay between cadherins and integrins in the cells of ovarian follicles, as both cell surface receptor groups interact with the actin-based microfilaments and regulate similar biological processes.</p>
<p>Direct physical contacts between cumulus cells and the oocyte are important for transport of cAMP and cGMP via gap junctions to maintain oocyte meiotic arrest. Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> N-cadherin antagonists caused disruption of transzonal projections and cumulus-oocyte cellular contacts in COCs. Disruption of these contacts was recently shown to be a normal event in response to induced COC maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. The effects of N-cadherin antagonists provide the first evidence confirming that N-cadherin stabilises these unique cell-cell contacts and that premature disruption of the cumulus cell-oocyte contacts is highly detrimental to follicle growth and oocyte maturation. Our observation that two N-cadherin antagonists severely impaired COC expansion and meiotic maturation in IVM while not depleting expression of cumulus matrix genes such as <italic>Has2</italic> suggests that N-cadherin mediates signalling between oocyte and cumulus cells, transducing essential signals necessary for these pre-ovulatory events. This is in line with N-cadherin being a known mechanotransducer and being abundant at cell junctions between cumulus cells and in transzonal projections at cumulus-oocyte contacts. The disruption of cumulus cell arrangement around oocytes in ovaries of N-cadherin antagonist treated mice also demonstrates the necessity for N-cadherin to stabilise cell-cell contact and maintain the tissue architecture critical for bidirectional cell communication. The possibility of heterotypic interaction of N-and E-cadherin at the cumulus cell-oocyte interface suggests a unique type of intercellular junction in the context of oocytes and cumulus cells with interactomes that are also likely to be specialised. The molecular composition of these adherens complexes, and the mechanism behind cadherin driven intracellular signalling in the COC clearly warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>β-catenin transduces Wnt signalling, and in ovarian cells it is fundamental to specification of the female somatic cell lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] establishing female sex determination and follicle formation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]). Our studies are the first to demonstrate that N-cadherin is important for functional gene regulation in the follicle by regulating the β-catenin and Hippo/Yap1 pathways. Reduced expression of β- catenin regulated granulosa cell specific genes, including <italic>Ptgs2</italic> and <italic>Cyp19a1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], and changes in the transcriptome profile indicate the loss of β-catenin activity caused by the N-cadherin antagonist. This is consistent with N-cadherin’s reported role stabilising β-catenin at tensile cell junctions and facilitating nuclear translocation in response to Wnt signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Thus, our results demonstrate that tissue structure and mechanical force contribute to hormone responsiveness and the steroidogenic phenotype of granulosa cells. We did not see evidence of upregulated testis specific genes indicating that neither N-cadherin antagonist treatment, nor gene depletion was not sufficient to reverse granulosa cell specification as seen with complete β-catenin ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. However, our results do indicate that N-cadherin stabilises granulosa and cumulus cell phenotypes through β-catenin signalling.</p>
<p>N-cadherin antagonists also reduced expression of Yap1 target genes with key functions in folliculogenesis (<italic>Ctgf</italic>, <italic>Areg</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], indicating a loss of Yap1 function <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings suggest that an ovarian Yap1 mechanosensing pathway, also mediated through N-cadherin, is attenuated in the antagonist treated mice. Trans-cellular interaction of cadherins has been shown to sequester Yap1 in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], and peptide inhibitors of N-cadherin can block nuclear translocation of Yap1 in response to tissue rigidity in mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Thus, our results show Yap1 signalling in granulosa cells is controlled by N-cadherin and regulates the differentiation status of these cells and their response to hormone stimuli. This conclusion is also supported by the morphological change in follicles of Wnt4 deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], and in granulosa-specific Yap1 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Together, these findings suggest that mechanotransduction signals through N-cadherin mediate the reported high Yap1 activity in granulosa cells needed to sustain normal folliculogenesis.</p>
<p>During <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation of COCs, N-cadherin antagonists blocked COC expansion, and oocyte meiosis. CRS-066 paradoxically increased <italic>Areg</italic> and <italic>Ptgs2</italic>, which are β- catenin repressed genes in COCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Their induction is consistent with compromised β-catenin function after N-cadherin inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> as was seen <italic>in vivo</italic>. The induction of <italic>Areg</italic>, <italic>Ptgs2</italic> and the canonical Yap1 target, <italic>Ctgf</italic> all suggest activation of Yap1 by N-cadherin antagonist in IVM. Supporting this, the Yap1 antagonist verteporfin caused dose-dependent repression of <italic>Ctgf</italic>, <italic>Areg</italic> and <italic>Ptgs2</italic> indicating Yap1 indeed mediates induction of these critical COC maturation genes. This is consistent with reports that show that close contact with oocytes suppresses Yap1 activation in cumulus cells, and that cumulus expansion elicits a mechanical signal that releases this inhibition leading to expression COC maturation genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Thus, N-cadherin antagonist-mediated inhibition of mechanotransduction disrupted the normal regulation of Yap1. Ctgf mediates size regulation of many organs and is a known ovarian mitogen that directly regulates follicle development and ovulation by upregulating activin-dependent LOX mediated extracellular remodelling, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. N-cadherin antagonism during IVM and <italic>in vivo</italic> consistently showed that Lysyl oxidase, activin binding and ECM remodelling were amongst the most affected molecular functions, further supporting our proposed model of N-cadherin acting through Hippo/Yap1/Ctgf to regulate COC expansion, meiotic maturation and ovulation. The inverse effect of LCRF-0006 on <italic>Ctgf</italic> expression in IVM suggests the two antagonists differ not only in their potency but have different effects on N-cadherin signalling responses. Further investigation is required to determine whether this observation is explained by the targeting of different binding pockets of N-cadherin by LCRF-0006 and CRS-066. Since Yap1 and β-catenin have divergent effects on <italic>Ptgs2</italic> and <italic>Areg and</italic> are both influenced by N-cadherin antagonists, the activation/inactivation state of these individual pathways is difficult to unravel, however it is clear the net effect mediated through N-cadherin cell contacts plays a key role in mediating follicle growth and differentiation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study identified N-cadherin as a mechanosensory regulator important in ovarian granulosa cell differentiation and response to hormone stimuli both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The action of N-cadherin through β-catenin and Yap1 signal transducers places new emphasis on the role of these pathways as mediators of hormone responses that also incorporates mechanical cues such as the size and physical tension within the ovary, which is influenced by the neighbouring growing follicles as well as ECM composition. Dysregulation of this mechanism has important implications for conditions such as premature ovarian failure, PCOS and fibrosis as well as other forms of unexplained infertility. Additionally, the potential to target this signalling pathway with small molecule inhibitors, to block ovulation is an illustration the principle of non-hormonal ovulation blocking contraceptives.</p>

<p>Total RNA was extracted from COCs and whole ovaries by homogenising in trizol as described above. mRNA was converted to strand specific Illumina compatible sequencing libraries using the Nugen Universal Plus mRNA mRNA-Seq library kit (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Nextseq550 High output mode and v2.5 chemistry platform for 75bp single-end reads. Sequencing quality control was performed using FastQC. Sequences were mapped to the GENCODE mouse transcriptome (GRCm38.p6, M25) and mapped transcripts were quantified using Salmon. Clustering analysis was performed on count data using variance stabilizing transformation as part of the DESeq2 package. Read count was transformed to log counts per million (CPM) for visualisation via heatmap using edgeR package (R/Bioconductor). Differential expression was analysed using DESeq2. Genes that had a highly stringent FDR &lt;= 10<sup>-6</sup> and log fold change &gt;=+/- 0.5 were determined to be differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Biological significance of DEGs was explored by GO term enrichment analysis including biological process (BP) and moleuclar function (MF), based on Enrichr web application. Gene Set enrichment analysis of the genes differentially expressed upon CRS-066 treatment was done using a pre-ranked list on the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp">software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp</ext-link>).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript reports experiments designed to dissect the function of N-cadherin during mammalian folliculogenesis, using the mouse as a model system. Prior studies have shown that this is the principal cadherin expressed by the follicular granulosa cells. Two main strategies are used - small-molecule inhibitors that target N-cadherin and a conditional knockout where the gene encoding N-cad is deleted in granulosa cells. The authors also take advantage of the ability to reproduce key events of folliculogenesis, such as oocyte meiotic maturation, in vitro. Four main conclusions are drawn from the studies: (i) cadherin-based cell contact is required to maintain cadherin (N-cad in the granulosa cells; E-cad in the oocyte) at the plasma membrane; (ii) N-cad is required for cumulus layer expansion; (iii) N-cad is required for meiotic maturation of the oocyte; (iv) N-cad is required for ovulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are logically conceived, clearly described and presented, and carefully interpreted. A key strength of the paper is that multiple approaches have been used (drugs, knockouts, immunofluorescence, PLA, in vitro and in vivo studies). Taken together, they clearly establish essential roles for N-cadherin during folliculogenesis.</p>
<p>It is intriguing that, when cadherin activity is impaired, the cadherins are lost from the plasma membrane. This suggests that, in a multicellular context, interactions with other cadherins, either in cis within the same cell or in trans with a neighboring cell, are required to maintain cadherins at the membrane. Hence, beyond their significance for understanding female reproductive biology, these experiments have broader implications for cell biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A few points could be considered or clarified by the authors:</p>
<p>The YAP experiments were confusing to the reviewer. CRS-066 increased YAP activity, as indicated by increased expression of target genes. Since CRS-066 prevents expansion, this result suggests that YAP antagonizes expansion. Therefore, blocking YAP should favor expansion. Yet, the YAP inhibitor impaired expansion. In the reviewer's eyes, these results seem to be contradictory.</p>
<p>It is intriguing that the inhibitors were able to efficiently block oocyte maturation. Oocytes from which the cumulus granulosa cells have been removed (denuded) will mature in vitro in the absence of LH or EGF. Since the effect of the inhibitors is to break the contact between the cumulus cells and oocyte, one might have predicted that this would not impair the ability of the oocytes to mature. Perhaps the authors could comment on this.</p>
<p>Regarding the experiments where the inhibitors were administered intra-peritoneally, the authors might comment on the rationale for choosing the doses that were used. An additional point to consider is that, since N-cadherin is expressed in a variety of tissues, an effect of interfering with N-cadherin at these non-ovarian sites could indirectly influence ovarian function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript entitled &quot;N-cadherin mechanosensing in ovarian follicles controls oocyte maturation and ovulation&quot; aimed to investigate the role of N-cadherin in different ovarian physiological processes, including cumulus oocyte expansion, oocyte maturation, and ovulation. The authors performed several in vitro and in vivo mice experiments, using diverse techniques to reinforce their results.</p>
<p>First, they identified two compounds (N-cadherin antagonists) that block the adhesion of periovulatory COCs to fibronectin through screening a small molecule library, using the xCELLigenceTM system, performing proper and complementary controls. Second, the authors showed the presence of N-cadherin adherens junctions between granulosa cells and cumulus cells and at the interface of cumulus cell transzonal projections and the oocyte throughout folliculogenesis. And that these adherens complexes between cumulus cells and oocytes were disrupted when inhibited N-cadherin, as observed by nice representative confocal images. Then, the authors assessed COC expansion and oocyte meiotic maturation to determine whether the loss of oocyte membrane β-catenin and E-cadherin upon N-cadherin inhibitor treatment disrupts the bi-directional communication between cumulus cells and the oocyte. Indeed, N-cadherin antagonists disrupted both processes (cumulus expansion and oocyte meiotic). However, the expression of known mediators of COC expansion (E.g., Areg and Ptgs2) were either increased or unaffected. Nevertheless, RNA-Seq showed consistent effects on cell signaling mRNA genes by the antagonist CRS-066.</p>
<p>In vivo studies using mice were also achieved using stimulated protocols (together with one of the antagonists or vehicle) or granulosa-specific Cdh2 Knockouts to further analyze the role of N-cadherin. N-cadherin antagonist CRS-066 (but not LCRF-0006) significantly reduced mouse ovulation compared to controls. RNA-sequencing data analysis identified distinct gene expression profiles in CRS-066 treated compared to control ovaries. Ovulation in CdhFl/FL; Amhr2Cre mice after stimulation were also significantly reduced; multiple large unruptured follicles were observed in these granulosa-specific Cdh2 mutant ovaries, and the mRNA expression of Areg and Ptgs2 were reduced.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that their study identified N-cadherin as a mechanosensory regulator important in ovarian granulosa cell differentiation able to respond to hormone stimuli both in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating a critical role for N-cadherin in ovarian follicular development and ovulation. They highlighted the potential to inhibit ovulation by targeting this signaling mechanism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This remarkable manuscript is very well designed, performed, and discussed. The authors analyzed different aspects, and their data supports their conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
This study was performed using the mouse as a research model; further studies in larger animals and humans would be interesting and warranted.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>Some results are intriguing. While the AREG y PTGS2 mRNA increased within the COC in vitro by the N-cadherin antagonists, in vivo, the treatment induced a significant increase in both genes when analyzing the whole ovary. What are the authors' ideas that could explain these discrepancies in outcomes?</p>
<p>The authors stated that the ovaries from mice treated in the same manner and collected either before hCG treatment (eCG 44 h) or 11 h after hCG showed equivalent numbers of follicles at each stage of development from primary to antral. However, in Panel l from Figure 5, there is a significant increase in the number of antral follicles in the CRS-066 group (hCG 11 h) compared to the vehicle. Could the author discuss it in the manuscript?</p>
