<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Goal-directed movements can fail due to errors in our perceptual and motor systems. While these errors may arise from random noise within these sources, they also reflect systematic motor biases that vary with the location of the target. The origin of these systematic biases remains controversial. Drawing on data from an extensive array of reaching tasks conducted over the past 30 years, we evaluated the merits of various computational models regarding the origin of motor biases. Contrary to previous theories, we show that motor biases do not arise from systematic errors associated with the sensed hand position during motor planning or from the biomechanical constraints imposed during motor execution. Rather, motor biases are primarily caused by a misalignment between eye-centric and the body-centric representations of position. This model can account for motor biases across a wide range of contexts, encompassing movements with the right versus left hand, proximal and distal effectors, visible and occluded starting positions, as well as before and after sensorimotor adaptation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Accurate movements are crucial for everyday activities, affecting whether a glass is filled or spilled, or whether a dart hits or misses the target. Some of movement errors arise from sensorimotor noise, including visual noise regarding the location of targets and effectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, planning noise introduced when issuing a motor command, and neuromuscular noise when executing a movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition, some of these errors arise from systematic biases that vary across the work space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The origin of these biases remains controversial (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>): Whereas some studies postulate that motor biases stem from systematic distortions in perception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, others posit that biases originate from inaccurate motor planning and/or biomechanical constraints associated with motor execution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In the following section, we provide an overview of current models of systematic motor biases as well as outline a novel hypothesis, setting the stage for a re-analysis of published data and presentation of new experimental results.</p>

<p><bold>(a)</bold> Motor biases may originate from biases in perceiving the initial hand position (proprioceptive bias), perceiving the location of the visual target (visual bias), transforming positional information from visual to proprioceptive space (transformation bias), and/or biomechanical constraints during motor execution. Previous models attribute motor biases to errors originating from the distinct contributions of visual (b) and proprioceptive biases (c).

<p>Starting at the input side, motor biases may arise from systematic distortions in the representation of the perceived target position (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). A prominent finding in the visual cognition literature is that the remembered location of a visual stimulus is biased towards diagonal axes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. That is, the reported visual location of a stimulus is shifted towards the centroid of each quadrant. This perceptual bias does not depend on the method of response, as this phenomenon can be observed when participants point to a cued location or press a key to indicate the remembered location of a briefly presented visual target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. While this literature has emphasized that this form of perceptual bias arises from processing within visual working memory, it is an open question whether it contributes to goal-directed reaching when the visual target remains visible.</p>
<p>Another perceptual cause of motor biases stems from proprioception (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). Systematic distortions in the perceived position of the hand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and/or joint position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> can infleunce motor planning. For example, if the perceived starting position of the hand is leftwards of its true location, a reaching movement to a forward visual target would exhibit a rightward bias and a reaching movement to a rightward visual target would fall short<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. A proprioceptive perceptual bias at the starting position has been reported to be the major source of bias in many previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whereas the preceding models have considered how distortions of visual or proprioceptive space might, on their own, lead to reaching biases, motor biases could also originate from a misalignment in the mapping between perceptual and motor reference frames. Based on classic theories of motor planning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, the start position and the target position are initially encoded in an eye-centric visual coordinate frame, and then transformed to representations in a body-centric proprioceptive coordinate frame within which the movement is planned (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>). Motor biases could arise from systematic distortions that occur during this visuo-proprioceptive transformation process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Indeed, when participants are required to match the position of their unseen hand with a visual target, systematic transformation biases are observed across the workspace (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>; also see Methods)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In the current study, we develop a novel computational model to capture how these transformation biases should result in systematic biases during reaching.</p>
<p>On the output side, it has been posited that reaching biases could arise from biomechanical factors that impact movement execution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Specifically, movements may be biased toward trajectories that minimize inertial resistance and/or energetic costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. For example, minimizing energy expenditure would result in biases towards trajectories that minimize resistive forces or changes in joint angles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Moreover, inaccuracies in the internal model of limb dynamics could produce systematic execution biases. For example, underestimating the weight of the limb would result in reaches that overshoot the target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To determine the origin of motor biases, we formalized four computational models to capture the potential sources described above. As detailed in the Results section, the models predict distinct motor bias patterns in a center-out reaching task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1f-h</xref>). While prior research has focused on the impact of individual sources (e.g., vision or proprioception) on the pattern of motor errors, these studies often entail a limited set of contexts (e.g., reaching behavior only when the start position is visible or only with the right hand). However, looking across studies, the task context can result in dramatically different motor bias patterns; indeed, when plotted in polar coordinates across the workspace, the bias functions range from having single peak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> to quadruple peaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. This diversity underscores the absence of a comprehensive explanation for motor bias phenomena across different experimental designs and setups. Additionally, a notable limitation of earlier work is the reliance on small participant cohorts (n&lt;10) and a restricted number of targets (typically 8). The sensitivity of such experiments is limited in terms of their capacity to discriminate between models.</p>
<p>To better evaluate sources of motor bias during reaching, we report a series of experiments involving a range of contexts, designed to test predictions of the different models. We compared movements performed with the right or left hand, proximal or distal effectors, under conditions in which the start position was either visible or not visible, and before and after implicit sensorimotor adaptation. To increase the power of model comparisons, we measured the motor bias function at a higher resolution (24 targets) and in a bigger sample size (n &gt;50 per experiment).</p>

<title>Motor biases across the workspace</title>
<p>To examine the pattern of motor biases during goal-directed movements, participants performed a center-out reaching task with their right hand (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). We ran two versions of the study in Experiment 1. In Exp 1a, we used an 8-target version similar to that used in most previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. To obtain better resolution of the motor bias pattern, we also conducted a 24-target version in Exp 1b. Within each experiment, participants first performed the task without visual feedback to establish their baseline bias and then a block with veridical continuous feedback to examine how feedback influences their biases. Motor biases were calculated as the angular difference between the target and hand when the movement amplitude reached the target distance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>), with a positive error indicating a counterclockwise bias and a negative error indicating a clockwise error.</p>

</fig>
<p>Across the workspace, the pattern of motor biases exhibited a two-peaked function (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>) characterized by two peaks and two troughs. From the 8-target experiment, larger biases were observed for the diagonal targets (45°, 135°, 225°, 335°) compared to the cardinal targets (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In terms of direction, reaches to diagonal targets were biased toward the vertical axis, and reaches for cardinal targets were biased in the counterclockwise direction. This pattern is similar to what has been observed in previous studies for right-handed movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. With the higher resolution in the 24-target experiment, we see that the peaks of the motor bias function are not strictly aligned with the diagonal targets but are shifted towards the horizonal axis. Moreover, the upward shift of the motor bias function relative to the horizontal line suggests that clockwise biases are more prevalent compared to counterclockwise biases across the workspace.</p>

<title>Motor biases primarily emerge from a misalignment between visual and hand reference frames</title>
<p>We developed a series of models to capture how systematic distortions at different sensorimotor processing stages would cause systematic motor biases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). Here we consider processing associated with the perceived position of the target, the perceived position of the arm/hand, and planning processes required to transform a target defined in visual space to a movement defined in arm/proprioceptive space. Biases could also arise from biomechanical constraints. Given that biomechanical biases are not easily simulated, we will evaluate this hypothesis experimentally (see below).</p>

</fig>
<p>We implemented four single-source models to simulate the pattern of the motor bias that would be predicted in a center-out reaching task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1f-h</xref>; see Methods). For the Visual Bias model, we assumed that the representation of the visual targets were biased towards the diagonals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This model predicts a four-peaked motor bias function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1f</xref>). For the Proprioceptive Bias model, we considered two variants building on the core idea is that the perceived starting position of the hand is distorted: A Vector-Based model in which the motor plan is a vector pointing from the perceived hand position to the target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and a Joint-Based model in which the movement is encoded as changes in the shoulder and elbow joint angles to move the limb from a start position to a desired target location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> (See <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>). Importantly, both models predict a motor bias function with a single peak (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1g</xref>). Taken together, models that focus on systematic distortions of perceptual information do not qualitatively capture the observed two-peaked motor bias function (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>).</p>
<p>The fourth model, the Transformation model is based on the idea that the start and target positions are initially encoded in visual space and transformed into proprioceptive space for motor planning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Motor biases may arise from a transformation error between coordinate systems. Two prominent features stand out when this transformation error is empirically measured<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. First, the direction of the transformation error is similar across the workspace (e.g., a leftward and downward matching error for right-handers). Second, the magnitude of the error increases with distance from the body (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>). As such, we simulated a visuo-proprioceptive error map by using a leftward and downward error vector with the magnitude scaled across the workspace based on the distance of each location to a reference point (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1h</xref> Top). This model predicts a two-peaked motor bias function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1h</xref> Bottom), a shape strikingly similar to that observed in Exps 1a and 1b.</p>
<p>To quantitively compare the models, we fit each model with the data in Exp 1b. The Transformation Bias model provided a good fit of the two-peaked motor bias function (R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>=0.84, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref> left, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref> for parameters). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1h</xref> (top) shows the recovered visual-proprioceptive bias map based on the parameters of the Transformation Bias model when fit to the reaching data in Exp 1b. The simulated results are very similar to the map measured empirically in the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1e</xref>). In contrast, the Visual Bias and Proprioceptive Bias models provide poor fits (all R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>&lt;0.18, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref> right). Thus, the simulations suggest that motor biases observed in reaching primarily originate from a transformation between visual and proprioceptive space.</p>
<p>A second way to evaluate the models is to compare the motor bias functions for the left and right hands. The Proprioceptive and Transformation Bias models predict that the bias function will be mirror-reversed for the two hands whereas the Visual Bias model predicts that the functions will be superimposed. We compared the functions for right and left hand reaches in Exp 2 using the 8-target layout. We found that the dissimilarity (RMSE) between the pattern of motor biases across two hands significantly decreased when the left-hand data are mirror-reversed compared to when the bias patterns are compared without mirror reversal (t(78) = 2.7, p = 0.008, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d-e</xref>). These results are consistent with the Transformation Bias model and provide further confirmation that the Visual Bias model, at least as conceptualized here, fails to provide a comprehensive account of reaching biases.</p>
<p>While the overall pattern of biases in the visuo-proprioceptive map are similar across individuals, there are subtle individual differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. As such, we would anticipate that the motor bias function would also exhibit stable individual differences due to idiosyncrasies in the visuo-proprioceptive map. To examine this, we correlated the bias functions obtained from blocks in which we either provided no visual feedback or veridical endpoint feedback. The magnitude of the biases was attenuated when endpoint feedback was provided, likely because the feedback reduced the visuo-proprioceptive mismatch. Nonetheless, the overall pattern of motor bias was largely preserved, with the within-participant correlations (Exp 1a: <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>norm</italic></sub> = 0.999, Exp 1b: <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>norm</italic></sub> = 0.974) significantly higher than the averaged between-participant correlation in both Exp 1a and Exp 1b (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2f</xref>).</p>

<title>Visual bias also contributes to the motor bias</title>
<p>In the preceding section, we considered each model in isolation, testing the idea that motor biases arise from a single source. However, the bias might originate from multiple sources. For example, there could be a distortion in both vision and proprioception, or a visuo-proprioceptive transformation that operates on distorted inputs. To address this, we evaluated hybrid models by combining the Visual Bias model with the Proprioceptive or Transformation Bias models. Although theoretically plausible, we did not consider a hybrid of the Proprioceptive and Transformation Bias models since they conflict in terms of whether the start position is perceived visually or proprioceptively.</p>
<p>The hybrid model that combines the Transformation and Visual Bias models (T+V model) provided an excellent fit of the motor bias pattern in Exp 1b (R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>=0.973, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). Based on a comparison of BIC values, this model not only outperforms the other hybrid models, but also significantly improved the fit compared to the Transformation Bias model alone. These results are especially interesting in that the assumed visual bias towards the diagonal axes has only been shown in studies in which perception was tested after the target had been extinguished. The current results suggest that this bias is also operative when the target remains visible, suggesting that the visual bias may reflect a general distortion in how space is represented, rather than a distortion that arises as information is processed in visual working memory.</p>
<p>To further evaluate the T+V model, we examined its performance in explaining the motor bias function obtained in an on-line study (Exp 3) in which participants performed the center-out task by moving a finger across a trackpad. One major difference between the in-person and on-line setups is that the workspace is much smaller and closer to the body when participants use a trackpad (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2g</xref>). As such, the magnitude of the motor biases generated by transformation errors should be smaller in the online compared to the in-person setup (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2h</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the prediction of the T+V model, we found markedly smaller motor biases with the online setup (Exp 3) compared to the in-person setup (Exp 1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>). While the motor bias functions were similar across experiments, we observed two small peaks between 20° and 200° in Exp 3 that were not apparent in Exp 1. When we fit this function to single source models, the Visual Bias model outperformed the Transformation Bias model. This suggests that, when the movements are close to the body, visual biases make a relatively stronger contribution to the motor biases compared to transformation biases. Nonetheless, the T+V model again provides the best fit to the motor bias function (R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>=0.857, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3e</xref>, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref> for parameters), significantly outperforming the other alternatives including the Visual Bias model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3f</xref>).</p>

<title>Transformation model accounts for qualitative changes in the motor bias function</title>
<p>The Transformation Bias model assumes that, for normal reaching, both the start and the target positions are encoded in visual space before being transformed into proprioceptive space for motor planning. However, if the start position is not visible, then the sensed start position would be directly encoded in proprioceptive space (i.e., where the hand is positioned), bypassing the need for a transformation between coordinate frames. As such, biases arising from the transformation process would only arise when the input is limited to the perceived position of the visual target. When we simulated the scenario in which the start position is not visible, the Transformation Bias model predicts a single-peaked function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref> right), a qualitative change from the two-peaked function predicted when both the start position and target position are visible (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref> left).</p>

</fig>
<p>To test this idea, we re-examined data from previous studies in which the participant’s hand was passively moved to a start position with no visual information given about the start location or hand position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Strikingly, the motor bias function under this condition has only have one peak. Thus, the transformation Bias model provides a novel account of the difference in motor biases observed when the start position is visible (Exp 1-3) compared to when it is not visible.</p>
<p>We note that the one-peaked motor bias function has previously been interpreted as evidence in support of a Proprioceptive Bias model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We performed a model comparison on the data from one of these studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and the T+V outperformed the Proprioceptive Bias, as well as the P+V models (ΔBIC=10.9). In addition, only the T+P model is able to account for the asymmetry between clockwise and counterclockwise biases. In summary, these results suggest that motor biases when reaching from an unseen start position arise when the target position is transformed from visual to proprioceptive coordinates rather than from a proprioceptive bias impacting the sensed start position. Moreover, the T+V model provides a parsimonious account of the bias functions, independent of the visibility of the start position.</p>
<p>Another way to evaluate the Transformation model is to perturb the position of the visual start position relative to the real hand position. Under this manipulation, a single peaked motor bias function is observed (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the functions exhibit opposing phase shifts when the starting position is perturbed to the left versus to the right (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>). This qualitative change in the motor bias function can again be successfully captured by the Transformation model (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2c</xref>). Taken together, these data provide strong evidence favoring the notion that motor biases originate primarily from a misalignment between visuo-proprioceptive reference frames.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Biomechanical models fail to account for motor biases</title>
<p>An alternative account of motor biases is that they arise from biomechanical constraints associated with upper limb movements. For example, movement kinematics have been explained in terms of cost functions to minimize energy and/or minimize jerk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> constraints that may result in an increase in endpoint error<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. One argument against a biomechanical model comes from evidence provided in the previous section: Biomechanical constraints associated with movement execution would not predict qualitative changes in the motor bias function in response to a visual manipulation of the start position.</p>
<p>As a second comparison of the T+V and Biomechanical Bias models, we examined how motor biases change after the sensorimotor map is recalibrated following a form of motor learning, implicit sensorimotor adaptation. Here we re-analyzed the data from previous experiments that had used a perturbation technique in which the visual feedback was always rotated by 15° from the target, independent of the hand position (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>, non-contingent clamped feedback<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>). Participants adapt to this perturbation, with subsequent reaches to the same target shifted in the opposite direction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>), reaching an asymptote of around 20° and showing a robust aftereffect when the perturbation is removed. Participants are unaware of their change in hand angle in response to clamped feedback, reporting their perceived hand position to be close to the target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="585272v2_fig5.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>For the T+V model, the transformation between visual and proprioceptive space depends on the perceived positions of the start and target locations in a visual-based reference space, one that remains unchanged before and after adaptation. We assume that adaptation has changed a sensorimotor map that is referenced after the transformation from visual to proprioceptive space. As such, the heading angle after adaptation for each target location is obtained by summing the motor biases for that target location and the extent of implicit adaptation. This would result in a vertical shift of the motor bias function (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c</xref> top).</p>
<p>In contrast, the biomechanical model predicts that motor biases will be dependent on the actual movement direction rather than the target location (e.g., a bias towards a movement that is energetically efficient). Since the mapping between a target location and its corresponding reach direction is rotated after adaptation, the motor bias pattern would also be rotated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c</xref> bottom). As such, the biomechanical model predicts that the motor bias function will be shifted along both the horizontal and vertical axes.</p>
<p>To arbitrate between these models, we analyzed the data from two previous studies, looking at the bias function from no-feedback trials performed before (baseline) and after adaptation (washout) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Consistent with the prediction of the T+V model, the motor bias function shifted vertically after adaptation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5d</xref>) but did not shift horizontally.</p>
<p>To quantitatively evaluate these results, we first fit the motor bias function during the baseline phase with the T+V model and fixed the parameters. We then examined the heading angles during the aftereffect phase by fitting two additional parameters, one that allowed the function to shift vertically (<italic>v</italic>) and the other to allow the function to shift horizontally (<italic>h</italic>). The T+V model predicts that only <italic>v</italic> will be different than zero; in contrast, the Biomechanical model predicts that <italic>h</italic> and v will both be different than zero and should be of similar magnitude. The results clearly favored the T+V model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5e</xref>). The vertical shift in the bias functions was of a similar magnitude as the aftereffect, with the shift direction depending on the direction of the clamped feedback (v: CW: 12.5°; CCW: –12.2°, p&lt;0.001). In contrast, the best fitting value for <italic>h</italic> was not significantly different from zero in both condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5g</xref>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that visual representations are first transformed into proprioceptive space for motor planning, with the recalibrated sensorimotor map altering the trajectory selected to achieve the desired movement outcome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While motor biases are ubiquitous in goal-directed reaching movements, the origin of these biases has been a subject of considerable debate. We addressed this issue by characterizing these biases across a range of experimental conditions and evaluated a set of computational models derived to capture different possible sources of bias. Contrary to previous theories, our results indicate that motor biases do not stem from a distortion in the sensed position of the hand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> or from biomechanical constraints during movement execution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Instead, motor biases appear to arise from systematic distortions in perceiving the location of the visual target and the transformation required to translate a perceived visual target into a movement described in proprioceptive coordinates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Strikingly, our model successfully accounts for sensorimotor biases across a wide range of contexts, encompassing movements performed with either hand as well as with proximal and distal effectors. Our model also accounts for the qualitative changes in the motor bias function that are observed when vision of the starting position of the hand is occluded, and when the sensorimotor map is perturbed following implicit adaptation.</p>
<p>While motor biases have been hypothesized to reflect a mismatch across perceptual and motor coordinate systems,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> it is unclear what information is transformed and what reference frame is employed for motor planning. Interestingly, many previous studies posit that movement is planned in an eye-centric visual reference frame<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. While the target can be directly perceived in this reference space, the start position of the hand would need to be transformed from a proprioceptive reference frame to a visual one. Systematic error in this transformation would mean that the start position of the hand is inaccurately represented in visual space, resulting in motor biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. This idea underlies the Proprioceptive Bias models described in this paper.</p>
<p>In contrast to these models, our Transformation Bias model posits that movement is planned in a hand-centric proprioceptive reference frame. By this view, when both the target and start position are provided in visual coordinates, the sensorimotor system transforms these positions from visual space to proprioceptive space. Systematic error in this transformation process will result in motor biases. When vision of the start position is available, the Transformation Bias model successfully accounts for the two-peaked motor bias function (Exp 1). Even more compelling, the Transformation Bias model accounts for how the pattern of motor biases change when the visibility of the start position is manipulated. When the start position is occluded, the transformation from visual to proprioceptive space is only relevant for the target position since the start position of the hand is already represented in proprioceptive space. Here the model predicts a motor bias function with a single peak, a function that has been observed in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We note that there is a third scenario, one which both the start position and target position are provided in proprioceptive space. We predict that under this condition, motor biases originating from the visuo-proprioceptive transformation would completely disappear. Indeed, when the hand is passively moved first to the target location and then to the start position, subsequent reaches to the target do not show the signature of bias from a visuo-proprioceptive transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Instead, the reaches exhibited a bias towards the diagonal axes, consistent with the predicted pattern if the sole source of bias is visual.</p>
<p>Why would a sensorimotor system exhibit inherent biases during the transformation process? We propose that these biases arise from two interrelated factors. First, these systems are optimally tuned for distinct purposes: A body-centric system predominantly uses proprioceptive and vestibular inputs to determine the orientation and position of the body in space, while an eye-centric system relies on visual inputs to interpret the layout of objects in the external world, representations that should remain stable even as the agent moves about in this environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> Second, these sensory systems consistently receive information with very different statistical distributions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, perhaps because of these distinct functions. For example, visual inputs tend to cluster around the principal axes (horizontal and vertical) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, whereas proprioceptive information during reaching is clustered around diagonal axes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. This is because these movements are often the least effortful and are the most frequently enacted directions of movement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. The differences in computational goals and input distributions might have led to natural divergences in how each system represents space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, and consequently, result in a misalignment between the reference frames.</p>
<p>The Transformation Bias model addresses how biases arise when the information is passed along from a visual to a proprioceptive reference frame. However, the results indicate that another source of bias originates from a distortion within the visual reference frame itself, manifesting as an attractive bias towards the diagonal axes. Thus, the best fitting model posits two sources of bias, one related to the representation of the visual target and a second associated with the transformation process. This hybrid Transformation + Visual Bias model outperformed all single-source and hybrid models, providing an excellent fit of the behavioral data across a wide variety of contexts.</p>
<p>There are several hypotheses concerning the origin of this bias. One account has focused on the idea that these biases arise from distortions introduced in visual working memory. The biases are observed when participants report the location of a remembered visual target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, independent of the reporting method (pointing or keypresses)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. However, as mentioned above, similar biases are observed even when participants report the location of a proprioceptive target (i.e., participants match the position of their unseen hand).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Moreover, as shown in our study, diagonal target biases make a sizable contribution even when the visual target is always present, imposing no demands on working memory. As such, we postulate that those visual biases may reflect a more domain-general distortion of spatial representations.</p>
<p>In addition to the diagonal bias, there may be other eye-centric, visual biases that impact movement. For instance, when required to fixate away from the target during motor planning, participants show systematic distortions in reach amplitude, with the effect an under– or overshoot depending on the relative position of the eyes and target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. While these results have been taken as evidence for eye-centric motor planning, redirecting fixation will shift the target and/or start position into the periphery, introducing distortions of radial distance. These distortions will influence motor planning even if the planning occurs in proprioceptive space.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that biomechanical factors do not significantly impact motor biases. While we did not formalize a biomechanical model, we provided several lines of evidence suggesting the biomechanical factors have minimal influence on the pattern of motor biases. For example, it is hard to envision a biomechanical model that would account for the qualitative change in the bias function when the start position was visible (two-peak function) to when it was hidden (one-peak function).</p>
<p>Empirically, we evaluated biomechanical contributions to motor biases by examining the bias pattern observed before and after implicit sensorimotor adaptation. We assume that adaptation mainly modifies a sensorimotor map<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> but has a relatively smaller influence on a visuo-proprioceptive map<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. That is, adaptation may change the mapping between a target represented in the proprioceptive space and the motor commands required to reach that location. Given that a biomechanical model assumes that motor biases are associated with the direction of a movement, this model would predict that the pattern of motor biases would be distorted by implicit motor adaptation. At odds with this prediction, the pattern of motor biases remained unchanged after adaptation, a result consistent with the Transformation Bias model.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the current study does not rule out the possibility that biomechanical factors may cause motor biases in different contexts. In our study, biomechanical constraints may not be influential since the extent of the required movements was relatively modest and involved minimal interaction torques. Moreover, we focused on examining biases that manifest at the movement endpoint rather than in the movement trajectory where biomechanics are known to play a greater role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Future studies are necessary to explore whether biomechanical biases are more pronounced in contexts in which the limb dynamics are crucial and/or the movements are energetically costly.</p>

<p>For the lab-based study (Exp 1, 2), 206 undergraduate students (age: 18-24) were recruited from University of California, Berkeley. For the online study (Exp 3), 183 young adult participants (age: 18-30) were recruited via Prolific, a website designed to recruit participants for online behavioral testing. All participants were right-handed as assessed by the Edinburgh handedness test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

<title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="s4b1">
<title>Experiments 1a, 1b, and 2</title>
<p>Experiments 1a, 1b, and 2 were conducted in the lab. Participants performed a center-out reaching task, holding a digitizing pen in the right or left hand to make horizontal movements on a digitizing tablet (49.3cm x 32.7cm, sampling rate= 100 Hz; Wacom, Vancouver, WA). The stimuli were displayed on a 120 Hz, 17-in. monitor (Planar Systems, Hillsboro, OR), which was mounted horizontally above the tablet (25 cm), to preclude vision of the limb. The experiment was controlled by custom software coded in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA), using Psychtoolbox extensions, and run on a Dell OptiPlex 7040 computer (Dell, Round Rock, TX) with Windows 7 operating system (Microsoft Co., Redmond, WA).</p>
<p>Participants made reaches from the center of the workspace to targets positioned at a radial distance of 8 cm. The start position and target location were indicated by a white annulus (1.2 cm diameter) and a filled blue circle (1.6 cm), respectively. Vision of the hand was occluded by the monitor, and the lights were extinguished in the room to minimize peripheral vision of the arm. Feedback, when provided, was in the form of a 4 mm white cursor that appeared on the computer monitor, aligned with the position of the digitizing pen.</p>
<p>To start each trial, the participant moved the cursor to the start circle (5mm diameter). After maintaining the cursor within the start circle for 500 ms, a target appeared at one of the target locations. The participant was instructed to make a rapid slicing movement through the target. We did not impose any reaction time guidelines, allowing the participant to set their own pace to initiate the movement. On no-feedback trials, the cursor was blanked when the hand left the start circle, and the target was extinguished once the radial distance of the movement reached the target distance (8 cm). On feedback trials, the cursor was visible throughout the movement until the movement amplitude reached 8 cm; at that point, its position was frozen for 1 s, providing feedback of the accuracy of the movement (angular position with respect to the target). After this interval, the target and cursor were extinguished.</p>
<p>At the end of both the no-feedback and feedback trials, a white ring appeared denoting the participant’s radial distance from the start position. This ring was displayed to guide the participant back to the start position without providing angular information about hand position. Once the participant moved within 2 cm of the start position, the ring was extinguished, and a veridical cursor appeared to allow the participant to move their hand to the start position. If the amplitude of the hand movement did not reach the target (&lt;8 cm radial distance) within 300 ms, the message “too slow” would be displayed for 500 ms before the white ring appeared.</p>
<p>For Exp 1a and Exp 2, there were 8 target locations, evenly spaced in 45° increments around the workspace (primary axes and main diagonals). For Exp 1b, there were 24 target locations, evenly spaced in 15° increments. Each experiment consisted of a no-feedback block followed by a feedback block. There were 5 trials per target (40 trials total) for each block in the Exps 1a. There were 4 trials per target (96 trials total) in Exp 1b.</p>

<title>Experiments 3a and 3b</title>
<p>Exps 3a and 3b were conducted using our web-based experimental platform (Tsay et al., 2021). Participants made center-out movements by controlling a cursor with the trackpad on their personal computers. It was not possible to occlude vision of the hand. However, since the visual stimulus was presented on a vertical monitor and the hand movement was in the horizontal plane, we assume vision of the hand was limited to the periphery (based on observations that the eyes remain directed to the screen during the trial). The size and position of visual stimuli were scaled based on each participant’s screen size (height = 239.6 ± 37.7 mm, width = 403.9 ± 69.5 mm). The experiment was controlled by custom software written with JavaScript and presented on Google Chrome. Data were collected and stored using Google Firebase.</p>
<p>The procedure was designed to mimic the lab-based experiments. On each trial, the participant made a center-out planar movement from the start position to a visual target. A white annulus (1% of screen height in diameter, 0.4 cm on average) indicated the start position, and a blue circle (1% of screen height in diameter) indicated the target location. The radial distance of the target from the start position was 40% of the screen height (5 cm on average). At the beginning of each trial, participants moved the cursor (0.6% of the screen height in diameter) to the start position, located at the center of their screen. The cursor was only visible when its distance from the start position was within 20% of the screen height. After maintaining the cursor at the start position for 500 ms, the target appeared. The participant made a rapid slicing movement through the blue target. As in the online experiments, there were feedback and no-feedback trials. For feedback trials, the cursor was visible until it reached the target distance, and then froze for 1 s at the target distance. On no-feedback trials, the cursor was extinguished after the hand exited the start position and the target disappeared once the radial distance of the movement reached the target distance. 500 ms after the end of the trial, the cursor became visible, repositioned at a random location within 10% of the screen height from the start position. The participant then moved the cursor to the start position to trigger the next trial.</p>
<p>There were 8 target locations in Exp 3a and 24 target locations in Exp 3b. As with the lab-based experiments, each experiment included a no-feedback block followed by a feedback block. We obtained larger data sets in the online studies: For each block, there were 20 trials/target (160 total trials for Exp 3a and 480 total trials for Exp 3b).</p>

<title>Reanalysis of prior data sets</title>
<p><italic>Vindras et al (2005)</italic>. This study used a design in which the participant did not see the start position of the movement. This was achieved by not included start position information in the visual display and passively moving the participant’s hand to a start position prior to each reach. Once positioned, a visual target would appear and the participant reached to that location. Across trials, there were two start positions, 12 target positions (spaced evenly by 30° around the workspace), and two target distances (6 and 12 cm). In modeling these data, we used the movement endpoint averaged across start positions and target distances.</p>
<p><italic>Morehead et al (2017) &amp; Kim et al (2018)</italic>. We re-analyzed the data from the 15° conditions of Exp 4 in Morehead et al (2017) and Exps 1 and 2 in Kim et al (2018). These three experiments examined visuomotor adaptation using non-contingent clamped feedback. On perturbation trials, the feedback cursor was presented at the radial position of the hand but with a fixed 15° angular offset relative to the target. Participants were informed that the angular position was not contingent on their hand position and instructed to move directly to the target, ignoring the feedback. This method results in robust implicit adaptation, with the heading direction of the movement gradually shifting away from the target in the opposite direction of the cursor. Participants are unaware of this change in behavior (Tsay et al, 2020). In each experiment, there were three blocks: A no-feedback baseline block (10 trials/target), a clamped feedback block (60 trials/target), and a no-feedback washout block (10 trials/target).</p>

<title>Data analyses</title>
<p>Motor bias refers to the angular difference between the position of the hand and target when the hand reaches the endpoint target distance. Angular errors were plotted as a function of the target position with 0° corresponding to the rightward target (3 o’clock location) and 90° corresponding to the forward target. Positive bias values indicate a counterclockwise error, and negative values indicate a clockwise error.</p>
<p>To assess the similarity of the motor bias functions across different conditions, we calculated the normalized correlation coefficient as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="585272v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two motor bias functions. <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> is the correlation coefficient between the recorded motor bias function and the true (but unknown) underlying motor bias function from that condition. To calculate <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> we used a method developed to measure the noise ceiling for EEG/fMRI data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>:

</disp-formula>
where <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>half</italic></sub> is determined by splitting the data set (based on participants) into random halves and calculating the correlation coefficient between the first half and the second half of the data. We bootstrapped <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>half</italic></sub> by resampling the data 2000 times and used the average value. <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> is calculated separately for a pair of conditions and the smaller one is applied as the normalizer for <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>norm</italic></sub>.</p>

<title>Models</title>
<p>To examine the source of motor bias, we considered five single-source models and three multiple-source models.</p>
<sec id="s4d1">
<title>Visual Bias model</title>
<p>The Visual Bias model postulates that movement biases arise because the perceived position of the visual target is systematically distorted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). Here we draw on the work of Huttenlocher et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In their study, a visual target was picked from an invisible circle, presented for 1 s and then blanked. The participant then indicated the remembered position of the target by pointing to a position on a circular digitizing pad. The results showed a bias towards the four diagonal directions (45°, 135°, 225°, 315°), with the magnitude of this bias increasing linearly as a function of the distance from the diagonals. As such, the maximum bias was observed for targets close to four cardinal target locations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°), and the sign of bias flipped at the four cardinal target locations.</p>
<p>We used the shape of this function to model bias associated with the perception of the location of the visual targets. To obtain a continuous function, we assumed a transition zone around the cardinal targets, each with a half-width represented by the parameter <italic>a</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>), and the peak motor bias is represented by the parameter <italic>b</italic>. As such, the angular bias (<italic>y</italic>) at a target located at <italic>x</italic>° can be formalized as:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="585272v2_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="585272v2_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
This model has two free parameters (<italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>). If participants directly reach to the perceived target location, their motor biases will directly reflect their visual biases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d2">
<title>Vector-based Proprioceptive Bias model</title>
<p>Vindras et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> proposed a model in which movement biases result from a misperception in estimating the initial position of the hand (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). Specifically, it has been shown that the perceived position of the hand when placed near the center of the workspace is biased towards the ipsilateral side and away from the body <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>). Assuming that the planned movement is formed by a vector pointing from the sensed hand position to the visual target position, this proprioceptive distortion will result in systematic motor biases around the workspace. For example, for the target at 90°, misperceiving the initial position of the right hand to the right of the start position will result in a movement that is biased in the counterclockwise (leftward) direction.</p>
<p>To simulate this Proprioceptive Bias model, we assumed the participants perceived the start position (0, 0) as a rightward bias away from the midline position, defining a proprioceptive error vector (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>). For a target i at [<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>], the motor plan is a vector [<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> − <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> − <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>]. From this, we calculated the angular difference between the motor plan vector and the target position to generate the motor bias for each target. The two free parameters in this model are [<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d3">
<title>Joint-based Proprioceptive Bias model</title>
<p>Reaching movements may also be planned in joint coordinates rather than the hand (endpoint) position <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Based on this hypothesis, motor biases could come about if there is a misperception of the initial elbow and shoulder joint angles. To implement a Joint-Based Proprioceptive Bias model, we represent the length of the forearm and upper arm as <italic>l</italic>1 and <italic>l</italic>1, respectively. We denote the initial angles of the shoulder and elbow joints as <italic>θ</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>φ</italic><sub>0</sub>, respectively, and their associated perceived error as <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, and <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> (See <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>).</p>
<p>By setting the origin of the coordinate system for the right shoulder at <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> (0, 0), the hand can be represented as:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="585272v2_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
For a fixed position in the workspace, there will be a unique solution pair for <italic>θ</italic> and <italic>φ</italic> (π &gt; <italic>φ</italic> &gt; <italic>θ</italic> &gt; 0), should a solution exist. To calculate the required change in joint angle to reach a visual target, we assumed that the system plans a movement based on the perceived hand position:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="585272v2_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Then we solve the following equation to decide the proper σ <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>and σ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>that transfer the hand from the start position to a target i at [<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>]:
<disp-formula id="eqn5">

We calculated the real movement direction based on the real hand position:
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="585272v2_eqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
We compare the direction of σ<italic>h</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and the target direction to calculate the motor bias. For simplicity, we assume <italic>l</italic>1= <italic>l</italic>2=24 cm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> The four free parameters in this model are <italic>θ</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>φ</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic>.</sub>, and <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub></p>

<sec id="s4d4">
<title>Transformation Bias model</title>
<p>The Transformation Bias model proposes attributes motor biases to systematic errors that arise during the transformation from a visual to proprioceptive-based reference frame. To implement this model, we refer to an empirically derived visuo-proprioceptive error map from a data set that sampled most of reachable space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>). Specifically, in that study, participants were asked to move their unseen hand from a random start position to a visual target. Rather than require a discrete reaching movement, they were told to continuously adjust their hand position, focusing on accuracy in aligning the hand with the target. The direction of the error was relatively consistent across targets, with the final hand position shifted to the right and undershooting the target. The magnitude of these biases increased as the radial extent of the limb increased. This basic pattern has been observed across studies using different visuo-proprioceptive matching methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The matching errors provide an empirical measure of the transformation from a visual reference frame to a proprioceptive reference frame. To model these data, we defined a transformation error vector, [<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>], whose direction is fixed across space. We then defined a “reference position” with a coordinate of [<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>]. For upper-limb movements, this reference position is often considered to be positioned around the shoulder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> The transformation error vector at position i is scaled by its Euclidean distance (<italic>d</italic>) to the referent position:

<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="585272v2_eqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

Movements towards a target i is planned via the vector connecting the start position to the target in proprioceptive space, denoted as:
<disp-formula id="eqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="585272v2_eqn9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> is the transformation vector at the start position, which is set as [0,0]. Motor bias is calculated as the angular difference between the motor plan and the target. The four free parameters in the Transformation Bias model are <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>.</p>

<title>Hybrid models</title>
<p>The four models described above each attribute motor biases to a single source. However, the bias might originate from multiple processes. To formalize this hypothesis, we considered three hybrid models, combining the Visual Bias model with the two versions of the Proprioceptive Bias model and with the Transformation Bias model. We did not create a hybrid of the Proprioceptive and Transformation Bias models since they make different assumptions about the information used to derive the motor plan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d6">
<title>Proprioceptive Bias + Visual Bias (P+V) model</title>
<p>We also created two hybrid models, combining the Visual Bias model with the Vector-Based and Joint-Based Proprioceptive Bias models. The Visual Bias model is used to estimate systematic error in the perceived location of the target and the proprioceptive Bias models are used to estimate systematic error in the perceived position of the hand at the start position. For these models, we calculated the biases from two models separately and then added them together:
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="585272v2_eqn10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

where <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> refers to the bias at target i.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d7">
<title>Transformation Bias + Visual Bias (T+V) model</title>
<p>The Transformation Bias model attributes motor biases to error that arises during the transformation of spatial information from visual space to proprioceptive space. However, the perceived location of the visual target may be biased. While we recognize that the misperception of the visual target may influence the transformation bias, the visual bias usually very small in our experiment, with a peak &lt;2°. As such, we simplify by calculating the biases from the Transformation Bias and Visual Bias models separately, and then added the values together:

<title>Model comparison</title>
<p>To compare the models, we fit each model with the data from Experiments 1b and 3b in which reaches were made to 24 targets. We evaluated our models on the average data across participants. We used the fminsearchbnd function in MATLAB to minimize the sum square errors (SSE) and used BIC for model comparison:

<title>Modeling motor bias after implicit sensorimotor adaptation</title>
<p>To examine how the motor bias function changes after visuomotor adaptation, we first used the T+V model to fit the motor bias function from a no-feedback baseline block tested prior to the introduction of the perturbation. We then used the best-fitted baseline model (<italic>TVb</italic>) to estimate the shift in the motor bias function from data obtained in a no-feedback aftereffect block following adaptation:

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study uses an original approach to address the longstanding question of why reaching movements are often biased. The combination of a wide range of experimental conditions and computational models is a strength. However, the modeling assumptions are not well-substantiated, the modeling analysis is insufficient with its focus on fits to average and not individual subject data, and the results are limited to biases in reach direction and do not consider biases in reach extent. Taken together, the evidence supporting the main claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Wang et al. studied an old, still unresolved problem: Why are reaching movements often biased? Using data from a set of new experiments and from earlier studies, they identified how the bias in reach direction varies with movement direction, and how this depends on factors such as the hand used, the presence of visual feedback, the size and location of the workspace, the visibility of the start position and implicit sensorimotor adaptation. They then examined whether a visual bias, a proprioceptive bias, a bias in the transformation from visual to proprioceptive coordinates and/or biomechanical factors could explain the observed patterns of biases. The authors conclude that biases are best explained by a combination of transformation and visual biases.</p>
<p>A strength of this study is that it used a wide range of experimental conditions with also a high resolution of movement directions and large numbers of participants, which produced a much more complete picture of the factors determining movement biases than previous studies did. The study used an original, powerful, and elegant method to distinguish between the various possible origins of motor bias, based on the number of peaks in the motor bias plotted as a function of movement direction. The biomechanical explanation of motor biases could not be tested in this way, but this explanation was excluded in a different way using data on implicit sensorimotor adaptation. This was also an elegant method as it allowed the authors to test biomechanical explanations without the need to commit to a certain biomechanical cost function.</p>
<p>The main weakness of the study is that it rests on the assumption that the number of peaks in the bias function is indicative of the origin of the bias. Specifically, it is assumed that a proprioceptive bias leads to a single peak, a transformation bias to two peaks, and a visual bias to four peaks, but these assumptions are not well substantiated. Especially the assumption that a transformation bias leads to two peaks is questionable. It is motivated by the fact that biases found when participants matched the position of their unseen hand with a visual target are consistent with this pattern. However, it is unclear why that task would measure only the effect of transformation biases, and not also the effects of visual and proprioceptive biases in the sensed target and hand locations. Moreover, it is not explained why a transformation bias would lead to this specific bias pattern in the first place. Also, the assumption that a visual bias leads to four peaks is not well substantiated as one of the papers on which the assumption was based (Yousif et al., 2023) found a similar pattern in a purely proprioceptive task. Another weakness is that the study looked at biases in movement direction only, not at biases in movement extent. The models also predict biases in movement extent, so it is a missed opportunity to take these into account to distinguish between the models.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors have done a good job mapping out reaching biases in a wide range of conditions, revealing new patterns in one of the most basic tasks, but unambiguously determining the origin of these biases remains difficult, and the evidence for the proposed origins is incomplete. Nevertheless, the study will likely have a substantial impact on the field, as the approach taken is easily applicable to other experimental conditions. As such, the study can spark future research on the origin of reaching biases.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work examines an important question in the planning and control of reaching movements - where do biases in our reaching movements arise and what might this tell us about the planning process? They compare several different computational models to explain the results from a range of experiments including those within the literature. Overall, they highlight that motor biases are primarily caused by errors in the transformation between eye and hand reference frames. One strength of the paper is the large number of participants studied across many experiments. However, one weakness is that most of the experiments follow a very similar planar reaching design - with slicing movements through targets rather than stopping within a target. Moreover, there are concerns with the models and the model fitting. This work provides valuable insight into the biases that govern reaching movements, but the current support is incomplete.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work uses a large number of participants both with studies in the laboratory which can be controlled well and a huge number of participants via online studies. In addition, they use a large number of reaching directions allowing careful comparison across models. Together these allow a clear comparison between models which is much stronger than would usually be performed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the topic of the paper is very interesting and potentially important, there are several key issues that currently limit the support for the conclusions. In particular I highlight:</p>
<p>Almost all studies within the paper use the same basic design: slicing movements through a target with the hand moving on a flat planar surface. First, this means that the authors cannot compare the second component of a bias - the error in the direction of a reach which is often much larger than the error in reaching direction. Second, there are several studies that have examined biases in three-dimensional reaching movements showing important differences to two-dimensional reaching movements (e.g. Soechting and Flanders 1989). It is unclear how well the authors' computational models could explain the biases that are present in these much more common-reaching movements.</p>
<p>The model fitting section is under-explained and under-detailed currently. This makes it difficult to accurately assess the current model fitting and its strength to support the conclusions. If my understanding of the methods is correct, then I have several concerns. For example, the manuscript states that the transformation bias model is based on studies mapping out the errors that might arise across the whole workspace in 2D. In contrast, the visual bias model appears to be based on a study that presented targets within a circle (but not tested across the whole workspace). If the visual bias had been measured across the workspace (similar to the transformation bias model), would the model and therefore the conclusions be different? There should be other visual bias models theoretically possible that might fit the experimental data better than this one possible model. Such possibilities also exist for the other models.</p>
<p>Although the authors do mention that the evidence against biomechanical contributions to the bias is fairly weak in the current manuscript, this needs to be further supported. Importantly both proprioceptive models of the bias are purely kinematic and appear to ignore the dynamics completely. One imagines that there is a perceived vector error in Cartesian space whereas the other imagines an error in joint coordinates. These simply result in identical movements which are offset either with a vector or an angle. However, we know that the motor plan is converted into muscle activation patterns which are sent to the muscles, that is, the motor plan is converted into an approximation of joint torques. Joint torques sent to the muscles from a different starting location would not produce an offset in the trajectory as detailed in Figure S1, instead, the movements would curve in complex patterns away from the original plan due to the non-linearity of the musculoskeletal system. In theory, this could also bias some of the other predictions as well. The authors should consider how the biomechanical plant would influence the measured biases.</p>

<p>The authors make use of a large dataset of reaches from several studies run in their lab to try to identify the source of direction-dependent radial reaching errors. While this has been investigated by numerous labs in the past, this is the first study where the sample is large enough to reliably characterize isometries associated with these radial reaches to identify possible sources of errors.</p>
<p>The sample size is impressive, but the authors should include confidence intervals and ideally, the distribution of responses across individuals along with average performance across targets. It is unclear whether the observed &quot;averaged function&quot; is consistently found across individuals, or if it is mainly driven by a subset of participants exhibiting large deviations for diagonal movements. Providing individual-level data or response distributions would be valuable for assessing the ubiquity of the observed bias patterns and ruling out the possibility that different subgroups are driving the peaks and troughs. It is possible that the Transformation or some other model (see below) could explain the bias function for a substantial portion of participants, while other participants may have different patterns of biases that can be attributable to alternative sources of error.</p>
<p>The different datasets across different experimental settings/target sets consistently show that people show fewer deviations when making cardinal-directed movements compared to movements made along the diagonal when the start position is visible. This reminds me of a phenomenon referred to as the oblique effect: people show greater accuracy for vertical and horizontal stimuli compared to diagonal ones. While the oblique effect has been shown in visual and haptic perceptual tasks (both in the horizontal and vertical planes), there is some evidence that it applies to movement direction. These systematic reach deviations in the current study thus may reflect this epiphenomenon that applies across modalities. That is, estimating the direction of a visual target from a visual start position may be less accurate, and may be more biased toward the horizontal axis, than for targets that are strictly above, below, left, or right of the visual start position. Other movement biases may stem from poorer estimation of diagonal directions and thus reflect more of a perceptual error than a motor one. This would explain why the bias function appears in both the in-lab and on-line studies although the visual targets are very different locations (different planes, different distances) since the oblique effects arise independent of plane, distance, or size of the stimuli.</p>
<p>When the start position is not visible like in the Vindras study, it is possible that this oblique effect is less pronounced; masked by other sources of error that dominate when looking at 2D reach endpoint made from two separate start positions, rather than only directional errors from a single start position. Or perhaps the participants in the Vindras study are too variable and too few (only 10) to detect this rather small direction-dependent bias.</p>
<p>A bias in estimating visual direction or visual movement vector is a more realistic and relevant source of error than the proposed visual bias model. The Visual Bias model is based on data from a study by Huttenlocher et al where participants &quot;point&quot; to indicate the remembered location of a small target presented on a large circle. The resulting patterns of errors could therefore be due to localizing a remembered visual target, or due to relative or allocentric cues from the clear contour of the display within which the target was presented, or even movements used to indicate the target. This may explain the observed 4-peak bias function or zig-zag pattern of &quot;averaged&quot; errors, although this pattern may not even exist at the individual level, especially given the small sample size. The visual bias source argument does not seem well-supported, as the data used to derive this pattern likely reflects a combination of other sources of errors or factors that may not be applicable to the current study, where the target is continuously visible and relatively large. Also, any visual bias should be explained by a coordinates centre on the eye and should vary as a function of the location of visual targets relative to the eyes. Where the visual targets are located relative to the eyes (or at least the head) is not reported.</p>
<p>The Proprioceptive Bias Model is supposed to reflect errors in the perceived start position. However, in the current study, there is only a single, visible start position, which is not the best design for trying to study the contribution. In fact, my paradigms also use a single, visual start position to minimize the contribution of proprioceptive biases, or at least remove one source of systematic biases. The Vindras study aimed to quantify the effect of start position by using two sets of radial targets from two different, unseen start positions on either side of the body midline. When fitting the 2D reach errors at both the group and individual levels (which showed substantial variability across individuals), the start position predicted most of the 2D errors at the individual level - and substantially more than the target direction. While the authors re-plotted the data to only illustrate angular deviations, they only showed averaged data without confidence intervals across participants. Given the huge variability across their 10 individuals and between the two target sets, it would be more appropriate to plot the performance separately for two target sets and show confidential intervals (or individual data). Likewise, even the VT model predictions should differ across the two targets set since the visual-proprioceptive matching errors from the Wang et al study that the model is based on, are larger for targets on the left side of the body.</p>
<p>I am also having trouble fully understanding the V-T model and its associated equations, and whether visual-proprioception matching data is a suitable proxy for estimating the visuomotor transformation. I would be interested to first see the individual distributions of errors and a response to my concerns about the Proprioceptive Bias and Visual Bias models.</p>

<p>We are pleased that the reviewers found our study thought-provoking and appreciate the care they have taken in providing constructive feedback. Focusing on the main issues raised by the reviewers, we provide here a provisional response to the Public Comments and outline our revision plan.</p>
<p>A) Reviewers 1 and 2 were concerned that our task and analyses were limited by the fact that we only tested the model based on biases in movement direction (angular biases) and did not examine biases in movement extent (radial biases).</p>
<p>While we think the angular biases provide a sufficient test to compare the set of models presented in the paper, we appreciate that there was a missed opportunity to also look at movement extent.  Looking at predictions concerning both movement direction and extent would provide a stronger basis for model comparison. To this end, we will take a two-step approach:</p>
<p>(1) Re-analysis of existing datasets from experiments that involve a pointing task (movements terminate at the target position) rather than a shooting task (movements terminate further than the target distance).  We will conduct a model comparison using these data.</p>
<p>(2) If we are unable to obtain a suitable dataset or datasets because we cannot access individual data or there are too few participants, we will conduct a new experiment using a pointing task.  We will use these new data to evaluate whether the transformation model can accurately predict biases in both movement direction and extent.</p>
<p>We will incorporate those new results in our revision.</p>
<p>B) Reviewer 3 noted that model fitting was based on group average data. They questioned if this was representative across individuals and how well the model would account for individual patterns of reach biases.</p>
<p>To address this issue, we propose to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) We will first fit the model to individual data in Exp 1 and assess whether a two-peak function, the signature of the transformation model, is characteristic of most the fits. We recognize that the results at the individual level may not support the model.  This could occur because the model is not correct.  Alternatively, the model could be correct but difficult to evaluate at the individual level for several reasons. First, the data set may be underpowered at the individual level. Second, motor biases can be idiosyncratic (e.g., within subject correlation is greater than between subject correlation), a point we noted in the original submission. Third, as observed in previous studies, transformation biases also show considerable individual variability (Wang et al, 2020); as such, even if the model is correct, a two-peaked function may not hold for all individuals.</p>
<p>(2) If the individual variability is too large to draw meaningful conclusions, we will conduct a new experiment in which we measure motor and proprioceptive biases. Our plan would be to collect a large data set from a limited number of participants.  These data should allow us to evaluate the models on an individual basis, including using each participant’s own transformation/proprioceptive bias function to predict their motor biases.</p>
<p>C) The reviewers have comments regarding the assumptions and form of the different models. Reviewer 3 questioned the visual bias model presented in the paper, and Reviewers 2 and 3 suggested additional visual bias/ biomechanical models to consider.</p>
<p>We agree that what we call a visual bias effect is not confined to the visual modality: It is observed when the target is presented visually or proprioceptively, and in manifest in both reaching movements, saccades, and pressing keys to adjust a dot to match with the remembered target (Kosovicheva &amp; Whitney, 2017; Yousif et al. 2023). As such, the bias may reflect a domain-general distortion in the representation of goals within polar space. We refer to this component as a &quot;visual bias&quot; because it is associated with the representation of the visual target in the reaching task.</p>
<p>We do think the version of the visual bias model in the original submission is reasonable given that the bias pattern has been observed in perceptual tasks with stimuli that were very similar to ours (e.g., Kosovicheva &amp; Whitney, 2017). We have explored other perceptual models in evaluating the motor biases observed in Experiment 1. For example, several models discuss how visual biases may depend on the direction of a moving object or the orientation of an object (Wei &amp; Stocker, 2015; Patten, Mannion &amp; Clifford, 2017). However, these models failed to account for the motor biases observed in our experiments, a not surprising outcome since the models were not designed to capture biases in perceived location.  There are also models of visual basis associated with viewing angle (e.g., based on retina/head position).  Since we allow free viewing, these biases are unlikely to make substantive contributions to the biases observed in our reaching tasks.</p>
<p>Given that some readers are likely to share the reviewers’ concerns on this issue, we will extend our discussion to describe alternative visual models and provide our arguments about why these do not seem relevant/appropriate for our study.</p>
<p>In terms of biomechanical models, we plan to explore at least one alternative model, the MotorNet Model (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88591">https://elifesciences.org/articles/88591</ext-link>). This recently published model combines a six-muscle planar arm model with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to generate a control policy. The model has been used to predict movement curvature in various contexts.  We will focus on its utility to predict biases in reaching to visual targets.</p>
<p>D) Reviewer 1 had concerns with how we measured the transformation bias. In particular, they asked why the data from Wang et al (2020) are used as an estimate of transformation biases, and not as the joint effects of visual and proprioceptive biases in the sensed target and hand location, respectively.</p>
<p>We define transformation error as the misalignment between the visual target and the hand position. We quantify this transformation bias by referencing studies that used a matching task in which participants match their unseen hand to a visual target, or vice versa. Errors observed in these tasks are commonly attributed to proprioceptive bias, although they could also reflect a contribution from visual bias. We utilized the same data set to simulate both the transformation bias model and the proprioceptive bias model.</p>
<p>Although it may seem that we are simply renaming concepts, the concept of transformation error addresses biases that arise during motor planning. For the proprioceptive bias model, the bias only influences the perceived start position but not the goal since proprioception will influence the perceived position of the target before the movement begins. In contrast, the transformation bias model proposes that movements are planned toward a target whose location is biased due to discrepancies between visual and proprioceptive representations.</p>
<p>The question then arises whether measurements of proprioceptive bias also reflect a transformation bias. We believe that the transformation bias is influenced by proprioceptive feedback, or at the very least, proprioceptive and transformation bias share a common source of error and thus, are highly correlated. We will revise the Introduction and Results sections to more clearly articulate these relationships and assumptions.</p>
<p>E) Reviewer 3 asked whether the oblique effect in visual perception could account for our motor bias.</p>
<p>The potential link between the oblique effect and the observed motor bias is an intriguing idea, one that we had not considered. However, after giving this some thought, we see several arguments against the idea that the oblique effect accounts for the pattern of motor biases.</p>
<p>First, by the oblique effect, variance is greater for diagonal orientations compared to Cartesian orientations. These differences in perceptual variability can explain the bias pattern in visual perception through a Bayesian efficient coding model (Wei &amp; Stocker, 2015). We note that even though participants showed large variability for stimuli at diagonal orientations, the bias for these stimuli was close to zero. As such, we do not think it can explain the motor bias function given the large bias for targets at locations along the diagonal axes.</p>
<p>Second, the reviewer suggested an &quot;oblique effect&quot; within the motor system, proposing that motor variability is greater for diagonal directions due to increased visual bias. If this hypothesis is correct, a visual bias model should account for the motor bias observed, particularly for diagonal targets. In other words, when estimating the visual bias from a reaching task, a similar bias pattern should emerge in tasks that do not involve movement. However, this prediction is not supported in previous studies. For example, in a position judgment task that is similar to our task but without the reaching response, participants exhibited minimal bias along the diagonals (Kosovicheva &amp; Whitney, 2017).</p>
<p>Despite our skepticism, we will keep this idea in mind during the revision, investigating variability in movement across the workspace.</p>
