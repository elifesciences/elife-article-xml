<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Human fetal development has been associated with brain health at later stages. It is unknown whether growth in utero, as indexed by birth weight (BW), relates consistently to lifespan brain characteristics and changes, and to what extent these influences are of a genetic or environmental nature. Here we show remarkably stable and life-long positive associations between BW and cortical surface area and volume across and within developmental, aging and lifespan longitudinal samples (N = 5794, 4-82 years of age, w/ 386 monozygotic twins, followed for up to 8.3 years w/12,088 brain MRIs). In contrast, no consistent effect of BW on brain changes was observed. Partly environmental effects were indicated by analysis of twin BW discordance. In conclusion, the influence of prenatal growth on cortical topography is stable and reliable through the lifespan. This early life factor appears to influence the brain by association of brain reserve, rather than brain maintenance. Thus, fetal influences appear omnipresent in the spacetime of the human brain throughout the human lifespan. Optimizing fetal growth may increase brain reserve for life, also in aging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is established that a substantial portion of functional variation through the lifespan, including in older age, is of neurodevelopmental origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Evidence converges on early life factors being important for normal individual differences in brain, mental health and cognition across the lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, as well as risk of psychiatric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and neurodegenerative disease in older age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Obtaining reliable indicators of individual early life factors is a major challenge. In this regard, birth weight (BW) stands out as a solid available measure. BW reflects fetal and maternal genetic, but also other in utero environmental factors affecting fetal growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, including brain growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. By now, a series of studies have established that BW relates positively to mental health, cognitive function and brain characteristics, including neuroanatomical volumes and cortical surface area as measured in different age groups <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, it is unknown whether and how BW relates to brain characteristics through the lifespan, how consistent effects are within and across samples, whether BW is associated with lifespan brain changes, and to what extent lifespan effects of BW on the brain are of an environmental, rather than genetic nature. These questions, which are critical to understand how and when the human brain can be influenced through the lifespan, we address in the present study. On an overarching level, this study also addresses current debates in the field of lifespan cognitive neuroscience, namely: 1) whether consistent, reproducible relationships between phenotypes relevant for mental health and function and inter-individual differences in brain characteristics can be found <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and 2) to what extent effects found in and ascribed to brain aging may actually reflect early life influences, rather than longitudinal changes in older age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There are at least two different ways by which the effects of fetal growth, as indexed by birth weight, could work to produce the brain effects so far observed. 1) In line with a brain reserve model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, higher birth weight could be associated with greater brain growth before birth. This seems likely, given that the effects are seen also in young populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, from the so far largely cross-sectional, or mixed models, several questions remain unanswered: Is this a fixed effect at the time of birth? Does higher birth weight also have carry-over effects to greater development in childhood and adolescence? In line with a brain maintenance model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, is higher birth weight associated with better maintenance of brain volumes in the face of age-related changes in older adulthood? While effects are found in young populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, reduced atrophy in aging is a possible additional effect of higher BW that should be investigated, given the known relationships between birth size and brain volumes also in older age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The possible effects of BW on later brain development and brain maintenance in adulthood can only be investigated by longitudinal brain imaging spanning all stages of human life. Furthermore, as BW normally reflects both genetic and prenatal environmental factors, and an environmental BW contribution to brain differences has been shown in young monozygotic (MZ) twins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, we need to study brain effects of birth weight discordance in MZ twins in this context to disentangle possible non-genetic contributions of BW through the lifespan.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that there are persistent effects of BW on brain characteristics through the lifespan, and hence, that these would be consistent within and across samples of varying age and origin. We test this in a Norwegian sample covering the lifespan (LCBC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, the US developmental sample ABCD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and the older adult UK biobank (UKB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> sample. The associations of BW and cortical surface, thickness, volume and their change were investigated vertex-wise in a total of 5794 persons (of whom 5718 with repeated scans, and 386 monozygotic twins) with 12088 longitudinal observations, 4-82 years of age at baseline, followed for up to ∼ 8.3 years. Based on previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, we hypothesized such effects to be driven primarily by positive associations between birth weight and cortical area, with lesser, if any, effects on cortical thickness. We expected positive effects on cortical volume corresponding to positive effects on cortical area. We hypothesized that effects would be stable, so that BW mainly affects the brain “intercept” and does not relate much to brain changes. That is, we hypothesize a threshold model, whereby higher BW yields greater cortical area, and hence cortical volume, to begin with, rather than a maintenance model, whereby higher BW serves to protect against atrophy in aging. Moreover, we hypothesized that effects could not be explained solely by genetics, so that birth weight discordance in a subsample of MZ twins would also result in differences in brain characteristics through the lifespan.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Cortical surfaces were reconstructed from T1-weighted anatomical MRIs by use of FreeSurfer v6.0 (LCBC and UKB), and 7.1. (ABCD) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, yielding maps of cortical area, thickness and volume. Vertex-wise analyses were run with spatiotemporal linear mixed effects modeling (FreeSurfer v6.0.0 ST-MLE package), to assess regional variation in the relationships between birth weight and cortical structure and its change. All analyses were run with baseline age, sex, scanner site, and time (scan interval) as covariates. For ABCD specifically, ethnicity was also included as a covariate. For consistency of multiple comparison corrections across analyses, the results were thresholded at a cluster-forming threshold of 2.0, p &lt; .01, with a cluster-wise probability of p &lt; .0.25 (p &lt;.05/2 hemispheres).</p>

<title>The lifespan relationship of BW and cortical volume, surface area and thickness</title>
<p>Associations of birth weight and cortical characteristics are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> (for the right hemisphere, and in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> for both hemispheres). Across all cohorts, widespread positive associations were observed between BW and cortical area. These were highly consistent across lifespan (LCBC), developmental (ABCD) and aging (UKB) cohorts, and there were bilateral overlapping effects across most of the cortical mantle. As expected, BW had in general lesser effects on cortical thickness, and no significant effects on thickness were observed in the UKB. There were however some lateral positive and medial negative effects in the LCBC and ABCD cohorts. We note that corresponding effects with increased medial frontal and occipital cortical thickness have been found associated with white matter alterations (reduced FA) in young adults born preterm with very low BW compared to term-born controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. BW was significantly positively associated with cortical volume across much of the cortical mantle. In sum, broad, bilateral, positive associations were observed across cohorts for cortical area and volume.</p>

</fig>
<p>Additionally controlling for education level had little effect on results (see <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Information on gestational length (i.e. whether there was premature birth) was not available for all participants. Importantly, this information was lacking for the older participants, i.e. this information is not available for UKB, and since this information for the LCBC was drawn from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN), only established in 1967, this was not available for the older part of the LCBC sample either. The majority of the LCBC sample and the ABCD sample, had information on gestational length, however (LCBC: n = 514; gestational length in weeks: M = 40.0 weeks, SD = 1.9, range = 25-44; ABCD: n = 3306; weeks premature: M = 1.0 weeks premature, SD = 2.1, range = 0.0-13.0). Controlling for gestational age in these subsamples had relatively little effect on results (see <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). However, as expected with reduced power in the LCBC sample, the effects in this analysis were somewhat narrower. Effects in ABCD, where almost all participants were retained for analysis, showed no sign of decrease with control for gestational length. When restricting all samples to participants with BW between 2.5 and 5.0 kg, results were also very similar (see <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). As expected from the widespread effects on cortical area and volume, effects were partly generic, with analyses controlling for ICV showing more restricted effects (see <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). However, consistent significant positive effects of BW on cortical area also when controlling for ICV were observed across all three cohorts in lateral temporal and frontal areas (see <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Birth weight effects on cortical change</title>
<p>Significant BW x time interactions on cortical characteristics were observed in restricted and non-overlapping regions across samples, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> (depicting right hemisphere results, for visualization of effects in both hemispheres, see <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Per direction of effect, the effect of BW differences was apparently reduced over time for area in LCBC and ABCD, whereas no interaction effects on area were significant in UKB. A mixture of positive (ABCD) and negative (LCBC, UKB) interaction effects were significant for thickness and volume.</p>
<p>Visualization of the interaction effects as seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>, by splitting the sample in two based on BW, did not yield convincing evidence for these interactions, as shown in Supplementary Figures 7-9. In plots of LCBC data, where number of follow-ups varied, and a select portion had longer follow-up, it appeared that the effect of BW was reduced over time in these restricted regions. However, virtually parallel trajectories for the ABCD and UKB subsamples with lower and higher BW, suggested the effect size even within the areas of significant interactions of BW and time was negligible. Since UKB and ABCD samples here consisted of samples having two time points only, whereas LCBC consisted of a mix of number of follow-ups over a longer time period, there might be sample-specific selection effects also regarding other characteristics than BW that can influence these effects in LCBC. For instance, participants who do not drop out tend to have better health, cognitive ability and education, which again may relate positively to the brain measures studied here <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, caution is advised in interpreting effects seen only with longer follow-up in the LCBC sample.</p>

<title>Consistency of spatial relationships across and within samples</title>
<p>Next, we assessed whether the cortical correlates of BW (βeta-maps) showed a similar topographic pattern across the three independent datasets (UKB, ABCD and LCBC). The results showed that all the spatial comparisons were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). That is, the topography of the effects of BW on cortical structure was comparable across datasets – the pairwise spatial correlation of a given cortical correlate of BW (e.g. BW effects on cortical area) was similar when estimated from two different datasets. The spatial correlations were highest for the volume measures (r = .64 -.79), and overall also high (r = .51-.71) for area measures, whereas for cortical thickness, they were more moderate (r = .24 -.45). See spatial correlations for the right hemisphere cortical volume in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and the full model summary in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. The results are qualitatively comparable when using -log10 (p) significance values instead of βeta estimates, as shown in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. The same pattern of results was largely seen also for spatial correlation of the maps capturing BW-associated cortical characteristics when controlling for ICV. The correlations were then on average somewhat lower, but there were still only significant positive correlations across LCBC, ABCD, and UKB (see <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the spatial correlation of the maps capturing BW-associated cortical <italic>change</italic> were either unrelated (n = 7) or showed negative associations between cohorts (n = 2). The spatial correlations of birth weight on cortical change were r = – 35- -.05 for area, r = -.35 -.08 for volume, and r = -.20, - -.04 for thickness. See a visual representation in <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 10</xref> and full stats in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>In sum, the spatial correlation analyses imply that the different datasets show a comparable topography of BW effects across the cortical mantle – i.e. the areas more and less affected by BW were common across datasets. Thus, the BW effects on cortical structure are robust and replicable across very different datasets. In contrast, the effects of BW on cortical change are not robust across datasets, showing dissimilar topographies.</p>

<title>Effects of BW discordance on brain characteristics and changes in monozygotic twins</title>
<p>BW discordance analyses on twins specifically were run as described for main analyses above, with the exception that twin scans were reconstructed using FS v6.0.1. for ABCD. BW discordance was associated with cortical area, where the heavier twins had greater area in some frontal, temporal and occipitotemporal regions, with effects in the right hemisphere only surviving corrections for multiple comparisons. We note that these regions mostly overlap with regions where positive effects of BW were also seen in the bigger sample. Strikingly, the effect of BW discordance, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, appeared similar in size to the effect of BW itself in the MZ twin sample. However, note that this plot is merely for illustrating effects, the effect size is inflated for the BW discordance plot, since the values are derived from areas already identified as significantly related to BW. There was no association of BW discordance and cortical area changes over time.</p>

<p>In a very small area of the right hemisphere, there was a significant association of BW discordance and cortical thickness change, meaning the lighter twin had greater cortical thickness over time, but this effect was both regionally and quantitatively minor, as shown in <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>. There were no significant effects of BW discordance on cortical volume or volume change over time.</p>
<p>Finally, to formally assess whether the cortical correlates (βeta-maps) of BW discordance in the twin subsample corresponded to cortical correlates of BW in the bigger samples, we did a meta-analysis of these estimates for area, thickness and volume in the UKB, ABCD and LCBC, and then assessed whether the cortical correlates of BW and BW discordance (βeta-maps) showed a similar topographic pattern across the datasets. The results of this meta-analysis-twin comparison showed only positive relationships, for area, r = .23, thickness r= .19, and volume r =.22. However, the respective uncorrected p-values were .08, .12, and .04, so the spatial comparisons would not be statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). However, the positive correlations are suggestive that the topography of the effects of BW discordance in genetically identical twins on cortical structure was to some extent comparable to effects of individual differences in BW in the bigger sample.</p>

<title>Effects of BW differences compared to effects of aging</title>
<p>We calculated the effect of 1 SD difference in BW (on average 600 g, see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) on cortical and brain volume across cohorts, to directly compare the early life effects on the brain to later aging changes. The effect of 1SD lower BW on cortical volume was 6708 mm<sup>3</sup>, 8466 mm<sup>3</sup>, and 5980 mm<sup>3</sup> in LCBC, UKB and ABCD, respectively. This was equal to 1.2%, 1.6% and 1.1% lesser cortex with 600-700 grams lower BW for each sample, respectively. In the context of brain aging, this is a substantial effect. The estimated yearly cortical volume reduction from 50 to 60 years is 895 mm<sup>3</sup> in the LCBC and 1402 mm3 in the UKB samples, respectively. Hence, the effect of 600 grams difference in BW equals 7.5 and 6 years of aging in LCBC and UKB, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present results indicate that BW, the earliest widely and easily obtainable congenital metric, show robust, persistent, and chiefly stable associations with brain characteristics through life. Especially, BW was associated with cortical area and volume in an age and time-invariant fashion. The robustness of this effect is quite remarkable, given the wealth of different influences individuals meet after birth, which are repeatedly assumed and reported to have major impact on the brain through the protracted human lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. It is also in quantitative terms outstanding, compared to consistency of cortical topographies reported for other phenotypical factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This is also special for a phenotype known to be environmentally influenced, unlike biologically hardcoded phenotypes such as sex or age, for which there are known brain-wide association studies (BWAS) patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Typically, other factors relating to later socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and health, get the most attention in adult and aging brain research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Such factors, which are then targeted for prevention and intervention at different stages of the life-course, often do not show consistent relationships to brain characteristics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, may not actually be causal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and may themselves be related to prenatal growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Another phenotype which obviously, like BW, reflects both genetic and environmental influences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, is body mass index (BMI) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Consistent BWAS patterns have been reported for BMI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. BW stands out as the single chronological earliest phenotype, and besides BMI, BW appears to have the most replicable and consistent relations to cortical morphology, as shown here both across and within samples. It has been claimed that smaller than expected brain–phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread replication failures for brain-wide association studies (BWAS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, this is necessarily a question of which phenotypes are the most relevant to relate to brain characteristics. Also, the temporal order of factors needs to be considered if causal interpretations are to be made. Chronologically later factors necessarily do not cause earlier ones. While we cannot claim that BW itself causes the cortical characteristics observed in aging, the cortical variance explained by BW after one decade, and seven or eight decades of life alike, is unlikely to be explained by influences only present at some point in adulthood or aging. BW, as further discussed below, depends on genetic, as well as prenatal environmental influences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, which likely have causal effects on early brain morphological features. Here we find that these effects are substantial also in the aging brain.</p>
<p>We calculated that a BW difference of one SD (about 600 g) equaled a difference in cortical volume on the order of 1.1-1.6 percent in these cohorts. This is a quite big effect, of a magnitude relevant for explaining a substantial portion of the differences typically seen between patients with neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls. As noted, BW differences have been reported for neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, and also other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia or more general psychopathology, with the cortical effects detected not invariably being very large in absolute terms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. There is a limit to the range of variation that can apply to human cortical volumes, in general, (e.g. virtually none have cortical volumes below 0.45 or above 0.65 l). In terms of sample representativity, one may assume that there can be a restriction relative to the actual range of human cortical volume variation, as the present samples specifically are largely healthy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Much of the differences within this limited range of variation is explained by factors here controlled for, such as age and sex. With the present effect, on the restricted range of variation, combined with big samples, it is obvious that BW differences of much less than our example magnitude (600 g) may be detectable in the cortical morphology of patients versus controls. In the context of aging and neurodegenerative change, the estimated cortical effect of ∼600 g difference in BW is of a magnitude many times the annual cortical reduction estimated to take place from e.g. 50 to 60 years in the adult cohorts, where the estimated yearly cortical volume reduction would be 895 mm<sup>3</sup> in LCBC and 1402 mm<italic><sup>3</sup></italic> in UKB. The effect of 600 grams difference in BW is equivalent to 7.5 and 6 years of aging in LCBC and UKB respectively. This is a substantial effect in terms of brain aging in imaging, and may illuminate why machine learning estimates such as “brain age”, assumed to index aging-related processes, may rather than relate to longitudinal age-changes, largely capture variance already determined at birth <sup>7,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Neglecting this especially consistent and early factor is likely to lead to a substantial portion of human brain variance being either erroneously ascribed to factors only present at later life stages <sup>7</sup> or left unaccounted for.</p>
<p>The solidity, replicability, and universality of effects as shown here for a partly environmentally influenced metric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, appear exceptional in human brain imaging. The within-sample replicability results are not fully comparable to other studies assessing the replicability of brain-phenotype associations due to analytical differences (e.g. sample size, multiple-comparison correction method)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Still, these results too clearly show that the rate of replicability of BW associations with cortical area and volume are comparable to benchmark brain-phenotype associations such as age and BMI with brain structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The BW-cortical volume and area associations may be among the topographically broadest and most consistent effects so far seen as stable across the lifespan of the human brain. The three cohorts studies differ on a range features known to be highly and reliably related to cortical characteristics, first and foremost age<sup>2,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, but also country of origin and representativity of the populations from which they are drawn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Yet there is a comparable topography of BW effects across the samples. This is so despite the samples collectively spanning the entire human age range, within which there are always substantial age-related changes in cortical structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, 51–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. The present results thus indicate that fetal growth influences an offset of brain reserve <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and that this brain reserve effect is persistent and stable through the lifespan.</p>
<p>In contrast, the cortical maps capturing <italic>change</italic> in cortical structure associated with BW were not robust across datasets; i.e. the most positive and negative association with BW on cortical change did not overlap at all between the different cohorts. While there was evidence from ABCD that BW affected regional cortical development in the narrow age range covered, there were limited and no consistent effects of BW on cortical change across cohorts. Importantly, there was no indication whatsoever that BW could be associated with better brain maintenance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> in the face of age-related changes in older adulthood. Thus, the data seem to indicate that any effect of BW on cortical <italic>change</italic> may be of relatively more temporary nature. The “offset effect” of BW, on the other hand, appears persistent and consistent, especially in terms of stable and widespread effects on cortical area and volume across the lifespan.</p>
<p>The sensitivity analyses indicate that the associations between BW and cortical characteristics are seen irrespective of not only sex and age, but also education, head size (ICV), and cases of abnormal BW. Such patterns could point to an underlying genetic pleiotropy of BW and brain characteristics. Interestingly, however, recent findings indicate that effects of exposure to environmental adversity on epigenetic programing in aging may be localized to the in-utero period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. The effects of BW discordance in MZ twins in this context, align with other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> pointing to also non-genetic, that is environmental, influences in the womb, associated with the pattern observed for cortical area effects. These analyses also account for multiple possibly confounding variables that could represent a mix of genetic-environmental effects, such as parental socioeconomic status, parity, or prenatal exposures shared between twins in the same womb such as maternal smoking or use of alcohol.</p>
<p>The neural basis for the observed association cannot readily be ascertained from human imaging studies tracking change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. While the “fetal origins hypothesis”, proposing that cardiovascular disease in adulthood is related to undernourishment in utero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> is well-known, there has been focus on “brain-sparing” adaptations under such conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, our finding that early human development in utero appears to be associated with a persistent and stable brain reserve effect, is largely in correspondence with what is known of human nervous system development and change through the lifespan: While synaptogenesis, synaptic remodeling and myelination are known to be protracted processes long after infancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, numerous processes in brain development appear to be exclusively, or almost exclusively happening before birth. For instance, neurogenesis takes place almost only in fetal development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Even if controversies remain, evidence suggests that any adult human neurogenesis must be severely restricted in location and amount<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Thus, human beings appear to be born with almost all cortical neurons they will have through life, and neuronal migration and differentiation are also defined early, by the place and time the neuron is born during fetal life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Factors that affect placental function and uterine and/or umbilical blood flow on a chronic basis may lead to restricted fetal growth, including brain growth, and given the timing of brain development, it may not be surprising that effects would be stable across years. Animal studies of chronic placental insufficiency have shown effects on brain development which persist with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Hence, the relationship between BW and cortical characteristics in the normal population could likely have a twofold etiology: it is likely to in part be based on normal variation in genetically determined body and brain size, but it also may be based on variations in environmental prenatal conditions, yielding differences in optimality of early brain development persisting through the lifespan.</p>
<p>These results indicate that there is potential to increase brain reserve throughout the lifespan, also in aging, by combating factors affecting fetal growth negatively. While it is unknown to what extent results from these specific US and European samples can be generalized to other populations, the current potential to improve prenatal factors may be especially high in low and middle-income countries, where the demographic changes will also be more marked in terms of the aging population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. About 200 million children in developing countries are not meeting their growth potential, and improving the prenatal environment is likely important to help children reach their full potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> – and ultimately also to help them stay above a functional threshold into older age. Also in industrialized countries, including the US, environmental factors are associated with birth weight. The opioid epidemic is increasingly affecting pregnant women, and in-utero opioid exposure is associated with higher risk of fetal growth restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Among highly common exposures, air pollution may for instance be of relevance. Recently, local traffic congestion-pollution exposure during pregnancy, independently of a series of maternal sociodemographic characteristics, was associated with reductions in term BW in a large US sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Programs and policies to limit such environmental factors reducing fetal growth may thus enhance brain reserve and ultimately prevent more people from falling below a functional threshold even in advanced age.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Some limitations should be noted. First, for most of the participants, only self-reported or parent-reported BW was available. While there was a very high correlation between registry and self-reported BW in LCBC, this is a possible source of noise. Second, pregnancy-related information of possible relevance, such as gestational age at birth, complications, method of delivery, maternal disorders, smoking, alcohol and drug intake, was not available across all participants of the different samples, and was thus not analyzed here, or, as for gestational age at birth, could only in part be controlled for. Some of these factors may be systematically related to BW, and may thus represent confounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. There were some premature, and very low BW participants in the samples, and these conditions are associated with known reductions in cortical volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. However, the analyses controlling for gestational age, as well as on the restricted range of BW – excluding very preterm and very/extremely low BW children – and the analysis controlling for education, which may again relate to some of these factors, showed very similar results. It is unknown to what extent the BW of participants reflect their individual fetal growth potential, as a fetus with normal BW can be growth restricted and a fetus with low BW can have appropriate growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. We believe, however, that possible differences in such factors would likely serve to decrease consistency of results, and not lead to inflated estimates of consistency.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The current results show that a simple congenital marker of early developmental growth, BW, is consistently associated with lifespan brain characteristics. While some significant effects of BW on cortical change patterns were also observed, these were regionally smaller and showed no consistency across cohorts. In conclusion, while greater early human developmental growth does not appear to promote brain maintenance in aging, it does, in terms of greater cortical volume and area, relate positively to brain reserve through the lifespan. Thus, there appears to be an omnipresence of fetal factors in the spacetime of the human brain through the lifespan. This indicates a potential to increase brain reserve at all ages, including in aging, by combating factors affecting fetal growth negatively. Given the exceptional consistency and broadness of this cortical topographical effect, it should be taken into account in studies of brain research on individual differences, whether the brains studied are those of eight-or eighty-year-olds.</p>

<title>Samples</title>
<p>In total, longitudinal data for 5718 persons with 12088 MRI scans from the LCBC, ABCD and UKB studies were included in the analyses. For UKB the dataset released February 2020 was used. For ABCD, the Data Release 3.0 was used (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.15154/1528313">http://dx.doi.org/10.15154/1528313</ext-link> for this NDA study). Only persons with longitudinal MRI scans were included in the main analyses, to limit the possibility that estimates of change were biased by immediate sample selection effects (i.e. those that remain for follow-up are known to have other characteristics than those who have only one time-point assessment in longitudinal studies, and this can bias effects). However, for the separate MZ twin-analyses, we also included participants with only one time-point MRI, to obtain an age-varying sample for assessment of whether non-genetic effects were found throughout the lifespan, including in adulthood and older age. Of the 386 MZ twins included, 310 had longitudinal imaging data. The twins were mostly (n = 310) from the developmental ABCD sample (age 10-11), whereas 64 adults were from LCBC (age 18-79 years), and 12 were from UKB (age 50-80 years). All samples consisted of community-dwelling participants.</p>
<p>For the most part, these were recruited by means of some type of population registry information (see Supplementary Materials, SM), but part of the LCBC cohort consisted of convenience samples, i.e. the studies were advertised broadly. Part of the LCBC sample was recruited through the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, and the Norwegian Twin Registry (NTR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Thus, this study includes data from MoBa and NTR, and both studies are conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. LCBC participants were part of observational studies, but subsamples were part of studies including cognitive training (n = 168). As BW was not a criterion for assigning participants to cognitive training, these were included here. For the majority of participants, and all in UKB and ABCD, BW was collected as self-report or, for children, parent report, at the time of scan. For LCBC, BW was for the majority (n = 526 collected from the Medical Birth Registry (MBRN), available for those recruited through MoBa, or NTR, or if collected by consent for participants born 1967 and later, and in part by self-report in connection with scanning, or earlier self-report to the Norwegian Twin Registry (for twins recruited through this registry). MBRN is a national health registry containing information about all births in Norway. Comparative analyses in the LCBC sample for 354 persons who had available both MBRN records and self-report/parent-report of BW, showed a very high correlation of BW as obtained from the different sources (r =.99). A high reliability of self-reported BW over time has also been found in broader NTR samples <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> Demographics of the samples in the main analyses are given in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, see SM for details.</p>

<title>Cortical Vertex-wise Analyses</title>
<p>Reconstructed cortical surfaces were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 15 mm full-width at half-maximum. We ran vertex-wise analyses to assess regional variation in the relationships between birth weight and cortical structure; area, thickness and volume at baseline and longitudinally. In all models we included 1) baseline age, sex and scanner site, as well as time (scan interval) as covariates. For ABCD specifically, ethnicity was also included as a covariate, as this sample is recruited to have and has, ethnic variation (see Supplemental Methods for details), whereas the other samples entered in the present analyses had little ethnic variation (i.e. in UKB, &gt;98% of participants included in the present sample defined themselves as British/Irish/Any other white background. In LCBC, this information was unfortunately not encoded for all, but the sample was mainly of white background). In further models, we additionally included education as a covariate. General linear models were run in turn using as predictors: birth weight, the interaction term birthweight x scan interval, and the interaction term of baseline age x time (scan interval) x birth weight. When analyses were run with baseline age x scan interval x birth weight as predictor, the interaction terms of baseline age x scan interval, scan interval x birth weight, and birth weight x baseline age were included as additional covariates. Standardized values were used in analyses for age, scan interval, BW, BW discordance, and education. For consistency of multiple comparison corrections across analyses, the results were thresholded at a cluster-forming threshold of 2.0, p &lt; .01, with a cluster-wise probability of p &lt; .0.25 (p &lt;.05/2 hemispheres). Finally, models were rerun only including participants with birth weights between 2.5 and 5.0 kg, to assess whether relationships were upheld also when excluding low and high birthweights. Given previous findings of broad effects of BW on cortical area and volume <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, we did not expect effects to be localized. Rather, we expected BW to affect gross head and brain size irrespective of sex, but we also performed supplementary analyses controlling for intracranial volume (ICV) in order to check for possible specificity of effects. Spatial correlation analyses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> were run on the cortical maps (for more information see SI) for analyses results using BW as predictor, from LCBC, ABCD, and UKB, to assess the overlap of BW-cortical characteristics associations in terms of topography and effect sizes. In a separate set of analyses, we restricted the sample to only monozygotic twins, and studied effects of BW discordance (number of grams BW above or below MZ twin). In these models, we included time, baseline age, sex and site as covariates.</p>

<title>Population, Recruitment and General Description of Study/ Procedures</title>
<p>Cognitively healthy, community dwelling participants across the lifespan were drawn from studies coordinated by the Research Group for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition (LCBC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oslobrains.no">www.oslobrains.no</ext-link>), approved by a Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK South-East). Written informed consent was obtained from all adult participants and from parents or other legal guardians for participants below age of majority. The samples were recruited in part by newspaper and web page adds, and in part by population registry-based research studies. Part of the developmental sample was recruited through the population registry-based study MoBa, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study at The Norwegian Institute of Public Health <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/">https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/</ext-link> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) is a population-based pregnancy cohort study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Participants were recruited from all over Norway from 1999-2008. The establishment of MoBa and initial data collection was based on a license from the Norwegian Data Protection Agency and approval from The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics. The MoBa cohort is currently regulated by the Norwegian Health Registry Act. The current study was approved by The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK sør-øst C 2010/2359). Part of the adult sample was recruited through the Norwegian Twin Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fhi.no/en/more/health-studies/norwegian-twin-registry/">https://www.fhi.no/en/more/health-studies/norwegian-twin-registry/</ext-link> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. The current NTR sub-study was approved by The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK South-East C 2018/94). Both MoBa and NTR are linked to The Medical Birth Registry (MBRN), which is a national health registry containing information about all births in Norway. By individual consent, information on BW was also obtained from the MBRN also for some LCBC participants not being part of MoBa or NTR. Approval for these studies was given by The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK Sør-Øst B 2017/653). Most participants, including all children, were recruited for observational studies, while some adults were recruited to enter into cognitive training studies after baseline assessment.</p>

<title>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria/ Screening</title>
<p>Adult participants were screened using a standardized health interview prior to inclusion in the study. Participants with a history of self- or parent-reported neurological or psychiatric conditions, including clinically significant stroke, serious head injury, untreated hypertension, diabetes, and use of psychoactive drugs within the last two years, were excluded. Further, participants reporting worries concerning their cognitive status, including memory function, were excluded. Participants above 40 years scored &gt;26 on the Mini Mental State Examination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. Additionally, a generalized additive mixed model regressing area/thickness/volume nonlinear on age with random intercept per participant, was fitted independently at each of 163842 vertices. 60 observations were defined as outliers and excluded, as the absolute value of their residual was large than four times the residual standard error at more than 6000 vertices.</p>

<title>Variables Used for Birth weight and Education</title>
<p>When possible, by participant consent, birth weight was obtained from the records of the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN, for participants born 1967 when the Registry was started, or after). MBRN records of birth weight was obtained for at total 526 of the participants. For 15 participants, birth weight records based on historical self-report to the Norwegian Twin Registry were obtained. Otherwise, self-report, or for children, parental report, of birth weight in connection with participation in the MRI scanning studies were used. For analyses controlling for gestational length, only information from the MBRN was used. For education, if multiple values were reported across timepoints, the highest was chosen. Education was recorded as total years of education to the highest obtained degree, for adults, and for participants &lt; 20 years of age, average of parental education was used. However, for some participants in the age range up to 21.3 years at baseline scan, parental education was used, if no report of own education existed. Age was recorded in years and months at the time of the baseline MRI scan.</p>

<p>The primary aim of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://abcdstudy.org">https://abcdstudy.org</ext-link> is to track human brain development from childhood through adolescence to determine biological and environmental factors that impact or alter developmental trajectories <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. ABCD has recruited &gt; 10 000 9-10 years olds across 21 US sites with harmonized measures and procedures, including imaging acquisition <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://abcdstudy.org/scientists-workgroups.html">https://abcdstudy.org/scientists-workgroups.html</ext-link>. A goal of the ABCD study is that its sample should reflect, as best as possible, the sociodemographic variation of the US population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.

<title>Variables used for Birth Weight and Education</title>
<p>We used the fields devhx_2_birth_wt_lbs_p and devhx_2b_birth_wt_oz_p. These fields were converted to grams, and added together. If devhx_2b_birth_wt_oz_p was missing, it is set to 0, so that the only contribution came from devhx_2_birth_wt_lbs_p . If devhx_2_birth_wt_lbs_p was missing, the final birth weight value was set to NA, and hence the participant was excluded from analysis. In cases where birth weight was reported multiple times for one participant, and values deviated, participants were excluded from analysis if the discrepancy was greater than 10%, else the mean reported number was entered. For the analyses controlling for gestational length, we used the variable weeks_premature. Education was entered as the maximum education of the parents in years.</p>

<title>Assessment of consistency of effects across and within samples</title>
<p>We assessed the spatial relationship between birth weight cortical correlates (βeta-maps) for cortical area, volume, and thickness across the different datasets (LCBC, UKB, ABCD) using Pearson’s correlations. Permutation-based significance testing (n = 10.000, p &lt; 0.05, two-tailed, FDR-corrected) was performed using non-0 parametric spatial permutation models, i.e. spin tests as implemented by <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Briefly, spin-tests generate spatially-constrained null distributions by applying random rotations to spherical projections of the brain. For each permutation, the original values at each coordinate are replaced with those of the closest rotated coordinate. Rotations are generated in one hemisphere and mirrored in the other.</p>
<p>Within-sample replicability was assessed in two different ways, an exploratory and a confirmatory analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In the exploratory analysis, we assessed within-sample replicability by conducting the same vertex-wise cortical analysis in different subsamples. For each dataset and cortical measure, we assessed the effects of birth weight on cortical structure |N| = 500 times using 50% of the original sample (participants’ split half). Beyond sample selection, all parameters remained identical as described in the <italic>main</italic> analysis (refer to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Replicability – of a given vertex – was determined by the proportion of multiple comparison-corrected results across the different subsamples. In the confirmatory analysis, we assessed the proportion of significant vertices obtained in each <italic>exploratory</italic> (train) analysis that was also deemed significant – and in the same direction – in the remaining (test; 50%) subsample (p &lt; 0.05 uncorrected). Subsamples without significant results were not considered (no results only in cortical thickness analyses). This is a criterion often followed for determining replicability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.

<p>For each panel, the upper triangular matrix shows Pearson’s (r) pairwise spatial correlation between the different cohorts’ cortical maps. Data is shown as a color-density plot. The red line represents the fitting between the two maps. The lower triangular matrix shows the significance testing. The dashed-grey line shows the empirical correlation, while the orange histogram represents the null distribution based on the <italic>spin test</italic>. The diagonal shows the effect of birth weight on cortical structure (right hemisphere shown only). Note eta-maps are shown as a percentile red-green-blue scale, where red β represents a lower (or more negative) effect of birth weight on cortical structure and vice versa. See <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref> for stats. The different panels show the spatial correlation of birth weight effects on cortical a) area, b) thickness, and c) volume. Units in the density maps represent birth weight effects as mm/g, mm<sup>2</sup>/g, and mm<sup>3</sup>/g (10e-5) for cortical thickness, area, and volume, respectively.</p></caption>

<p>The degree of within-sample replicability was high for both area and volume but not for cortical thickness (see <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>) in the three datasets (LCBC, ABCD, and UKB). For area and volume, some vertices were fully replicable, i.e., significant results were found in this vertex regardless of sample variability. <italic>Exploratory</italic> replicability [median (interquartile range); LCBC, ABCD, UKB] was .46 (.56), .85 (.47), .89 (.43) for area, .36 (.47), .50 (.65), .79 (.68) for volume, and .008 (.04), .00 (.00), .002 (.02) for thickness. <italic>Exploratory</italic> replicability indexes for each voxel the proportion of significant results found using different |N| = 500 subsamples. The confirmatory replicability analyses also showed good replicability for area and volume but not for cortical thickness. Confirmatory replicability indexes the proportion of voxels (per analysis) that was significant both in the exploratory subsample (p &lt; 0.01, FWE-corrected) and in the test subsample (p &lt; 0.05). The proportion of vertices that were significant both in the <italic>exploratory</italic> and <italic>test</italic> subsamples was .74 (.17), .91 (.08), .93 (.08) for area, .68 (.19), .84 (.12), .92 (.09) for volume, and .28 (.28), .00 (.00), .58 (.18) for thickness. These results are not fully comparable to other studies assessing the replicability of brain-phenotype associations due to analytical differences (e.g. sample size, multiple-comparison correction method)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, yet clearly show that the rate of replicability of BW associations with cortical area and volume are comparable to benchmark brain-phenotype associations such as body-mass index and age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Lower levels of replicability in the LCBC subsample are likely attributed to higher sample variability (e.g. increased age span). Kinship may lead to inflated patterns of replicability within the ABCD cohort.</p>

<caption><title>The degree of within-sample replicability of birth weight effects on cortical structure for LCBC, ABCD, and UKB.</title>
<p>Brain images show the exploratory replicability analyses; i.e. the proportion of results (refer to Figure 1) that are significant across different subsamples (50% of the original sample; |N| = 500 subsamples). The overlay is thresholded at replicability (p) = .1. For visual purposes data has been up-sampled and smoothed (FWHM = 5) on fsaverage space. Left-side violin plots show the exploratory replicability; i.e., the proportion of significant results across the different subsamples (unit = voxel). Right-side plots show the confirmatory replicability; i.e. for each sample, the proportion of results (p &lt; 0.01; FWE-corrected) that also pass significance criteria (p &lt; 0.05) in a test subsample (|N| = 500 subsamples) (unit = analysis).

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study uses multiple large neuroimaging data sets acquired at different points through the lifespan to provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that birthweight (BW) is associated with robust and persistent variations in cortical anatomy, but less-substantial influences on cortical change over time. These findings, supported by robust statistical methods, illustrate the long temporal reach of early developmental influences and carry relevance for how we conceptualize, study, and potentially modify such influences more generally. The paper will be of interest to people interested in brain development and aging.</p>

<p>This manuscript uses 3 large neuroimaging datasets - which together span childhood to late adulthood - to model the relationship between birthweight (BW) and cortical anatomy over time. The authors separately consider BW associations with the &quot;height&quot; of cortical anatomy trajectories (intercept effects) vs. BW associations with trajectory shape. The authors also distinguish between BW associations with cortical surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT), which together determine cortical volume (CV). Prior studies have firmly established robust positive associations between BW and cortical SA, but this study adds evidence for the protracted lifespan persistence of these associations, and the degree to which BW associations with cortical change over time are much weaker.</p>
<p>The study has several strengths including: clear motivation of this work in the Introduction and contextualization of the results in Discussion; use of three large neuroimaging datasets; inclusion of sensible sensitivity analyses; disambiguation of SA and CT findings; and use of formal spatial analysis to quantify the reproducibility of effects across cohorts.</p>
<p>The primary way in which this work seeks to extend beyond established findings is to determine if BW is associated with differences in cortical change over time. The results presented clearly establish that such BW-change associations are much more localized and less consistent across cohorts that BW-intercept associations. However, the evidential basis for this statement is partly limited by the nature of the neuroimaging cohorts used and the specific approaches taken to statistical modeling. Interpretation of findings for both BW-change and BW-intercept associations would also be assisted by greater clarity regarding the specification of statistical models, and the provision of effect-size maps.</p>
<p>Moreover, several factors complicate interpretation of the BW effects on cortical change - which are arguably the main way in which this work could extend on established knowledge of BW associations with brain anatomy. Under the study design presented, inferences regarding age-varying BW effects come from two main sources ... age effects which are quantitatively modeled within each sample, and qualitative differences in age effects between samples. Any inferences from the latter source of evidence are weakened by the fact that (i) no direct statistical comparisons are conducted between samples (beyond the spin tests), and (ii) the composition of samples with regard to age span covered (e..g 2 in ABCD vs longer in UKB and longest in LCBC) and density of longitudinal data makes it hard to know if between-samples differences in age*BW effects are about biology or methodology. Inferences about age*BW effects from models within each sample are also limited by the fact that (i) some samples (ABCD) have very narrow age ranges precluding detection of age-related effects, and (ii) the modeling strategy used does not allow for non-linear interactions between age and BW or linear interactions that occur in the context of e.g. non-linear BW effects. For this last concern, it would be helpful to know that there is no evidence in the data for such non-linear effects</p>
<p>The tests for spatial consistency between BW effects are a valuable aspect of the manuscript and provide a solid quantitative test for the main effects of BW. For the reasons detailed above however, I think that the more variable (and sometimes negative) correlations in age*BW maps are harder to interpret. One could argue for example that bivariate spline models of age*BW interactions on a lifespan dataset assembled from different COMBAT-aligned cohorts would provide a more solid basis for inference regarding the degree to which BW effects on cortical anatomy vary with age</p>
<p>Overall, this work provides a valuable new data point in our understanding of the profound and protracted influences that prenatal developmental features can have on postnatal outcomes.</p>

<p>This study focuses on the association between weight at birth and area, volume and thickness of the cerebral cortex measured at timepoints throughout the lifespan. Overall, the study is well designed, and supported by evidence from a large sample drawn from three geographically distinct cohorts with robust analytical and statistical methods.</p>
<p>The authors test three hypotheses: (1) that higher birth weight is associated with greater cortical area in later life; (2) that associations are robust across samples and age; and (3) that associations are stable across the lifespan. Analyses are performed separately in three cohorts: ABCD, UKBB and LCBC and the pattern of associations compared by means of spatial correlations. They find that BW is positively associated with cortical area (and, as a consequence, cortical volume) across most of the cortex, with effect sizes being greatest in frontal and temporal regions. These associations remain largely unchanged when accounting for age, sex, length of gestation and (in one cohort) ethnicity. Variations due to MRI scanner and site are accounted for statistically. Measures are taken to determine within sample replicability through split-half analyses.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that BW, as a marker of early development, is consistently associated with brain characteristics throughout the lifespan, acting as an 'intercept' and promoting brain reserve, i.e.: the capacity of the brain to withstand aging effects. Indeed, the authors calculate that 600g lower BW results in reductions in cortical volume akin to 6-7 years of aging in middle to later life. This is perhaps a startling statistic but one that is not entirely supported by the data presented.</p>
<p>A key piece of information lacking from this study is the functional importance of the reported associations. That lower BW is associated with lower cortical volume and that cortical volume decreases with age is perhaps not surprising - the same could be said for height - one cannot conclude that the same processes underpin the two factors without examining the functional consequences of BW-related volume reductions in older age. The notion of 'brain reserve' indicates a protective effect. If this is the case, one might expect to see a mediating effect of BW on age-related cognitive effects. Without this data, it is difficult to reach the authors conclusions that decreased birthweight has the same effect as 7 years of aging in later life.</p>
<p>In addition, it is not clear to what degree the association between BW and cortical area/volume is simply reflecting overall somatic growth: brain mass scales with body height, and birth weight and length are associated with adult height. While the specificity of the associations between cortical area/volume and BW are not fully tested, the effects are significantly diminished when controlling for a related measure of somatic growth: intracranial volume (Fig S5). In this context, additional commentary on the specificity of the reported BW-brain associations (or lack thereof) would be helpful.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors use linear models to model brain area, thickness and volume as a function of age. The authors' previous studies have demonstrated nonlinear trajectories of cortical thickness in the LCBC cohort across most of the cortex. A stronger rationale (e.g.: theoretical or model selection) supporting the use of GLM in this study would be more compelling.</p>

<body>
<p>First, we would like to thank eLife and the reviewers for the positive assessment of our manuscript and for providing the medium to expand the scientific dialogue on the present study. We greatly appreciate the reviewers´ assessment and will revise the manuscript considering their input. Please see our provisional response below.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1’s main concern is centered on the evidential strength of the study’s conclusion that age-specific effects of birth weight on brain structure are more localized and less consistent across cohorts than age-uniform, stable effects. More specifically, the reviewer points out the evidence (or lack of such) for age-specific effects. The reviewer specifies four methodological concerns: that #1 no direct statistical comparisons are conducted between samples (beyond the spin-tests) and that #2 the differential composition of samples in terms of age distribution leads to the possibility that lack of results is explained by methodological differences. Further, he/she adds that #3 some datasets have a narrow age range precluding detection of age-related effects and #4 that the modeling strategy does not allow for non-linear interaction between age and BW suggesting the use of spline models instead in a _mega-_analytical fashion. Reviewer #1 also asks for greater clarity regarding the statistical models and the provision of effect-size maps.</p>
<p>As a response to the reviewer’s comments, we will submit a revised version of the manuscript with a revised description of the statistical models and submit effect-size maps in an accompanying repository. We will tackle the first two concerns by performing additional statistical analyses. The planned analyses will include across-sample reliability and within-sample reliability for the <italic>time*birth weight</italic> analyses. These analyses will address the concerns that the lack of age-specific effects is due to sample differences rather than a lack of biological effects (#2) and provide further explicit statistical comparisons across samples (#1).</p>
<p>We do not believe concern #3 is critically problematic since <italic>time*birth weight</italic> refers to a within-subject contrast, e.g. longitudinal-only based contrast. Birth weight, even when self-reported is a highly reliable measure and the sample sizes are relatively large (n = 635, 1759, and 3324 unique individuals). Note that the smaller dataset does have longer follow-up times and more observations per participant increasing the reliability of estimations in individual change. Structural MRI measures have very high reliability (often ICC &gt; .95). Clearly, longitudinal brain change is less reliable, yet the present sample size and the high reliability of birth weight should provide enough statistical power to capture even small time-varying effects of birth weight on brain structure.</p>
<p>We agree that some - if not most - brain structures follow non-linear trajectories throughout life (#4). In the present study, age regressors are used only for accounting for variance in the data rather than capturing any effect of interest. Rather, it is the <italic>time*birth weight</italic> regressor that captures age-varying changes in brain structure. <italic>Time</italic> reflects within-subject follow-up time. In any case, the inclusion of non-linear regressors is superfluous in ABCD given the small age range and will not  regress out additional variance. Likewise, published data on UKB has shown that most age trajectories of cortical data follow grossly linear fits (age range in the UKB: 45 – 85 years). In LCBC, however, we recognize that non-linear modeling may be able to capture additional variance since it is a lifespan dataset. This may provide better estimates for <italic>birth weight</italic> and <italic>time*birth weight</italic> though it is unlikely that it has a big effect on the <italic>slope</italic>. In any case, #4 is a valid concern and we will repeat the main analysis using «spline models to fit age We will not follow the reviewer's suggestion for a <italic>mega-analytical</italic> approach. It is a valid approach, but it is best suited to other configurations of data than those used here where we used longitudinal data only. The use of cross-sectional data for deriving differential age trajectories is also not without problems.</p>
<p>We see Reviewer #2´s  concerns mainly being: #1 The translation of birth-weight effects on brain volume to years of aging is inadequate and not fully supported by the data. #2 Lack of data regarding the functional relevance of brain weight effects on brain structure; suggesting the inclusion of cognitive data and (birth weight – brain structure – cognition) mediation analyses. #3 The degree to which the association between birth weight and cortical area/volume is explained by overall somatic growth. #4 The lack of non-linear regressors for fitting age.</p>
<p>#1 We will modify the section on translation of birth weight effects into years of aging. While it is often used - see for example the literature on brain age - and is relatable, it can be easily misinterpreted and does not reflect any objective measure of effect size. #2 The degree to which birth weight relates to cognition throughout the lifespan through individual variations in brain structure is a key question in the field for which currently we only have indirect evidence. Unfortunately, the study of this triple relationship is out of the scope of the current study. This, we agree with the reviewer, warrants further research. We disagree, however, in that mediation analyses are able to provide a satisfactory answer to this question. Also, we believe that the conclusions of the present study are not affected by the omission of cognitive data beyond what has been commented on in #1. The relationship between birth weight, structure, and cognition will be further discussed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>#3 Indeed, part of birth weight effects on brain structure can be explained by overall somatic growth. This study does not provide - and is not designed to provide - a specific mechanism for which birth weight is associated with brain structure. Yet, research has also shown that differences in birth weight partially reflect factors associated with variations in neurodevelopmental processes in gestation. Mechanisms are thought to be partially genetic (including geneticly influenced potential for somatic growth) and partially environmental prenatal influences. The amount of variance explained by such mechanisms is unknown and may differ across samples (e.g. population samples vs. monozygotic twins). In our view, the association is no less meaningful if mostly attributed to somatic growth if it is associated with partly modifiable variance in brain growth. The revised manuscript will include further considerations on the possible mechanisms explaining the association between birth weight and cortical structure throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>Concern #4 is equivalent to Reviewer #1, concern #4. In short, the age regressor is used only to account for variance. Linear modeling in the ABCD and UKB datasets has been shown to fit relatively well the different cortical regions due to the samples’ narrow age range. In LCBC, however, we recognize that non-linear modeling may be able to capture additional variance since it is a lifespan dataset. This may provide better estimates for <italic>birth weight</italic> and <italic>time*birth weight</italic> though it is unlikely that has a big effect on the <italic>slope</italic> of the effects. We will repeat the main analysis using «spline models to fit age.</p>
