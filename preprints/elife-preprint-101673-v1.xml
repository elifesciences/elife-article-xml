<title>Abstract</title><p>Filopodia are dynamic adhesive cytoskeletal structures that are critical for directional sensing, polarization, cell-cell adhesion, and migration of diverse cell types. Filopodia are also critical for neuronal synapse formation. While dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is known to be critical for filopodia biogenesis, little is known about the upstream extracellular signals. Here, we identify secreted exosomes as potent regulators of filopodia formation. Inhibition of exosome secretion inhibited the formation and stabilization of filopodia in both cancer cells and neurons and inhibited subsequent synapse formation by neurons. Rescue experiments with purified small and large extracellular vesicles (EVs) identified exosome-enriched small EVs (SEVs) as having potent filopodia-inducing activity. Proteomic analyses of cancer cell-derived SEVs identified the TGF-β family coreceptor endoglin as a key SEV-enriched cargo that regulates filopodia. Cancer cell endoglin levels also affected filopodia-dependent behaviors, including metastasis of cancer cells in chick embryos and 3D migration in collagen gels. As neurons do not express endoglin, we performed a second proteomics experiment to identify SEV cargoes regulated by endoglin that might promote filopodia in both cell types. We discovered a single SEV cargo that was altered in endoglin-KD cancer SEVs, the transmembrane protein Thrombospondin Type 1 Domain Containing 7A (THSD7A). We further found that both cancer cell and neuronal SEVs carry THSD7A and that add-back of purified THSD7A is sufficient to rescue filopodia defects of both endoglin-KD cancer cells and exosome-inhibited neurons. We also find that THSD7A induces filopodia formation through activation of the Rho GTPase, Cdc42. These findings suggest a new model for filopodia formation, triggered by exosomes carrying THSD7A.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is critical for cell shape changes, elaboration of specialized cell structures, and cell movement. Thin actin-rich structures called filopodia are used for directional sensing and making initial contacts between neighboring cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In migrating cells, filopodia protrude from the leading edge of the cell to promote cell polarization and facilitate adhesion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Filopodia are also important for establishing cell contacts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In neurons, filopodia initiate synapse formation by contacting the axon of neighboring neurons and then develop into specialized postsynaptic structures called dendritic spines that are important for learning and memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Filopodia have also been shown to contribute to invasive cancer cell behaviors, including metastasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Several different mechanisms have been described to promote filopodia formation, including direct nucleation of unbranched actin filaments by formins and other nucleators and reorganization of branched cortical actin filaments followed by actin polymerization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Additional actin regulatory proteins promote uncapping of the barbed ends, elongation and bundling of actin filaments. These actin regulatory proteins are controlled upstream by phosphatidylinositols, especially PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3, and PI(3,4)P2, and Rho GTPases, particularly Cdc42 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Myosin-X may further promote filopodia maintenance by transporting and/or organizing cytoskeletal and adhesion molecules at filopodia tips <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While the intracellular cytoskeletal machinery that drives filopodia formation has been heavily studied, there is little known about the extracellular cues that activate that machinery. Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) have been shown to regulate filopodia in endothelial cells, myoblasts, and neurons, often through activation of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. VEGFA has also been shown to promote endothelial sprouting and filopodia formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. In neurons, a variety of extracellular molecules have been shown to regulate filopodia formation and dynamics, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, Slit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, Netrin-1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and nerve growth factor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Filopodia formation has also been shown to be influenced in tumor cells by TGF-β signaling-induced alterations in gene expression, specifically upregulation of fascin protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. While these studies have identified some extracellular regulators of filopodia formation, the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood and some are indirect, via inducing gene expression changes in cytoskeletal components.</p>
<p>Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are formed within multivesicular late endosomes (MVEs) and released into the extracellular space by fusion of MVEs with the plasma membrane. Exosomes carry bioactive cargoes, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids and promote autocrine and paracrine cell communication across a variety of systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Notably, exosomes have been shown to promote polarization and motility of multiple cell types, including cancer cells, immune cells, and single-celled amoebae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Exosomes also play a key role in metastasis by seeding metastatic niches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In previous studies, we found that exosome secretion is critical for the formation of two motility-related actin cytoskeletal structures: invadopodia and nascent cell-matrix adhesions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In our live imaging studies, we also frequently observed filopodia formation in close proximity to sites of exosome secretion and adhesion formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Here, we directly investigate the role of exosomes in filopodia formation and stability. In both cancer cells and primary rat neurons, we find that genetic inhibition of exosome biogenesis or secretion inhibits filopodia formation and stability. In neurons, the reduction of filopodia was accompanied by a decrease in dendritic spines and synapses, which are structures that develop from filopodia. Filopodial defects of exosome-inhibited cells were fully rescued by the add-back of purified small EVs (SEVs, containing exosomes) but not larger ectosome-type EVs (LEVs). Proteomic comparison of SEVs and LEVs purified from melanoma cells identified the TGF-β co-receptor endoglin as a cargo that is unique to the SEV fraction. Endoglin was found to promote filopodia formation by cancer cells, as well as the filopodia-dependent behaviors of cancer cell metastasis and 3D motility. A quantitative proteomic comparison of exosomes purified from control and endoglin-KD melanoma cells revealed that the filopodia regulatory transmembrane molecule thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 7A (THSD7A) is reduced in endoglin-KD exosomes. Further investigation revealed that THSD7A is present on both cancer cell and neuronal exosomes and that recombinant purified THSD7A is sufficient to rescue filopodia defects resulting from exosome inhibition in both cell types. THSD7A-induced filopodia formation was diminished in the presence of a chemical inhibitor of the small GTPase Cdc42. Altogether, we find that exosomes drive filopodia formation in multiple cell types by carrying the filopodia regulator THSD7A.</p>

<title>Exosome markers localize to filopodia</title>
<p>To visualize exosome association with cytoskeletal structures, we stained for CD63 in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, which form numerous filopodia. The cells were fixed and co-stained with phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 488 to visualize filamentous actin (F-actin) in filopodia. Confocal images of the cells show localization of CD63 puncta at the tips of filopodia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, arrowheads). To observe the dynamic relationship between exosome secretion and filopodia formation, we utilized a live cell reporter that allows us to dynamically visualize the fusion of MVE with the plasma membrane, pHluorin-M153R-CD63-mScarlet <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. pHluorin is a pH-sensitive form of GFP that is non-fluorescent at acidic pH inside late endosomes and fluoresces at neutral pH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, such as occurs upon endosome-plasma membrane fusion, whereas mScarlet is a pH-insensitive red fluorescent protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and can report on MVE movements within the cell. Using this probe stably expressed in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, we observed localization of MVEs at (red signal) and fusion with (yellow puncta) the plasma membrane immediately before or coincident with filopodia initiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Supplemental Movie 1). Quantitative analysis of the timing of yellow fluorescence appearance at the plasma membrane revealed that exosome secretion occurred with a median time of 20 seconds before filopodia formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). We also examined the localization of MVE markers to filopodia in primary cortical neurons by transiently transfecting neurons with the MVE docking factor GFP-Rab27b <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> along with mCherry as a filler to visualize neuronal structures. Notably, GFP-Rab27b localized to both the base and tips of neuronal filopodia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E,F</xref>), with more localized to the base than to the tips (63% vs. 37%, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Together, both the cancer cell and neuron data suggest an association of MVEs and exosomes with filopodia.</p>

<title>Exosomes promote filopodia formation and stability in cancer cells</title>
<p>To directly test whether exosomes affect filopodia formation and/or stability, shRNA targeting Rab27a or Hrs was expressed in B16F1 melanoma cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A,B</xref>), a frequently used cell line for studying filopodia, and shRNA targeting Rab27a was expressed in HT1080 cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). Rab27a is a key factor controlling MVE docking at the plasma membrane, which allows intraluminal vesicles to be secreted as exosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. The ESCRT-0 protein Hrs plays an important role in the biogenesis of intraluminal vesicles within MVEs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. The exosome-enriched small EV (SEV) population was isolated by cushion density gradient ultracentrifugation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, after isolation of large EVs by differential centrifugation from conditioned media (see methods). Consistent with current standards in the field <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, the EVs carried typical EV markers and were of the expected size and morphology by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and negative stain transmission electron microscopy (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C-E</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B,C</xref>). Quantitation by NTA of EVs isolated from conditioned media confirmed that B16F1 Rab27a- and Hrs-knockdown (KD) cells secrete fewer SEVs compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Consistent with a selective effect on MVE docking and biogenesis, these constructs had no effect on secretion of LEVs, which should contain primarily shed ectosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Phalloidin staining of actin filaments in Rab27a- and Hrs-KD B16F1 cells revealed reduced numbers of filopodia compared with control B16F1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,C</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of exosome secretion by Rab27a KD in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells also led to a decrease in filopodia numbers (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D,E</xref>). Consistent with a specific role for exosomes in controlling filopodia dynamics, the addition of SEVs purified from control B16F1 cells to Hrs-KD B16F1 cells rescued the defect in filopodia numbers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,E</xref>). By contrast, there was no effect of LEVs on filopodia numbers. The addition of SEVs to B16F1 shScr control cells also increased filopodia number in a dose-dependent manner, while LEVs had no effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>

<title>Exosomes promote filopodia and synapse formation in neurons</title>
<p>In neurons, filopodia formation is critical for the subsequent development of synapses as filopodia mature into postsynaptic specializations called dendritic spines. In primary rat neuron cultures, numerous filopodia are present on dendritic shafts at day <italic>in vitro</italic> (<italic>DIV)</italic>6 while dendritic spines are predominant around <italic>DIV</italic>12. To test whether exosomes control filopodia in neurons, we altered expression of exosome regulators in primary rat hippocampal and cortical neurons. Since Rab27b is the predominant form of Rab27 protein present in the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> we overexpressed Rab27b in primary neurons. Cortical neurons overexpressing GFP-Rab27b exhibited a significant increase in the number of filopodia examined at <italic>DIV</italic>6, quantitated as thin protrusions that were negative for the synapse marker SV2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). This increase in filopodia density translated into an increased number of SV2-positive dendritic spines and synapses at DIV12 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). A similar increase in filopodia, spine, and synapse density occurred in primary hippocampal neurons upon GFP-Rab27b expression (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A,B</xref>).</p>

<p>To inhibit exosome secretion in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons, we knocked down Hrs or Rab27b by transient transfection of two different shRNAs along with mCerulean at least 48 hours prior to immunostaining. For both genes, shRNA-transfected neurons (recognized by mCerulean co-transfection) exhibited 40-60% reduction in protein expression analyzed by fluorescence intensity, compared to cells transfected with nontargeting shRNA (NTshRNA, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A-D</xref>). Analysis of immunostained cells revealed that loss of either Rab27b or Hrs in KD neurons led to a significant reduction in filopodia, spines, and synapse density compared to NTshRNA controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-H</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3C-F</xref>). To further confirm that the effect of gene KD on filopodia density was due to loss of exosome release, we performed rescue experiments by treating Rab27b- or Hrs-KD primary cortical neurons for 24 hrs with SEVs isolated by differential centrifugation from <italic>DIV</italic>9 primary cortical neurons (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E-G</xref>). LEVs were not tested due to the low recovery of LEVs from neuronal conditioned media. The dose of 200 SEVs per neuron was chosen based on the estimated SEV secretion rate from primary cortical neurons over the 24 h time period of the assay. In the Rab27b-KD condition, SEV treatment fully rescued the filopodia number defects of untreated KD controls (Figs. S4H and 3I). For Hrs-KD condition, there was partial rescue in filopodia density upon SEV treatment (Figs. S4I and 3J). These data indicate that - similar to cancer cells - endogenous exosomes secreted by neurons promote filopodia formation.</p>

<title>Endoglin is an SEV cargo that promotes filopodia formation in cancer cells</title>
<p>EVs carry multiple bioactive protein cargoes. Because only SEVs but not LEVs were able to rescue or induce filopodia numbers in B16F1 melanoma cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), we identified unique SEV cargoes by running SEV and LEV lysates on an SDS-PAGE gel, staining it with colloidal Coomassie, extracting 4 bands that were enriched in the SEV lysates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, arrowheads) and performing proteomic analysis of trypsin digests of the extracted protein bands.

<p>Endoglin is a TGF-β co-receptor that regulates multiple processes relevant to motility and filopodia, including cellular signaling, adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. To test whether endoglin regulates filopodia formation, we stably expressed endoglin-targeting shRNAs in B16F1 melanoma cells and confirmed that endoglin levels are reduced in both SEVs and cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Compared with control cells, stable endoglin-KD cells exhibit a reduction in filopodia number (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D,E</xref>) but no significant effect on SEV release from cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A,B</xref>). Likewise, transient KD of endoglin in B16F1 cells also leads to a significant reduction in filopodia numbers (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C,D</xref>). Whereas the addition of LEVs to stable endoglin-KD cells has little effect on filopodia numbers, treatment with control SEVs fully rescues the filopodia number defects of endoglin-KD cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D,E</xref>). Consistent with endoglin being a key SEV cargo that controls filopodia, add-back of endoglin-KD SEVs does not rescue the filopodia defects of endoglin-KD cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Furthermore, control - but not endoglin-KD - SEVs also rescue filopodia defects of exosome-inhibited B16F1 Hrs-KD cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5E</xref>). To determine whether endoglin selectively controls filopodia formation or stability, we performed live imaging of endoglin-KD B16F1 cells. We found a specific defect of endoglin-KD cells in de novo filopodia formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>) with no change in filopodia lifetime (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>, see also Supplemental Movie 3). These data suggest that endoglin specifically affects filopodia formation whereas additional exosome cargoes may affect filopodia lifetime, since Hrs-KD cells had a defect in both filopodia formation and lifetime (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G,H</xref>). Finally, we assessed the role of endoglin in filopodia formation in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. Similar to B16F1 cells, KD of endoglin in HT1080 cells reduced filopodia numbers (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A-E</xref>). These data suggest that endoglin and/or endoglin-regulated cargoes carried by exosomes have important functions in controlling filopodia dynamics.</p>

<p>To determine whether alterations in exosomes were responsible for the effect of endoglin <italic>in vivo,</italic> we tested whether coinjection of SEVs with the cells could rescue the metastatic defects of endoglin-KD cells. The number of SEVs that were injected with cells was determined using the estimated SEV secretion rate calculated from nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) data of 9.28 SEVs per cell per hour for HT1080 control cells. Since the chick CAM experiment was conducted over a period of 96 hours, and each injection contained 100,000 cells, we used 89 million SEVs per injection. Indeed, coinjection of SEVs led to a full rescue of the endoglin-KD phenotype, both increasing the number of metastatic colonies and decreasing the number of large colonies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the known role of filopodia in directed cell migration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and the presence of large, potentially nonmotile, colonies formed by endoglin-KD cells in the chick CAM, we hypothesized that endoglin-KD cells would have a defect in cellular migration.

Movies were taken to observe and quantitate cell migration away from the spheroids (Supplemental Movie 4). Comparison of the spheroid area increase after 8 h, including migration of individual cells away from the spheroids, revealed that endoglin-KD cells indeed have a defect in 3D cell migration compared to controls.

<title>Endoglin controls levels of the filopodia regulator THSD7A in cancer cell SEVs</title>
<p>Endoglin is not expressed in neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>; therefore, it could not be a universal filopodia regulator. In addition, as a TGFβ coreceptor, it is difficult to imagine how endoglin as an EV cargo could directly induce filopodia formation by recipient cells. However, endoglin interacts with numerous proteins, including TGFβ receptors Alk1 and Alk5, TGFβ family ligand BMP9, and α5β1 integrin, and could potentially alter their sorting into exosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Thus, we hypothesized that endoglin could promote filopodia formation by carrying a key filopodia-inducing cargo into exosomes. Surprisingly, Western blot analysis of control and endoglin-KD SEVs did not reveal reductions in several candidate endoglin binding partners in KD SEVs, including TGF-β1, Alk1, or β1 integrin (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>). As BMP9 is the only TGFβ family member reported to directly bind to endoglin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, we also tested whether BMP9 could affect filopodia formation. Contrary to expectation, purified BMP9 did not rescue the defect in filopodia formation by endoglin-KD cells and instead decreased filopodia numbers in control shScr cells (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B</xref>). We also tested whether the addition of TGF-β or coating the culture surfaces with fibronectin might rescue the filopodial defect of endoglin-KD cells. While both of those ligands slightly enhanced the number of filopodia in control cells, there was no effect on endoglin-KD cells (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7C,D</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether endoglin may regulate the transport of any novel proteins into exosomes, we performed a quantitative proteomic comparison between SEVs purified from control and endoglin-KD B16F1 cells. Equal amounts of protein extracted from the SEVs were subjected to isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and mass spectrometry analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Consistent with our Western blot results (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>), the proteomics data showed no significant differences in the expression of any integrins or TGFβ family ligands or receptors (Supplemental Table 2). Analysis of the data further revealed only 2 proteins that were significantly lower in both endoglin KD1 and KD2 samples compared to control samples (Supplemental Table 2), endoglin and the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 7a protein (THSD7A).</p>
<p>THSD7A is a transmembrane protein that is known to be expressed in endothelial cells, neurons, and kidney podocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. Interestingly, although little is known about this protein, a soluble form of THSD7A was reported to promote filopodia formation in endothelial cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Additionally, THSD7A has been shown to be aberrantly expressed in a variety of cancers and autoantibodies against THSD7A are a frequent cause of a paraneoplastic autoimmune kidney disease, secondary membranous nephropathy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Autoantibodies against THSD7A are also a cause of idiopathic (primary) membranous nephropathy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To validate our finding that THSD7A levels are downregulated in SEVs from endoglin-KD cancer cells, we performed Western blot analysis of control and endoglin-KD SEVs from B16F1 and HT1080 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). Detection of THSD7A in B16F1 SEVs necessitated using native gels and thus endoglin and SEV marker CD63 ran at a significantly higher molecular weight (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Indeed, THSD7A was present on control SEVs and was reduced on endoglin-KD SEVs purified from either cell line.

<p>To test whether THSD7A regulates filopodia formation in our system, we overexpressed THSD7A tagged with mScarlet fluorescent protein in HT1080 cells. THSD7A-mScarlet localized to the tips of filopodia as well as in extracellular deposits similar to those we have previously observed with exosomes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>). Notably, expression of THSD7A-mScarlet increased filopodia numbers in HT1080 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, graph). To further test the role of THSD7A in filopodia formation, we knocked down THSD7A in HT1080 cells using 3 different targeting shRNAs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Analysis of filopodia numbers revealed a significant reduction in THSD7A-KD cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). To determine the role of THSD7A in filopodia regulation by endoglin, we plated control and endoglin-KD cells on coverslips coated with various concentrations of recombinant THSD7A protein. Indeed, recombinant human THSD7A fully rescued the filopodia defects of endoglin-KD for both HT1080 and B16F1 melanoma cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>Our typical filopodia analysis is performed after culturing cells for 48 h on coverslips. To determine whether THSD7A can boost filopodia formation in a short time period as would be expected for a direct regulator, we plated cells on coverslips coated with poly-D-Lysine or recombinant THSD7A for 15 min-2 h and found that recombinant THSD7A fully rescued the filopodia defect of endoglin-KD cells at the shortest timepoint of 15 min (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7E</xref>).</p>
<p>Although neurons do not express endoglin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, they do rely on exosomes for filopodia induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and they express THSD7A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>). To test the role of THSD7A in neuronal filopodia formation, we transiently expressed FLAG-tagged THSD7A in cortical neurons.

In addition, plating exosome-inhibited Hrs-KD neurons on recombinant THSD7A-coated coverslips fully rescued filopodia formation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>).

<title>Endoglin regulates THSD7A trafficking into cancer cell exosomes</title>
<p>Based on the observed decreases in THSD7A expression in SEVs from endoglin-KD cancer cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A,B</xref>) and the role of endoglin as a co-receptor that traffics through endosomes, we hypothesized that endoglin may alter the trafficking of THSD7A to SEVs/exosomes. To test this hypothesis, we first investigated the relative abundance of THSD7A in control and endoglin-KD HT1080 cells and SEVs by Western blot analysis. Indeed, lysates of endoglin-KD cells had increased levels of THSD7A compared to control cells, while endoglin KD SEVs had decreased levels of THSD7A (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-C</xref>). These data are consistent with an alteration in THSD7A trafficking in endoglin-KD cells rather than a decrease in the overall protein expression of THSD7A. We performed a rescue experiment, in which endoglin-KD cells were stably transfected with either wild-type endoglin (+WT) or an empty vector control (+vector). Interestingly, we found that the high cellular levels of THSD7A in endoglin-KD cells were decreased with re-expression of WT endoglin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-C</xref>). These changes were paralleled by increased THSD7A in +WT endoglin rescue SEVs. In parallel, expression of WT endoglin in HT1080 endoglin KD cells also rescues filopodia defects (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether endoglin might affect the trafficking of THSD7A to MVE, we expressed THSD7A-mScarlet in control and endoglin-KD HT1080 cells and co-stained with an anti-CD63 antibody to label MVEs as well as with phalloidin to visualize the cell boundary (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). Consistent with less THSD7A being secreted in EVs, there was much less extracellular THSD7A surrounding endoglin-KD cells compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>, Zoom 1). In addition, we observed increased accumulation of THSD7A in CD63-positive MVE in endoglin-KD cells compared to control cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>, Zoom 2). Thus, the percentage of intracellular THSD7A colocalized with CD63-positive compartments was increased in KD cells compared with control cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>), suggesting increased accumulation in endolysosomal compartments. These data suggest that endoglin alters the endolysosomal trafficking of THSD7A, leading to decreased THSD7A release in exosomes.</p>

<title>Cdc42 activity is required for filopodia induction by THSD7A and endoglin</title>
<p>Finally, we sought to identify downstream signaling pathways responsible for modulating filopodia dynamics via exosomal endoglin and THSD7A. To assess any changes in TGFβ signaling, we assayed for downstream Smad phosphorylation and did not detect any increases from treatment with rhTHSD7A coating (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7F</xref>). Because the small GTPase Cdc42 has been shown to regulate filopodia across diverse cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that THSD7A and endoglin might induce filopodia formation via Cdc42 activation. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether filopodia induced by THSD7A could be inhibited with a specific Cdc42 inhibitor or, conversely, whether expressing a constitutively active form of Cdc42 could rescue the filopodia defects of endoglin-KD cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). The Q61L mutant of Cdc42 (Cdc42-Q61L) is a dominant active, GTPase-defective, GTP-bound form of Cdc42 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. ML141 has been identified as a non-competitive inhibitor of Cdc42 and effectively inhibits Cdc42-Q61L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. Consistent with a role for Cdc42 activation in basal filopodia formation by our cells, we found that treatment of control HT1080 cells with the ML141 inhibitor significantly reduces filopodia numbers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Likewise, the rescue of filopodia numbers that occurs when endoglin-KD cells are seeded on THSD7A-coated coverslips is ablated when combined with ML141 treatment (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). In addition, the filopodia defect of endoglin-KD cells is rescued by expression of Cdc42-Q61L. The filopodia induction by Cdc42-Q61L in HT1080 endoglin-KD cells was inhibited by ML141, confirming that ML141 acts to inhibit Cdc42 at the doses and times used (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>).</p>

<p>A. Control and endoglin-KD HT1080 cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine (PDL) or THSD7A. In some cases, cells were treated with the Cdc42 inhibitor ML141 (10 µM) or transfected with the dominant active Cdc42 mutant Q61L, as indicated. N=3, ≥ 20 cells per condition per rep. Error bars, SEM. ns, not significant; * p&lt;0.05; ** p&lt;0.01; *** p&lt;0.001. B. In tumor cells, endoglin and THSD7A are trafficked into intralumenal vesicles (ILV) in multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) for secretion. Inhibiting the exosome biogenesis pathway by blocking Hrs or inhibiting MVE docking by blocking Rab27a subsequently reduces exosome secretion and filopodia formation. SEVs carrying THSD7A can induce filopodia on target cells via Cdc42, leading to increased cell motility and metastasis. When endoglin levels are lowered (such as by KD), THSD7A is retained inside cells in CD63-positive endosomes and its levels in SEVs are greatly decreased. The drop in THSD7A levels in endoglin-KD EVs could be due either to a lack of trafficking into ILVs or, alternatively, the promotion of lysosomal degradation of THSD7A-containing MVEs. The cartoon was created using BioRender. C. In primary neurons, exosome biogenesis is controlled by formation of ILVs by Hrs and MVE docking is controlled by Rab27b. Knockdown of either of these proteins results in reduced formation of filopodia, dendritic spines, and synapses in both cortical and hippocampal neurons. Similar to cancer cells, THSD7A is carried in neuronal SEVs and induces filopodia. The cartoon was created using BioRender.</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Filopodia are adhesive cellular structures that control cell polarization, chemical and physical sensing, and motility. Using a genetic inhibition and rescue approach, we found that autocrine secretion of exosomes controls the number and stability of filopodia in both cancer cells and neurons. The decrease in filopodia in neurons was paralleled by a similar decrease in synapse formation. In cancer cells, we identified endoglin as a key SEV cargo and molecular regulator of this process, controlling filopodia formation, cell migration, and metastasis of cancer cells via SEVs. As endoglin seemed unlikely to directly induce filopodia formation and is not present in neurons, we performed quantitative proteomics of control and endoglin-KD SEVs and identified the transmembrane ECM protein THSD7A as regulated in cancer cell SEVs by endoglin. In neurons, THSD7A was also present on SEVs and regulated filopodia formation. Indeed, purified THSD7A was able to rescue filopodia defects in both endoglin-KD cancer cells and exosome-inhibited neurons. Finally, we found that Cdc42 activity is important for filopodia formation controlled by endoglin and THSD7A. Altogether, we identify THSD7A carried by exosomes as a key controller of filopodia formation in diverse cell types and further identify endoglin as a key regulator of THSD7A secretion in exosomes in cancer cells. These data suggest a new model for filopodia induction via secreted exosomes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B,C</xref>).</p>
<p>Exosomes have been shown to regulate cell migration and invasion in a variety of contexts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In order for cells to migrate, they must form adhesive and sensing cytoskeletal structures, including lamellipodia, focal complexes, invadopodia, and filopodia. Our finding that exosomes promote filopodia formation adds to our previous findings that exosome secretion promotes the formation of nascent adhesions and invadopodia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> and likely stabilizes lamellipodia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. While some of these activities are likely related, the filopodia activity appears to be distinct. Indeed, while we previously found that fibronectin was a critical exosome cargo driving nascent adhesion formation, lamellipodia stabilization, and cell speed in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>, fibronectin was unable to rescue the filopodia defect of endoglin-KD HT1080 cells in this study (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7D</xref>). Instead, THSD7A was identified as a distinct exosome cargo that specifically promotes <italic>de novo</italic> filopodia formation in HT1080 and other cell types and rescued defects of exosome-inhibited cells in filopodia formation. Thus, multiple exosome cargoes contribute to diverse aspects of cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration.</p>
<p>Filopodia are important for directional sensing, directional migration, and cell-cell contact formation in a variety of cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In cancer, filopodia formation is associated with aggressive behavior and cancer metastasis. Indeed, we found that endoglin-KD cancer cells had defects in not only filopodia formation but also in 3D migration and metastasis to chick embryo chorioallantoic membranes. In neurons, inhibition of exosome secretion reduced both filopodia and synapse formation. Thus, in two very different cell types, exosomes regulate these fundamental, filopodia-dependent behaviors. Future studies could further test the importance of exosomes and exosome-associated-THSD7A in controlling filopodia in additional cell types, including endothelial cells that use filopodia during cell-cell contact formation and angiogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. It would also be interesting to see whether THSD7A carried by EVs regulates kidney podocyte foot process formation downstream of filopodia and whether it is soluble proteolyzed THSD7A or THSD7A-carrying EVs released into the circulation by cancer cells that leads to autoimmune secondary membranous nephropathy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In our first proteomics dataset identifying SEV-enriched cargoes, we identified endoglin as a candidate molecule to regulate filopodia formation. While we originally hypothesized that endoglin was regulating filopodia formation through one of its known binding partners, our tests of candidates did not yield any positive results. Instead, through our proteomic comparison of control and endoglin-KD SEVs, we identified THSD7A as a possible filopodia-inducing EV cargo regulated by endoglin. Indeed, recombinant purified THSD7A rapidly induced filopodia formation, rescuing filopodia defects of endoglin-KD cells within 15 min (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7E</xref>). As neurons do not express endoglin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> but do express THSD7A, we expect that sorting of THSD7A to exosomes is controlled by additional molecules. In addition, we found for the first time that Cdc42 activity was required for THSD7A to promote filopodia formation. However, the intermediary proteins that link THSD7A to Cdc42 remain unknown. Future studies to identify THSD7A-binding partners will be important to understand both the mechanism by which THSD7A selectively induces filopodia formation via Cdc42 and how its trafficking is regulated in neurons and other cell types.</p>
<p>Endoglin is highly expressed in endothelial cells and regulates angiogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Indeed, mutations in endoglin are a frequent cause of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia – a disease in which abnormal vascular structures are formed in the skin, mucous membranes and some organs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. Endoglin expression is also upregulated in several cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, including melanoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>, ovarian cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>, breast cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>, and gastric cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. In breast cancer, these elevated endoglin levels are correlated with reduced survival and invasive phenotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. There is also blood vessel enrichment of endoglin in ovarian tumors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup> and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>. In fact, anti-endoglin antibodies are being evaluated as potential anti-cancer therapy and inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis in pre-clinical models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>. Given our new findings that endoglin is a key regulator of filopodia via regulating THSD7A trafficking to SEVs, an important future direction could be to test the contribution of THSD7A to endoglin-dependent phenotypes, including angiogenesis and cancer metastasis.</p>
<p>In summary, we found that exosomes promote filopodia formation in diverse cell types by carrying the transmembrane ECM molecule THSD7A. This appears to be a major mechanism for filopodia formation with broad importance for a variety of cellular processes, including cancer cell migration and neuronal synapse formation.</p>

<title>EV Isolation and Characterization</title>
<p>48-hour conditioned Opti-MEM (a serum-free but growth factor-containing medium) was collected for isolation of EVs from cancer cells. A 5-minute 300xg spin and 25-minute 2000xg spin were performed to remove dead cells and large particulate matter. The supernatant was then spun at 10,000xg for 30 minutes to pellet the LEVs (Ti45 rotor, Beckman Coulter). This LEV fraction was later washed with PBS spins and used for Western blotting and rescue experiments. To isolate SEVs from cancer cells, we used a cushion density gradient ultracentrifugation method, which reduces vesicle and protein aggregation and leads to a highly purified preparation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. For iodixanol cushion and gradient, OptiPrep Density Gradient Medium was purchased from Sigma (D1556). The supernatant from the 10,000xg spin was layered on top of a 2 mL 60% iodixanol cushion and spun for 4 hours at 100,000xg (SW32 Ti rotor, Beckman Coulter). The bottom 3 mL of the cushion was obtained and layered at the bottom of a discontinuous gradient, followed by three 3 mL layers of 20%, 10%, and 5% iodixanol diluted with 0.25M sucrose/10mM Tris, pH 7.5. The discontinuous gradient was spun for 18 hours at 100,000xg and collected into twelve 1 mL fractions (SW40 Ti rotor, Beckman Coulter). SEVs are typically located in fractions 6 and 7, and these fractions are then washed by resuspending with PBS and repelleting.

Tandem was set up to search the uniprot-mouse-refernce-canonical_20121112_rev database (unknown version, 86222 entries) also assuming trypsin. Sequest was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.00 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 2.5 Da. X! Tandem was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.50 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 2.5 Da. Glu-&gt;pyro-&gt;Glu of the n-terminus, ammonia-loss of the n-terminus, gln-&gt;pyro-&gt;Glu of the N-terminus, oxidation of methionine and carbamidomethyl of cysteine were specified in X! Tandem as variable modifications. Oxidation of methionine and carbamidomethyl of cysteine were specified in Sequest as variable modifications. Criteria for protein identification: Scaffold (version Scafford_4.8.8, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 50.0% probability to achieve an FDR less than 5.0% by the Peptide Prophet algorithm (Keller, A. et al. Anal. Chem. 2002;74(20):5483-92). Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 81.0% probability to achieve an FDR less than 5.0% and contained at least 2 identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii, Al et al. Anal. Chem. 2003;75(17):4646-58). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS Analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.

<title>iTRAQ Analysis of SEVs</title>
<p>For iTRAQ proteomics analysis, isolated exosomes from multiple cushion-density gradient preparations were pooled together for each cell type. Each individual preparation was tested for purity using Zetaview nanoparticle tracking and Western blot for typical exosomal markers. Pooled SEVs were resuspended in PBS and mixed 1:1 with 2x “exosome lysis buffer” (200 mM TEAB, 600 mM NaCl, 2% NP-40, and 1% sodium deoxycholate). After mixing, samples were then sonicated using a Bioruptor in cold ice water (30 seconds on/30 seconds off for 15 minutes). After sonication, samples were spun down to pellet insoluble proteins, and the supernatant was submitted and run by the Vanderbilt University MSRC Proteomics Core Laboratory. MS/MS spectra were searched against a mouse subset of the UniProt KB protein database, and autovalidation procedures in Spectrum Mill were used to filter the data to &lt;1% false discovery rates at the protein and peptide level. The median log2 iTRAQ protein ratios were calculated over all peptides identified for each protein, and frequency distributions were generated in GraphPad Prism. Log2 ratios typically follow a normal distribution and were fit using least squares regression. The mean and standard deviation values derived from the Gaussian fit were used to calculate p-values using Z-score statistics. A given iTRAQ protein ratio, with the calculated mean and standard deviation of the fitted dataset, is transformed to a standard normal variable (z = (x-μ)/ο). Since the properties of the standard normal curve are known, area under the curve for a particular value can be calculated, providing a p-value for each measured protein ratio. Calculated p-values were subsequently corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The full proteomics results are shown in Supplemental Table 2.</p>

<p>To detect THSD7A in HT1080 TCLs and SEVs, reducing Western blot conditions and rabbit anti-THSD7A (Sigma HPA000923) were used. To detect THSD7A in B16F1 SEV samples, SEVs were solubilized in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 1mM PMSF mixed 1:1 with SEVs resuspended in PBS) in non-reducing conditions and ran on native gels using non-SDS running buffer. After transfer, the membrane was probed with rabbit anti-THSD7A IgG generously provided by Nicola M. Tomas, Rolf A.K.

<p>For detecting Smad phosphorylation, TGF-β1 was used as a positive control and added to indicated conditions for 1 hr at 10 ng/mL. TGF-β1 was reconstituted in sterile 4 mM HCl + 0.1% BSA according to manufacturer’s instructions (R&amp;D Systems Cat #240-B-002). Indicated conditions were treated with the TGF-β1 inhibitor SB 431542 (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# S4317; solubilized in DMSO) for 5 minutes at 10 μM prior to TGF-β1 treatment. Cells were seeded on 100 μg/mL PDL +/− 2 μg/mL rhTHSD7A. At experiment endpoint, media was aspirated and adherent cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Research Products International (RPI) Cat # P202705) and PhosSTOP<sup>TM</sup> (Roche Cat # 4906845001).

<title>Avian Embryo Model of Metastasis</title>
<p>Avian embryo experimental metastasis model protocol was based on previously published methods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Live fertilized chicken eggs were incubated for 11 days prior to injections. HT1080 control and KD cells expressing mCitrine were suspended in PBS at a concentration of 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and 100,000 cells (100 μL) were injected into the allantoic vein in the direction of bloodflow. Eggs were returned to the incubator for 4 days. After 4 days post-injection, chicks were sacrificed, and three circular areas of CAM were harvested from inside the shell 4 days post-injection. The membrane was then peeled away from the eggshell and placed between a glass slide and coverslip for imaging. 25-30 fields of view were captured for each egg harvested and 4-7 eggs were sacrificed for each condition. Preliminary low-power wide-field images were obtained using a Zeiss Lumar V12 fluorescence stereomicroscope with 10X magnification. For higher power wide-field images, fluorescent cell extravasation and metastasis was observed using X10/0.40 UPlanSApo objective lens with a 10X ocular (100X total) on a Olympus BX-61 microscope equipped with a digital camera controlled with Volocity image acquisition software. For SEV rescue experiments, control SEVs were isolated using the cushion-density gradient method and were premixed with cells immediately prior to injection into chick embryo intravascularly. The number of SEVs per injection was calculated using the SEV secretion rate for the HT1080 shScr cell line according to data collected with the Zetaview nanoparticle tracking instrument (89×10<sup>6</sup> SEVs per 100,000 cells). Images were analyzed in ImageJ by manually thresholding each image to include visible cells and avoid capturing background signals.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study significantly advances our understanding of how exosomes regulate filopodia formation. Filopodia play crucial roles in cell movement, polarization, directional sensing, and neuronal synapse formation. McAtee et al. demonstrated that exosomes, particularly those enriched with the protein THSD7A, play a pivotal role in promoting filopodia formation through Cdc42 in cancer cells and neurons. This discovery unveils a new extracellular mechanism through which cells can control their cytoskeletal dynamics and interaction with their surroundings. The study employs a combination of rescue experiments, live-cell imaging, cell culture, and proteomic analyses to thoroughly investigate the role of exosomes and THSD7A in filopodia formation in cancer cells and neurons. These findings offer valuable insights into fundamental biological processes of cell movement and communication and have potential implications for understanding cancer metastasis and neuronal development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions of this study are in most cases supported by data, but some aspects of data analysis need to be better clarified and elaborated. Some conclusions need to be better stated and according to the data observed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that small EVs trigger the formation of filopodia in both cancer cells and neurons. They go on to show that two cargo proteins, endoglin, and THSD7A, are important for this process. This possibly occurs by activating the Rho-family GTPase CDC42.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The EV work is quite strong and convincing. The proteomics work is well executed and carefully analyzed. I was particularly impressed with the chick metastasis assay that added strong evidence of in vivo relevance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weakest part of the paper is the Cdc42 work at the end of the paper. It is incomplete and not terribly convincing. This part of the paper needs to be improved significantly</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identify a novel relationship between exosome secretion and filopodia formation in cancer cells and neurons. They observe that multivesicular endosomes (MVE)-plasma membrane (PM) fusion is associated with filopodia formation in HT1080 cells and that MVEs are present in filopodia in primary neurons. Using overexpression and knockdown (KD) of Rab27/HRS in HT1080 cells, melanoma cells, and/or primary rat neurons, they found that decreasing exosome secretion reduces filopodia formation, while Rab27 overexpression leads to the opposite result. Furthermore, the decreased filopodia formation is rescued in the Rab27a/HRS KD melanoma cells by the addition of small extracellular vesicles (EVs) but not large EVs purified from control cells. The authors identify endoglin as a protein unique to small EVs secreted by cancer cells when compared to large EVs. KD of endoglin reduces filopodia formation and this is rescued by the addition of small EVs from control cells and not by small EVs from endoglin KD cells. Based on the role of filopodia in cancer metastasis, the authors then investigate the role of endoglin in cancer cell metastasis using a chick embryo model. They find that injection of endoglin KD HT1080 cells into chick embryos gives rise to less metastasis compared to control cells - a phenotype that is rescued by the co-injection of small EVs from control cells. Using quantitative mass spectrometry analysis, they find that thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 7a protein (THSD7A) is downregulated in small EVs from endoglin KD melanoma cells compared to those from control cells. They also report that THSD7A is more abundant in endoglin KD cell lysate compared to control HT1080 cells and less abundant in small EVs from endoglin KD cells compared to control cells, indicating a trafficking defect. Indeed, using immunofluorescence microscopy, the authors observe THSD7A-mScarlet accumulation in CD63-positive structures in endoglin KD HT1080 cells, compared to control cells. Finally, the authors determine that exosome-secreted THSD7A induces filopodia formation in a Cdc42-dependent mechanism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) While exosomes are known to play a role in cell migration and autocrine signaling, the relationship between exosome secretion and the formation of filopodia is novel.</p>
<p>(2) The authors identify an exosomal cargo protein, THSD7A, which is essential for regulating this function.</p>
<p>(3) The data presented provide strong evidence of a role for endoglin in the trafficking of THSD7A in exosomes.</p>
<p>(4) The authors associate this process with functional significance in cancer cell metastasis and neurological synapse formation, both of which involve the formation of filopodia.</p>
<p>(5) The data are presented clearly, and their interpretation appropriately explains the context and significance of the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A better characterization of the nature of the small EV population is missing:</p>
<p>It is unclear why the authors chose to proceed to quantitative mass spectrometry with the bands in the Coomassie from size-separated EV samples, as there are other bands present in the small EV lane but not the large EV lane. This is important to clarify because it underlies how they were able to identify THSD7A as a unique regulator of exosome-mediated filopodia formation. Is there a reason why the total sample fractions were not compared? This would provide valuable information on the nature of the small and large EV populations.</p>
<p>(2) Data analysis and quantification should be performed with increased rigor:</p>
<p>a) Figure 1C - The optical and temporal resolution are insufficient to conclusively characterize the association between exosome secretion and filopodia. Specifically, the 10-second interval used in the image acquisitions is too close to the reported 20-second median time between exosome secretion and filopodia formation. Two-5 sec intervals should be used to validate this. It would also be important to correlate the percentage of filopodia events that co-occur with exosome secretion. Is this a phenomenon that occurs with most or only a small number of filopodia? Additionally, resolution with typical confocal microscopy is subpar for these analyses. TIRF microscopy would offer increased resolution to parse out secretion events. As the TIRF objective is listed in the Methods section, figure legends should mention which images were acquired using TIRF microscopy.</p>
<p>b) Figure 2 - It would be important to perform further analysis to concretely determine the relationship between exosome secretion and filopodia stability. Are secretion events correlated with the stability of filopodia? Is there a positive feedback loop that causes further filopodia stability and length with increased secretion? Furthermore, is there an association between the proximity of secretion with stability? Quantification of filopodia more objectively (# of filopodia/cell) would be helpful.</p>
<p>c) Figure 6 - Why use different gel conditions to detect THSD7A in small EVs from B16F1 cells vs HT1080 and neurons? Why are there two bands for THSD7A in panels C and E? It is difficult to appreciate the KD efficiency in E. The absence of a signal for THSD7A in the HT1080 shEng small EVs that show a signal for endoglin is surprising. The authors should provide rigorous quantification of the westerns from several independent experimental repeats.</p>
<p>(3) The study lacks data on the cellular distribution of endoglin and THSD7A:</p>
<p>a) Figure 6 - Is THSD7A expected to be present in the nucleus as shown in panel D (label D is missing in the Figure). It is not clear if this is observed in neurons. a Western of endogenous THSD7A on cell fractions would clarify this. The authors should further characterize the cellular distribution of THSD7A in both cell types. Similarly, the cellular distribution of endoglin in the cancer cells should be provided. This would help validate the proposed model in Figure 8.</p>
<p>b) Figure 7 - Although the western blot provides convincing evidence for the role of endoglin in THSD7A trafficking, the microscopy data lack resolution as well as key analyses. While differences between shSCR and shEng cells are clear visually, the insets appear to be zoomed digitally which decreases resolution and interferes with interpretation. It would be crucial to show the colocalization of endoglin and THSD7A within CD63-postive MVE structures. What are the structures in Figure 7E shSCR zoom1? It would be important to rule out that these are migrasomes using TSPAN4 staining. More information on how the analysis was conducted is needed (i.e. how extracellular areas were chosen and whether the images are representative of the larger population). A widefield image of shSCR and shEng cells and DAPI or HOECHST staining in the higher magnification images should be provided. Additionally, the authors should quantify the colocalization of external CD63 and mScarlet signals from many independently acquired images (as they did for the internal signals in panel F). Is there no external THSD7A signal in the shEng cells?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study significantly advances our understanding of how exosomes regulate filopodia formation. Filopodia play crucial roles in cell movement, polarization, directional sensing, and neuronal synapse formation. McAtee et al. demonstrated that exosomes, particularly those enriched with the protein THSD7A, play a pivotal role in promoting filopodia formation through Cdc42 in cancer cells and neurons. This discovery unveils a new extracellular mechanism through which cells can control their cytoskeletal dynamics and interaction with their surroundings. The study employs a combination of rescue experiments, live-cell imaging, cell culture, and proteomic analyses to thoroughly investigate the role of exosomes and THSD7A in filopodia formation in cancer cells and neurons. These findings offer valuable insights into fundamental biological processes of cell movement and communication and have potential implications for understanding cancer metastasis and neuronal development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions of this study are in most cases supported by data, but some aspects of data analysis need to be better clarified and elaborated. Some conclusions need to be better stated and according to the data observed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's recognition of the impact of our study.  We will address the concerns about data analysis and statement of our conclusions in our full response to reviewers.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that small EVs trigger the formation of filopodia in both cancer cells and neurons. They go on to show that two cargo proteins, endoglin, and THSD7A, are important for this process. This possibly occurs by activating the Rho-family GTPase CDC42.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The EV work is quite strong and convincing. The proteomics work is well executed and carefully analyzed. I was particularly impressed with the chick metastasis assay that added strong evidence of in vivo relevance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weakest part of the paper is the Cdc42 work at the end of the paper. It is incomplete and not terribly convincing. This part of the paper needs to be improved significantly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's recognition of the impact of our study.  Indeed, more work needs to be done to clarify the role of Cdc42 in the induction of filopodia by exosome-associated THSD7A.  We anticipate that this will be a separate manuscript, delving in-depth into how exosome-associated THSD7A interacts with recipient cells to activate Cdc42 and carrying out a variety of assays for Cdc42 activation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identify a novel relationship between exosome secretion and filopodia formation in cancer cells and neurons. They observe that multivesicular endosomes (MVE)-plasma membrane (PM) fusion is associated with filopodia formation in HT1080 cells and that MVEs are present in filopodia in primary neurons. Using overexpression and knockdown (KD) of Rab27/HRS in HT1080 cells, melanoma cells, and/or primary rat neurons, they found that decreasing exosome secretion reduces filopodia formation, while Rab27 overexpression leads to the opposite result. Furthermore, the decreased filopodia formation is rescued in the Rab27a/HRS KD melanoma cells by the addition of small extracellular vesicles (EVs) but not large EVs purified from control cells. The authors identify endoglin as a protein unique to small EVs secreted by cancer cells when compared to large EVs. KD of endoglin reduces filopodia formation and this is rescued by the addition of small EVs from control cells and not by small EVs from endoglin KD cells. Based on the role of filopodia in cancer metastasis, the authors then investigate the role of endoglin in cancer cell metastasis using a chick embryo model. They find that injection of endoglin KD HT1080 cells into chick embryos gives rise to less metastasis compared to control cells - a phenotype that is rescued by the co-injection of small EVs from control cells. Using quantitative mass spectrometry analysis, they find that thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 7a protein (THSD7A) is downregulated in small EVs from endoglin KD melanoma cells compared to those from control cells. They also report that THSD7A is more abundant in endoglin KD cell lysate compared to control HT1080 cells and less abundant in small EVs from endoglin KD cells compared to control cells, indicating a trafficking defect. Indeed, using immunofluorescence microscopy, the authors observe THSD7A-mScarlet accumulation in CD63-positive structures in endoglin KD HT1080 cells, compared to control cells. Finally, the authors determine that exosome-secreted THSD7A induces filopodia formation in a Cdc42-dependent mechanism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) While exosomes are known to play a role in cell migration and autocrine signaling, the relationship between exosome secretion and the formation of filopodia is novel.</p>
<p>(2) The authors identify an exosomal cargo protein, THSD7A, which is essential for regulating this function.</p>
<p>(3) The data presented provide strong evidence of a role for endoglin in the trafficking of THSD7A in exosomes.</p>
<p>(4) The authors associate this process with functional significance in cancer cell metastasis and neurological synapse formation, both of which involve the formation of filopodia.</p>
<p>(5) The data are presented clearly, and their interpretation appropriately explains the context and significance of the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A better characterization of the nature of the small EV population is missing:</p>
<p>It is unclear why the authors chose to proceed to quantitative mass spectrometry with the bands in the Coomassie from size-separated EV samples, as there are other bands present in the small EV lane but not the large EV lane. This is important to clarify because it underlies how they were able to identify THSD7A as a unique regulator of exosome-mediated filopodia formation. Is there a reason why the total sample fractions were not compared? This would provide valuable information on the nature of the small and large EV populations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify that there are two sets of proteomics data in the manuscript. The first was comparing bands from a Coomassie gel from two samples: small EVs and large EVs from B16F1 cells. In this proteomics experiment, we identified endoglin as present in small EVs, but not large EVs. For this experiment, we only sent 4 bands from the small EV lane, chosen based on their obvious banding pattern difference on the Coomassie gel.</p>
<p>In the second proteomics experiment, we used quantitative iTRAQ proteomics to compare small EVs purified from B16F1 control (shScr) and endoglin KD (shEng1 and shEng2) cell lines. In this experiment, we sent total protein extracted from small EV samples for analysis. So, these samples included the entire EV content, not just selected bands from a gel. In this experiment, we identified THSD7A as reduced in the shEng small EVs.</p>

<p>(2) Data analysis and quantification should be performed with increased rigor:</p>
<p>a) Figure 1C - The optical and temporal resolution are insufficient to conclusively characterize the association between exosome secretion and filopodia. Specifically, the 10-second interval used in the image acquisitions is too close to the reported 20-second median time between exosome secretion and filopodia formation. Two-5 sec intervals should be used to validate this. It would also be important to correlate the percentage of filopodia events that co-occur with exosome secretion. Is this a phenomenon that occurs with most or only a small number of filopodia? Additionally, resolution with typical confocal microscopy is subpar for these analyses. TIRF microscopy would offer increased resolution to parse out secretion events. As the TIRF objective is listed in the Methods section, figure legends should mention which images were acquired using TIRF microscopy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that the frame rate naturally limits our estimates of the timing of filopodia formation after exosome secretion. We set out to show a relationship between exosome secretion and filopodia formation, based on their proximity in timing. While our data set shows a median time interval of 20 seconds, the true median could be between 10-30 seconds, based on our frame rate.  Regardless of the exact timing, our data show that exosome secretion is rapidly followed by filopodia formation events.</p>
<p>To address the question of the percentage of filopodia events that are preceded by exosome secretion, the reviewer is correct in stating that we might need TIRF microscopy to get an accurate calculation of this number.  Nonetheless, we will review our live imaging data for this experiment to determine if this calculation is possible. Again, we will be limited by the frame rate we used to capture the images, so we could possibly be missing secretion events taking place between the 10 second time intervals.  Regardless, for the secretion events that we visualized, we always observed subsequent filopodia formation.</p>
<p>No TIRF imaging was used in this manuscript.  A TIRF objective was used for selected neuron imaging (see methods); however, it was used for spinning disk confocal microscopy, not for TIRF imaging.  We will clarify this in the methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) Figure 2 - It would be important to perform further analysis to concretely determine the relationship between exosome secretion and filopodia stability. Are secretion events correlated with the stability of filopodia? Is there a positive feedback loop that causes further filopodia stability and length with increased secretion? Furthermore, is there an association between the proximity of secretion with stability? Quantification of filopodia more objectively (# of filopodia/cell) would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our data shows that manipulation of general exosome secretion, via Hrs knockdown, affects both <italic>de novo</italic> filopodia formation and filopodia stability (Fig 2g,h). Interestingly, knockdown of endoglin only affects <italic>de novo</italic> filopodia formation, while filopodia stability is unaffected (Fig 4g,h). These results suggest that filopodia stability is dependent upon exosome cargoes besides endoglin/THSD7A.  Such cargoes might include other extracellular matrix molecules, such as fibronectin. We previously showed that exosomes promote nascent cell adhesion and rapid cell migration, through exosome-bound fibronectin (Sung et al., Nature Communications, 6:7164, 2015). We also previously found that inhibition of exosome secretion affects the persistence of invadopodia, which are filopodia-dependent structures (Hoshino et al., Cell Reports, 5:1159-1168, 2013).  We agree that this is an interesting research direction, and perhaps future work could focus on exosomal factors that are responsible for filopodia persistence.</p>
<p>With regard to the way we plotted the filopodia data, we plotted the cancer cell data as filopodia per cell area so that it matched the neuron data, which was plotted as filopodia per 100 mm of dendrite distance. Since the neurons cannot be imaged as a whole cell, the quantification is based on the length of the dendrite in the image. We found that graphing the cancer cell data as filopodia per cell gave similar results as filopodia per cell area, as there were no significant differences in cell area between conditions and experiments. We plan to include a new supplementary figure showing the data in Figure 2 plotted as filopodia per cell to show that this quantification gives the same results.</p>

<p>c) Figure 6 - Why use different gel conditions to detect THSD7A in small EVs from B16F1 cells vs HT1080 and neurons? Why are there two bands for THSD7A in panels C and E? It is difficult to appreciate the KD efficiency in E. The absence of a signal for THSD7A in the HT1080 shEng small EVs that show a signal for endoglin is surprising. The authors should provide rigorous quantification of the westerns from several independent experimental repeats.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Detection of THSD7A via Western blot was, unfortunately, not straightforward and simple. Due to the large size (~260 kDa) of THSD7A, its low level of expression in cancer cells, as well as the inconsistency of commercially available THSD7A antibodies, we had to troubleshoot multiple conditions.  We found that it was much easier to detect THSD7A in the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 than in the mouse B16F1 cells, both in the cell lysates and in the small EVs. We were usually unable to detect THSD7A using these same conditions for the mouse melanoma B16F1 samples, but were successful using native gel conditions. We also detected THSD7A in rat primary neuron samples. All these samples were from different source organisms (human, mouse, rat) and from either cell lysates or extracellular vesicles, further complicating the analyses. Expression and maturation of THSD7A in these different cell types and compartments could involve different post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, thus requiring different methods needed to detect THSD7A on Western blots and leading to different banding patterns. Based on our THSD7A trafficking data, we believe that in control cells, most of the THSD7A is getting trafficked and secreted via small EVs. As you can see in Figure 7A, the band for THSD7A in the shScr cell lysate is relatively light and also shows a double band similar to Figure 6E (both HT1080 samples).</p>
<p>With regard to the level of knockdown of THSD7A in the Western blot shown in Figure 6E, the normalized level is quantitated below the bands.  If you compare that quantitation to the filopodia phenotypes in the same panel, they are quite concordant.  Figures 7B and 7C show quantification of triplicate Western blots, highlighting the significant accumulation of THSD7A in shEng cell lysates, as well as significant small EV secretion of THSD7A in control and WT rescued conditions.</p>

<p>(3) The study lacks data on the cellular distribution of endoglin and THSD7A:</p>
<p>a) Figure 6 - Is THSD7A expected to be present in the nucleus as shown in panel D (label D is missing in the Figure). It is not clear if this is observed in neurons. a Western of endogenous THSD7A on cell fractions would clarify this. The authors should further characterize the cellular distribution of THSD7A in both cell types. Similarly, the cellular distribution of endoglin in the cancer cells should be provided. This would help validate the proposed model in Figure 8.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The image in figure 6D shows an HT1080 cell stained with phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 488 to visualize F-actin with or without expression of THSD7A-mScarlet.  In order to fully visualize the thin filopodia protrusions, the cellular plane of focus of the images for this panel was purposely taken at the bottom of the cell, where the cell is attached to the coverslip glass. Thus, we interpret the red signal across the cell body as THSD7A-mScarlet expression on the plasma membrane underneath the cell, not in the nucleus. The neuron images only include the dendrite portion of the neurons; therefore, there is no nucleus present in the neuronal images.</p>

More information on how the analysis was conducted is needed (i.e. how extracellular areas were chosen and whether the images are representative of the larger population).

Is there no external THSD7A signal in the shEng cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The images for Figure 7E were taken with high resolution on a confocal microscope.  Insets for Figure 7E were zoomed in so that readers could see the tiny structures.  Zoom 1 in Figure 7E shows areas of extracellular deposition. In these areas, we can see small punctate depositions that are positive for CD63 and/or THSD7A-mScarlet. Our interpretation of this staining is that the cells are secreting heterogeneous small EVs that are then attached to the glass coverslip. The images and zooms in Fig 7E were chosen to be representative and indeed reveal that there is more extracellular deposition of THSD7A-mScarlet outside the control shScr cells compared to the shEng cells, consistent with more export of THSD7A into small EVs from shScr cells when compared to those of shEng cells (Fig 7A,B). However, we did not quantify this difference, as these experiments were conducted with transient transfection of THSD7A-mScarlet and it is challenging to determine which cell the extracellular THSD7A-mScarlet came from, complicating any quantitative analysis on a per-cell basis.  Quantification of internal THSD7A localization is much more straightforward in this experimental regime.  Indeed, in Figure 7F we assessed internal colocalization of THSD7A-mScarlet and CD63, which we obtained by choosing only cells that were visually positive for THSD7A-mScarlet in each transient transfection and omitting all extracellular signals. Quantifying the extracellular colocalization of THSD7A and CD63 could certainly be a future direction for this project and would require establishing cells that stably express THSD7A-mScarlet.</p>
