<title>Abstract</title><p>High resolution live imaging of regeneration presents unique challenges, due to the nature of the specimens (large mobile animals), the duration of the process (spanning days or weeks), and the fact that cellular resolution must be achieved without damage caused by lengthy exposures to light. Building on previous work that allowed us to image different parts of the process of leg regeneration in the crustacean <italic>Parhyale hawaiensis</italic>, we present here a method for live imaging that captures the entire process of leg regeneration, spanning up to 10 days, at cellular resolution. Our method includes (1) mounting and long-term live imaging of regenerating legs under conditions that yield high spatial and temporal resolution but minimise photodamage, (2) fixing and <italic>in situ</italic> staining of the regenerated legs that were imaged, to identify cell fates, and (3) computer-assisted cell tracking to determine the cell lineages and progenitors of identified cells. The method is optimised to limit light exposure while maximising tracking efficiency. Combined with appropriate cell-type-specific markers, this method may allow the description of cell lineages for every regenerated cell type in the limb.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In contrast to imaging embryonic development, live imaging of regeneration presents unique challenges that have so far been difficult to overcome. First, unlike developing embryos which can be easily immobilised, regenerating juvenile or adult animals are mobile and cannot easily be fixed under a microscope over long periods of time. These animals need to move to capture food and in many cases to breathe. Anaesthesia is possible for short periods, but lethal if applied over many hours or days.</p>
<p>Second, imaging embryonic development has been particularly successful in animals with rapid development. Developmental processes with a duration of hours or a few days, such as the embryonic development of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zebrafish, or the process of somitogenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Keller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Masamizu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tomer et al., 2012</xref>), can be followed with high temporal resolution. Processes with a longer duration, however, present greater challenges due to the damaging effects that prolonged exposure to light has on living tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Icha et al., 2017</xref>). Long-term live imaging also requires robust microscope-camera setups that can maintain image quality and record images over long periods. Regeneration typically takes place on a timescale of several days or weeks.</p>
<p>Third, the larger size of juvenile or adult organisms can impact live imaging in a number of ways, for example, by constraining how large specimens can be mounted on a microscope (or, indeed, how a microscope might be mounted on the animal, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aharoni et al., 2019</xref>), or by exceeding a microscope’s field of view or imaging depth.</p>
<p>In spite of these difficulties, live imaging of regeneration –under anaesthesia– has been developed in zebrafish and mice, allowing to image successfully cell dynamics during repair or regeneration in different organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chioccioli et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gurevich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kamimoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mateus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pineda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rompolas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). The duration of continuous time-lapse recordings, in these cases, was constrained by survival under long-term anaesthesia and was typically limited to less than one day. An alternative approach has been to immobilise a regenerating animal for the time required to acquire an image stack and then to release it, until the next imaging time point when one re-captures the animal and re-visits the same body part. This approach has allowed imaging experiments to run over much longer time periods (several days, even weeks), but with much lower temporal resolution, typically 12 or 24 hours between successive time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chioccioli et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">De Simone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mateus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pineda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rompolas et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A major challenge in the latter approach is identifying the same cells at different time points, especially after cell divisions and movements. This can be made easier by sparse labelling of cells, or mosaic labelling of cell clones, for example using <italic>Brainbow</italic>-like methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barbosa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ritsma et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent years, the crustacean <italic>Parhyale hawaiensis</italic> has emerged as a promising experimental system for studying regeneration, in which transgenic tools can be combined with live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Grillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Konstantinides and Averof, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Paris et al., 2022</xref>). For live imaging, a major advantage of <italic>Parhyale</italic> is our ability to immobilise its regenerating legs over long periods without needing to keep the animals under anaesthesia. This is achieved by fixing the chitinous exoskeleton that surrounds the leg onto the microscope coverslip using surgical glue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Konstantinides and Averof, 2014</xref>). Thus, <italic>Parhyale</italic>’s cuticle –which is both sturdy and transparent– serves as a straitjacket to immobilise the leg, and as a window through which we can visualise regeneration. Our first systematic study using this approach presented continuous live imaging over periods of 2-3 days, capturing key events of leg regeneration such as wound closure, cell proliferation and morphogenesis of regenerating legs with single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we extend this work by developing a method for imaging the entire course of leg regeneration, optimised to reduce photodamage and to improve cell tracking. We also develop a method of <italic>in situ</italic> staining of gene expression in cuticularised adult legs, which we combine with live imaging to determine the fate of tracked cells.</p>
<p>Our objective is to image legs during the entire time course of leg regeneration, with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to support the tracking of individual cells in 3D. We would also like to determine the identities and molecular signatures of the cells that are being tracked. This will enable us to identify progenitors for each cell type in the leg, to trace their complete genealogies, and to characterise the molecular and cell state transitions associated with leg regeneration.</p>
<p>Leg regeneration takes place over approximately 1 week in adult <italic>Parhyale</italic> (3 to 10 days, depending on the age of the individual, the injury sustained, and other unknown factors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Konstantinides and Averof, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sinigaglia et al., 2022</xref>). Our previous studies showed that imaging at 20 minute intervals is sufficient to capture cell divisions and to track cells reliably over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, a complete recording of a regenerating leg would require capturing at least 360 image stacks, at 20-minute intervals, over a period of 5 days. A major challenge we must address in such long-term imaging experiments is how to balance the need for high spatial and temporal resolution with the need to minimise photodamage. Increasing spatial or temporal resolution (whether by using higher numerical aperture objectives, finer sampling in x, y or z, or shorter imaging intervals) improves our ability to resolve and to track cells in a crowded cellular environment, but also leads to increased light exposure and resulting tissue damage.</p>
<p>Among the various imaging modalities available for live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Schroeder, 2008</xref>), we have used confocal microscopy. Light-sheet microscopy would have been preferable for minimising light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Stelzer et al., 2021</xref>), but the currently accessible light-sheet designs are incompatible with mounting and imaging through a microscope coverslip, which we need in order to immobilise adult <italic>Parhyale</italic>. Confocal microscopy is now widely established and commercial systems are stable enough to support automated 3D image acquisition over very long time courses.</p>

<title>Imaging the entire course of leg regeneration at cellular resolution</title>
<p><italic>Parhyale</italic> can regenerate their limbs independently of the site of amputation. Regeneration occurs in the distal part of the limb stump, within the exoskeleton of the amputated leg (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Konstantinides and Averof, 2014</xref>). We have found that by amputating the T4 or T5 legs of mid-sized adults in the distal part of the carpus, we can capture the entire regenerating tissue within a single field of view using a 20x objective (Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 20 x/0.8) (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Videos 1 and 2).</p>

<p>Live imaging is performed on transgenic animals expressing a histone-bound fluorescent protein expressed under a heat-shock promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pavlopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wolff et al., 2018</xref>). To minimise photodamage we image at longer wavelengths, using a construct expressing H2B-mRFPruby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wolff et al., 2018</xref>). To induce transgene expression, a heat-shock (45 minutes at 37°C) is applied, typically 12-18 hours before amputation, yielding high levels of nuclear fluorescence which can persist for many days in non-dividing cells. Heat shocks may be repeated during the course of imaging, using the microscope’s temperature-controlled stage, to maintain adequate levels of fluorescence in dividing cells. The temperature change causes a slight displacement in the acquired images, which is corrected post acquisition (see Methods).</p>
<p>To minimise light-induced damage, we select transgenic individuals that show the highest levels of nuclear fluorescence and set the power of the excitation laser to the lowest setting that yields acceptable image quality on our most sensitive GaAsP detector. Previous experiments had shown that imaging with a pixel size of 0.31x0.31 microns, a z step of 2.48 microns, and a time interval of 20 minutes are sufficient for cell tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>), both manually and using the Elephant tracking software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>). To improve image quality while keeping light exposure in check, we have tested different settings for scanning speed and image averaging, and determined that a scanning speed of 2.06 μs per pixel with an averaging of 2 images (or 1.03 μs per pixel with an averaging of 4 images) are the fastest settings that generate images of sufficient quality for tracking (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1</xref>). Most animals imaged under these settings regenerate their legs within 5-10 days from amputation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), unless they have been amputated shortly before molting. In the latter case, the wound is closed and the animals molt before regenerating. The imaging settings are described in more detail in the Methods.</p>

For each recording, we indicate the span of the early phase of wound closure and proliferative quiescence prior to epithelial detachment from the scab (in blue), the early phases of cell proliferation and morphogenesis, up to the time when the first and second podomere boundaries becomes visible (in yellow and orange, respectively), and the late phases of regeneration, when the leg takes its final shape, cell proliferation gradually dies down and cells differentiate (in red). The total duration of this process varies from 3 to 10 days. Note that the fastest instances of regeneration occurred in young individuals (li51 and li52); the fastest, li51 was imaged at 29°C (marked by an asterisk). Datasets li-13 and li-16 were recorded until the molt; the other recordings were stopped before molting. Further details on each recording are given in Suppl. Data 1.</p></caption>

<p>By continuously imaging the entire process of leg regeneration, we are now able to confirm and extend our description of leg regeneration, which was previously reconstructed from snapshots and partial recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Konstantinides and Averof, 2014</xref>). Within 24 hours post amputation (hpa), a melanised scab forms at the site of injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A,B</xref>). This is accompanied by stretching and migration of epithelial cells to cover the wounded surface, under the scab (10-30 hpa in Videos 1 and 2). There is little (if any) cell division during these early stages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Between 1 and 3.5 days post amputation the epithelium detaches from the scab (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; 31 hpa in Video 1, 65 hpa in Video 2). The timing of detachment varies considerably (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), but we find that it often coincides with the onset of cell proliferation, cell-cell rearrangements and apoptosis in the cells that lie within ∼100 microns from the scab. More proximally-located tissues detach from the cuticle and retract towards the body, making space for the growth of regenerating tissues in the distal part of the stump (40-85 hpa in Video 1; 80-120 hpa in Video 2). The boundaries of the leg podomeres appear within a day from epithelial detachment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D,E</xref>; 45-60 hpa in Video 1; 80-95 hpa in Video 2). In some recordings, the tissues making up the podomeres can be seen pulsating with a periodicity of 6-7 hours (see 105-145 hpa in Video 2). This pulsating movement had not been observed previously, and its significance is unclear. Later, the rates of cell proliferation and movement gradually decline and the nuclear positions within the tissue become stabilised (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Based on transcriptome profiling data, we think that many cells differentiate during this phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sinigaglia et al., 2022</xref>). Once regeneration is completed, the newly regenerated leg is trapped inside the exoskeleton of the amputated leg stump. It is released from the old exoskeleton and becomes functional during the animal’s next molt. When the animal molts, the regenerated leg is fully formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almazán et al., 2022</xref>). Molting allows the animal to detach from the coverslip and therefore marks the end of our imaging.</p>

</fig>
<p>The timing of these events varies from leg to leg, but their order is consistent in all our recordings (summarised in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Our fastest recordings show the leg of a young adult regenerating in less than 3 days at 29°C (li51-t4 and li51-t5, Video 2). In contrast, the longest ones take ∼10 days to complete regeneration (li16-t5 and li34-t4, imaged at 26-27°C). We find that the overall speed of leg regeneration is determined largely by variation in the speed of the early (wound closure) phase of regeneration, and to a lesser extent by variation in later phases when leg morphogenesis takes place (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 2 A,B</xref>). There is no clear relationship between the <italic>relative</italic> duration of each phase and the speed of regeneration (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 2 A’,B’</xref>).</p>
<p>We note that pairs of adjacent T4 and T5 legs that were amputated simultaneously (in datasets li24, li41, li48, li51 and li5) appear to regenerate at a similar pace, suggesting variation in the speed of regeneration is influenced by systemic factors, such as the age, health or physiology of the individual.</p>
<p>During the course of regeneration some cells undergo apoptosis (reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>). Using the H2B-mRFPruby marker, apoptotic cells appear as bright pyknotic nuclei that break up and become engulfed by circulating phagocytes (see bright specks in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). While some cell death might be caused by photodamage, apoptosis can also be observed in similar numbers in regenerating legs that have not been subjected to live imaging (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Computer-assisted cell tracking during regeneration</title>
<p>Continuous live imaging provides a unique opportunity to track cells and determine their behaviours, lineages and fates during the course of regeneration. We use the Mastodon cell tracking platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon">https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon</ext-link>) to perform cell tracking on regenerating <italic>Parhyale</italic> legs. We previously presented the Elephant, a Mastodon plug-in that enables semi-automated cell tracking (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elephant-track">https://github.com/elephant-track</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>). Elephant uses deep learning on sparse annotations provided by the user to identify and track nuclei across an entire image dataset, in 3D. The computationally-predicted tracks must then be proofread and validated by the user.</p>
<p>The regenerating legs of <italic>Parhyale</italic> make challenging datasets for cell tracking, due to large variations in signal intensity and poor image quality in the deeper tissue layers. This is exacerbated by the need to limit the tissues’ exposure to light, which constrains signal intensity, spatial and temporal resolution (see above). Moreover, the datasets capturing the entire course of regeneration are large, typically image stacks of 15-30 z slices collected over 300-700 time points (i.e. ∼10,000 images per dataset), which makes both manual tracking and proofreading of computer-generated tracks very laborious.</p>
<p>The initial implementation of Elephant generated tracking predictions over entire datasets. We have now added a ‘backtracking’ function (see Methods), which allows users to focus on tracking cells of particular interest. With this function, users are able to select individual cells and obtain predictions on their progenitors, moving up towards earlier points in their cell lineage. This is particularly useful when specific cells of interest can be identified based on molecular or other markers (see below). Using this mode of semi-automated and manual cell tracking, we find that most cells in the upper slices of our image stacks (top 30 microns) can be tracked with a high degree of confidence. A smaller proportion of cells are trackable in the deeper layers (see <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Optimising trade-offs between imaging resolution, image quality and light exposure, based on cell tracking performance</title>
<p>Having identified settings that allow us to image the entire course of leg regeneration in <italic>Parhyale</italic>, we asked whether imaging could be improved further, to facilitate cell tracking, without exposing the legs to additional light. We approached this question by exploring the trade-offs between spatial resolution, temporal resolution and image quality, keeping in mind that the crowding of nuclei (in relation to z resolution) and the speed of mitosis (in relation to temporal resolution) are likely to limit tracking accuracy.</p>
<p>We started by recording leg regeneration at higher than usual spatial and temporal resolutions (0.31 x 0.31 µm pixel size, 1.24 µm z step, 10 minute time intervals, 4 image replicates) and tracking all the nuclei in this volume to generate ground truth track annotations. We then simulated different imaging conditions by subsampling this recording, to generate five datasets that differ in spatial resolution, temporal resolution and/or image quality: (#1) a dataset corresponding to our standard imaging settings, described earlier; (#2) a dataset with improved z resolution, but lower image quality; (#3) a dataset with improved temporal resolution, but lower image quality; (#4) a dataset with improved z and temporal resolutions, but lower resolution in x and y; and (#5) a dataset with improved z and temporal resolutions, but lower image quality. To help assess the tradeoffs between these parameters, we made sure that capturing each of these five datasets would require precisely the same amount of light exposure. We then evaluated and compared the performance of Elephant across these five datasets, in relation to the ground truth, using different metrics, including overall cell detection (DET) and tracking (TRA) scores, measurements of precision and recall rates for the detection and linking of spots across timepoints, and an estimate of the time or effort required to proofread the resulting cell tracks (see Methods).</p>
<p>Our results, summarised in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>, show that the detection of nuclei can be enhanced by doubling the z resolution at the expense of xy resolution and image quality (compare detection metrics in #1 versus #2, #4 and #5). This improvement is particularly evident in the deeper layers of the imaging stacks, which are usually the most challenging to track (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 4</xref>). Tracking of nuclei across timepoints (’linking’) can be enhanced by doubling the temporal resolution at the expense of xy resolution and image quality (compare linking metrics in #1 versus #3, #4 and #5). Taking both detection and linking into account, it appears that the best tracking performance is achieved by improving both z and t resolution, at the expense of xy resolution or image quality (conditions #4 and #5). However, doubling the temporal resolution requires much more effort for proofreading (see last column in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>), because the datasets contain many more time points.</p>

<caption><title>Evaluating image acquisition and post-processing based on cell tracking performance (A)</title><p>Elephant’s tracking performance was evaluated on the same image dataset rendered at different resolutions and image quality (datasets #1 to #5), as described in the Methods. To measure linking performance independently of detection, the linking metrics were determined for tracking performed on the spots of the ground truth data (’TRA on GT’). Dataset #1 corresponds to our standard image acquisition settings; improvements in z and t are indicated in green; lower xy resolution or numbers of averaged replicates are indicated in red. The best scores for each metric are highlighted in yellow. To account for variation in the training, three detection and three linking models were trained and evaluated independently on each dataset. The table shows the averaged scores of the three iterations. <bold>(B)</bold> Elephant’s tracking performance was evaluates on dataset #1 with and without post-processing by denoising or deconvolution (see Methods). The metrics are the same as above. Image denoising did not significantly improve cell tracking and deconvolution (under the setting tested) gave worse results.</p></caption>

</table-wrap>
<p>We conclude that improving the z resolution (condition #2) should be the preferred option when taking into account the efforts required for proofreading. Improving both z and t resolution (conditions #4 or #5) will be valuable for tracking more rapid changes, or when users seek the best tracking performance from Elephant, without proofreading (e.g. automated tracking).</p>
<p>We also tested whether image deconvolution or denoising using state of the art algorithms could improve cell detection and tracking. We find that, under the settings tested, deconvolution and denoising did not help to improve cell tracking performance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Combining live imaging with <italic>in situ</italic> staining to determine the fate of tracked cells</title>
<p>Nuclear-localised fluorescence is convenient for cell tracking but does not help to identify specific cell types, as cell shapes and cell-to-cell contacts remain invisible. During the last years we have tried to develop cell-type-specific fluorescent markers for live imaging using different approaches (CRISPR knock-ins, gene trapping, promoter reporters), but we have not yet succeeded in developing these tools. To overcome this limitation, we have turned to <italic>in situ</italic> staining of molecular markers. Our method involves live imaging, fixation and staining of the regenerated legs, and manual image registration, allowing us to associate the stained cells with specific nuclei tracked in the live recordings.</p>
<p>Initially we developed this approach using immunostaining with antibodies for the <italic>Parhyale</italic> Repo protein, identifying putative glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almazán et al., 2022</xref>), a cross-reactive antibody raised against Prospero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Perry et al., 2016</xref>) and an antibody for acetylated tubulin (see Methods). We showed that regenerating legs could be fixed and immunofluorescently stained after long-term live imaging. The stained cells could then be identified in the live recordings and tracked (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,A</xref>’).</p>

</fig>
<p>In a non-conventional experimental animal like <italic>Parhyale</italic> this approach is limited by the scarcity of antibodies that can serve as cell-type markers. Using single-nucleus transcriptional profiling, we have identified approximately 15 transcriptionally-distinct cell types in adult <italic>Parhyale</italic> legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almazán et al., 2022</xref>), including epidermis, muscle, neurons, hemocytes, and a number of still unidentified cell types. Numerous markers can be identified from these data, but generating and validating antibodies for these markers is a severe bottleneck. To overcome this problem we developed an alternative approach for detecting these markers, based on <italic>in situ</italic> staining using short nucleotide probes. Numerous efforts to apply <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation protocols on <italic>Parhyale</italic> legs have failed in the past, because the chitinous exoskeleton surrounding the adult legs is impermeable to probes or gives high unspecific staining. By fragmenting the legs and using long incubation times, the permeability problem was partly solved for antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almazán et al., 2022</xref>) but could not be overcome with conventional <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization probes, presumably due to the large molecular size of these probes. We therefore turned to Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR), a sensitive <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization method that makes use of much shorter probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). Starting from an HCR protocol used in <italic>Parhyale</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>), we adapted HCR to adult legs by extending the permeabilization step, adding a decalcification step to soften the cuticle, adjusting probe concentrations, and extending the incubation and washing steps (see Methods). Using this method, we are able to label specific populations of cells, such as neurons (using probes for <italic>futsch</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hummel et al., 2000</xref>) and mechanosensory organs (using probes for <italic>nompA</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chung et al., 2001</xref>), in late embryos and adult legs (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 5</xref>). This is the first time we are able to apply an <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization approach to adult legs, overcoming the cuticular permeability barrier.</p>
<p>As described earlier for immunostainings, we applied HCR to regenerated legs immediately after live imaging and were able to locate the stained cells in the live image recordings. This approach allows us to track the origins of molecularly identified cells during the course of regeneration. As a proof of principle, we track the origin of a population of <italic>spineless</italic>-expressing cells in the distal part of the regenerated carpus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>spineless</italic> is expressed in a ring of cells in the distal part of developing legs; it encodes a transcription factor that plays a role in patterning of the tarsal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Duncan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Natori et al., 2012</xref>). We find that the <italic>spineless</italic> orthologue of <italic>Parhyale</italic> is expressed in a similar pattern at the distal end of the regenerated carpus (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 6</xref>). Cell tracking reveals that the <italic>spineless</italic>-expressing cells of the distal carpus originate from epidermal cells that were widely dispersed in the carpus at the time of amputation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). These epidermal progenitors undergo 0, 1 or 2 cell divisions, and generate mostly <italic>spineless</italic>-expressing cells (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Future directions</title>
<p><italic>Parhyale</italic> stands out as an experimental system in which we can image the entire process of leg regeneration at single-cell resolution and follow the lineages and the fates of cells as the leg is re-made. This provides unique opportunities to identify the progenitors of regenerated tissues, their degree of commitment, locations, division patterns and behaviours during regeneration. Combined with high resolution live imaging of developing embryonic legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wolff et al., 2018</xref>), it also offers the chance to compare the cellular dynamics of leg regeneration with those of leg development.</p>
<p>Currently, there are two major limitations in this research approach. First, image quality limits the efficiency with which we can track cells, particularly in the deeper tissue layers. Improved image quality could be achieved with higher numerical aperture objectives, stronger fluorescence signals and longer exposure times, to increase signal-to-noise ratios and resolution. These improvements, however, come with trade-offs in terms of increased light exposure and tissue damage. An obvious improvement, in this respect, would come from replacing confocal microscopy by a more gentle imaging method, such as light-sheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Stelzer et al., 2021</xref>). Unfortunately, our current method for immobilising <italic>Parhyale</italic> legs for live imaging is incompatible with conventional light-sheet microscopy, because it requires glueing and imaging the specimens through a microscope coverslip. At present, the method we describe here provides the most robust approach to image leg regeneration in <italic>Parhyale</italic>.</p>
<p>A second limitation is the dearth of fluorescent markers that we can use to identify different cell types and cellular transitions during the course of live imaging. Until we develop such markers, the <italic>in situ</italic> labelling approaches described here will provide an efficient way to identify different cell fates at the end of live imaging.</p>

<title>Live imaging</title>
<p>To induce H2B-mRFPruby expression, animals were heat-shocked for 45 minutes at 37°C, 12-24 hours prior to the amputation. Prior to amputation, the animals were anaesthetized using 0.02% clove oil (in artificial seawater) and mounted on the glass surface of 35mm Ibidi Glass Bottom Dishes (Ibidi µ-Dish 35 mm, #81158), which served as the microscope cover slip, using surgical glue (2-octyl-cyanoacrylate, Dermabond Mini #AHVM12), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>). Aliquots of the glue are stored in the dark at room temperature. T4 and/or T5 limbs were amputated at the distal end of the carpus using a microsurgical knife (Fine Science Tools #10316-14).</p>
<p>Live imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 M27 objective (Zeiss 420650-9901-000) and a temperature control chamber set to 26 or 27°C (with the exception of dataset li51, imaged at 29°C). Imaging was carried out with the 561 nm excitation laser, a pinhole set to 38 µm (1 Airy unit), an emission window of 400-700 nm, and a GaAsP detector (detector gain 700-750 V, detector offset 0, digital gain 1.0). Laser power was typically set to 0.3% to 0.8%, which yields 0.51 to 1.37 µW at 561 nm (measured with a ThorLabs Microscope Slide Power Sensor, #S170C).</p>
<p>Images were acquired with a pixel size of 0.31-0.62 µm and a speed of 0.76-2.06 μs per pixel, averaging 2-4 images per slice. These settings were determined by early tests in which we scanned the same specimen with a range of scan speed and averaging settings and measured the signal-to-noise and contrast ratios as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ulman et al. 2017</xref> (see <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Image stacks typically consisted of 8-36 z steps taken with a step size of 1.24 to 2.48 µm. Stacks were acquired at 10-20 minute time intervals, over up to 330-1030 time points, using the Definite Focus feature of the microscope to compensate for axial image drift. Image size was typically 1024 x 800 pixels and image depth was 8-bit. The table in Suppl. Data 1 provides more information on individual imaging experiments. Under these conditions, approximately 85% of animals (18 out of 21) survive the mounting and imaging procedure. Among the imaged legs, approximately 20% show tissue damage/retraction (5 out of 37) or become arrested before the onset of regeneration (2 out of 37), while 80% go on to regenerate normally.</p>
<p>To image multiple regenerating legs simultaneously (e.g. li24, li41, li48, li51 and li52 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), T4 and T5 limbs on the same side of the animal were positioned parallel to each other during mounting, and imaged using the “tile” imaging option of the Zeiss Blue software; the two limbs were imaged as individual tiles.</p>
<p>Heat shocks were carried out during the course of imaging to boost H2B-mRFPruby expression by setting the temperature of the stage (Pecon Heatable Universal Mounting Frame KH-R S1, Pecon #020-800 153) to 40°C for 2 hours; the temperature setting of the microscope incubation chamber was kept at 26 or 27°C. At the end of the heat shock, the temperature control of the stage was turned off. Typically, 1-3 heat shocks are required during the time course of imaging.</p>
<p>After image acquisition, stacks were exported in .czi format and post-processed in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Image stacks were concatenated in Fiji (Stacks/Tools/Concatenate function), xy image shifts caused by heat-shock were corrected using the <italic>align-slices3d</italic> Fiji plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elephant-track/align-slices3d">https://github.com/elephant-track/align-slices3d</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162844">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162844</ext-link>) and z shifts were corrected manually in Fiji, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Detecting cell divisions</title>
<p>Cell divisions in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> were detected in two ways. The divisions in li13-t4 were extracted from the extensive cell tracking carried out previously in that dataset using Elephant and manual proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>). The divisions in the other datasets were detected by training an Elephant detection model to identify the nuclei of dividing cells at metaphase, followed by manual proofreading of the predictions. Training was conducted on cropped volumes of size (96 x 96 x 96 pixels) extracted from the resized image volumes that were rescaled by a factor of eight along the Z-axis to render them nearly isotropic. Each volume was augmented with random flips along all three dimensions to enhance the robustness of the model. In each iteration of training, the model was trained over 10 epochs with a batch size of 20, using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. Prediction was performed on the resized image volumes using patches of size (96 x 96 x 96 pixels). A threshold of 0.8 was applied to the probabilities to filter out low-confidence predictions. The parameters for the centre detection were set to: minimum radius (rmin) 1 µm, maximum radius (rmax) 5 µm, suppression distance (dsup) 3 µm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>).

This function allows users to automatically trace the position of a selected cell backward in time using the flow estimation algorithm integrated in Elephant. Prior to initiating the tracking process, a detection model and a flow estimation model are trained on the target image data (or a similar dataset) to ensure precise tracking. Users can select the target cell in the Elephant graphical user interface. The method then processes each timepoint iteratively, creating track links by predicting the target cell’s position at the previous time point and identifying the closest detected cell. This is achieved by predicting spots around the cell’s estimated position. If no cells are detected in the vicinity, the algorithm interpolates a new spot at the position estimated by the flow model. The maximum number of timepoints for interpolation can be specified. For detailed information on the training of the detection and flow estimation models, please refer to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>). The implementation of the backtracking function can be found in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elephant-track/elephant-client/blob/main/src/main/java/org/elephant/actions/B">https://github.com/elephant-track/elephant-client/blob/main/src/main/java/org/elephant/actions/B</ext-link> <underline>ackTrackAction.java</underline> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162848">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162848</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Optimising trade-offs between imaging resolution, image quality and light exposure</title>
<p>To optimise our image acquisition strategy, we acquired a 3D image dataset using the setup described in the previous section, at higher resolutions and image quality than in our standard experiments (0.31x0.31 µm pixel size in xy, acquired at a speed of 1.03 µs per pixel, 1.24 μm step size in z, 10 minute time intervals, with 4 averaged image replicates per splice). We then sub-sampled this dataset in different ways, yielding 5 reduced datasets that differ in xy resolution, z resolution and image quality (Datasets #1-5, see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>). Dataset #1 was made by discarding every second z slice and every second time point, yielding resolutions and image quality similar to those of our typical imaging datasets. Dataset #2 was made by discarding every second time point and by averaging only 2 images per slice, instead of 4 (better z resolution, but worse image quality than dataset #1). Dataset #3 was made by discarding every second z slice and by averaging only 2 images per slice, instead of 4 (better temporal resolution, but worse image quality than dataset #1). Dataset #4 was made by discarding every second pixel in the x and y dimensions (better z and temporal resolutions, but lower xy resolutions than dataset #1). Dataset #5 was made by using a single image per z slice and time point, rather than by averaging 4 image replicates (better z and temporal resolutions, but lower image quality than dataset #1). Averaging operations were made by averaging the raw pixel values of 2 or 4 imaging replicates. These datasets were generated using a script available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ksugar/czi_sampling/blob/main/src/czi_sampling/sampling.py">https://github.com/ksugar/czi_sampling/blob/main/src/czi_sampling/sampling.py</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162855">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162855</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Using Mastodon, we generated ground truth annotations on the original image dataset, consisting of 278 cell tracks, including 13,888 spots and 13,610 links across 55 time points (see Supplementary Data 4). From these annotations, we selected 10 tracks (including 5 tracks with cell divisions and 5 tracks without) for training Elephant; the selected tracks consisted of 699 spots and 689 links.</p>
<p>The ground truth annotations were then applied to Datasets #1 to #5. To apply these annotations to datasets #1 and #2, we had to reduce the number of time points. We did this using a Mastodon plugin (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon-averoflab">https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon-averoflab</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162873">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162873</ext-link>), generating a reduced set of ground truth annotations with 7,068 spots and 6,790 links. These annotations include 356 spots and 346 links in the 10 tracks selected for training Elephant.</p>
<p>To ensure a fair comparison of the tracking metrics across datasets of varying sizes, the training of the models was conducted using resized volumes, standardised to the same dimensions as the highest resolution data (512 x 512 x 20 pixels). Additionally, the number of iteration steps during training was kept nearly identical across all datasets, ensuring consistent model training and allowing for a reliable comparison of tracking performance.</p>
<p>The detection models were trained using a standardised approach to ensure consistency across the datasets. For Datasets #1, #3, and #4, the input image volumes were resized to dimensions of (512 x 512 x 20 pixels) with nearest-neighbour interpolation. For the remaining datasets, which were already sized at (512 x 512 x 20 pixels), no resizing was necessary. Training was conducted on cropped volumes of size (128 x 128 x 16 pixels) extracted from the resized image volumes. Each volume was augmented with random flips along all three dimensions to enhance the robustness of the model. The models were trained over 10 epochs with a batch size of 20, using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01. For Datasets #1 and #2, which contain 28 timepoints with annotations, 100 volumes were cropped from each timepoint for training in each epoch. For the other datasets, which contain 55 timepoints with annotations, 50 volumes were cropped from each timepoint for training in each epoch. During training, the centre ratio was set to 0.4, and the background threshold was set to 0, meaning that only explicitly annotated voxels were utilised in the training process. The source code used for training the detection models is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elephant-track/elephant-server/blob/trackathon-paper/script/train_trackathon.s">https://github.com/elephant-track/elephant-server/blob/trackathon-paper/script/train_trackathon.s</ext-link> <underline>h</underline> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15161691">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15161691</ext-link>). The trained detection models were then used to predict nuclei in datasets #1 to #5, following the same procedure across all datasets. The input image volumes were resized in the same manner as during training, ensuring that the model operated on images of dimensions (512 x 512 x 20 pixels). Prediction was performed directly on the resized image volumes without further patching, allowing the model to process the entire volume in one step. A threshold of 0.7 was applied to the probabilities to filter out low-confidence predictions. The parameters for the centre detection were set to: minimum radius (<italic>r<sub>min</sub></italic>) 1 µm, maximum radius (<italic>r<sub>max</sub></italic>) 5 µm, suppression distance (<italic>d<sub>sup</sub></italic>) 3 µm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The flow models were trained following a similar preprocessing as described for the detection models. Input image volumes were resized and cropped with random flips across all dimensions, as in the training of detection models. The flow models were trained over 10 epochs with a batch size of 1, employing the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00001. For Datasets #1 and #2, which include 27 pairs of successive timepoints with annotations, 100 volumes were cropped from each timepoint for training in each epoch. For the other datasets, which include 54 pairs of successive timepoints with annotations, 50 volumes were cropped from each timepoint for training in each epoch. The source code used for training the flow models is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elephant-track/elephant-server/blob/trackathon-paper/script/train_trackathon_f">https://github.com/elephant-track/elephant-server/blob/trackathon-paper/script/train_trackathon_f</ext-link> <underline>low.sh</underline>. The trained flow models were then employed for tracking by providing flow predictions. To ensure a fair comparison of the tracking metrics across datasets of varying sizes, the input image volumes were resized in the same manner as during training, ensuring that the model operated on images with dimensions of (512 x 512 x 20 pixels). Tracking was performed directly on the resized image volumes without additional patching, allowing the model to process the entire volume in a single step. In the nearest neighbour linking algorithm, the maximum distance threshold of 5 microns was applied (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sugawara et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, the maximum number of links per cell was set to 2, enabling the tracking of dividing cells.</p>
<p>The tracking results were evaluated using several metrics to comprehensively assess performance under each condition. Detection and tracking accuracy (DET and TRA) were defined in the Cell Tracking Challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Matula et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ulman et al., 2017</xref>); DET was used to evaluate the model’s ability to correctly identify the locations of cells, and TRA to assess the overall performance of the tracking model, including the accuracy of both detection and linking.</p>
<p>Detection precision and recall were calculated based on the DET analysis, offering insights into the model’s ability to correctly identify true positives (<italic>precision = TP/(TP+FP)</italic>) and its capability to recall all relevant instances (<italic>recall = TP/(TP+FN)</italic>). Linking precision and recall were derived in the same manner from the TRA analysis. In order to measure specifically the linking performance, independently of detection, we measured the linking precision and recall from tracking performed on the spots of the ground truth data (TRA on GT, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). DET and TRA scores were normalised to the range [0, 1] by calculating the cost of transforming the computed set of detections and links into the reference set (ground truth data). This normalisation provides a representation of model performance that is comparable across different datasets, independent of their size.</p>
<p>Last, we estimated the time or effort that would be required to proofread the tracking results (in arbitrary units) based on the acyclic oriented graphs matching (AOGM) metric, which is part of the calculation of TRA scores (see Table 6 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Matula et al., 2015</xref>). This metric depends both on the model’s performance and the total number of spots and links across all time points; as the number of time points increases, the number of data points requiring correction also increases, thereby impacting the proofreading time.</p>
<p>To account for variation in the training, three detection and three linking (flow) models were trained and evaluated independently on each dataset. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the averaged scores of the three iterations. The source code used for the evaluation is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ksugar/long-term-live-imaging">https://github.com/ksugar/long-term-live-imaging</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162928">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15162928</ext-link>.</p>

<p>To test the impact of image deconvolution on cell tracking performance we applied the Huygens Essential 21.04 software (Scientific Volume Imaging), using the Standard Express Deconvolution algorithm, to dataset #1.

<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>After live imaging, animals were fixed while attached to the glass surface that was used for imaging, using 4% paraformaldehyde (20% EM grade stock solution, Electron Microscopy Sciences #15713) in filtered artificial seawater for 20 minutes at room temperature. The animals were washed three times, 15 minutes each, in 1x PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. Using insect pins, holes were made in the melanized scab of the leg stumps. The regenerated legs were then detached from the glass surface by cutting them out at the distal part of the merus. They were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in 1x PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 1% normal goat serum, and stained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almazán et al., 2022</xref>).

<title>Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)</title>
<p>The HCR protocol for adult <italic>Parhyale</italic> legs is based on previous protocols developed for chicken embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choi et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>Parhyale</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>) and crinoids (<underline>Gattoni 2022</underline>). Adult legs were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (20% EM grade stock solution, Electron Microscopy Sciences #15713) in filtered artificial seawater for 50 minutes at room temperature. The legs were then washed at least three times (10 minutes each) in PTw (1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20). At this stage, the legs can be stored by washing in increasing concentrations of methanol (50%, 70%, 90% methanol in PTw) before transferring to 100% methanol at −20°C. The samples can be stored in this way for several months, and recovered by washing in decreasing concentrations of methanol (75%, 50%, 25% in PTw), and then 3 times in PTw (10 minutes each). The transfer to methanol and storage are optional.</p>
<p>The legs were then cut into fragments comprising one or more podomeres and placed in 500 µl of decalcification solution (5% EDTA in DEPC-treated water, pH adjusted to 7.5 using NaOH) overnight at room temperature.</p>
<p>On the following day, the leg fragments were transferred to 500 µl of detergent solution (1% SDS, 0.5% Tween-20, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, in DEPC-treated water) for 2 hours. They were then washed briefly in PTw (10 minutes), re-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PTw for 10 minutes. The fixative was removed with three 10-minute washes in PTw. The leg fragments were transferred to 50 µl of Probe Hybridization Buffer (30% formamide, 5x SSC, 9 mM citric acid (pH 6.0), 0.1% Tween-20, 50 µg/ml heparin, 1x Denhardt’s solution, 10% dextran sulphate; supplied by Molecular Instruments) that had been pre-heated to 37°C, and kept for 30 minutes at 37°C. The probe solution was prepared by adding 0.8 pmol (0.8 µl of 1 µM stock solution) of each probe to 50 µl of pre-warmed Probe Hybridization Buffer at 37°C (probe concentration can be increased up to 2-3 times to improve signal). The 50 µl probe solution was added to the 50 µl of Probe Hybridization Buffer containing the leg fragments (to a final volume of 100 µl), mixed and incubated overnight at 37°C.</p>
<p>On the third day, the probe solution was recovered [can be kept at −20°C and re-used] and the leg fragments were processed through four 5-minute and two 30-minute washes at 37°C, in Probe Wash Buffer (30% formamide, 5x SSC, 9 mM citric acid (pH 6.0), 0.1% Tween-20, 50 µg/ml heparin; supplied by Molecular Instruments) that had been pre-heated to 37°C. The leg fragments were then washed twice (5 minutes each) with 500 µl of SSCT (5X SSC and 0.1% Tween-20 in DEPC-treated water) at room temperature. SSCT was removed, and the sample was incubated in 50 µl of Amplification Buffer pre-warmed to room temperature (5x SSC, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% dextran sulphate; supplied by Molecular Instruments), for 30 minutes at room temperature. During this step, 2 µl of each hairpin (3 µM stock solutions of hairpins h1 and h2, supplied by Molecular Instruments, see below) were placed in separate 0.5 µl Eppendorf tubes, incubated at 95°C for 90 seconds, and then allowed to cool down to room temperature in the dark for 30 minutes. These hairpins were then mixed in 50 µl of Amplification Buffer, and mixed with the 50 µl of Amplification Buffer containing the leg fragments (to a final volume of 100 µl). This solution was incubated overnight at room temperature.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, the amplification solution containing the hairpins was recovered [can be kept at −20°C and re-used] and the leg fragments were processed through three 5-minute washes and two 30-minute washes in SSCT, at room temperature. The leg fragments were then transferred to 50% glycerol (in 1x PBS, pH 7.4) containing 1 µg/ml DAPI for 2 hours or more, at room temperature, then to 70% glycerol (in 1x PBS), and mounted for imaging.</p>
<p>In this study we used HCR probes for the <italic>Parhyale</italic> orthologues of <italic>futsch</italic> (MSTRG.441), <italic>nompA</italic> (MSTRG.6903) and <italic>spineless</italic> (MSTRG.197), ordered from Molecular Instruments (20 oligonucleotides per probe set). The transcript sequences targeted by each probe set are given in Supplementary Data 6. These were detected using the amplifier sets B1-647 (for <italic>futsch</italic>) and B5-546 (for <italic>nompA</italic> and <italic>spineless</italic>). The stained legs were imaged on an Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope.</p>
<p>To perform HCR after live imaging, the imaged legs were detached from the glass surface by cutting the leg at the distal part of the merus, using a microsurgical knife (Fine Science Tools #10316-14). The leg fragments were then placed directly into 500 µl of 4% paraformaldehyde (20% EM grade stock solution, Electron Microscopy Sciences #15713) in filtered artificial seawater for 50 minutes at room temperature. We then followed the HCR protocol described above.</p>

<p><bold>Video 1. Time lapse recording of regeneration in a Parhyale T5 leg (dataset li48-t5)</bold></p>
<p>Live imaging of nuclei labelled with H2B-mRFPruby (maximum projection of z slices 3-10). Proximal parts of the leg are to the left and the amputation site is at the right of the frame. For annotations of different features please refer to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Shortly after leg amputation (0 hpa) hemocytes adhere to the wound. By 16 hpa the wound has melanized. Up to ∼32 hpa epithelial cells can be seen migrating and accumulating at the wound, below the melanized scab (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Around 31 hpa, the leg tissues become detached from the scab (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). At 43 hpa, the carpus-propodus boundary first becomes visible, and thereafter many cells can be observed dividing at the distal part of the leg stump (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). At 56 hpa, the propodus-dactylus boundary first becomes visible (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). At later stages, tissues in more proximal parts of the leg retract, making space for the regenerating leg to grow (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F,G</xref>). After ∼90 hpa cell proliferation there is less cell proliferation and cell movements, and the nuclear positions within the tissue become fixed. Scale bars, 20 µm.</p>
<p><bold>Video 2. Time lapse recording of regeneration in a <italic>Parhyale</italic> T5 leg (dataset li36-t5)</bold></p>
<p>Live imaging of nuclei labelled with H2B-mRFPruby (maximum projection of z slices 3-15). Proximal parts of the leg are to the left and the amputation site is at the right of the frame. The sequence of events is similar to that described in Video 1, but the progression is slower: epithelial migration towards the wound is observed up to 40 hpa, tissues detach from the scab at 65 hpa, and the carpus-propodus and propodus-dactylus boundaries first become visible at 78 and 91 hpa. The tissues making up the carpus and propodus can be seen pulsating from 105 to 145 hpa. Scale bars, 20 µm.</p>

<p>(.csv file)</p>
<p><bold>Supplementary Data 2. Live imaging of regenerated Parhyale legs: maximum projections</bold> Compressed folder including maximum projections for each of the 22 time lapse recordings presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. These files were generated by projecting all or a subset of the z slices acquired at each time point. A 20 micron scale bar was added on the first time point. These files serve as a quick way to examine the 22 time lapse recordings.</p>

<p><bold>Supplementary Data 3. Live imaging of regenerated <italic>Parhyale</italic> legs: complete datasets</bold></p>
<p>Complete image 3D+T hyperstacks for each of the 22 time lapse recordings presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. These files have been generated by concatenating the original image stacks and correcting any image shifts, as described in the Methods section.</p>
<p>(22 .tif files)</p>
<p><bold>Supplementary Data 4. Analysis of trade-offs of imaging resolution and image quality</bold></p>
<p>The data used for the analysis of trade-offs in imaging and the results shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> are included in two folders. The folder named <italic>Image_and_tracking_data</italic> includes the image data (.tif, .h5, .xml), ground truth cell tracking files (.mastodon files) and three sets of cell track predictions (.mastodon files) for the original recording (labelled 00), for each of the subsampled datasets (labelled 01 to 05), and for the denoised and deconvoluted datasets. It also includes separate folders containing the Elephant detection and flow model parameters for each set of predictions. The folder named <italic>CTC_tracking_results</italic> includes the ground-truth data along with three sets of predictions for detection and tracking for each dataset, following the Cell Tracking Challenge format. For each dataset we include label image files (.tif) for every time point along with tracking results in .txt format, and each results directory (01_RES_*) also contains the evaluation results from the Cell Tracking Challenge Evaluation Software. For a detailed explanation of the folder structure, please refer to the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://public.celltrackingchallenge.net/documents/Naming%20and%20file%20content%20conventions.pdf">Cell Tracking Challenge documentation</ext-link>.</p>

<p>Building upon their previous work, the authors present an enhanced method for confocal live imaging of leg regeneration in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis. Parhyale is an emerging and tractable model system that offers insights into the evolution and mechanisms of development and regeneration. Çevrim et al. demonstrate the ability to image the complete leg regeneration process, spanning several days, with 10-20 minute time intervals and cellular resolution. They have concurrently optimized imaging conditions to enable cell tracking while minimizing phototoxicity. Additionally, they report successfully implementing HCR in situ hybridization in Parhyale, allowing for specific gene transcript staining at the endpoint of live imaging. This opens the possibility of assigning molecular identities to tracked cells.</p>
<p>A key challenge in many regeneration models is achieving continuous imaging throughout the entire regenerative process, as many organisms are difficult to immobilize or cannot tolerate extended imaging without stress. This manuscript's major strength lies in providing practical solutions to these challenges in Parhyale, a compelling and accessible arthropod model for limb regeneration. The authors also employ complementary tools to analyze time-lapse movies and correlate them with endpoint staining. Together, these advances will serve as a useful resource for researchers studying regeneration in Parhyale or in other systems where parts of this workflow can be adapted.</p>
<p>While the data demonstrating the methodological advancement and technical feasibility are solid, much of the benchmarking and regeneration characterization remains qualitative. This does not undermine the validity of the proof-of-principle, but limits the study's broader appeal.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Çevrim et al. presents a live-imaging workflow that captures the complete leg regeneration process in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, at a resolution suitable for cell tracking and gene expression analysis. Building on earlier work describing selective stages of leg regeneration (Alwes et al., 2016), the authors recorded 22 confocal time-lapse movies, starting from amputation to full regeneration. They defined three distinct phases of regeneration (wound closure, cell proliferation and morphogenesis, and differentiation) based on cellular and morphological features.</p>
<p>One movie was used to assess how imaging parameters (z-spacing, time intervals, and image quality) influence tracking reliability and the time required for manual proofreading, with an effort to minimize phototoxicity. Tracking was performed in the upper tissue layers using an improved version of the Mastodon plugin Elephant in Fiji. The same sample was fixed post-imaging for in situ hybridization using an HCR protocol adapted for adult legs, targeting the gene spineless. This enabled the alignment of gene expression with specific cell lineages and the identification of progenitor cells present at the time of amputation.</p>
<p>In summary, the study provides a proof-of-principle for combining long-term live imaging, cell tracking, and gene expression analysis during regeneration. Given the labor-intensive nature of tracking over a 5-10 day time-lapse movie, the use of a single movie for this study is well justified. The workflow, from imaging to lineage reconstruction and molecular annotation, is successfully demonstrated and well documented with this dataset.</p>
<p>Although the biological insights from the cell lineage and molecular mapping are still limited, the methodology offers significant potential in regenerative biology to uncover the cellular and molecular contributions to tissue and cell type re-formation.</p>
<p>Confocal microscopy was used for live imaging, which restricted imaging to the upper 30 µm tissue layer. Light-sheet microscopy could have provided gentler imaging and enabled imaging from multiple angles to image the whole leg. While the authors acknowledge this possibility in the manuscript, they discarded it due to incompatibility between their mounting strategy and available light-sheet microscopes. As a future direction, optimizing the mounting approach for compatibility with light-sheet microscopes could enable more comprehensive tissue imaging.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their feedback on our paper. We have taken all their comments into account in revising the manuscript. We provide a point-by-point response to their comments, below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>R<bold>eviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>The manuscript is clearly written with a level of detail that allows others to reproduce the imaging and cell-tracking pipeline. Of the 22 movies recorded one was used for cell tracking. One movie seems sufficient for the second part of the manuscript, as this manuscript presents a proof-of-principle pipeline for an imaging experiment followed by cell tracking and molecular characterisation of the cells by HCR. In addition, cell tracking in a 5-10 day time-lapse movie is an enormous time commitment.</p>
<p>My only major comment is regarding &quot;Suppl_data_5_spineless_tracking&quot;. The image file does not load.</p>
<p>It looks like the wrong file is linked to the mastodon dataset. The &quot;Current BDV dataset path&quot; is set to &quot;Beryl_data_files/BLB mosaic cut movie-02.xml&quot;, but this file does not exist in the folder. Please link it to the correct file.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected the file path in the updated version of Suppl. Data 5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>The authors state that their imaging settings aim to reduce photo damage. Do they see cell death in the regenerating legs? Is the cell death induced by the light exposure or can they tell if the same cells die between the movies? That is, do they observe cell death in the same phases of regeneration and/or in the same regions of the regenerating legs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we observe cell death during Parhyale leg regeneration. We have added the following sentence to explain this in the revised manuscript: &quot;During the course of regeneration some cells undergo apoptosis (reported in Alwes et al., 2016). Using the H2B-mRFPruby marker, apoptotic cells appear as bright pyknotic nuclei that break up and become engulfed by circulating phagocytes (see bright specks in Figure 2F).&quot;</p>
<p>We now also document apoptosis in regenerated legs that have not been subjected to live imaging in a new supplementary figure (Suppl. Figure 3),  and we refer to these observations as follows: &quot;While some cell death might be caused by photodamage, apoptosis can also be observed in similar numbers in regenerating legs that have not been subjected to live imaging (Suppl. Figure 3).&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Based on 22 movies, the authors divide the regeneration process into three phases and they describe that the timing of leg regeneration varies between individuals. Are the phases proportionally the same length between regenerating legs or do the authors find differences between fast/slow regenerating legs? If there is a difference in the proportions, why might this be?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Both early and late phases contribute to variation in the speed of regeneration, but there is no clear relationship between the relative duration of each phase and the speed of regeneration. We now present graphs supporting these points in a new supplementary figure (Suppl. Figure 2).</p>
<p>To clarify this point, we have added the following sentence in the manuscript: &quot;We find that the overall speed of leg regeneration is determined largely by variation in the speed of the early (wound closure) phase of regeneration, and to a lesser extent by variation in later phases when leg morphogenesis takes place (Suppl. Figure 2 A,B). There is no clear relationship between the relative duration of each phase and the speed of regeneration (Suppl. Figure 2 A',B').&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Based on their initial cell tracing experiment, could the authors elaborate more on what kind of biological information can be extracted from the cell lineages, apart from determining which is the progenitor of a cell? What does it tell us about the cell population in the tissue? Is there indication of multi- or pluripotent stem cells? What does it say about the type of regeneration that is taking place in terms of epimorphosis and morphallaxis, the old concepts of regeneration?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the first paragraph of Future Directions we describe briefly the kind of biological information that could be gained by applying our live imaging approach with appropriate cell-type markers (see below). We do not comment further, as we do not currently have this information at hand. Regarding the concepts of epimorphosis and morphallaxis, as we explain in Alwes et al. 2016, these terms describe two extreme conditions that do not capture what we observe during Parhyale leg regeneration. Our current work does not bring new insights on this topic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 5. The authors mention the possibility of identifying the cell ID based on transcriptomic profiling data. Can they suggest how many and which cell types they expect to find in the last stage based on their transcriptomic data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added this sentence: &quot;Using single-nucleus transcriptional profiling, we have identified approximately 15 transcriptionally-distinct cell types in adult Parhyale legs (Almazán et al., 2022), including epidermis, muscle, neurons, hemocytes, and a number of still unidentified cell types.&quot;</p>

<p>Page 8. The HCR in situ protocol probably has another important advantage over the conventional in situ protocol, which is not mentioned in this study. The hybridisation step in HCR is performed at a lower temperature (37˚C) than in conventional in situ hybridisation (65˚C, Rehm et al., 2009). In other organisms, a high hybridisation temperature affects the overall tissue morphology and cell location (tissue shrinkage). A lower hybridisation temperature has less impact on the tissue and makes manual cell alignment between the live imaging movie and the fixed HCR in situ stained specimen easier and more reliable. If this is also the case in Parhyale, the authors must mention it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This may be correct, but all our specimens were treated at 37˚C, so we cannot assess whether hybridisation temperature affects morphological preservation in our specimens.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 9. The authors should include more information on the spineless study. What been is spineless? What do the cell lineages tell about the spineless progenitors, apart from them being spread in the tissue at the time of amputation? Do spineless progenitors proliferate during regeneration? Do any spineless expressing cells share a common progenitor cell?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now point out that spineless encodes a transcription factor. We provide a summary of the lineages generating spineless-expressing cells in Suppl. Figure 6, and we explain that &quot;These epidermal progenitors undergo 0, 1 or 2 cell divisions, and generate mostly spineless-expressing cells (Suppl. Figure 5).&quot;</p>

<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>MC 1. Given that most of the technical advances necessary to achieve the work described in this manuscript have been published previously, it would be helpful for the authors to more clearly identify the primary novelty of this manuscript. The abstract and introduction to the manuscript focus heavily on the technical details of imaging and analysis optimization and some additional summary of the implications of these advances should be included here to aid the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This paper describes a technical advance. While previous work (Alwes et al. 2016) established some key elements of our live imaging approach, we were not at that time able to record the entire time course of leg regeneration (the longest recordings were 3.5 days long). Here we present a method for imaging the entire course of leg regeneration (up to 10 days of imaging), optimised to reduce photodamage and to improve cell tracking. We also develop a method of in situ staining in cuticularised adult legs (an important technical breakthrough in this experimental system), which we combine with live imaging to determine the fate of tracked cells. We have revised the abstract and introduction of the paper to point out these novelties, in relation to our previous publications.</p>
<p>In the abstract we explain: &quot;Building on previous work that allowed us to image different parts of the process of leg regeneration in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, we present here a method for live imaging that captures the entire process of leg regeneration, spanning up to 10 days, at cellular resolution. Our method includes (1) mounting and long-term live imaging of regenerating legs under conditions that yield high spatial and temporal resolution but minimise photodamage, (2) fixing and in situ staining of the regenerated legs that were imaged, to identify cell fates, and (3) computer-assisted cell tracking to determine the cell lineages and progenitors of identified cells. The method is optimised to limit light exposure while maximising tracking efficiency.&quot;</p>
<p>The introduction includes the following text: &quot;Our first systematic study using this approach presented continuous live imaging over periods of 2-3 days, capturing key events of leg regeneration such as wound closure, cell proliferation and morphogenesis of regenerating legs with single-cell resolution (Alwes et al., 2016). Here, we extend this work by developing a method for imaging the entire course of leg regeneration, optimised to reduce photodamage and to improve cell tracking. We also develop a method of in situ staining of gene expression in cuticularised adult legs, which we combine with live imaging to determine the fate of tracked cells.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>MC 2. The description of the regeneration time course is nicely detailed but also very qualitative. A major advantage of continuous recording and automated cell tracking in the manner presented in this manuscript would be to enable deeper quantitative characterization of cellular and tissue dynamics during regeneration. Rather than providing movies and manually annotated timelines, some characterization of the dynamics of the regeneration process (the heterogeneity in this is very very interesting, but not analyzed at all) and correlating them against cellular behaviors would dramatically increase the impact of the work and leverage the advances presented here. For example, do migration rates differ between replicates? Division rates? Division synchrony? Migration orientation? This seems to be an incredibly rich dataset that would be fascinating to explore in greater detail, which seems to me to be the primary advance presented in this manuscript. I can appreciate that the authors may want to segregate some biological findings from the method, but I believe some nominal effort highlighting the quantitative nature of what this method enables would strengthen the impact of the paper and be useful for the reader. Selecting a small number of simple metrics (eg. Division frequency, average cell migration speed) and plotting them alongside the qualitative phases of the regeneration timeline that have already been generated would be a fairly modest investment of effort using tools that already exist in the Mastodon interface, I would roughly estimate on the order of an hour or two per dataset. I believe that this effort would be well worth it and better highlight a major strength of the approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The primary goal of this work was to establish a robust method for continuous long-term live imaging of regeneration, but we do appreciate that a more quantitative analysis would add value to the data we are presenting. We tried to address this request in three steps:</p>
<p>First, we examined whether clear temporal patterns in cell division, cell movements or other cellular features can be observed in an accurately tracked dataset (li13-t4, tracked in Sugawara et al. 2022). To test this we used the feature extraction functions now available on the Mastodon platform (see link). We could discern a meaningful temporal pattern for cell divisions (see below); the other features showed no interpretable pattern of variation.</p>
<p>Second, we asked whether we could use automated cell tracking to analyse the patterns of cell division in all our datasets. Using an Elephant deep learning model trained on the tracks of the li13-t4 dataset, we performed automated cell tracking in the same dataset, and compared the pattern of cell divisions from the automated cell track predictions with those coming from manually validated cell tracks. We observed that the automated tracks gave very imprecise results, with a high background of false positives obscuring the real temporal pattern (see images below, with validated data on the left, automated tracking on the right). These results show that the automated cell tracking is not accurate enough to provide a meaningful picture on the pattern of cell divisions.</p>
<p>Third, we tried to improve the accuracy of detection of dividing cells by additional training of Elephant models on each dataset (to lower the rate of false positives), followed by manual proofreading. Given how labour intensive this is, we could only apply this approach to 4 additional datasets. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure 4.</p>

<p>MC 3. The authors describe the challenges faced by their described approach:</p>
<p>Using this mode of semi-automated and manual cell tracking, we find that most cells in the upper slices of our image stacks (top 30 microns) can be tracked with a high degree of confidence. A smaller proportion of cell lineages are trackable in the deeper layers.</p>
<p>Given that the authors quantify this in Table 1, it would aid the reader to provide metrics in the manuscript text at this point. Furthermore, the metrics provided in Table 1 appear to be for overall performance, but the text describes that performance appears to be heavily depth dependent. Segregating the performance metrics further, for example providing DET, TRA, precision and recall for superficial layers only and for the overall dataset, would help support these arguments and better highlight performance a potential adopter of the method might expect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised manuscript we have added data on the tracking performance of Elephant in relation to imaging depth in Suppl. Figure 3. These data confirm our original statement (which was based on manual tracking) that nuclei are more challenging to track in deeper layers.</p>
<p>We point to these new results in two parts of the paper, as follows: &quot;A smaller proportion of cells are trackable in the deeper layers (see Suppl. Figure 3)&quot;, and &quot;Our results, summarised in Table 1A, show that the detection of nuclei can be enhanced by doubling the z resolution at the expense of xy resolution and image quality. This improvement is particularly evident in the deeper layers of the imaging stacks, which are usually the most challenging to track (Suppl. Figure 3).&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>MC 4. Performance characterization in Table 1 appears to derive from a single dataset that is then subsampled and processed in different ways to assess the impact of these changes on cell tracking and detection performance. While this is a suitable strategy for this type of optimization it leaves open the question of performance consistency across datasets. I fully recognize that this type of quantification can be onerous and time consuming, but some attempt to assess performance variability across datasets would be valuable. Manual curation over a short time window over a random sampling of the acquired data would be sufficient to assess this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that similar trade-offs will apply to all our datasets because tracking performance is constrained by the same features, which are intrinsic to our system; e.g. by the crowding of nuclei in relation to axial resolution, or the speed of mitosis in relation to the temporal resolution of imaging. We therefore do not see a clear rationale for repeating this analysis. On a practical level, our existing image datasets could not be subsampled to generate the various conditions tested in Table 1, so proving this point experimentally would require generating new recordings, and tracking these to generate ground truth data. This would require months of additional work.</p>
<p>A second, related question is whether Elephant would perform equally well in detecting and tracking nuclei across different datasets. This point has been addressed in the Sugawara et al. 2022 paper, where the performance of Elephant was tested on diverse fluorescence datasets.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>• The authors should clearly specify what are the key technical improvements compared to their previous studies (Alwes et al. 2016, Elife; Konstantinides &amp; Averof 2014, Science). There, the approaches for mounting, imaging, and cell tracking are already introduced, and the imaging is reported to run for up to 7 days in some cases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Konstantinides and Averof (2014) we did not present any live imaging at cellular resolution. In Alwes et al. (2016) we described key elements of our live imaging approach, but we were never able to record the entire time course of leg regeneration. The longest recordings in that work were 3.5 days long.</p>
<p>We have revised the abstract and introduction to clarify the novelty of this work, in relation to our previous publications. Please see our response to comment MC1 of reviewer 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• While the authors mention testing the effect of imaging parameters (such as scanning speed and line averaging) on the imaging/tracking outcome, very little or no information is provided on how this was done beyond the parameters that they finally arrived to.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Scan speed and averaging parameters were determined by measuring contrast and signal-to-noise ratios in images captured over a range of settings. We have now added these data in Supplementary Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• The authors claim that, using the acquired live imaging data across entire regeneration time course, they are now able to confirm and extend their description of leg regeneration. However, many claims about the order and timing of various cellular events during regeneration are supported only by references to individual snapshots in figures or supplementary movies. Presenting a more quantitative description of cellular processes during regeneration from the acquired data would significantly enhance the manuscript and showcase the usefulness of the improved workflow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The events we describe can be easily observed in the maximum projections, available in Suppl. Data 2. Regarding the quantitative analysis, please see our response to comment MC2 of reviewer 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Table 1 summarizes the performance of cell tracking using simulated datasets of different quality. However only averages and/or maxima are given for the different metrics, which makes it difficult to evaluate the associated conclusions. In some cases, only 1 or 2 test runs were performed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The metrics extracted from each of the three replicates, per dataset, are now included in Suppl. Data 4.</p>
<p>We consistently used 3 replicates to measure tracking performance with each of the datasets. The &quot;replicates&quot; column label in Table 1 referred to the number of scans that were averaged to generate the image, not to the replicates used for estimating the tracking performance. To avoid confusion, we changed that label to &quot;averaging&quot;.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• OPTIONAL: An imaging approach that allows using the current mounting strategy but could help with some of the tradeoffs is using a spinning-disk confocal microscope instead of a laser scanning one. If the authors have such a system available, it could be interesting to compare it with their current scanning confocal setup.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Preliminary experiments that we carried out several years ago on a spinning disk confocal (with a 20x objective and the CSU-W1 spinning disk) were not very encouraging, and we therefore did not pursue this approach further. The main problem was bad image quality in deeper tissue layers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>• The presented imaging protocol was optimized for one laser wavelength only (561 nm) - this should be mentioned when discussing the technical limitations since animals tend to react differently to different wavelengths. Same settings might thus not be applicable for imaging a different fluorescent protein.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the second paragraph of the Results section, we explain that we perform the imaging at long wavelengths in order to minimise photodamage. It should be clear to the readers that changing the excitation wavelength will have an impact for long-term live imaging.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• For transferability, it would be useful if the intensity of laser illumination was measured and given in the Methods, instead of just a relative intensity setting from the imaging software. Similarly,more details of the imaging system should be provided where appropriate (e.g., detector specifications).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now measured the intensity of the laser illumination and added this information in the</p>
<p>Methods: &quot;Laser power was typically set to 0.3% to 0.8%, which yields 0.51 to 1.37 µW at 561 nm (measured with a ThorLabs Microscope Slide Power Sensor, #S170C).&quot;</p>
<p>Regarding the imaging system and the detector, we provide all the information that is available to us on the microscope's technical sheets.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• The versions of analysis scripts associated with the manuscript should be uploaded to an online repository that permanently preserves the respective version.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The scripts are now available on gitbub and online repositories. The relevant links are included in the revised manuscript.</p>
