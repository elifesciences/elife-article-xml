<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The brain predicts regularities in sensory inputs at multiple complexity levels, with neuronal mechanisms that remain elusive. Here, we monitored auditory cortex activity during the local-global paradigm, a protocol nesting different regularity levels in sound sequences. We observed that mice encode local predictions based on stimulus occurrence and stimulus transition probabilities, because auditory responses are boosted upon prediction violation. This boosting was due to both short-term adaptation and an adaptation-independent surprise mechanism resisting anesthesia. In parallel, and only in wakefulness, VIP interneurons responded to the omission of the locally expected sound repeat at sequence ending, thus providing a chunking signal potentially useful for establishing global sequence structure. When this global structure was violated, by either shortening the sequence or ending it with a locally expected but globally unexpected sound transition, activity slightly increased in VIP and PV neurons respectively. Hence, distinct cellular mechanisms predict different regularity levels in sound sequences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to predict incoming sensory inputs at different timescales is a key cognitive function both in humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dehaene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Friston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</xref>). Predictions are classically revealed by specific responses when a sensory event violates an expectation which stems either from the observation of regularities in passively observed stimulus sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carbajal and Malmierca, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gavornik and Bear, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Grimm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lao-Rodríguez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Näätänen et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Squires et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">N. Ulanovsky et al., 2004</xref>) or from the repeated experience of sensory outcomes produced by motor actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Attinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Audette et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Solyga and Keller, 2024</xref>). While the first evidence of sequence violation responses were based on the repetition of the same stimulus, e.g. in the so-called oddball or stimulus-specific adaptation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Farley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lao-Rodríguez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Näätänen et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Squires et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Taaseh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</xref>), a large range of experiments also revealed predictive processes for sequences of two or more stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Asokan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gavornik and Bear, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tang et al., 2023</xref>). Different levels of prediction complexity were conceptualized in parallel with these experiments, allowing to uncover the brain signatures of different predictive processing levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wacongne et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chao et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Parras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hamm and Yuste, 2016</xref>). The simplest form of prediction relates to the occurrence probability of a single stimulus, irrespective of other stimuli. Occurrence probability can be captured by stimulus specific adaptation mechanisms, in which a variable, such as synaptic strength or neural excitability is updated by each stimulus occurrence and keeps a short-term memory of the occurrence thanks to a long relaxation time constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ulanovsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tsodyks and Markram, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Varela et al., 1997</xref>). Numerous studies indicate that stimulus-specific adaptation mechanisms play an important role in the violation responses observed in oddball paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hamm and Yuste, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Parras et al., 2017</xref>). At a higher complexity level, some predictions require the knowledge of the probability of a stimulus conditioned on the occurrence of one or more earlier events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balsam and Gallistel, 2009</xref>). In many cases, these relationships can be effectively captured by local transition probabilities between successive stimuli (probability of stimulus N given the identity of stimulus N-1). In such cases, violation responses in the brain largely reflect violations of learned first-order local transition probabilities, as observed both in humans and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kaposvari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Maheu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Meyniel et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, at an even higher level, some sequence structures are defined globally, meaning that the occurrence of a stimulus is fully predicted if and only if multiple previous stimuli are taken in account, possibly including information about the number of stimuli within identified chunks of stimuli interleaved by sequence interruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dehaene et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, the ability to chunk sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ericcson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fonollosa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Graybiel, 1998</xref>) is an important part of predictive processing.</p>
<p>These different levels of regularity are all present in the local-global paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>). In this paradigm, two distinct tones (denoted X and Y) are presented within short sequences of five tones (either XXXXX or XXXXY), which are themselves repeated multiple times in two different types of blocks : in one block (denoted XX for simplicity), the frequent sequence is XXXXX, and in the other block (denoted XY), the frequent sequence is XXXXY. This paradigm leads to both local and global expectations. The local expectation arises from the frequent transition X&gt;X, which is violated at the end of XXXXY sequences. The global expectation arises from the frequent sequence, which is violated by occasionally presenting a rare unexpected sequence (XXXXX instead of XXXXY, or vice-versa). In XX block, hearing XXXXX XXXXX … XXXXY violates both a local and a global expectation, while in XY blocks, hearing XXXXY XXXXY … XXXXX violates only the global expectation that the sequence should terminates with a different sound Y. This paradigm also modulates stimulus probability (one sound X is more frequent than the other sound Y) and thereby produces stimulus-specific adaptation.</p>
<p>The local-global paradigm has been applied extensively to show that violations at different complexity levels produce brain responses with different cortical localization, timing and sensitivity to changes in consciousness and attention. Global violations produce late responses in temporal and prefrontal cortices of awake humans and non-human primates, accompanied by top-down inputs to the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bellet et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chao et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">El Karoui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mazancieux et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Uhrig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wacongne et al., 2011b</xref>). Those global violation responses are strongly affected when the subject is anesthetized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nourski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tasserie et al., 2022</xref>), sleeps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Strauss et al., 2015</xref>) or is instructed to divert his attention away from the stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, stimulus-specific adaptation and responses to violations of local predictions (transition probabilities between successive stimuli) are fast, dominate in sensory cortices, largely resist inattention, sleep or anesthesia, and can even occur in deep subcortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Parras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tang et al., 2023</xref>). This set of results suggests the existence of distinct mechanisms for a hierarchy of prediction levels. Yet, in the absence of a neural circuit-scale analysis of the hierarchy of violation responses, the neuronal mechanisms underlying these key predictive mechanisms remain largely elusive.</p>
<p>Here, we performed two-photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels electrophysiology in the auditory cortex of awake and anesthetized mice, during the local-global paradigm. We show that even if responses purely attributable to global violations are weak, the auditory cortex captures different types of sequence violations based on several parallel mechanisms. Local transitions are signaled by an increase of the sound response amplitude magnified if the transition is globally unexpected. This modulation relies on two anesthesia-resistant mechanisms: stimulus-specific adaptation and an adaptation-independent surprise response operating on long time scales. In parallel, VIP interneurons signal stimulus omissions and sequence terminations in an anesthesia-sensitive manner, while PV interneurons weakly signal global violation. Together, these results indicate that the mouse brain learns several levels of regularities in auditory sequences thanks to a set of mechanisms distributed in the local cortical circuits.</p>

<title>Sequence violations are broadly signaled in the mouse auditory cortex</title>
<p>We adapted the local-global paradigm to awake, passively listening mice, which were head-fixed and held in a tube to allow for simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging of the auditory cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). With two distant pures tones, A (4 kHz) and B (12 kHz), we generated four different 5-tone sequences starting with 4 repetitions of the same tone and terminating with a local sound transition (AAAAB, BBBBA) or with no transition (AAAAA, BBBBB). Tones within a sequence were 50 ms long, and their onsets were regularly spaced by a 237.5 ms time-interval. We presented 4 different blocks of 125 sequences interspaced by 1.5s of silence. In each block, the frequent sequence was first presented 25 times to create a global expectation, then, it was randomly replaced in 25 of its next 100 repetitions with an oddball sequence that differed only in the last stimulus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In 10 of the 25 oddball sequences, the last sound was omitted and, in the 15 remaining oddball sequences, B was replaced by A or conversely.</p>

<p>Each mouse was presented with all four possible blocks (frequent sequence = AAAAA, AAAAB, BBBBB or BBBBA), each repeated twice in a randomized fashion. Two blocks with common AAAA and BBBB sequences were used to control for rare omission sequences in the 5-tone blocks. Two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2/3 neurons in the auditory cortex was performed continuously during each block yielding fluorescence variations produced by sounds across several hundred GCAMP6s expressing neurons across large 1×1mm field-of-views (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>). In order to estimate firing rate modulations in the neurons, we used a simple linear deconvolution technique which is robust for indicators with a long decay time constant like GCAMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deneux et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">2016</xref>). This method yielded sufficient temporal resolution to partially isolate individual tone responses in a given 5-tone sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). With this method, we collected responses to the four different sequences in each of the two possible conditions (common or rare) and to omission sequences for 8514 neurons across 12 sessions and 4 mice. Three different depths (150 µm, 250 µm, and 350 µm) were recorded in each mouse on three separate days.</p>
<p>Averaging deconvolved signals across all sampled neurons, we observed that the population response after the last sound was larger when a sequence is rare than when a sequence is common, but only for AAAAB and BBBBA sequences, which have a local transition at the last sound (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). In the absence of a local transition (AAAAA or BBBBB, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D,E</xref>) or for omission sequence (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>), the population response level was not significantly different for rare <italic>vs</italic> common sequences. Therefore, we observed a global violation response at population level in layer 2/3 neurons only when the global violation was coupled to a local violation (local+global) and not in absence of local violation (pure global). The local+global violation response was seen in 10 to 20% of the recorded neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), which provided enough information to discriminate between rare and common sequences in single trials with cross validated linear classifiers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Intrigued by the absence of a response to the pure global violation seen in humans and non-human primates, all using electrophysiological techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chao et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Uhrig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wacongne et al., 2011b</xref>), we performed recordings using Neuropixels probes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), also targeted to mainly layer 2-3 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). Theoretically calcium imaging with a sensor expressed based on the synapsin promotor and extracellular recordings sample the same broad population of neurons. However, sampling biases across techniques are likely. For example, rapidly firing interneurons produce weak calcium signals that may not be efficiently detected in calcium imaging, while their dense firing is likely efficiently detected in spike sorting. We therefore did not expect identical results from each methodology. We isolated 559 single units in 8 recordings in 4 mice during which only BBBBA and BBBBB blocks were presented (see methods). Pooling together the activity of these units, we observed a clear local+global violation response consistent with calcium imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I-J</xref>). However, surprisingly, we also observed a weak but significant pure global violation response appearing both at the population level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I-J</xref>) and in a significant fraction of neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). This response occurred more than 200ms after the last sound (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), and provided enough information to discriminate between rare and common sequences above chance level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k</xref>).</p>

<title>Local violations selectively modulate the responses of neurons tuned to the violating sound</title>
<p>To identify functional cell types involved in the signaling of sequence structure violations in a hypothesis-free manner, we performed a clustering analysis using the correlation between temporal response profiles across all conditions as a metric of functional similarity between neurons (see methods). Clustering was performed in a cross-validated manner, taking only a fraction of available trials to build the clusters and using the remaining fraction of trials to verify that the clustered response profiles were not emerging from the aggregation of similar noise patterns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>) as occurred occasionally (e.g. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The clustering of calcium imaging data revealed diverse response types, with a small fraction of clusters showing suppression in response to A or B sounds and a larger fraction of clusters activated by A or B with more or less specificity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). No specific response to pure global violations (rare XXXXX) was observed. By contrast, most neuron clusters activated by A or B displayed an increased response to the preferred sound when this sound generated a local+global violation (rare XXXXY) as compared to when the violation was only local (common XXXXY) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), consistent with the population-level results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig1</xref>). One exception to this rule was observed in cluster #30 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) which responds to the B tone only at the end of AAAAB sequences and not for BBBBX sequences. Clusters of isolated single units with boosted responses upon local+global violations were also observed in Neuropixels data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In addition, Neuropixels data uncovered a large fraction of clusters suppressed during the sequence. This was in line with the dominance of suppressive response at the population level in this dataset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>) and contrasted with calcium imaging data, indicating possible sampling biases across the two datasets. Notably, in two Neuropixel clusters, the suppressed response was followed by weak activating responses to pure global violations with a time course similar to the long lasting response profiles of global violations responses observed in human MEG or EEG recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Strauss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wacongne et al., 2011b</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). However, if some of these responses were statistically significant when individually tested, the significance level was above threshold when accounting for multiple testing across all extracted clusters. This further corroborates the observation that responses to global violations are weak in the mouse auditory cortex if not combined with a local violation.</p>

<title>Modulation of sound responses by unexpected local violations is only partially due to adaptation</title>
<p>The large modulation of sound responses when a global violation is accompanied by a local violation (rare XXXXY) could be due to a stronger adaptation to the less frequent oddball sound (Y) in the control blocks where XXXXY sequences are repeated, compared to blocks where XXXXX sequences are repeated. To test this hypothesis, we reasoned that recovery from adaptation in the cortex is typically complete after 2-3s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ulanovsky et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore increased the inter-sequence interval to 28-30s (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and repeated two-photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels recordings in awake mice. Specifically, we sampled 9441 neurons in 27 recordings in 8 mice with two-photon imaging, and 559 single units in 8 recordings in 4 mice with Neuropixel (same dataset as for the 1.5s interval). We observed that the larger responses at the end of XXXXY sequences are maintained despite the wide intersequence interval in calcium imaging (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref>) and Neuropixels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) data. This reflected a positive response modulation in neurons tuned to the oddball sound as revealed by a clustering analysis of single neuron responses (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figs. S3</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>). In both datasets, no specific response was observed for pure global violations (rare XXXXX, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-E</xref>). The local+global effect for the ∼30s inter-sequence interval, was slightly weaker than for the 1.5s inter-sequence interval in calcium imaging population responses (30s: rare XXXXY = 151.50% ± 7.95 % common XXXXY; 1.5s: rare XXXXY = 182.15% ± 11.89 % common XXXXY; p=0.0124, Wilcoxon ranksum test, n=12 sessions for 1.5s and n=27 sessions for 30s interval) compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Accordingly, a smaller number of neurons were modulated by the global violation for the long inter-sequence interval even when correcting for the smaller number of rare sequences for the 30s interval protocol (30s: 8.66% ± 1.48 %; 1.5s: 16.55% ± 2.36%; p=3×10-3, Wilcoxon ranksum test, n=12 sessions for 1.5s and n=27 sessions for 30s interval, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Overall, those results suggest that only part of the local+global response for the 1.5s inter-sequence interval is due to stimulus specific adaptation.</p>

<p>To estimate the time scale on which stimulus specific adaptation plays a role in sound response modulations, we performed two-photon calcium imaging of 593 auditory cortex neurons (2 recordings in 1 mouse) during a classical oddball sound paradigm in which a standard tone is repeated with a fixed inter-tone interval, and occasionally replaced with deviant tone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Varying systematically the inter-tone interval, we observed larger oddball responses compared to when the same tone is a standard up to a 2s interval, but not for 4s or larger intervals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). This indicates that recovery from adaptation is complete after 4s. To corroborate this, we performed two-photon calcium imaging while presenting in the same imaging sessions two blocks with BBBBA or BBBBB sequences repeated at a 30s interval, occasionally violated by BBBBB and BBBBA sequences respectively, and two blocks with in which the A tone was presented with the same time intervals as in the BBBBA and BBBBB blocks but in the absence of B tones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). We observed in 6906 neurons collected in 8 recordings in 3 mice that the modulation of responses to rare A’s occurred only in the presence of the B tones associated with A in the repeated sequences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Together, these results show that responses to local + global violations correspond to a surprise mechanism that cannot be entirely explained by adaptation. This therefore suggests that the local + global violation response reflects a prediction about the short time scale structure of the one second XXXXX sequence chunks rather than about the occurrence frequency of the oddball sound Y.</p>

<title>Unexpected local violations produce a surprise response based on recently experienced sequence structure</title>
<p>To further disentangle the contribution of adaptation and of the sequence-based predictions in violation responses, we reasoned that adaptation corresponds to a dampening of the response to a specific stimulus over frequent repeats, whereas the violation of a prediction should rather correspond to an increase of the response for stimuli that are unlikely to occur based on the predictable context. We therefore plotted neural responses for each sequence repetition across the full protocols with 1.5s and ∼30s time intervals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). For the 1.5s interval, we observed a reproducible diminution of the response across the first three XXXXY sequences when common (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, C</xref>) which reflects adaptation. For the 30s interval, we observed no decrease of the responses to the Y tone across successive repeats of the XXXXY sequence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, D</xref>). Instead, responses to Y when not predictable based on sequence context were always larger than when Y is regularly repeated at the end of the sequence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), corroborating the idea that they reflect a surprise response to an unexpected transition rather than adaptation. For the 1.5s interval, we also observed a significant diminution of the end response to the rare XXXXY sequences across a single block (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,C</xref>). These observations indicate the coexistence of three types of phenomena: (i) stimulus-specific adaptation, that we quantified as the difference between the first and last response to a stimulus in a block, (ii) surprise, which we quantified as the difference between the responses to the first rare and first common XXXXY, and therefore reflects the elevation of XXXXY response when XXXXX is predicted, (iii) surprise adaptation, which is the diminution of the surprise response upon frequent surprises (first - last rare XXXXY). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, these three phenomena coexist when the sequences are repeated at a short interval, but only the surprise component is maintained for the long inter-sequence interval. This surprise response, similar to adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nieto-Diego and Malmierca, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Taaseh et al., 2011</xref>), is maintained during anesthesia (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>), suggesting that it is a pre-attentive phenomenon.</p>

<title>VIP interneurons signal sequence termination and omission of expected local violations</title>
<p>We next investigated how vasoactive intestinal peptide positive (VIP) interneurons in the auditory cortex represent sequence violations. VIP neurons were shown to signal stimulus local omissions of image repeats in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Garrett et al., 2020</xref>), and are therefore important candidates for violation signals in the auditory cortex. We specifically expressed GCAMP6s by local injections of a floxed AAV-GCAMP6s virus in the auditory cortex of VIP-Cre mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We imaged 3547 VIP neurons across 15 sessions, using a local-global protocol that included oddball sequences with replacement or omission of the last sound. The inter-sequence interval was 1.5s. Strikingly, the population of VIP neurons was globally suppressed by all sequences with a late rebound activity after the sequence whose amplitude was significantly larger for two particular violations: for an unexpected local transition in rare AAAAB sequences (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) and for the omission of B in blocks where AAAAB is the standard sequence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). In blocks where B was the standard tone, local violation responses were weak and we could not detect responses to omission, probably due to the fact that we sampled more extensively VIP neurons preferring tone A. Violation signals provided enough information to decode above chance level if a sequence was rare or common in blocks where A was the standard tone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Interestingly, the strong response suppression disappeared under isoflurane anesthesia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), as well as violation responses for omissions (AAAA in AAAAB block: −0.0010 ±0.002% dΔF/F, AAAA in AAAA control block: 0.0006% dΔF/F ± 0.001%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.707; Mann-Whitney U test; n=20 for rare and n=100 for common repetitions), suggesting a strong re-organisation of VIP neuron activity during anesthesia. The population response profile however concealed a diversity of neuronal responses across VIP neurons which we could uncover by clustering neurons according to their response time courses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). While many VIP neurons were suppressed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, cluster 4), others were driven by sounds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, clusters 1, 2, 3), and some were silent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>, cluster 7). Most remarkably, a small but salient population of VIP interneurons signaled the termination of sequences (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, cluster 5). Termination responses were characterized by a slight suppression during all sequences followed by a large activity increase about 200ms after the last sound. When the sequence was shortened by one sound the termination response occurred earlier, showing that it follows the actual sequence structure and not a global expectation based on repeated sequence length. Moreover, the termination signal was similar across all sequences although slightly larger for unexpected omissions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, cluster 5), consistent with population observations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). During anesthesia many sound-driven, suppressed and sequence termination neurons became unresponsive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). By contrast, VIP neurons that were silent in the awake state became responsive under anesthesia, confirming the massive re-organisation of VIP neuron activity in this state (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we characterized auditory cortex activity during the local-global paradigm to investigate the mechanisms underlying the predictive processing of recurring auditory sequences. Our results indicate first that the most salient effect of sequence structure is to modulate sound-specific responses depending on the predictability of perceived sounds. The same sound triggers larger responses when it is weakly predictable than when it is highly predictable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In line with observations made over several decades with the classical oddball paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nelken, 2014</xref>), part of this modulation is due to stimulus-specific adaptation, which corresponds to a progressive decrease in responsiveness upon repetition of a stimulus. This decrease was clearly exhibited by deviant sounds in the local-global protocol when the intersequence interval was 1.5s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Adaptation level is incremented by stimulus repeats occurring within its typical recovery time. Therefore, it is a suitable process to estimate the occurrence probability of a sound through a running average over a short time scale, independent of the presence of other sounds (at least in the absence of cross-stimulus adaptation which occurs when sounds are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yarden et al., 2022</xref>)). The occurrence probability of a sound can also be deduced from the local transition probability between sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Meyniel et al., 2016</xref>). The existence of processes performing such predictions in the mouse brain is demonstrated by our observation that a repeated local transition between an X and a Y sound leads to a lower response to Y than when the transition is unexpected, even over a timescale that does not allow for an occurrence probability estimate via adaptation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This adaptation-independent and anesthesia-resistant violation response aligns with previous observations of stronger responses to deviant stimuli in mice trained with repeated visual stimulus sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gavornik and Bear, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tang et al., 2023</xref>) although in these cases the protocol does not allow disentangling the violation of transition probabilities from stimulus-specific and cross-stimulus adaptation. Our results therefore clearly indicate that at least two parallel processes estimate stimulus occurrence probability in the sensory cortex : one estimating the probability of a sound independently of other sounds and one making an estimation of conditional probability relative to the previous sound (at least). The modulations of sound response resulting from the violation of these predictions are cumulative and involve the same sound responsive neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figs. S3</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to these two processes which modulate sensory responses to signal local changes in the sequence, we have also observed several types of anesthesia-sensitive responses that specifically signal more global aspects of the expected sequence structure or of its violations. The first and most robust response type was observed in a subgroup of VIP-positive interneurons which elevate their firing rate about 200ms after the end of a sequence, irrespective of the sequence type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These responses differ from offset responses in the auditory cortex by their long delay and their lack of specificity. These neurons were a small fraction of all VIP neurons, about 2% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) and therefore are a rare cell type. They signal the interruption of systematic sound repeats and could serve to mark the border of sequence chunks. These responses could be considered to signal the omission of the next sound in a regular sequence of sounds irrespective of the specific sequence content. Their response pattern is similar to the chunking signals that are observed in the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex and mark the beginning and end of action sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barnes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fujii and Graybiel, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In parallel with these termination responses, we observed responses of the population of VIP interneurons to omissions of the B sound in repeated AAAAB sequences, but not to omissions of A in repeated AAAAA sequences and not to omissions in BBBBA blocks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). At the single neuron level, these omission responses reflected a small rebound of neurons that were suppressed during the sequence, or more rarely, a boosting of a ramping response during the sequence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The absence of omissions responses when XXXXX is the expected sequence suggests that the omission detection mechanism requires a salient expectation. As we did not observe a salient response to A in BBBBA sequences in the sampled population of VIP neurons, we speculate that the absence of omission responses for the absence of A in BBBBA sequence was due to weak signaling of A in the considered VIP population. Omission responses have been recently observed through multielectrode recordings in the auditory cortex of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lao-Rodríguez et al., 2023</xref>). Our results suggest that the omission-responsive neurons in this study may be VIP neurons. The sensitivity of omission responses to anesthesia reported in this study is also in line with our observations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Moreover, populations of VIP interneurons have been implicated in the signaling of omitted images in sequences of regularly repeated identical images by ramping activity until the next image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Garrett et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that VIP interneurons share the function of signaling omissions of salient predictions across sensory cortex.</p>
<p>The last type of sequence violation feature observed in our experiment is the anesthesia-sensitive slight boosting of PV positive interneurons at the end of AAAAA sequences when AAAAB sequences are expected, i.e. a “pure global” effect which was also seen in Neuropixel recordings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Although this effect provides enough information to discriminate between rare and common AAAAA sequences above chance level, it is much weaker than the modulation of sound response for unexpected XXXXY sequences. Moreover, we did not observe it for rare BBBBB sequences in our dataset. The weakness of the response suggests that the mismatch between the local continuation of a sound repeat and the global expectation of a sound transition makes this type of violation difficult to detect for the mouse brain, at least within the auditory cortex. The primary reason may be that global regularities are encoded at a higher level of the cortical hierarchy, with only weak top-down signals returning back to sensory cortices. In prior human and non-human primate experiments, robust responses to pure global violations were observed in, the prefrontal cortex, but also in the auditory cortex in mesoscopic-scale recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chao et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wacongne et al., 2011b</xref>) with late timing and functional connectivity suggesting that the latter arose from top-down signals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chao et al., 2018b</xref>). Our imaging approach covers a broad area of the auditory cortex (repeatedly sampled with a 1×1mm field of view), and yet this was insufficient to observe a salient response to pure global violations. This may be because the networks necessary to capture the global regularity level are underdeveloped in mice compared to humans. Alternatively, it is possible that these violation signals originate from a diffuse source in the auditory cortex (rare neurons or incoming axons) which was not sampled in our approach. Larger-scale experiments in mice, encompassing the prefrontal/cingulate cortex, will be necessary to discriminate between these hypotheses.</p>
<p>Overall, our results demonstrate a remarkable diversity of neural processes tracking the regularity of sound sequences in the mouse auditory cortex, some of them pre-attentive and robust to anesthesia, and others which are anesthesia-sensitive. Our results are in line with the general view that predictive processes are constantly ongoing in brain circuits, as suggested by the predictive coding theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dayan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Friston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Srinivasan et al., 1982</xref>). However, they also suggest that there is more than a single canonical circuit which performs predictions and detects violations. For example, our results highlight that the boosting of responses to unexpected sounds is both due to an item-specific adaptation and to a surprise response that takes in account transition probabilities and, for some neurons, the more global sequence structure. As they affect the same neurons, the coexistence of these two effects could only be detected by using an appropriate sequence structure and multiple time scales (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Moreover, the classical predictive coding theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Friston, 2005</xref>) postulates that omission and stimulus mismatch responses result from a single process in which top-down predictions are compared to bottom-up sensory signals. Our observation that omission, sequence termination responses and pure global violation responses are produced by partially distinct interneurons and are anesthesia-sensitive while local transition mismatch responses are broadcasted across all cell types and resist anesthesia, indicates that mismatch and omissions are computed by different sub-circuits. Our results largely extend recent observations that different cell types have different dynamics of violation responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">O’Toole et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, theories of how sound sequences generate predictions in the brain would need to incorporate an array of mechanisms addressing different aspects of the sequence structure rather than a single generic mechanism.</p>

<title>Cranial window implantation and viral injections</title>
<p>All procedures were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the French Ethical Committees #59 and #89 (authorizations APAFIS#9714-2018011108392486 v2 and APAFIS#27040-2020090316536717 v1). We used 8 to 12-weeks-old C57BL/6J, VIP-Cre and PV-Cre male and female mice housed 1-7 per cage, in normal light/dark cycle (12h/12h). Cranial window implantation and viral injections were performed under ketamine medetomidine or under isoflurane anesthesia (1.3-1.7%) with body temperature maintained constant at 37°C using a thermal blanket. Part of the right masseter was surgically removed to expose the temporal bone. A craniotomy of 5 mm in diameter was drilled over the auditory cortex on the right hemisphere. Three injections of 150 nl of AAV1.Syn.GCaMP6s or AAV1.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6s (∼1×10<sup>-12</sup> vg.ml<sup>-1</sup>), obtained from Addgene and Vector Core (Philadelphia, PA, USA), were performed with glass micropipettes and a programmable oil-based injector (Nanoliter 2000 &amp; Micro 4; World Precision Instruments) at 30 nl.min<sup>-1</sup>. We targeted all subfields of the auditory cortex, including non-primary regions. The craniotomy was sealed with a glass window comprising a circular coverslip (5 mm diameter, pre-sealed with cyano-acrylate glue) and a metal post for head-fixation was implanted using two dental cements: Super-Bond C&amp;B (Sun Medical Co. Ltd.) directly on the bone and Orthojet (Lang Dental, Wheeling, Illinois) for final sealing of the cranial window and the fixation post. Mice were given one week to recover from the surgery. Imaging was performed between 4 to 7 weeks after virus injection.</p>

<title>Sounds and stimulation protocols</title>
<p>Sounds were generated using MATLAB and delivered at 192 kHz with an NI-PCI-6221 card (National Instruments), which fed an amplified free-field loudspeaker (SA1 and MF1-S, Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). The head-fixed mouse in a tube was isolated from external noise sources by a soundproof box that provided 30 dB attenuation across the 1-100 kHz range. The two-photon microscope used was a fully silent acousto-optic system.</p>
<p>We generated two pure tones at 4 and 12 kHz with an intensity of 70dB SPL (calibrated at the animal’s ear position using a probe microphone (Brüel &amp; Kjær, type 4939-L-002) over a duration of 50 ms including 10ms linear intensity up- and down-ramp to avoid onset and offset artifacts. The 4 and 12kHz tones were labeled as A and B respectively, and combined in sequences of 4 to 5 tones with 237.5 ms time-intervals in between tone onsets. We used four sound stimulation protocols. A local-global protocol with short inter-sequence (2.5s) intervals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), a local-global protocol with long inter-sequence (28-30s) intervals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), a classical oddball protocol with several inter-stimuli intervals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>) and a single-tone (A-only) repetition protocol followed by a local-global protocol with long (30s) inter-sequence intervals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>The short interval protocol included 10 blocks of ∼5 min corresponding to 125 sequences of 1s separated by a fixed 1.5s silence period. 8 blocks consisted of one common 5-tone sequence repeated 25 times alone and then 75 times randomly interleaved with a rare 5-tone sequence, repeated 15 times and with a 4-tones omission sequence repeated 10 times. These 8 blocks correspond to 4 different block types repeated each twice: block type 1 (common AAAAB, rare AAAAA, rare omission AAAA), block type 2 (common AAAAA, rare AAAAB, rare omission AAAA), block type 3 (common BBBBA, rare BBBBB, rare omission BBBB), block type 4 (common BBBBB, rare BBBBA, rare omission BBBB). One additional block type included 50 AAAA sequences followed by a 62.5s silence period and then 50 BBBB sequences. This block type was repeated twice and was used as a comparison with oddball AAAA or BBBB omission sequences.</p>
<p>The long interval protocol included four blocks of 45 sequences each separated by a 28-30s interval between two sequences. The 45-sequences consisted of one common 5-tone sequence repeated 10 times during the habituation phase and then 30 times randomly interleaved with rare sequences of 5-tone, repeated 5 times. There were 4 different block types repeated only once: block type 1 (common AAAAB, rare AAAAA), block type 2 (common AAAAA, rare AAAAB), block type 3 (common BBBBB, rare BBBBA), block type 4 (common BBBBA, rare BBBBB). In one experiment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), we delivered a white noise burst (70dB SPL, 50ms duration including 10ms intensity ramps) with a random 3-5s interval after each sound sequence followed by a silence period of 25s. We observed no difference in the response observed during protocols including white noise bursts and those without.</p>
<p>In the electrophysiological recordings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H-I</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>) and one of the two-photon calcium imaging experiments (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>), we used a protocol containing both short and long inter-sequence intervals, but only for the 2 blocks of B-block with two types of sequences (BBBBB and BBBBA sequences). We recorded the same neurons using short (1.5s) and long (30s) interval protocols in awake animals, then only the long (30s) interval protocol in anesthetized animals. It should be noted that during electrophysiological recording, we were unable to match the same single units between awake and anesthetized animals contrary to the two-photon calcium imaging.</p>
<p>The classical stimulus specific adaptation (SSA) protocol included 12 blocks of 67 sounds each separated with 6 different inter-stimuli intervals of 0.5s; 1s; 2s; 4s; 8s and 16s. For each interval, there were 2 different block types repeated only once. A block begins with a habituation phase of 10 standard tone (tone A) and followed with a random repetition of 47 standard tone (tone A) and 10 deviant tone (tone B). In the second block of each interval the deviant and standard tones were switched.</p>
<p>The single-tone protocol (A only) included 2 blocks and was followed by 2 additional blocks of local-global paradigm with a long interval between sequences (30 seconds). Blocks 3 and 4 contained the repetition of 50 sequences separated by a 30-second interval. At the beginning of the block, 10 standard sequences (BBBBA or BBBBB) were played, followed by a randomized repetition of 34 standard sequences and 6 rare sequences (BBBBB or BBBBA, respectively). During the first two blocks, we delivered only the last deviant tone of the sequences, and instead of the BBBBB sequence, which contains no deviant tone, blank stimuli were presented (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). The order of the blocks was changed between rarely presented and commonly presented stimuli. We had 2 types of recordings: 1) A only rare - A only common - BBBBA rare - BBBBA common. 2) A only common - A only rare - BBBBA common - BBBBA rare that we combined. In all the data collected in this study, it was systematically observed that the initial tone of each session generated particularly high activity. To avoid this effect we excluded the first tone of each session here.</p>

<title>Two-photon calcium imaging in wake and anesthetized mouse auditory cortex</title>
<p>One week before imaging, mice were trained to stand still, head-fixed under the microscope for five consecutive days for 15 min to 1 h per day. Then mice were imaged for 1h long sessions with up to four vertical depths imaged per mouse on different days. Imaging was performed using a two-photon microscope (Femtonics, Budapest, Hungary) equipped with an 8 kHz resonant scanner combined with a pulsed laser (MaiTai-DS, SpectraPhysics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) tuned at 920 nm. The objective was a 10x Olympus (XLPLN10XSVMP), obtaining a field of view of 1000 x 1000 µm. Images were acquired at 31.5 Hz during trials of 315.5 sec. For the anesthesia, VIP and PV interneurons experiments, 2-photon imaging was performed with a fully silent acousto-optic microscope (Karthala) combined with a pulsed laser (Insight, Spectra Physics). The objective was a 16x (N16XLWD-PF, Nikon). Images were acquired from four planes at 19.1 Hz per plane interleaved by 50 µm with fields of view of 478 x 478 µm. In the short interval protocol, calcium activity was acquired continuously during an entire block with the Femtonics microscope and during half a block with the karthala microscope (the interruption between two half blocks was below 3s). In the long interval protocol, calcium activity was recorded during the sequence and until 1s after the white noise presentations (between −1 s to −2s and 4.5 s to 7.5 s from sequence onset).</p>
<p>The anesthesia sessions followed the awake sessions, without modifying the field of view. During anesthesia sessions, a nose mask from the SomnoSuite anesthesia unit (Kent Scientific) was used to induce narcosis. An infrared heating pad (Kent Scientific) was placed under the mouse tube. At the beginning, the isoflurane level was gradually increased to 2.5% for 2 minutes to induce narcosis. The anesthesia was then gradually reduced to around 1.3% (range 1.1-1.4%) during recordings, adjusting based on observed whisker movements and pupil size.</p>

<title>Calcium imaging data analysis</title>
<p>Motion artifacts, regions of interest selection, and the signal extraction were carried out using the Python-based version of Suite2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>). Then, data analysis was performed using custom Matlab scripts. Neuropil contamination was subtracted by applying the following equation: F<sub>cor</sub>(t) = F(t) – 0.7 F<sub>n</sub>(t). Then the change in fluorescence ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was computed as (F<sub>cor</sub>(t) - F<sub>0</sub>) / F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> is estimated as the minimum of gaussian filtered calcium trace, for each block. ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was then temporally deconvolved to yield a more accurate estimate of neuronal firing rate changes, using a linear algorithm using the following formula: r(t) = ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>’(t) + ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>(t) / τ in which ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>’ is the first temporal derivative of ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> and τ the calcium decay time constant which we set to 2 seconds for GCaMP6s. After deconvolution a Gaussian smoothing filter (σ = 1.5 or 2 frames) was applied to the data.</p>

<title>Acute extracellular recordings in wake and anesthetized mouse auditory cortex</title>
<p>Electrophysiology was performed using Neuropixels 1.0 probes (384 channels) on 4 mice that had previously been used for calcium imaging through a glass coverslip placed above the auditory cortex. For track reconstruction, the electrodes were dipped in diI, diO or diD (Vybrant™ Multicolor Cell-Labelling Kit, Thermofisher) prior to recording and allowed to dry at least 15 min before insertion. Prior to recording, a small hole was drilled in the coverglass to allow probe access and the electrode was slowly inserted into the brain and left in position for 20min before beginning recording to stabilize and minimize movements of neurons. Recordings were performed using a warmed cortex buffer filling a small kwik cast well formed around the edge of the coverslip to retain the liquid and in contact with the reference electrode. After each recording the surface of the brain was amply flushed and then protected with Kwik-Cast. Two recordings were performed per animal. Data was sampled at 30kHz using a NI-PXI chassis (National Instruments) and the SpikeGLX acquisition software.</p>
<p>After five of the awake sessions, anesthesia sessions were conducted without moving the Neuropixel probes, using the same protocol as for anesthesia sessions for two-photon calcium imaging.</p>

<title>Spike sorting and analysis of extracellular recordings</title>
<p>Electrophysiological signals were high-pass filtered and spike sorting was performed using the CortexLab suite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab">https://github.com/cortex-lab</ext-link>, UCL, London, England). Single unit clusters were identified using kilosort 2.5 followed by manual corrections based on the interspike-interval histogram and the inspection of the spike waveform using Phy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy">https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Cross-validated clustering analysis</title>
<p>Single trial responses to each 5- or 4-tone sequence were extracted from the raw deconvolved traces including a 0.5s baseline and a 1 s post-sequence period for each neuron. We averaged a subset of trials (training set), pooling trials from the two repetitions of each block type. For each sequence, we considered whether it occurred commonly or rarely as different conditions. Clustering was performed by using the average response signatures of each cell to selected sets of conditions as described in the figure legends. We used agglomerative hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deneux et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">2016</xref>) based on the Ward method to group together neurons with similar response signatures. The similarity metric used was the Pearson correlation between response profiles. A threshold was applied on the resulting dendrogram to obtain N clusters based on the number of neurons and conditions in each dataset. The threshold is chosen so that increasing the number of clusters does not lead to an increase in the number of different response types in the clustering. These clusters were then manually sorted to remove all obvious groups of non-responsive cells as indicated by an absence of activity above or below the typical baseline noise level for the cluster. Finally, the responsive clusters were tested on the remaining trials, which were not used for the clustering (test set). If we observe the same response profile as in the train test, we have validated the cluster (e.g. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This cross-validation ensures that clusters do not simply aggregate noise patterns (e.g. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Cross-validated classifiers</title>
<p>In order to evaluate if violation responses provide sufficient information to differentiate between a rare and a common sequence, we used a decoder applied to all neurons of a given dataset pooled across mice and recording sessions, and cross-validated using a leave-one-out procedure. To reduce dimensionality and improve classifier training, we use clusters of neurons instead of individual neurons. Next, we train a linear SVM classifier to discriminate between the common and rare conditions. Finally, we test the classifier using the left out trial for all averaged 90 ms time bins describing the response to the sequence, including the training time bin. Then another trial is left out and the procedure is performed again. This is repeated until all rare and common trials are tested. The performance of the classifier in each time bin is given as the average of the classifier output (0 = wrong, 1 = correct classification) for all test trials balanced by the number of trials per condition.</p>

<title>Fraction of neurons selective to a condition</title>
<p>We evaluated the fraction of neurons in each session selective to the rare or common presentation of a sequence in the time span between 0 to 300 ms after the last tone onset. For each cell, we computed the p-value of a Wilcoxon ranksum test evaluating the probability that mean responses in the considered time bin are greater for the rare than common condition (for the short-interval protocol, we remove the first 10 repetitions of the common stimuli from the habituation phase of each block). Using an alpha-value of 0.01, we then computed the fraction of cells with a p-value below the alpha-value. This fraction represents the proportion of neurons showing a significant difference in response between rare and common conditions during the 300 ms time window after the last tone onset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1K</xref>).</p>
<p>To compare the short (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) and long (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) datasets, we first chose an SNR threshold common to both datasets above which cells are retained, in order to extract cells with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = mean activity divided by its standard deviation). This threshold (=0.2) was determined on the basis of the SNR calculated from the first four tones of the sequences, defining responsiveness to a specific frequency. This threshold allows us to contain between 5% and 12% of neurons in each data set. We then correct our statistical test so that the number of repetitions N of the rare and common stimuli in the short-interval protocol is identical to that in the long-interval protocol. To do this, we calculate the percentage of modulated neurons in the short-interval protocol by randomly selecting only 40 repetitions from 180 repetitions of the common condition and 5 repetitions from 30 repetitions of the rare condition, repeat this process 100 times and calculate the mean percentage.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors successfully detected distinct mechanisms signalling prediction violations in the auditory cortex of mice. For this purpose, an auditory pure-tone local-global paradigm was presented to awake and anaesthetised mice. In awake rodents, the authors also evaluated interneuron cell types involved in responses to the interruption of the regularity imposed by local-global sequences. By performing two-photon calcium imaging and single-unit electrophysiology, the authors disentangled three phenomena underlying responses to violations of the distinct local-global regularity levels: Stimulus-specific adaptation, surprise and surprise adaptation. Both stimulus-specific adaptation and surprise-or deviant-evoked responses are observable</p>
<p>
under anaesthesia. Altogether, this work advances our understanding of distinct predictive processes computing prediction violations upon the complexity of the regularity imposed by the auditory sequence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>it is an elegant study beautifully executed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Oddball responses are increases in sensory responses when a stimulus is encountered in an unexpected location in a sequence of predictable stimuli. There are two computational interpretations for these responses: stimulus-specific adaptation and prediction errors. In recent years, evidence has accumulated that a significant part of these sequence violation responses cannot be explained simply by stimulus-specific adaptation. The current work elegantly adds to this evidence by using a sequence paradigm based on two levels of sequence violations: &quot;Local&quot; sequence violations of repetitions of identical stimuli, and &quot;global&quot; sequence violations of stimulus sequence patterns. The authors demonstrate that both local and global sequence violation responses are found in L2/3 neurons of the mouse auditory cortex. Using sequences with different inter-stimulus intervals, they further demonstrate that these sequence violation responses cannot be explained by stimulus-specific adaption.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is based on a very clever use of a sequence violation paradigm (local-global paradigm) and provides convincing evidence for the interpretation that there are at least two types of sequence violation responses and that these cannot be explained by stimulus-specific adaption. Most of the conclusions are based on a large dataset, and are compelling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The final part of the paper focuses on the responses of VIP and PV-positive interneurons. The responses of VIP interneurons appear somewhat variable and difficult to interpret (e.g. VIP neurons exhibit omission responses in the A block, but not the B block). The conclusions based on these data appear less solid.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;Parallel mechanisms signal a hierarchy of sequence structure violations in the auditory cortex&quot;, Jamali et al. provide evidence for cellular-level mechanisms in the auditory cortex of mice for the encoding of predictive information on different temporal and contextual scales. The study design separates more clearly than previous studies between the effects of local and global deviants and separates their respective effects on the neuronal responses clearly through the use of various contextual conditions and short and long time scales. Further, it identifies a contribution from a small set of VIP interneurons to the detection of omitted sounds, and shows the influence of isofluorane anesthesia on the neural responses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study provides a rather encompassing set of experimental techniques to study the cellular level responses, using two complementary recording techniques in the same animal and similar cortical location.</p>
<p>(2) Comparison between awake and anesthetized states are conducted in the same animals, which allows for rather a direct comparison of populations under different conditions, thus reducing sampling variability.</p>
<p>(3) The set of paradigms is well developed and specifically chosen to provide appropriate and meaningful controls/comparisons, which were missing from previous studies.</p>
<p>(4) The addition of cell-type specific recordings is valuable and in particular in combination with the contrast of awake and anesthetized animals provides novel insights into the cellular level representation of deviant signals, such as surprise, prediction error, and general adaptation.</p>
<p>(5) The analysis and presentation of the data are clear and quite complete, yet remain succinct and perform insightful contrasts.</p>
<p>(6) The study will have an impact on multiple levels, as it introduces important variations in the paradigm and analytical contrasts that both human and animal researchers can pick up and improve their studies. The cell-type-specific results are particularly intriguing, although these would likely require replication before being completely reliable. Further, the study provides a substantial and diverse dataset that others can explore.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The responses from cells recorded via Neuropixel and 2p differ qualitatively, as noted by the authors, with NP-recorded cells showing much more inhibited/reduced responses between acoustic stimulations. The authors briefly qualify these differences as potentially indicating a sampling issue, however, this matter deserves more detailed consideration in my opinion. Specifically, the authors could try to compare the different depths at which these neurons were sampled or relate the locations in the cortex to each other (as the Neuropixel recordings were collected in the same animals, a subset of the 2p recordings could be compared to the Neuropixel recordings.).</p>
<p>(2) The current study did not monitor the attentional state of the mouse in relation to the stimulus by either including a behavioral component or pupil monitoring, which could influence the neural responses to deviant stimuli and omissions. .</p>

<p>We agree with the referee that the response modulations observed in  VIP and PV-Positive interneurons are weak and variable. This is indicated in the manuscript. Probably, larger scale recordings are necessary to ascertain fully the presence and distribution of omission responses.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the referee that the sampling issue, which we propose as a possible explanation for the large difference between our Neuropixel and 2P imaging recordings, must be investigated more thoroughly. This is, however, largely outside of the scope of this study. We have reported the depth and location of Neuropixel recordings in Figure S2. The depth is similar for both techniques covering mostly layers 2, 3 and 4. The location spans mostly the primary auditory cortex for two photon imaging and Neuropixel recordings. One Neuropixel recording is located in the ventral secondary auditory cortex. We could not find any evidence that the response to global violations in Neuropixel data stems specifically from this particular recording.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The current study did not monitor the attentional state of the mouse in relation to the stimulus by either including a behavioral component or pupil monitoring, which could influence the neural responses to deviant stimuli and omissions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As reported by Bekinschtein et al. 2009, the attentional state influences responses to global violation in human subjects. It is extremely difficult to precisely compare attentional states in mice and human subjects. We have performed recordings in mice that had to attend to sound to detect a white noise sound in between the sequence to obtain a reward. This did not lead to increased global violation response. However, as the sequence themselves did not predict reward in this context they may divert attention. Therefore, this result is inconclusive and not worth including in our manuscript. If the sequence predicts rewards, there is a potential confound between violation responses and reward expectations or motor preparation signals. Pupil monitoring could be an alternative which we did not investigate.</p>

<p>(3) Given the complexity and variety of the paradigms, conditions, and analyzed cell-types, the manuscript could profit from a more visual summary figure that provides an easy-to-access overview of what was found.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent suggestion, although given the complexity and diversity of our observations it may be hard to fit everything in one understandable figure.</p>
