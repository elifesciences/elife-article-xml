<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Visual signal transduction takes place within a stack of flattened membranous “discs” enclosed within the light-sensitive photoreceptor outer segment. The highly curved rims of these discs, formed in the process of disc enclosure, are fortified by large hetero-oligomeric complexes of two homologous tetraspanin proteins, PRPH2 (a.k.a. peripherin-2 or rds) and ROM1. While mutations in PRPH2 affect the formation of disc rims, the role of ROM1 remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the knockout of ROM1 causes a compensatory increase in the disc content of PRPH2. Despite this increase, discs of ROM1 knockout mice displayed a delay in disc enclosure associated with a large diameter and lack of incisures in mature discs. Strikingly, further increasing the level of PRPH2 rescued these morphological defects. We next showed that disc rims are still formed in a knockin mouse in which the tetraspanin body of PRPH2 was replaced with that of ROM1. Together, these results demonstrate that, despite its contribution to the formation of disc rims, ROM1 can be replaced by an excess of PRPH2 for timely enclosure of newly forming discs and establishing normal outer segment structure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The light-sensitive outer segment organelle of vertebrate photoreceptor cells is a modified cilium containing a stack of disc-shaped membranes, or “discs”. While initially formed as serial evaginations of the photoreceptor plasma membrane, mature discs are separated from this membrane and are fully enclosed inside the outer segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Steinberg et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Burgoyne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Volland et al., 2015</xref>) (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Spencer et al., 2020</xref>)). Membrane enclosure involves the formation of highly curved, hairpin-shaped disc rims. Two homologous tetraspanin proteins, PRPH2 (also known as peripherin-2 or rds) and ROM1, localize specifically to disc rims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Connell and Molday, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Travis et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bascom et al., 1992</xref>) (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stuck et al., 2016</xref>)). Within the disc rim, PRPH2 and ROM1 form homo- and heteromeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bascom et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goldberg et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goldberg and Molday, 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goldberg and Molday, 1996a</xref>) that are assembled into larger oligomers connected by disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goldberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Loewen and Molday, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chakraborty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zulliger et al., 2018</xref>). Three parallel interconnected chains of these oligomers are wrapped around the circumference of the mature disc and support its hairpin-shaped structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pöge et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite a high level of structural homology between PRPH2 and ROM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2003</xref>), the consequences of their mutations for photoreceptor health are quite different. Around 200 mutations of <italic>PRPH2</italic> are shown to cause a heterogeneous set of inherited retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy and macular dystrophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Landrum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peeters et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, mutations in <italic>ROM1</italic> typically cause digenic retinitis pigmentosa in conjunction with mutations in <italic>PRPH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kajiwara et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dryja et al., 1997</xref>), except for a handful of reports of mutations in <italic>ROM1</italic> in patients without accompanying <italic>PRPH2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bascom et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sakuma et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Reig et al., 2000</xref>). With regard to animal models, the <italic>Prph2</italic> knockout mouse, commonly known as the <italic>rds</italic> mouse, has a complete failure of outer segment formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cohen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jansen and Sanyal, 1984</xref>), while the <italic>Rom1</italic> knockout mouse forms outer segments with relatively minor structural abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>). This discrepancy could be explained, at least in part, by the importance of the cytoplasmic C-terminus of PRPH2, which has been shown to retain membranes at the photoreceptor cilium, thereby allowing their remodeling into outer segment discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Salinas et al., 2017</xref>). However, most of the disease-associated PRPH2 mutations spare its C-terminus, so the complete explanation of this discrepancy awaits further investigation of the role of ROM1.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of ROM1 in the formation of photoreceptor disc rims and the process of disc enclosure. We first revisited the phenotype of the <italic>Rom1</italic> knockout (<italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mouse and made several novel observations. Using quantitative proteomics, we showed that the knockout of ROM1 causes a compensatory increase in the relative disc content of PRPH2. Despite the total tetraspanin content being essentially the same as in WT discs, <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs displayed a delay in their maturation and an increase in outer segment diameter. In addition, <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs lacked the indentations of their rims, known as incisures, present in WT discs. These changes could be explained, at least in part, by an alteration in tetraspanin oligomerization likely arising from a rearrangement of intramolecular disulfide bridge(s) in PRPH2. Strikingly, these morphological phenotypes can be rescued by transgenic overexpression of PRPH2, suggesting that ROM1 is not absolutely necessary for the formation of normal outer segments. In another set of experiments, we investigated whether disc rims could be formed in a knockin mouse in which the tetraspanin core of PRPH2 was replaced with that of ROM1. While the knockin photoreceptors failed to form orderly disc stacks, outer segment membranes preserved the ability to form hairpin-shaped rims. Together, these results demonstrate that, despite its contribution to disc formation and intrinsic ability to support disc rim structure, ROM1 can be replaced by an excess of PRPH2 for the formation of a normal outer segment.</p>

<title>Loss of ROM1 causes a compensatory increase in the relative outer segment content of PRPH2</title>
<p>Three proteins, rhodopsin, PRPH2 and ROM1, comprise ∼98% of the total transmembrane protein material in normal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Skiba et al., 2023</xref>). Recently, it has been proposed that the overall dimensions of a disc are determined by the molar ratio between the total tetraspanin content (PRPH2 and ROM1) forming the disc rim and rhodopsin forming the disc surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, interpreting the phenotype of the <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse requires an understanding of how the loss of ROM1 affects the outer segment content of PRPH2. This is particularly important because discs deficient in PRPH2 display a compensatory increase in the relative amount of ROM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that the opposite (i.e., a compensatory increase in the amount of PRPH2 when there is a deficiency in ROM1) may also be true.</p>
<p>To address this possibility, we employed a quantitative mass spectrometry approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Skiba et al., 2023</xref>) recently used to determine the molar ratio among PRPH2, ROM1 and rhodopsin in other mutant photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>). In these experiments, the outer segment content of PRPH2 was determined as a molar fraction of rhodopsin. Because the packing density of rhodopsin in discs is unaffected by any changes in disc dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liang et al., 2004</xref>), this parameter reflects the relative content of PRPH2 in each disc, independent of any changes in outer segment length or volume. We found that the relative content of PRPH2 in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> outer segments increased to an ∼1:12 molar ratio to rhodopsin from an ∼1:18 ratio in WT outer segments (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>; see raw data in <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>). Strikingly, this 1:12 ratio is equal to the ratio between total tetraspanin (PRPH2 + ROM1) and rhodopsin in WT outer segments. Therefore, the knockout of ROM1 leads to a compensatory increase in the relative disc content of PRPH2.</p>

<title>Loss of ROM1 delays disc enclosure causing increased outer segment diameter and occasional disc overgrowth</title>
<p>The retinal phenotype of <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was analyzed at postnatal day 30 (P30), as photoreceptor cell degeneration was just beginning at this age (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A,B</xref></bold>). Interestingly, light microscopy imaging was sufficient to identify that the outer segment layer of these mice appeared disorganized and even shortened (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A,C</xref></bold>). Please note that this and the three subsequent figures also include data obtained with a mouse overexpressing PRPH2 on the <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>background (<italic>PRPH2 OE</italic>/<italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), which will be described below, to facilitate a side-by-side comparison of all three phenotypes. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we observed a number of outer segment structural abnormalities (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>), consistent with those noted in the original report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>). In general, outer segments appeared to be shorter and wider, with some of them displaying overgrown disc membranes not aligned in a stack (yellow arrows, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). The degree of this overgrowth varied, with the extended membranes occasionally wrapping around the entire outer segment.</p>

</fig>
<p>Because these ultrastructural defects are reminiscent of those from several PRPH2 mutant lines in which photoreceptor disc enclosure is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>), we assessed the status of disc enclosure in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>outer segments. We contrasted retinal tissue with tannic acid and uranyl acetate instead of the traditionally used osmium tetroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). This technique yields a darker staining of newly forming, “open” discs exposed to the extracellular space than discs fully enclosed within the outer segment. This approach revealed that even outer segments lacking gross abnormalities in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have an increased number of open discs at their base (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A,B</xref></bold>). Whereas WT rods contained a relatively constant number of ∼7 open discs (consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Volland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>)), <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> rods had an average of ∼14 open discs. In addition, the number of open discs in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> rods was much more variable than in WT rods, with up to ∼30 open discs occasionally observed. Lastly, we quantified outer segment diameters of <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>rods and found that they were on average ∼35% wider than WT rods (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>), which is close to the ∼43% increase previously reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

For each genotype, three retinas were analyzed with at least 35 outer segments analyzed per retina. Data were plotted with samples separated, while statistical analysis was performed on the averages within each retina (n=3 for each genotype). One-way ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences in the number of open discs across genotypes (p &lt; 0.0001). Tukey’s multiple comparisons post-hoc test revealed statistically significant differences in the number of open discs between WT and <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (p &lt; 0.0001) and <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>PRPH2 OE/Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (p &lt; 0.0001) mice, but not between WT and <italic>PRPH2 OE/Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (p = 0.2686). <bold>(C)</bold> Quantification of the outer segment (OS) diameter.

Note that these diameters were measured in longitudinal sections, in which outer segment are not always sectioned across their widest part; therefore, these values are likely under-representations of the true OS diameters. However, this does not affect the comparison across genotypes.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="547380v1_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>These findings show that ROM1 contributes to the process of disc enclosure and that the compensatory increase in the disc content of PRPH2 does not fully replace ROM1 in this capacity. Accordingly, the increase in outer segment diameter may be explained by prolonged delivery of disc membrane material to each disc before it becomes fully enclosed. On occasion, an expansion of open discs becomes uncontrolled leading to formation of membranous whorls.</p>
<p>Another phenotype of <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was revealed using TEM of tangentially sectioned retinas (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). Normal mouse discs contain a single deep indentation of their rims, called an incisure (yellow arrowheads, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). In contrast, no incisures were observed in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs. Because the rims of both disc circumference and incisure are built from PRPH2/ROM1, the lack of incisures in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs may be explained by the entire pool of remaining tetraspanin being deposited at the circumference of larger discs.</p>

<title>ROM1 regulates the supramolecular organization of PRPH2</title>
<p>We next sought to address why the compensatory increase in the disc content of PRPH2 in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>rods is insufficient to support normal disc morphogenesis. In this context, it is important to consider that defects in PRPH2 oligomerization, without an accompanying decrease in PRPH2 levels, also lead to defects in disc enclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that loss of ROM1 may modulate the status of PRPH2 oligomerization. In fact, the idea that ROM1 may regulate the formation of high order PRPH2 oligomers has been put forward in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Loewen and Molday, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>To address the possibility that PRPH2 oligomerization may be disrupted without ROM1, we first performed SDS-PAGE of retinal lysates from WT and <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice under non-reducing conditions (i.e., no DTT in samples). Under these conditions, PRPH2 is represented by two bands, one corresponding to ∼35 kDa monomers and another to ∼75 kDa dimers linked by a disulfide bond (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). Both bands are somewhat diffuse, likely reflecting the heterogeneous status of PRPH2 glycosylation. The majority of PRPH2 in WT retinas is represented by dimers, consistent with its origin from large, disulfide-bound oligomers.</p>

<p>Two differences were observed in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> retinas. First, there was an ∼50% increase in the fraction of PRPH2 that runs in a monomeric state (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5A,B</xref></bold>), indicating that PRPH2 oligomerization may be negatively affected by loss of ROM1. Second, the monomeric form of PRPH2 was represented by a doublet, consistent with a previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stuck et al., 2015</xref>). This doublet was consolidated into a single band under reducing conditions in the presence of DTT (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>), which suggests that the two bands in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> retinas represent pools of PRPH2 molecules with different patterns of internal disulfide bonds. Apart from the C150 residue involved in intermolecular disulfide bonding of a PRPH2 molecule to another PRPH2 or ROM1, there are six other conserved cysteines in PRPH2 that are involved in intramolecular disulfide bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goldberg et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that ROM1 contributes to PRPH2 assuming the intermolecular disulfide bond conformation optimal for tetraspanin oligomerization at the disc rim.</p>
<p>To further investigate the status of PRPH2 oligomerization in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we utilized a technique typically used to describe PRPH2 and ROM1 complexes of various sizes. In this approach, complexes are extracted from disc membranes in the presence of an non-ionic detergent and separated by velocity sedimentation on a sucrose gradient under non-reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goldberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ding et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chakraborty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chakraborty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Stuck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zulliger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Milstein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>). We performed velocity sedimentation of lysates from both WT and <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>retinas followed by SDS-PAGE of gradient fractions under non-reducing conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5D,E</xref></bold>). The distribution of the PRPH2 monomeric form across fractions was unaffected by the ROM1 knockout. In both WT and <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> retinas, it was most abundant in fractions #6-8, shown to correspond to PRPH2 core complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chakraborty et al., 2008</xref>). However, the loss of ROM1 shifted the distribution of the disulfide-bound PRPH2 dimers to smaller oligomeric forms, consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Conley et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these data show that loss of ROM1 does indeed affect the status of PRPH2 oligomerization and suggest that abnormal PRPH2 oligomerization underlies the defects in disc enclosure in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p>

<title>Transgenic overexpression of PRPH2 can compensate for the loss of ROM1</title>
<p>We next investigated whether a further increase in the level of PRPH2 could improve the morphological defects observed in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>outer segments. We employed a transgenic line that expresses PRPH2 in both rods and cones under control of the human IRBP promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nour et al., 2004</xref>). While originally called NMP, we refer to this line as <italic>PRPH2 OE</italic> (PRPH2 overexpressor). In the current study, we used <italic>PRPH2 OE</italic> mice with a single copy of this transgene, which has been shown to express ∼30% excess PRPH2 over WT levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nour et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>PRPH2 OE</italic> mice were crossed with <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and retinas were analyzed as for WT and <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>). Strikingly, the gross morphological defects observed in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were significantly improved by transgenic overexpression of PRPH2 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). The outer segment length was somewhat restored (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A,C</xref></bold>), although the degree of this effect did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, PRPH2 overexpression rescued the disc enclosure defect of <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>outer segments by restoring the number of open discs to the WT level (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A,B</xref></bold>). In addition, <italic>PRPH2 OE/Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> outer segments had normal diameters (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A,C</xref></bold>) and their discs contained incisures (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>).

<title>ROM1 is able to form disc rims in the absence of PRPH2</title>
<p>While we have shown that ROM1 contributes to the formation of disc rims, it is unclear whether it can do so in the absence of PRPH2. Because disc formation is completely abolished in the absence of PRPH2, we could not address this question using PRPH2 knockout mice. Instead, we utilized a knockin mouse model, called RRCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Conley et al., 2019</xref>), in which the tetraspanin core of PRPH2 was replaced with that of ROM1 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>).

<p>As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Conley et al., 2019</xref>), homozygous RRCT photoreceptors formed rudimentary outer segments (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). The small number and size of these outer segment-like structures is likely explained by a very low expression of the chimeric protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Conley et al., 2019</xref>), which may lead to a low efficiency of disc membrane retention. We now show that some of these structures contain stacked disc membranes that are partially enclosed within the outer segment plasma membrane. Importantly, these disc membranes have discernible rims with a characteristic hairpin-like shape. This finding indicates that ROM1 alone is, in principle, able to support the formation of disc rims in the absence of PRPH2.</p>
<p>In an additional set of experiments, we explored the oligomerization status of ROM1 and the RRCT chimera in the absence of PRPH2. Unfortunately, the severe disruptions of outer segments in homozygous RRCT mice precluded us from obtaining a sufficient amount of retinal lysate to perform this analysis. Instead, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> system in which we co-transfected equal amounts of RRCT and ROM1 in COS7 cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>)</bold>. In these cells, RRCT and ROM1 co-localized in structures that were distinct from the endoplasmic reticulum, as evident from the lack of co-localization with the endoplasmic reticulum marker, calreticulin, suggesting that they were normally processed in the biosynthetic membranes. Velocity sedimentation of lysates from these cells revealed that both RRCT and ROM1 sediment in fractions #6-8 <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6D-E</xref>)</bold>, which is the same as for PRPH2/ROM1 core complexes from WT photoreceptors. These data indicate that heterologously expressed RRCT and ROM1 can form core tetraspanin complexes, even in the absence of PRPH2, that are able to support disc rim formation.</p>

<title>Disc rims can be formed without disulfide bonds between tetraspanin molecules</title>
<p>In a final experiment, we investigated whether the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between tetraspanins is dispensable for disc rim formation. We have previously shown that disulfide bonds between PRPH2 molecules are not absolutely required for this function because disc rims were formed in <italic>Prph2<sup>C150S/C150S</sup></italic> knockin mice lacking the cysteine residue forming this bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>). Yet ROM1 also forms intermolecular disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chakraborty et al., 2008</xref>), which raises the question of whether disc rim formation in <italic>Prph2<sup>C150S/C150S</sup></italic> knockin mice was driven by disulfide-linked ROM1 molecules.</p>
<p>To address this question, we analyzed disc rim structure in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice bearing the <italic>Prph2<sup>C150S/C150S</sup></italic> mutation. Outer segments of these mice had morphological defects comparable to those of <italic>Prph2<sup>C150S/C150S</sup></italic> mice (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we analyzed the role of ROM1 in supporting the formation of outer segment discs. In addition to the previously described morphological defects of <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>outer segments, we showed that these outer segments experience a delay in disc enclosure. This delay leads to an increase in disc diameter, loss of incisures and occasional uncontrolled disc membrane outgrowth. Remarkably, these defects can be reversed by sufficient overexpression of PRPH2, indicating a functional redundancy between these two tetraspanin proteins.</p>
<p>The idea of redundancy between PRPH2 and ROM1 is supported by the finding that mutations in both genetically interact to modulate disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kajiwara et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dryja et al., 1997</xref>). While individual PRPH2 mutations have greater phenotypic consequences, this could relate to both the unique role of the C-terminal tail of PRPH2 in the initial stages of disc formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Salinas et al., 2017</xref>) as well as the fact that there is twice as much PRPH2 as ROM1 in outer segments, at least in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kedzierski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Loewen and Molday, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Skiba et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>While evidence that <italic>ROM1</italic> mutations alone may cause human visual pathology is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bascom et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sakuma et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Reig et al., 2000</xref>), photoreceptors of <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice eventually degenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>). We propose that the delay in disc enclosure is the primary defect underlying this degeneration. Because discs remain open longer than normal, they may incorporate more than a normal amount of membranous material, which is continuously delivered to the outer segment. This can lead to disc membrane overgrowth and, eventually, the formation of highly dysmorphic membrane whorls. This progressive collapse of outer segment ultrastructure would eventually lead to cell death. Notably, this same progression of structural defects occurs in certain mice in which PRPH2 oligomerization is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>But why is the phenotype of the heterozygous <italic>rds</italic> mouse containing ∼50% of normal PRPH2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hawkins et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheng et al., 1997</xref>) much more severe than the <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse lacking 100% of ROM1? This difference is not intuitive because the molar ratio between PRPH2 and ROM1 is ∼2:1 and, therefore, each mouse is expected to have ∼2/3 of the normal tetraspanin content. However, there is a compensatory increase in outer segment tetraspanin in each of these two mice. We now show that relative content of total tetraspanin in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs is essentially the same as in WT discs (∼1:12 molar ratio to rhodopsin) due to a compensatory increase in PRPH2. On the other hand, there is only a partial compensatory increase of ROM1 in heterozygous <italic>rds</italic> mice (∼1:15 molar ratio of PRPH2+ROM1 to rhodopsin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>). The mechanism behind these increases remains to be elucidated, but regardless, the lesser severity of the <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> phenotype could be explained, at least in part, by a larger degree of this compensatory tetraspanin increase.</p>
<p>Yet, the complete restoration of the total tetraspanin content in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> outer segments does not fully rescue their morphological phenotype. This implies that, in normal photoreceptors, ROM1 contributes some unique functional features to the properties of tetraspanin oligomers. In fact, our data suggest that the loss of ROM1 alters both the intra- and intermolecular properties of the remaining PRPH2. We found that ROM1 likely facilitates an optimal internal disulfide bond arrangement of PRPH2 in addition to promoting the formation of larger oligomeric chains of PRPH2. One possible explanation for the ability of ROM1 to potentially facilitate the optimal disulfide bond arrangement of PRPH2 may relate to the intracellular trafficking of these two proteins. Whereas the majority of PRPH2 is normally trafficked through the unconventional secretory pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum that bypasses the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zulliger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pearring et al., 2021</xref>), ROM1 was shown to direct a small fraction of PRPH2 through the conventional secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Conley et al., 2019</xref>). It is intriguing to speculate that a shift in the intramolecular disulfide bonds of PRPH2 in the absence of ROM1 may arise from a complete loss of PRPH2 trafficking through the conventional pathway. Nonetheless, the outer segment deficiencies arising from loss of ROM1 were nearly completely overcome by a sufficient excess of PRPH2.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is our finding that discs of <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice lack incisures. A recent study put forth a model in which the total length of the disc rim, including the incisure, is determined by the molar ratio between the total tetraspanin protein and rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>). The lack of incisures in <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs may not appear intuitive since the total tetraspanin content in these discs is essentially the same as in WT discs. However, <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs also have an increased diameter, which allows the total rim length of WT and <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> discs to be about the same. The reason why such a tradeoff between the disc diameter and the presence/absence of an incisure exists remains to be determined, although it is likely to relate to the kinetics of disc enclosure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study shows that ROM1 makes distinct contributions to the formation of disc rims and the process of disc enclosure. Nonetheless, a sufficient excess of PRPH2 is able to compensate for the loss of ROM1, indicating that ROM1 is redundant to PRPH2 as a molecular building block of photoreceptor disc rims. Given that excess PRPH2 can rescue defects associated with loss of ROM1, it is exciting to speculate that PRPH2 overexpression can prevent the long-term photoreceptor degeneration associated with either loss of ROM1 or deficiencies arising from mutations in PRPH2 itself. It also remains to be seen whether the opposite is also true, whereby an excess ROM1 may rescue certain defects associated with mutations in PRPH2.</p>

Agarose sections were stained with 1% tannic acid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and 1% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences), gradually dehydrated with ethanol and infiltrated and embedded in Spurr’s resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences). 70 nm sections were cut, placed on copper grids and counterstained with 2% uranyl acetate and 3.5% lead citrate (19314; Ted Pella, Redding, CA). The samples were imaged on a JEM-1400 electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA) at 60 kV with a digital camera (BioSprint; AMT, Woburn, MA). Image analysis and processing was performed with ImageJ. For <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, fixation, processing, and imaging of mouse eyes for TEM was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Stricker et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Western blotting of retinal lysates</title>
<p>Protein concentration was assayed by using a colorimetric Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Western blotting was performed essentially as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Spencer et al., 2016</xref>). In short, lysates were incubated with Laemmli sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol and 1% Bromophenol Blue) with or without 100 mM DTT for reducing or non-reducing blots respectively. Samples containing 10 µg of total protein were incubated at 90°C for 5 minutes and run on a 10-20% Tris-HCl gel. Gels were transferred onto PVDF membrane and blocked with Intercept (PBS) Blocking Buffer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska) with 0.25% Tween-20. Blots were incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-PRPH2 C-terminal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kedzierski et al., 1999</xref>). After primary antibody incubation, blots were washed and incubated with 1:10000 dilution of donkey anti-rabbit DyLight 800 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 2 h.

<title>Velocity sedimentation using sucrose gradients</title>
<p>Sucrose gradients were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chakraborty et al., 2009</xref>). In short, gradients of 5–20% sucrose were prepared by sequentially layering 0.5 ml each of 20, 15, 10 and 5% sucrose solutions in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10 mM NEM and allowing them to sit at room temperature for 1 h to equilibrate. Gradients were then chilled on ice for 30 minutes prior to loading lysate and centrifugation at 40,000 rpm on a TLS-55 swinging bucket rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) for 16 hours at 4°C. The bottom of each tube was pierced with a 21G needle and 12 fractions of ∼180 µl each were collected. Western blotting was performed as described above using 15 µl samples for each fraction.</p>

<title>Cell culture experiments</title>
<p>COS7 cells were transfected with 7.5 µg of RRCT-FLAG and ROM1 mammalian expression constructs that were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Conley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Conley et al., 2019</xref>) using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Conley et al., 2019</xref>). After 48 hours, cells were processed for immunofluorescent staining or velocity sedimentation as described below. Experiments were repeated three independent times.</p>
<p>Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Conley et al., 2010</xref>). After blocking, coverslips were incubated overnight in primary antibodies to label RRCT, ROM1 and ER membranes as follows: 1) 1:2 dilution of monoclonal mouse anti-RRCT (2E7; described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zulliger et al., 2015</xref>), 2) 1:400 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-ROM1 (2Rom1; described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ding et al., 2005</xref>)), and 3) 1:250 dilution of polyclonal chicken anti-calreticulin at 1:250 (ab2908; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). After washing, cells were incubated with 1:000 dilution of donkey anti-mouse Alexa 568 (Invitrogen), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (Invitrogen) and goat anti-chicken Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies for 1 h. Cells were mounted in ProlongGold with DAPI (ThermoFisher). Images were captured on a BX-62 spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with an ORCA-ER camera (Olympus, Japan) and analyzed with Slidebook™ 5.2 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). Images from the spinning disk confocal microscope were deconvolved using the nearest neighbors paradigm. Images were captured with 100x/1.40 oil objectives, and exposure times and display settings (brightness and contrast) for all images were normalized to a control section where primary antibody was omitted during processing. No gamma adjustments were made to immunofluorescent images.</p>
<p>For velocity sedimentation, scraped cells were lysed in the same solubilization buffer used to prepare retinal extracts. Lysates were separated as described above (200 µg protein lysate/gradient). Resulting gradient fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and blots were probed with either 1:500 dilution of monoclonal mouse anti-RRCT (2B7; described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Conley et al., 2014</xref>)) or monoclonal mouse anti-ROM1 (2H5, described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Conley et al., 2014</xref>)).

<title>Quantitative mass spectrometry</title>
<p>A crude preparation of rod outer segments was obtained as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>). Dissected mouse retinas were vortexed in 8% OptiPrep in mouse Ringer’s solution (containing 130 mM NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl, 2.4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) that was adjusted to 314 mOsm. The preparation was briefly left on ice to allow the remaining retinal tissue to settle. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 20,000 x g. Pelleted outer segments were gently washed with mouse Ringer’s solution before lysis with 2% SDS in PBS. Protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Samples containing 5-10 µg of protein were mixed with 0.25-0.5 µg BSA (used as an internal standard in this analysis) and cleaved with 1 µg trypsin/LysC mix (Promega, Madison, WI) using the SP3 beads protocol described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>). The combined digest of outer segments and BSA was mixed with the digest of a chimeric protein consisting of concatenated tryptic peptides of outer segment proteins, including rhodopsin, PRPH2 and ROM1, which is described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Skiba et al., 2023</xref>). Mass spectrometry, data processing and data analysis were also performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Skiba et al., 2023</xref>).

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study is focused on the requirement for the photoreceptor-specific tetraspanins, ROM1 and PRPH2, in the formation of the light-sensitive membrane discs.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The precise mechanism of how tetraspanin proteins engage in the generation of discs is still an open question in the field of photoreceptor biology. This question is of significance as the lack of photoreceptor discs or defects in disc morphogenesis due to mutations in tetraspanin proteins is a known cause of vision loss in humans. The authors of this study combine TEM and mouse models to tease out the role of tetraspanin proteins, peripherin, and Rom1 in the genesis of the photoreceptor discs. They show that the absence of Rom1 leads to an increase in peripherin and changes in disc morphology. Further rise in peripherin alleviates some of the defects observed in Rom1 knockout animals leading to the conclusion that peripherin can substitute for the absence of Rom1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
A mouse model of Rom1 generated by the McInnes group in 2000 predicted a role for Rom1 in rim closure. They also showed enlarged discs in the absence of Rom1. This study confirmed this finding and showed the compensatory changes in peripherin, maintaining the total levels of tetraspanin proteins. Lack of Rom1 leads to excessive open disks demonstrated by darkly stained tannic acid-accessible areas in TEM. Interestingly, increased peripherin expression can rescue some morphological defects, including maintaining normal disc diameters and incisures. Overall, these observations lead authors to propose a model that ROM1 can be replaced by peripherin.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The compensatory increase in peripherin and morphological rescue in the absence of ROM1 is expected, given the previous work from authors showing i) absence of peripherin showing increased ROM1 and ii) &quot;Eliminating Rom1 also increased levels of Prph2/RRCT: mean Prph2/RRCT levels in P30 Prph2+/R retinas were 34% of WT, while levels in Prph2+/R/Rom1−/− retinas were 59% of WT&quot; from Conley, 2019. The current study provides a comprehensive quantitative analysis. However, the mechanism behind the mechanism is unclear and warrants discussion.</p>
<p>Photoreceptor morphology appears better when peripherin is overexpressed. Is there a rescue of rod function (assessed by ERG or equivalent measures) in peripherin OE/Rom1-/- mice? Given the extensive work in this area and the implications the authors allude to at the end, it is important to investigate this aspect.</p>

<p>In this study, Lewis et al seek to further define the role of ROM1. ROM1 is a tetraspanin protein that oligomerizes with another tetraspanin, PRPH2, to shape the rims of the membrane discs that comprise the light-sensitive outer segment of vertebrate photoreceptors. ROM1 knockout mice and several PRPH2 mutant mice are reexamined. The conclusion reached is that ROM1 is redundant to PRPH2 in regulating the size of newly forming discs, although excess PRPH2 is required to compensate for the loss of ROM1.</p>
<p>This replicates earlier findings while adding rigor using a mass spectrometry-based approach to quantitate the ratio of ROM1 and PRPH2 to rhodopsin (the protein packed in the body of the disc membranes) and careful analysis of tannic acid labeled newly forming discs using transmission electron microscopy.</p>
<p>In ROM1 knockout mice PRPH2 expression was found to be increased so that the level of PRPH2 in those mice matches the combined amount of PRPH2 and ROM1 in wildtype mice. Despite this, there are defects in disc formation that are resolved when the ROM1 knockout is crossed to a PRPH2 overexpressing line. A weakness of the study is that the molar ratios between ROM1, PRPH2 and rhodopsin were not measured in the PRPH2 overexpressing mice. This would have allowed the authors to be more precise in their conclusion that a 'sufficient' excess of PRPH2 can compensate for defects in ROM1.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Lewis et al. investigate the role of tetraspanins in the formation of discs - the key structure of vertebrate photoreceptors essential for light reception. Two tetraspanin proteins play a role in this process: PRPH2 and ROM1. The critical contribution of PRPH2 has been well established and loss of its function is not tolerated and results in gross anatomical pathology and degeneration in both mice and humans. However, the role of ROM1 is much less understood and has been considered somewhat redundant. This paper provides a definitive answer about the long-standing uncertainty regarding the contribution of ROM1 firmly establishing its role in outer segment morphogenesis. First, using an ingenious quantitative proteomic technique the authors show PRPH2 compensatory increase in ROM1 knockout explaining the redundancy of its function. Second, they uncover that despite this compensation, ROM1 is still needed, and its loss delays disc enclosure and results in the failure to form incisures. Third, the authors used a transgenic mouse model and show that deficits seen in ROM1 KO could be completely compensated by the overexpression of PRPH2. Finally, they analyzed yet another mouse model based on double manipulation with both ROM1 loss and expression of PRPH2 mutant unable to form dimerizing disulfide bonds further arguing that PRPH2-ROM1 interactions are not required for disc enclosure. To top it off the authors complement their in vivo studies by a series of biochemical assays done upon reconstitution of tetraspanins in transfected cultured cells as well as fractionations of native retinas. This report is timely, addresses significant questions in cell biology of photoreceptors, and pushes the field forward in a classical area of photoreceptor biology and mechanics of membrane structure as well. The manuscript is executed at the top level of technical standard, exceptionally well written, and does not leave much more to desire. It also pushes standards of the field- one such domain is the quantitative approach to analysis of the EM images which is notoriously open to alternative interpretations - yet this study does an exceptional job unbiasing this approach.</p>
<p>According to my expertise in photoreceptor biology, there is nothing wrong with this manuscript either technically or conceptually and I have no concerns to express.</p>
