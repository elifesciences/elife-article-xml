<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> is a species of <italic>Bacillus</italic> that has been widely investigated because of its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. However, most studies on <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> have focused on the biocontrol of plant diseases, with few reports on antagonizing <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium infections. In this investigation, it was discovered that <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> HBXN2020, which was isolated from healthy black pigs, possessed strong anti-stress and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Importantly, <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 did not cause any adverse side effects in mice when administered at various doses (1 × 10<sup>7</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>8</sup>, and 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU) for 14 d. Supplementing <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores, either as a curative or preventive measure, dramatically reduced the levels of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium ATCC14028 in the mice’s feces, ileum, cecum, and colon, as well as the disease activity index (DAI), in a model of infection caused by this pathogen in mice. Additionally, supplementing <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores significantly regulated cytokine levels (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10) and maintained the expression of tight junction proteins and mucin protein. Most importantly, adding <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores to the colonic microbiota improved its stability and increased the amount of beneficial bacteria (<italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>). All together, <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 can improve intestinal microbiota stability and barrier integrity and reduce inflammation to help treat infection by <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium (<italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium) is a major foodborne zoonotic pathogen that can cause diarrhea and colitis in humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fabrega and Vila, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). According to reports, <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections are common in both industrialized and developing nations, posing a serious risk to public health and resulting in significant financial losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Katiyo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mohan et al., 2019</xref>). At present, antibiotics remain one of the most effective treatment strategies for <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections. However, numerous studies have reported that the prolonged use or misuse of antibiotics can lead to environmental pollution, an increase in multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, as well as gastrointestinal microbiota dysbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ferri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Paulson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Reyman et al., 2022</xref>). In order to tackle <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections, a hunt for novel antimicrobial drugs is now underway.</p>
<p>More research has recently demonstrated the critical role gut microbiota plays in reducing intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cristofori et al., 2021</xref>) and mending the intestinal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ohland and Macnaughton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The use of probiotics is a popular approach to modulating intestinal microbiota nowadays. Among all probiotics, <italic>Bacillus</italic> is one of the most popular probiotic species because of its ability to form endospores that survive gastric transit, storage and delivery conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Bacillus</italic> species can generate extracellular enzymes and antimicrobial metabolites that inhibit enteric pathogens, which lowers the risk of infection and enhances nutrient utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdhul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ouattara et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies have found that <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> (<italic>B. velezensis</italic>) has the enormous potential to produce a variety of metabolites with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, previous studies have reported that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> exhibits varying degrees of beneficial effects on plants, livestock, poultry and fish. For instance, the combined use of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> SQR9 mutant and FZB42 improved root colonization and the production of secondary metabolites that are beneficial to cucumber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shao et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>B. velezensis</italic> isolated from yaks was shown to enhance growth performance and ameliorate blood parameters related to inflammation and immunity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The dietary <italic>B. velezensis</italic> supplementation can regulate the innate immune response in the intestine of crucian carp and reduce the degree of intestinal inflammation damage induced by <italic>A. veronii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). However, studies on <italic>B. velezensis</italic> in the prevention of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection are rarely reported; instead, the majority of investigations on <italic>B. velezensis</italic> focused on the biocontrol of fungal infections in plants. In this study, a strain of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against <italic>Salmonella</italic> was selected from a vast number of <italic>Bacillus</italic> strains. Next, we evaluated its safety in mice by supplementing <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 and then explored the protective effects in STm-infected mice. Notably, <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 alleviated colon tissue damage caused by STm infection, as indicated by markers such as STm loads, TNF-α and ZO-1 levels. Moreover, supplementing <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 also increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, specifically <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, within the colon microbiota. As a result, this research supports the creation of probiotic-based microbial products as a substitute method of preventing <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Isolation of <italic>Bacillus</italic></title>
<p>Four strains of <italic>Bacillus</italic> with antibacterial activity were screened from a large amount of presumptive <italic>Bacillus</italic> isolates, based on spot-on-plate tests analysis (Fig. S1), and the four strains clearly displayed the properties of bacteria in the genus <italic>Bacillus</italic> such as colonies were crateriform, Gram-positive, rod shape, and endospore-forming ability. Next, a comparative analysis of the antibacterial spectrum of four strains of <italic>Bacillus</italic> found that one strain exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against common pathogens (Table S1). Therefore, this strain was selected in this study for further research, which was designated as the HBXN2020.</p>

<title>Growth curve and <italic>in vitro</italic> resistance against environmental assaults</title>
<p>The growth of HBXN2020 was assessed in flat-bottomed 100-well microtiter plates by measuring the values of OD<sub>600</sub> every hour using an automatic growth curve analyzer. After measurement, we found that HBXN2020 entered the logarithmic growth phase after 2 h, and reached a plateau after 10 h of culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

Equal amounts of endospore and vegetative cells of HBXN2020 were exposed to the following: (<bold>C</bold>) acid solution (pH 2 to 7), (<bold>D</bold>) 0.3% bile salts, (<bold>E</bold>) SGF (pH 1.2) supplemented with pepsin, and (<bold>F</bold>) SIF (pH 6.8) containing trypsin at 37°C. At predetermined time points, 100 μL was taken from each sample, and tenfold serially diluted with sterile PBS (pH 7.2), and then spread on LB agar plates and cultured at 37°C for 12 h before bacterial counting. Each group was repeated three times (n = 3).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Next, we evaluated the effect of physical, chemical, and biological sterilization conditions such as high temperature, strong acidity, and enzyme preparation on the survival of HBXN2020. The survival rate of HBXN2020 showed a decreasing trend with increasing temperature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), but this decrease was not obvious. In a strong acid environment (pH 2.0), HBXN2020 maintained a high survival rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), suggesting that HBXN2020 spores can survive under extreme conditions. Based on these results, we hypothesized that HBXN2020 spores might also exhibit improved survival in gastrointestinal tract environments. Therefore, we further evaluated the survival rate of HBXN2020 in bile salt (0.3%, v/v), simulated gastric fluid (pepsin 1 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, pH 1.2), and simulated intestinal fluid (trypsin 1 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, pH 6.8). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-F</xref>, HBXN2020 spores demonstrated significantly improved tolerance to these simulated gastrointestinal tract environments.</p>

<title>Antibiotic susceptibility of HBXN2020 and bacteriostasis effect <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>In order to assess HBXN2020’s drug resistance, 19 antibiotics that are frequently used in clinical settings were chosen in this study. The results indicated that only polymyxin B had a relatively small inhibition zone diameter (less than 15 mm). Ampicillin, meropenem, minocycline, ofloxacin, and trimethoprim had the strongest inhibition on HBXN2020, with an inhibition zone diameter exceeding 30 mm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This indicated that HBXN2020 was extremely sensitive to β-lactams, tetracyclines, and quinolone drugs. We next utilized an in vitro antibacterial assay to evaluate the antibacterial activity of HBXN2020. The results showed that HBXN2020 had a similar inhibitory effect on standard and wild strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>), <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>), and <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> (<italic>C. perfringens</italic>), as well as wild strains of <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> (<italic>S. suis</italic>), <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> (<italic>P. multocida</italic>), and <italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</italic> (<italic>A. pleuropneumoniae</italic>). Except for the wild strains of <italic>S. suis</italic>and <italic>A. pleuropneumoniae</italic>, the diameter of the inhibition zone of other strains was above 15 mm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, S2), while the size of the inhibition zone of <italic>S. suis</italic> and <italic>pleuropneumoniae</italic> was also more than 12 mm.</p>

<title>Safety evaluation of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020</title>
<p>We assessed the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 in a mouse model in order to ascertain its safety. After gavage with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores for two weeks, we observed no significant difference in the body weight of each group of mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The gene expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 of colon from all groups of mice exhibited no remarkable changes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, in the colon, mRNA levels of the barrier proteins ZO-1 and occludin were trending towards an increase compared with the control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Additionally, blood routine tests and serum biochemistry tests were performed for mice in the control group and H-HBXN2020 group on the 14<sup>th</sup> d after oral administration of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spore multiple times. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and S4, the blood parameters of mice after <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores treatment, including red blood cells (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), hemoglobin (HGB), white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), hematocrit (HCT), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), were consistent with those of healthy mice. The serum biochemical parameters, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), total bilirubin (TBIL), serum creatinine (CREA), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), were also within normal limits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). The corresponding histological analysis of colon tissue from mice receiving low, medium, and high doses of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores (L-HBXN2020, M-HBXN2020, and H-HBXN2020 groups, respectively) is presented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>. The colon tissue sections of mice in the test groups showed no significant differences compared to the control group. Additionally, there were no observable differences in the major organ tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) of mice treated with the high dose of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores compared to healthy mice (Fig. S5). The results of this trial show that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 is safe to use and has no negative side effects in mice.</p>

<p>Testing both solid and liquid co-culture methods to see if <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 might suppress <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium ATCC14028 (STm), the findings indicated that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 decreased the development of STm in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, S6). Next, the therapeutic potential of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 was evaluated in an STm-infected mouse model. At days 1, 3, and 5 after STm infection, mice in the STm+HBXN2020 group and HBXN2020 group were orally administered <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores by gavage, STm+CIP group were given oral ciprofloxacin, while the control group and STm+PBS group were orally treated with sterile PBS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Also, the number of excreted STm in feces was counted daily at the designated time points. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, there was a significant and continuous reduction in the number of STm in feces following treatment with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores or ciprofloxacin, while the number of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 viable bacteria in feces is also gradually decreasing (Fig. S7A). The number of STm in the mice feces of STm+HBXN2020 group and STm+CIP group exhibited a reduction ranging from 0.12 to 1.18 logs and 0.76 to 1.81 logs respectively, compared with the STm+PBS group, over the period from day 2 to day 7 post-treatment. Moreover, treatment with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spore or ciprofloxacin, resulted in a 1.06, 1.69, 1.14 logs and 1.70, 2.15, 1.48 logs reduction in the number of STm in the cecum, colon and ileum, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-E</xref>, S7B).

In addition, we also measured the colon length of the mice and found that the STm+PBS group had a significantly shorter colon length (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than the control group and HBXN2020 group. However, compared to the STm+PBS group, the STm+HBXN2020 group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and STm+CIP group exhibited a longer colon (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H-I</xref>).</p>

<p>To further assess the impact of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 on intestinal infammatory response, the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines in the colonic tissues were measured. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-D</xref>, the mRNA levels of TNF-α (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), IL-1β (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), IL-6 (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001), and IL-10 (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001) in the colon tissue were significantly increased in the STm+PBS group compared to the control group. <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spore treatment signifcantly decreased the mRNA levels of TNF-α (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), IL-1β (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), IL-6 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and increased the IL-10 level, compared with the STm+PBS group. In contrast, ciprofloxacin treatment failed to signifcantly decrease the mRNA levels of IL-6 in the colon of STm-infected mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Similarly, ciprofloxacin treatment drastically dampened the mRNA levels of IL-10 in the colon of STm-infected mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the infuence of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 on the intestinal barrier integrity, the mRNA levels of tight junction proteins in the colonic tissues were measured. As presented in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, compared with control group, the mRNA levels of tight junction protein in the STm+PBS group was significantly reduced, including ZO-1 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), occludin (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), claudin, and Muc2 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-I</xref>). Moreover, the levels of tight junction protein transcription were remarkably elevated in the STm+HBXN2020, STm+CIP, and HBXN2020 group, including ZO-1 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, respectively), occludin (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, respectively), and claudin (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0857 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, respectively), except for claudin (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0857) in group STm+CIP, compared with that of the STm+PBS group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-I</xref>). In addition, we also detected the transcription level of Muc2 in colon tissue, which mainly exists in and around goblet cells and is an important component of the mucus layer. The transcription levels of Muc2 were dramatically increased in the STm+HBXN2020 group compared with the STm+PBS group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). Conversely, the mRNA levels of Muc2 were significantly decreased in the HBXN2020 group and STm+CIP group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we further explore the impact of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 on the intestinal microbiota composition of STm-treated mice by 16S rRNA gene high throughout sequencing. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, alpha-diversity analysis revealed that both the richness and diversity (calculated in Sobs, Chao, Shannon, and Simpson indexes) were lower in STm+PBS group than control group, HBXN2020 group, STm+HBXN2020 group, and STm+CIP group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-D</xref>). Although an increasing trend of alpha diversity was observed in STm+CIP group, but without statistical difference was achieved as compared with other groups. Principal Components analysis (PCA) based on Bray-Curtis distance showed that a separation in the gut microbiota structure among control and STm+PBS group. When <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores were supplemented, the gut microbiota composition of the STm+HBXN2020 group, HBXN2020 group and the control group were closer together (R<sup>2</sup>= 0.1616, P = 0.006, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we examined the impact of prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 on the intestinal microbiota composition of STm-treated mice. Sobs, Chao and Shannon index were signifcantly increased in the HBXN2020, PBS+STm group, HBXN2020+STm group and CIP+STm group compared with the control group (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A-C</xref>), while the Simpson index (not statistically different) significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10D</xref>). PCA analysis showed significant separation between control and PBS+STm groups (R<sup>2</sup>=0.3186, p=0.014, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10E</xref>). When <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores or ciprofloxacin were supplemented, the community clustering was significantly similar to that of the control group rather than the PBS+STm group (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10E</xref>). Meanwhile, the overall fecal bacterial composition of mice at the phylum and genus level in all groups was similar to that of the treatment experiment. The fecal microbiota was dominated by phyla <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, <italic>Verrucomicrobiota</italic>, <italic>Patescibacteria</italic>, and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> in all five groups (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10F</xref>, S10A). At the genus level, PBS+STm group exhibited lower relative abundances of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10G, H-I</xref>), and higher relative abundances of <italic>Alistipes</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, and <italic>Alloprevotella</italic>, compared with the control (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10G, J-M</xref>, S10B). Moreover, compared with the PBS+STm group, following supplementation with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores or ciprofloxacin, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> significantly increased, and the gut microbiota was restored to a composition similar to the control group. It was noteworthy that six bacterial genera including <italic>Alistipes</italic>, <italic>Odoribacter</italic>, and <italic>norank_f Oscillospiraceae</italic> were enriched in PBS+STm group, while other three taxa (e.g., <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>) were enriched in the control group (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10N</xref>). Moreover, we found that <italic>Candidatus_Arthromitus</italic> was enriched in the HBXN2020+STm group, <italic>Dubosiella</italic> was enriched in the CIP+STm group, and <italic>Faecalibaculum</italic>, <italic>Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group</italic>, and <italic>unclassified_f Lactobacillaceae</italic> were enriched in the HBXN2020 group (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10N</xref>). Above all, these results indicated that prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores regulated the gut microbiota composition, leading to the potential to attenuate the STm-induced dysbiosis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium is an important intestinal pathogen that can cause invasive intestinal diseases such as bacterial colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Herp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schultz et al., 2017</xref>). Antibiotics are frequently used to treat colitis caused by bacteria; nevertheless, in recent years, their abuse has greatly increased bacterial resistance, leading to serious environmental pollution. A recent study showed that antibiotic-resistance genes in probiotics could be transmitted to the intestinal microbiota, which may threaten human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Crits-Christoph et al., 2022</xref>). It is crucial to consider the source of probiotics. Strong environmental adaptability and disease resistance make black pigs an outstanding household breed in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 was isolated from the free-range feces of black piglets in a mountain village in Xianning City (Hubei, China) and exhibited excellent antibacterial activity. Otherwise, <italic>in vitro</italic> tolerance assays showed that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores have good tolerance to high temperature, strong acids, bile salts, as well as simulated gastric and intestinal fluid, which was similar to previous research results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Du et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, studies for antibiotic susceptibility revealed that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 is not resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<p>Probiotics are distinct from food or medications in that they can cause toxins or infections in the body when ingested, and they are living when swallowed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sanders et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Snydman, 2008</xref>). Therefore, assessing the biosafety of probiotics is crucial. In this study, the safety of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 was evaluated by measuring the body weight, intestinal barrier proteins, and inflammatory cytokines of the experimented mice, as well as conducting routine blood and biochemical tests. The results showed that the expression levels of ZO-1 and occludin in the colon of mice increased after treatment with different doses of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores. It has been reported that ZO-1, occludin and claudin are the three most important tight junction proteins in intercellular connections, which play a crucial role in maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bazzoni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zihni et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is possible to improve intestinal barrier function by upregulating ZO-1 and occludin expression levels.</p>
<p>Important aminotransferases in animals, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are regarded as critical metrics for assessing liver function damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ozer et al., 2008</xref>). Under normal circumstances, the levels of ALT and AST are in dynamic balance without notable changes. However, when the liver is damaged or becomes dysfunctional, the levels of aminotransferases (ALT and AST) increase significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have shown that CCL4-induced liver injury strongly increases plasma ALT/AST levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Singhal et al., 2018</xref>). Zhang et al. reported that the addition of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> to chicken diets significantly decreased the serum levels of ALT and AST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In this present study, the levels of ALT and AST in the probiotic-treated group were slightly lower than those in the control group, indicating that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 had no negative effect on liver health in mice. The <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 treatment group’s blood indices were also found to be comparable to those of the control group, falling within the normal reference range, according to regular blood testing.</p>
<p>Mice were fed with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores orally after being challenged with <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium ATCC14028 in order to assess the spores’ potential to alleviate infection caused by <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. Our experimental results demonstrated that oral treatment with <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores could alleviate infection by <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, as evidenced by decreased weight loss, DAI, and histological damage, which is similar to prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Previous research showed that macrophages are the first line of host defense against bacterial infection. They release proinflammatory cytokines, which are critical in initiating adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dinarello, 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, proinflammatory cytokines have immunological properties that can be beneficial for the host to resist the invasion of bacteria and other microbes in the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, pretreatment with recombinant murine TNF-α was shown to protect mice against lethal bacterial (<italic>E. coli</italic>) infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cross et al., 1989</xref>). PJ-34 exerted protective effects on intestinal epithelial cells against invasive <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection by upregulating IL-6 expression through the ERK and NF-κB signal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huang, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, some research has demonstrated that over-activation of immune cells can result in tissue damage, organ failure, systemic or persistent inflammation, and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Karki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kotas and Medzhitov, 2015</xref>). IL-10 is a recognized anti-inflammatory mediator that plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal microbe-immune homeostasis, regulating the release of inflammatory mediators, and inhibiting proinflammatory responses of innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Maloy and Powrie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ouyang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Saraiva et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, previous studies have shown that <italic>Clostridium butyrate</italic> can induce the production of IL-10 in the intestine, thereby alleviating experimental colitis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hayashi et al., 2013</xref>). Similar results were observed in our study, where oral administration of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores reduced the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 while increasing the levels of IL-10 in the colon of mice. Additionally, as demonstrated by the decreased histological damage and increased expression levels of intestinal barrier proteins, oral treatment of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores reduced the functional damage of the intestinal barrier induced by S. Typhimurium infection.</p>
<p>Besides host itself, environmental factors such as diet and gut microbiota have been associated with the development of STm-infected. Gut microbiota constitutes a critical bridge between environmental factors and host health, where the beneficial bacteria such as <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in the microbiota may exert repair and anti-infammatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, supplementation of probiotics has been shown to modulate intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of STm-infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Buddhasiri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). This is consistent with our research results between the <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 treatment group and STm-infected mice. Here, we found that oral <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores raised the colonic microbiota’s alpha diversity and modulated the composition of the intestinal microbiota, namely, enriching the relative abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (known for enhancing the epithelial barrier by increasing mucus secretion and upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kaur et al., 2021</xref>) and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> (known for modulating intestinal immune response by producing short chain fatty acids and reducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cani et al., 2022</xref>), reducing the relative abundance of <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> (harmful to intestinal homeostasis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, we also found that the relative abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> in the ciprofloxacin treatment group was significantly lower than that in the <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores treatment group, indicating that excessive use of antibiotics may interfere with the recovery of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Collectively, infection with <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium disrupts gut microbiota and the gut barrier, leading to intestinal inflammation, while oral <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores protects the colon and reduce infection by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria and and barrier integrity and decreasing inflammation.</p>
<p>We further assessed pretreatment in order to learn more about the potential of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores for disease prevention, given the increased efficacy of treating infection caused by <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. Similarly to the therapeutic effect of oral <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020, prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores effectively alleviated the symptoms of STm-infected mice, namely, reduced the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine level in the colon of STm-infected mice. Prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores also increased the mRNA levels of gut barrier proteins in the colon of STm-infected mice. Furthermore, the microbiota composition was also dramatically modulated by prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores in both healthy mice and STm-infected mice. Also, the community richness revealed by the alpha diversity index were not significantly impacted in STm-infected mice by prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores. Interestingly, we found that prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores signifcantly increased the community diversity in healthy mice, suggesting the potentially benefcial efects of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 in gut microenvironment for animals in the future. Moreover, prophylactic <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores significantly boosted SCFA-producing bacteria including <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, which was consistent with the effects of therapeutic oral <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores. Meanwhile, harmful bacteria such as <italic>Alistipes</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Escherichia-Shigella</italic>, and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> were significantly enriched in STm-infected mice, reminding us that increased harmful bacteria might play a major role in promoting the development of STm-infected. In summary, our results demonstrated that <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020-mediated microbial communities, especially <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> might play a crucial role in alleviating the development of STm-infected.</p>

<p>To investigate whether HBXN2020 directly inhibited the growth of STm, we performed spot-on lawn and agar-well diffusion assays, as well as co-culture assays in liquid culture medium. In the spot-on lawn antimicrobial assays, we prepared double layers of agar by first pouring LB agar into the plate as the bottom layer. The top layer consisted of 10 mL TSB broth containing 0.7% agar with STm overnight culture. Then, 10 μL of HBXN2020 overnight culture and cell-free supernatant (CFS) were respectively spotted onto TSB agar and incubated at 37°C for 12 h to measure the inhibition zone. A transparent zone of at least 1 mm around the spot was considered positive.</p>
<p>The antagonistic effect of HBXN2020-CFS against STm was determined using the agar-well diffusion assays. To collect HBXN2020-CFS, the culture was centrifuged at 9,000g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter (Millipore, USA). The STm lawn medium was prepared by mixing 10 mL of TSB broth containing 0.7% agar with STm overnight culture and then poured into a sterile plate covered with LB agar and Oxford cups, 8 mm diameter wells were prepared in the TSB agar after removing the cups.

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> safety evaluation of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020</title>
<p>Female specific-pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice aged 6 to 8 weeks were purchased from the Animal Experimental Center of Huazhong Agricultural University. All mice experiments were conducted in the standard SPF facility of Huazhong Agricultural University, with 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness at a temperature of 25°C and ad libitum access to food and water. The use of animals in this experiment was approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of Huazhong Agricultural University (Ethics Approval Number: HZAUMO-2023-0089).</p>
<p>Safety assay of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 referred to the method described by Zhou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>) with slight modifications. After a 7-day acclimation period (free access to water and food), mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups (n = 5): low-dose <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores group (L-HBXN2020 group, 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mouse), medium-dose <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores group (M-HBXN2020 group, 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse), high-dose <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores group (H-HBXN2020 group, 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mouse), and a control group. During the experimental period (15 days), mice were weighed and orally gavaged with their respective treatments once every two days. On day 15, all mice were euthanized, and blood, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, ileum, cecum, and colon were collected. Blood samples were used for routine blood and biochemistry tests. Major organ tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) and a 5-mm distal segment of the colon were used for histopathology. The remaining colonic tissues were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for cytokine and tight junction protein expression analysis.</p>

<title><italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium-infected mouse model</title>
<p>After 7 days of acclimation (free access to water and food), mice were randomly divided into five treatment groups (n = 6): control group, HBXN2020 group, STm+PBS group, STm+HBXN2020 group and STm+CIP group. The <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium-infected model was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Stecher et al., 2005</xref>), with slight modifications. On the first day of the experiment, all mice in the STm+PBS group, STm+HBXN2020 group and STm+CIP group were orally inoculated with 200 μL (5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mouse) of STm. On days 1, 3 and 5 following STm infection, each mouse in the HBXN2020 group, STm+HBXN2020 group and STm+CIP group received 200 μL (1×10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse) of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores or ciprofloxacin (1 mg/mL) via gavage administration, respectively. In contrast, the control group and STm+PBS group received 200 μL of sterile PBS by oral gavage. Fecal samples were collected daily following STm infection and resuspended in sterile PBS. The number of STm in mice feces from both the STm+PBS, STm+HBXN2020 and STm+CIP groups was then determined by spreading a serial 10-fold dilution on selective LB agar plates containing 50 µg mL<sup>-1</sup> kanamycin. Throughout the entire experiment, the body weight, stool consistency and fecal occult blood of all mice were monitored daily. As shown in Table S6, disease activity index (DAI) was calculated by the sum of the scores from three parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Praveschotinunt et al., 2019</xref>). On day 7 after STm infection, all mice were euthanized, their ileum, cecum and colon were collected. The length of colon was measured, and a 5-mm distal segment of the colon was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for further histopathology. The remaining colon was then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for cytokine and tight junction protein expression analysis. Then, the number of STm in the ileum, cecum, and colon was determined by spreading serial 10-fold dilutions on selective LB agar plates.</p>
<p>To investigate the prophylactic efficacy of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 in ameliorating STm-infected, another independent experiment was conducted using six-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (SPF). After a seven-day acclimation period, mice were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 6): control group, HBXN2020 group, PBS+STm group, HBXN2020+STm group and CIP+STm group. On days 1, 3, 5 and 7, each mouse in the HBXN2020 group, HBXN2020+STm group and CIP+STm group received 200 μL (1×10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse) of <italic>B. velezensis</italic> HBXN2020 spores or ciprofloxacin (1 mg/mL) via gavage administration. Meanwhile, mice in the control group and PBS+STm group received 200 μL of sterile PBS by oral gavage. On day 7, all mice in the PBS+STm group, HBXN2020+STm group and CIP+STm group were orally inoculated with 200 μL (5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mouse) of STm. Fecal samples were collected daily following STm infection from both groups and resuspended in sterile PBS. The number of STm in the feces of mice was then determined by spreading serial 10-fold dilutions on selective LB agar plates (50 µg mL<sup>-1</sup> kanamycin). Throughout the entire experiment, the body weight and DAI scores of all mice were monitored daily. On day 12, all mice were euthanized, and the ileum, cecum, and colon were collected. The colon length was measured, and a 5-mm distal segment of the colon was fixed in 4% formalin for sectioning and staining. The remaining colon was stored at −80°C for future analysis. Lastly, the number of STm in the ileum, cecum, and colon was determined using a selective LB agar plate.</p>

<title>Histopathology analysis</title>
<p>Colon tissue samples (0.5 cm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, and the fixed tissues were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and observed and imaged using an optical microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). The histopathological score included the degree of inflammatory infiltration, changes in crypt structures, and the presence or absence of ulceration and edema.

<title>16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis</title>
<p>According to the manufacturer’s instructions, colon microbial community genomes were extracted using E.Z-N.A ® Stool DNA Kit (Omega; D4015-01), and quality was detected by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The 16S rRNA V3-V4 variable region was amplified by PCR using universal primers 338F (5 ’- ACTCCTACGGGGGGCAG-3’) and 806R (5 ’- GACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3’). The PCR products were examined by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and then purified with the AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit (Axygen Biosciences, USA). A sequencing library was constructed using the NEXTFLEX® Rapid DNA-Seq Kit, and sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Raw reads were quality evaluated and filtered by fastp (version 0.20.0) and merged using FLASH (version 1.2.7). The optimized sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% sequence similarity using UPARSE (version 7.1). The representative sequences of each OTU was classified by RDP classifier (version 2.2; confidence threshold value, 0.7). Alpha diversity was assessed using the ACE, chao, Shannon, and Simpson indices. The β- diversity analysis was performed using Bray-Curtis distances and visualized through principal component analysis (PCA). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LefSe) was used to identify differential microbiota between groups.</p>

<p>In this <bold>useful</bold> study, Wang and colleagues investigate the potential probiotic effects of Bacillus velezensis in a murine model. They provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that B. velezensis limits the growth of Salmonella typhimurium in lab culture and in mice, together with beneficial effects on the microbiota. The overall presentation of the manuscript has improved and the work will be of interest to infectious disease researchers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang and colleagues presented an investigation of pig-origin bacteria Bacillus velezensis HBXN2020, for its released genome sequence, in vivo safety issue, probiotic effects in vitro, and protection against Salmonella infection in a murine model. Various techniques and assays are performed; the main results are all descriptive, without new insight advancing the field or a mechanistic understanding of the observed protection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>An extensive study on the probiotic properties of the Bacillus velezensis strain HBXN2020</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main results are descriptive without mechanistic insight. Additionally, most of the results and analysis parts are separated without a link or a story-telling way to deliver a concise message.</p>
<p>Now the manuscript has made appropriate and considerable improvements.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Wang and colleagues study the potential probiotic effects of Bacillus velezensis. Bacillus species have potential benefit to serve as probiotics due to their ability to form endospores and synthesize secondary metabolites. B. velezensis has been shown to have probiotic effects in plants and animals but data for human use are scarce, particularly with respect to salmonella-induced colitis. In this work, the authors identify a strain of B. velezensis and test it for its ability to control colitis in mice.</p>

<p>Key findings:</p>
<p>(1) The authors sequence an isolate for B. velezensis - HBXN2020 and describe its genome (roughly 4 mb, 46% GC-content etc).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the constructive comments and the positive reception of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors next describe the growth of this strain in broth culture and survival under acid and temperature stress. The susceptibility of HBXN2020 was tested against various antibiotics and against various pathogenic bacteria. In the case of the latter, the authors set out to determine if HBXN2020 could directly inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Convincing data, indicating that this is indeed the case, are presented.</p>

<p>Thanks for the constructive comments and the positive reception of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) To determine the safety profile of BHXN2020 (for possible use as a probiotic), the authors infected the strain in mice and monitored weight, together with cytokine profiles. Infected mice displayed no significant weight loss and expression of inflammatory cytokines remained unchanged. Blood cell profiles of infected mice were consistent with that of uninfected mice. No significant differences in tissues, including the colon were observed.</p>

<p>(4) Next, the authors tested the ability to HBXN2020 to inhibit growth of Salmonella typhimurium (STm) and demonstrate that HBXN2020 inhibits STm in a dose dependent manner. Following this, the authors infect mice with STm to induce colitis and measure the ability of HBXN2020 to control colitis. The first outcome measure was a reduction in STm in faeces. Consistent with this, HBXN2020 reduced STm loads in the ileum, cecum, and colon. Colon length was also affected by HBXN2020 treatment. In addition, treatment with HBXN2020 reduced the appearance colon pathological features associated with colitis, together with a reduction in inflammatory cytokines.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) After noting the beneficial (and anti-inflammatory effects) of HBXN2020, the authors set out to investigate effects on microbiota during treatment. Using a variety of algorithms, the authors demonstrate that upon HXBN2020 treatment, microbiota composition is restored to levels akin to that seen in healthy mice.</p>

<p>Thanks for the constructive comments and the positive reception of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Finally, the authors assessed the effect of using HBXN2020 as prophylactic treatment for colitis by first treating mice with the spores and then infecting with STm. Their data indicate that treatment with HBXN2020 reduced colitis. A similar beneficial impact was seen with the gut microbiota.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Wang et al. investigates the effects of B. velezensis HBXN2020 in alleviating S. Typhimurium-induced mouse colitis. The results showed that B. velezensis HBXN2020 could alleviate bacterial colitis by enhancing intestinal homeostasis (decreasing harmful bacteria and enhancing the abundance of Lactobacillus and Akkermansia) and gut barrier integrity and reducing inflammation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comments and the positive reception of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>B. velezensis HBXN2020 is a novel species of Bacillus that can produce a great variety of secondary metabolites and exhibit high antibacterial activity against several pathogens. B. velezensis HBXN2020 is able to form endospores and has strong anti-stress capabilities. B. velezensis HBXN2020 has a synergistic effect with other beneficial microorganisms, which can improve intestinal homeostasis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comments and the positive reception of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Few studies about the clinical application of Bacillus velezensis. Thus, more studies are still needed to explore the effectiveness of Bacillus velezensis before clinical application.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. This study serves as an exploratory investigation before the application of <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic>. The main purpose of this study is to explore the potential of <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> in application.

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Most of my previous comments are well addressed, here are a few examples.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/fo/d0fo01017k">https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/fo/d0fo01017k</ext-link> please replace &quot;colitis&quot; to a normal infection model. The current statement is incorrect.</p>
<p>
While in my last comment, I requested a Colitis Mouse Model, which will well resemble the diarrhea disease caused by Salmonella in mammals. The available statement is not convincing, please check <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2225501/,">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2225501/,</ext-link> </p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Certain parts remain to be overestimated, to my knowledge, the language and logical flow should be addressed thoroughly.</p>
<p>Here are suggestions to improve the logical flow of the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Probiotic sampling and isolation</p>
<p>(2) in vitro assessment</p>
<p>(3) genomic sequencing and in silico safety assessment (Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. 2023;63(32):11244-11262), which should be included as a right ref.</p>
<p>(4) in vivo assay for safety evaluation, but not biosafety (it has a different meaning!!)</p>
<p>(5) infection model and protection assay.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The revised manuscript by Wang and colleagues attempts to address concerns raised during the first round of review.</p>
<p>All minor comments have been addressed and in general, the major concerns have been partially addressed in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>The outstanding concerns relate to the mechanistic basis of the observations. The authors made no attempt to address this in a meaningful manner. Secondly, the issue of comparing the responses to what would be standard therapy (such as anti-inflammatories) was also handled in a somewhat dismissive manner, referring to other ongoing/future work. The clinical utility of the findings are hard to ascertain if there is no comparison to the current gold standard therapeutic approach.</p>
<p>I have no further suggestions for the authors, save for those previously made.</p>
