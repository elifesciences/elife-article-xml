<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Caspase (CASP) is a family of proteases involved in cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis. In human, CASP3 and CASP7 recognize the same consensus motif DxxD, which is present in gasdermin E (GSDME). However, human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear. In this study, we identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. p10 contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination. This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate (except mammalian) CASP7. In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primate (e.g., mouse) but not in primate. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME. These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate. These results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pyroptosis represents a form of programmed cell death that provokes robust inflammatory immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bergsbaken, Fink, &amp; Cookson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tsuchiya et al., 2019</xref>). Gasdermin (GSDM) serves as the direct executioner of pyroptosis. GSDM forms transmembrane pores to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, if these transmembrane pores persist, pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kovacs &amp; Miao, 2017</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shi, Gao, &amp; Shao, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). Human has six GSDM (HsGSDM) family members, HsGSDMA-E, and HsPJVK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tamura et al., 2007</xref>). All HsGSDMs (except for HsPJVK) adopt a two-domain architecture, the N-terminal (NT) pore-forming domain and the C-terminal (CT) autoinhibitory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">De Schutter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Shao, 2021</xref>). Proteolytic cleavage of HsGSDM to remove the autoinhibitory CT domain enables the binding of the lipophilic NT fragment to the cell membrane, where the NT fragments oligomerize and form transmembrane pores to induce osmotic cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kuang et al., 2017</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the signaling pathways that activate GSDM-mediated pyroptosis, caspase (CASP) 1/4/5/11-mediated GSDMD activation is well documented. In human, HsGSDMD is specifically cleaved by the inflammatory HsCASP1 through multiple inflammasome signaling pathways. HsCASP4/5 also cleave HsGSDMD in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. After cleavage by HsCASP1/4/5, the pore-forming HsGSDMD-NT fragment becomes unconstrained and triggers pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Structural and biochemical analysis reveal that HsCASP1/4 βIII/βIII’ sheet forms an exosite that interacts with the hydrophobic pocket of HsGSDMD-CT domain, rendering HsGSDMD cleavage independent of CASP recognition of the tetrapeptide motif FLTD (K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). When the tetrapeptide FLTD is mutated to AAAD, HsCASP1/4 cleavage of HsGSDMD is not affected. The residues that form the hydrophobic pocket of HsGSDMD-CT domain are not conserved in HsGSDME, suggesting that HsGSDME cannot be cleaved by HsCASP1/4 via interaction with an exosite (Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Actually, human HsGSDME is specifically cleaved by HsCASP3 at the consensus motif DMPD, which is required for HsCASP3-mediated HsGSDME proteolysis. Mutation of either the Asp residue of the DMPD tetrapeptide motif leads to cleavage resistance of HsGSDME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Rogers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that HsCASP3-mediated HsGSDME activation paradigm is distinct from that of HsGSDMD. It is intriguing that although HsCASP7 shares the same recognition motif (DxxD) with HsCASP3, HsCASP7 cannot cleave HsGSDME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agniswamy, Fang, &amp; Weber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Slee, Adrain, &amp; Martin, 2001</xref>). The molecular mechanism underlying the HsCASP3/7 cleavage discrimination of HsGSDME is unknown.</p>
<p>Historically, HsCASP3 and HsCASP7, which are 54% identical, are known to possess similar structure and share overlapping protein substrate repertoire, and are considered to have functionally redundant roles in regulating cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Crawford &amp; Wells, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kumar, 2007</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shi, 2002</xref>). Both HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 consist of two polypeptide subunits named p20 and p10 (1:1 ratio), which assemble to form active heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Timmer &amp; Salvesen, 2007</xref>). HsCASP3/7 contain highly conserved QACRG and SHG motifs in p20 subunit, and SWR and GSWF motifs in p10 subunit, which participate in the catalytic reaction and substrate binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boyce, Degterev, &amp; Yuan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cohen, 1997</xref>). In the apoptosis signaling pathway, death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway ultimately converge to the activation of HsCASP3/7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Budd, Tenneti, Lishnak, &amp; Lipton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wajant, 2002</xref>). Active HsCASP3/7 cleave a series of protein substrates, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA fragmentation factor 45, which causes chromatin fragmentation and leads to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Erener et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wolf, Schuler, Echeverri, &amp; Green, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zheng et al., 1998</xref>). Although HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 exert almost indistinguishable proteolytic specificity to certain polypeptides, there exist functional differences between these two HsCASPs in cleaving some substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brentnall, Rodriguez-Menocal, De Guevara, Cepero, &amp; Boise, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Demon et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, HsCASP3 cleaves Bid much more efficiently than HsCASP7, while HsCASP7 cleaves cochaperone p23 more efficiently than HsCASP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Slee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Walsh et al., 2008</xref>). These findings support the notion that HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 are enzymatically similar but functionally non-redundant.</p>
<p>Different from HsGSDME that is specifically cleaved by HsCASP3, teleost GSDME is cleaved via various modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angosto-Bazarra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yuan, Jiang, Qin, &amp; Sun, 2022</xref>). In this study, we identified a functional GSDME (named TrGSDME) from pufferfish <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>. We found that TrGSDME was specifically cleaved by both HsCASP3/7 and TrCASP3/7, whereas HsGSDME was cleaved by TrCASP3/7 and HsCASP3, but not by HsCASP7. We examined the underlying mechanism of this observation. We found that the GSDME-CT and the CASP7 p10 were critical for CASP7 cleavage of GSDME. By a series of site-directed mutagenesis, we discovered a previously unrecognized key residue (S234 in HsCASP7) in p10 that was responsible for the discriminative cleavage of HsGSDME by HsCASP7.</p>

<title>Pufferfish GSDME is specifically cleaved by both human and fish CASP3/7</title>
<p>It has long been observed that although human caspase (HsCASP) 3 and 7 share the same consensus recognition motif DxxD, HsCASP3, but not HsCASP7, cleaves human GSDME (HsGSDME) (at the site of DMPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Poreba, Strozyk, Salvesen, &amp; Drag, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we found that a pufferfish <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic> GSDME (designated TrGSDME), which belongs to the GSDMEa lineage of teleost GSDME (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure-figure supplement 1</xref>), was specifically cleaved by both HsCASP3 and 7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This intriguing observation promoted us to explore the mechanism of HsCASP7 substrate discrimination. We first examined whether TrGSDME could be cleaved by pufferfish CASP (TrCASP) 3/7. The active forms of TrCASP3/7 were prepared (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), both exhibited high proteolytic specificity and activity towards the tetrapeptide DEVD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and E</xref>), which is the conserved recognition motif of HsCASP3/7. When incubated with TrGSDME, both TrCASP3 and TrCASP7 cleaved TrGSDME into the NT and CT fragments, similar to that cleaved by HsCASP3/7, in a dose dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Accordingly, TrCASP3/7-mediated TrGSDME cleavage was inhibited by the CASP3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK) and the pan-CASP inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Based on the molecular mass of the cleaved NT and CT products, we inferred that the tetrapeptide motif <sup>255</sup>DAVD<sup>258</sup> in the vicinity of the linker region of TrGSDME may be the recognition site of CASP3/7. Indeed, the D255R and D258A mutants of TrGSDME were resistant to TrCASP3/7 and HsCASP3/7 cleavage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I and J</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated that TrGSDME was cleaved by fish and human CASP3/7 in a manner that depended on the specific sequence of DAVD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>).</p>

<title>CASP3/7-cleaved TrGSDME is functionally activated and induces pyroptosis</title>
<p>We next examined whether TrGSDME, like HsGSDME, is a functional pyroptosis inducer. For this purpose, HEK293T cells were transfected with mCherry-tagged full length (FL) or NT/CT domain of TrGSDME. The results revealed that TrGSDME-FL and -CT were abundantly expressed in the cells, whereas TrGSDME-NT expression was barely detectable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). No significant morphological change or LDH release was observed in cells expressing TrGSDME-FL or -CT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and C</xref>). By contrast, cells expressing TrGSDME-NT showed necrotic cell death with massive LDH release and positive Sytox Green staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>). TrGSDME-NT-induced cell death exhibited osmotic cell membrane swelling, a typical feature of pyroptosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Time-lapse imaging showed that TrGSDME-NT triggered rapid cell swelling and membrane rupture, which led to release of cytoplasmic contents and eventually cell death (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-video 1). To examine the pyroptotic activity of CASP3/7-cleaved TrGSDME, TrCASP3/7 and TrGSDME were overexpressed in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F and G</xref>). The cells expressing TrCASP3, TrCASP7 or TrGSDME alone had no apparent morphological change or LDH release, whereas the cells co-expressing TrGSDME and TrCASP3 or TrGSDME and TrCASP7 underwent pyroptosis, accompanying with massive LDH release, membrane rupture, and TrGSDME cleavage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-I</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 3A</xref>). Consistently, the presence of the CASP3 inhibitor and pan-CASP inhibitor hampered TrGSDME-mediated pyroptosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J and K</xref>). Mutation of the cleavage site (D255R and D258A) inhibited pyroptosis and significantly decreased LDH release and TrGSDME cleavage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L and M</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). These results indicated that TrCASP3/7 cleavage was required to activate TrGSDME-mediated pyroptosis.</p>

<title>GSDME-CT domain mediates the recognition by CASP7</title>
<p>Since it is known that human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7, the observation that TrGSDME was cleaved by both human and fish CASP3/7 intrigued us to explore the underlying mechanism. We found that unlike TrCASP1, both HsCASP3 and 7 exhibited proteolytic activity towards the consensus CASP3/7 recognition motif, DMPD, in HsGSDME, but HsCASP7 failed to cleave HsGSDME (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref> and 2). Structure analysis revealed that compared to TrGSDME, HsGSDME possesses two additional regions with the possibility to form a loop (261-266 aa) and an α-helix (281-296 aa), respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We tested whether deletion of these two regions could confer HsCASP7 cleavage on HsGSDME. The results showed that similar to the wild type HsGSDME, the loop deletion mutant (Δ261-266) and the α-helix deletion mutant (Δ281-296) were cleaved by HsCASP3 but not by HsCASP7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Since the NT and CT domains play different roles in GSDM structure maintenance, we constructed GSDME chimeras consisting of HsGSDME-NT plus TrGSDME-CT (named HsNT-TrCT), or TrGSDME-NT plus HsGSDME-CT (named TrNT-HsCT) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Compared with wild type HsGSDME and TrGSDME, chimeric HsNT-TrCT was cleaved by HsCASP3/7, whereas TrNT-HsCT was cleaved only by HsCASP3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-I</xref>), suggesting that the CT domain determined the cleavability of GSDME by HsCASP7.</p>

<title>The p10 subunit determines the substrate specificity of CASP7</title>
<p>Since as shown above, unlike HsCASP7, TrCASP7 was able to cleave HsGSDME (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>), we compared the sequences of TrCASP7 and HsCASP7. The two CASPs share 66.24% sequence identity.

<title>The S234 of p10 is the key to HsCASP7 discrimination on HsGSDME</title>
<p>Comparative analysis of the p10 sequences of TrCASP7 and HsCASP7 identified 13 non-conserved residues. To examine their potential involvement in GSDME cleavage, a series of site-directed mutagenesis was performed to swap the non-conserved residues between HsCASP7 p10 and TrCASP7 p10 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref> and C). Of the 13 swaps created, S234N conferred on HsCASP7 the ability to cleave HsGSDME (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), whereas its corresponding swap in TrCASP7 (N245S) markedly reduced the ability of TrCASP7 to cleave HsGSDME (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). None of the 13 swaps affected the ability of HsCASP7 or TrCASP7 to cleave TrGSDME (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, E). HsCASP7-S234N cleaved HsGSDME in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), and the cleavage was not enhanced by the additional mutation of S247N&amp;I248V (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Additionally, HsCASP7 and HsCASP7-S234N exhibited similar cleavage capacities against other CASP7 substrates, such as PARP1 and gelsolin (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Erener et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Walsh et al., 2008</xref>). Previous studies showed that human CASP1/4 cleaved GSDMD through exosite interaction (Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). However, this exosite is not conserved in HsCASP7, in which the corresponding region forms a coil, not a β sheet (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>). Structural modeling showed that the residues Q276, D278, and H283 are close to the region corresponding to the HsCASP1/4 exosite (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>). Since these three residues are also not conserved between HsCASP7 p10 subunit and TrCASP7 p10 subunit, they were selected for mutagenesis to examine whether there existed an exosite interaction between HsCASP7 and HsGSDME. The mutation results showed that, similar to the wild type, the mutant Q276W&amp;D278E&amp;H283S was unable to cleave HsGSDME (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), suggesting that, unlike human GSDMD, HsGSDME cleavage by CASPs probably did not involve exosite interaction. In contrast to HsGSDME, TrGSDME cleavage by HsCASP7 was not affected by the mutation of S234N, S234N plus S247N&amp;I248V, or Q276W&amp;D278E&amp;H283S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>).</p>

<title>Divergent and GSDME-independent evolution of CASP7 leads to the loss of GSDME-activation function in mammalian CASP7</title>

<p>For CASP7, an Asn at the position corresponding to HsCASP7 S234 is highly conserved in teleost, amphibians, reptiles and birds, but not in mammals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>GSDME is an ancient member of the GSDM family existing ubiquitously in vertebrate from teleost to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Broz, Pelegrin, &amp; Shao, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">De Schutter et al., 2021</xref>). In human, GSDME is specifically cleaved by CASP3 at the consensus motif DMPD, but it is not cleaved by CASP7, which recognizes the same DxxD motif. CASP3 cleavage releases the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment from the association of the inhibitory CT fragment and switches cell death from apoptosis to pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Rogers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we found that different from human GSDME, a pufferfish GSDME belonging to the teleost GSDMEa lineage was specifically cleaved by both CASP3 and CASP7 at the site of DAVD to liberate the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment. In teleost, there generally exist two GSDME orthologs, named GSDMEa and GSDMEb. Comparative study on the functions of GSDMEa and GSDMEb is scarce, and it remains to be explored whether clear physiological roles are played by these two orthologs in fish. As executors of pyroptosis, teleost GSDMEs are activated via different mechanisms. In tongue sole <italic>Cynoglossus semilaevis</italic>, GSDMEb is preferably cleaved by CASP1 to trigger pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jiang, Gu, Zhao, &amp; Sun, 2019</xref>); in zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, GSDMEb is activated by caspy2 (CASP5 homolog) through the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2020</xref>; Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). These observations indicate that similar to mammalian GSDMD, teleost GSDMEb is activated by inflammatory CASPs. In contrast, teleost GSDMEa is cleaved mainly by apoptotic CASPs. In zebrafish, GSDMEa is cleaved by CASP3 to generate the pyroptotic NT fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In turbot <italic>Scophthalmus maximus</italic>, GSDMEa is bi-directionally regulated by CASP3/7, which activate GSDMEa, and CASP6, which inactivates GSDMEa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Xu, Jiang, Yu, Yuan, &amp; Sun, 2022</xref>). In common carp <italic>Cyprinus carpio haematopterus</italic>, GSDMEa is cleaved by CASP3 and induces pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>).The complicated scenario of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis signaling in fish is likely due to the reason that, unlike mammals that have multiple GSDM members to induce pyroptosis under different conditions, fish have only GSDME to induce pyroptotic cell death. Regulation by different CASPs may represent a mechanism that enables fish GSDME to execute the orders of different pyroptotic signals.</p>
<p>It is intriguing that, although HsCASP3 and 7 were indistinguishable in proteolysis towards the consensus tetrapeptide, they differed remarkably in the cleavage of HsGSDME and TrGSDME. HsCASP3, but not HsCASP7, cleaved HsGSDME, whereas both HsCASP3 and 7 cleaved TrGSDME at the same site. NT/CT domain swapping between HsGSDME and TrGSDME showed that chimeric GSDMEs containing the TrGSDME-CT domain were cleaved by human as well as pufferfish CASP7 regardless of the source of the NT, whereas chimeric GSDMEs containing the HsGSDME-CT domain were resistant to HsCASP7. These results indicate that the CT domain, which is well accepted to exert an inhibitory effect on the pore-forming NT domain (Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shi et al., 2015</xref>), is the target of HsCASP7 discrimination, and hence determines the cleavability of GSDME by HsCASP7. Recently, Wang and Liu studied the molecular mechanism of human GSDMD recognition by CASP1/4, and showed that GSDMD-CT interacted with CASP1/4 exosites through binding to a hydrophobic pocket, which enhanced the recognition by CASP1/4 and contributed to tetrapeptide sequence-independent cleavage of GSDMD (Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Different from GSDMD, we found that for TrGSDME, mutation of either the P4 (D255) or P1 (D258) residue of the consensus motif <sup>255</sup>DAVD<sup>258</sup> made it resistant to CASP3/7, implying a lack of DAVD-independent cleavage mechanism. Similarly, a previous study observed that human and mouse GSDME harboring cleavage site (P4 or P1) mutation resisted CASP3 cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest that, compared to GSDMD, GSDME has a distinct enzyme-substrate engagement mode that, as demonstrated in the present study, involves GSDME-CT.</p>
<p>Unlike HsCASP7, which was unable to cleave HsGSDME, TrCASP7 effectively cleaved HsGSDME. The swapping of p20 between HsCASP7 and TrCASP7 revealed that the two catalytic motifs in p20, i.e., SHG and QACRG, were not involved in HsCASP7 discrimination on GSDME. SWR and GSWF are known to be responsible for CASP substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Riedl et al., 2001</xref>). However, in our study, we found that these two motifs are conserved in human and pufferfish CASP7, and they had no apparent effect on the substrate discrimination of HsCASP7. By contrast, the chimeric HsCASP7 containing the p10 subunit of TrCASP7 acquired the ability to cleave HsGSDME, indicating an important role of p10. By a series of residue swapping and mutation analyses, we discovered that the residue in the position of 245 (in TrCASP7) or 234 (in HsCASP7) of the p10 subunit was the key that determined CASP7 cleavage of HsGSDME. Sequence analysis revealed that N245 is highly conserved in the CASP7 of teleost, amphibians, reptiles and birds. In contrast, this Asn residue was changed to Ser in the CASP7 of mammals, especially primates, resulting in divergence of CASP7 from CASP3 in substrate recognition and cleavage. Since, unlike non-mammalian vertebrates, mammals possess multiple pyroptotic GSDM members (GSDMA, B, C, D, and E), the functional divergence of CASP7 from CASP3 may have occurred as a result of specific and non-redundant regulation of programmed cell death mediated by different executor molecules. One of the physiological consequences is that CASP7 frees itself from the GSDME-mediated pathway and thus is able to be engaged in other cellular processes. Another physiological consequence is that GSDME activation is limited to CASP3 cleavage, thus restricting GSDME activity to situations more specific, such as that inducing CASP3 activation. More physiological consequences of CASP3/7 divergence in GSDME activation need to be explored in future studies. With the exception of primates, the conserved Asn is present in a large number of mammals, including mice. Mouse CASP7 was able to cleave HsGSDME, further supporting the importance of the Asn in CASP7 recognition and cleavage. The inability of mouse CASP7 to cleave mouse GSDME is consistent with a previous report that CASP7 deletion had little effect on mouse GSDME-mediated pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sarhan et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest mutually independent evolution of GSDME and CASP7 in mice, which likely has distanced GSDME and CASP7 from each other. Similarly, human CASP7 and GSDME may also have undergone independent evolution, which leads to the disengagement of GSDME from the substrate relationship with CASP7.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified a teleost GSDME that can be cleaved by fish and human CASP3/7 to trigger pyroptosis. The GSDME-CT domain and the CASP7 p10 subunit are critical in the determination of CASP7 cleavage of GSDME. Within the p10 subunit, a single residue plays a key role in CASP7 substrate recognition and cleavage. Our results reveal the molecular basis of the functional divergence of CASP7 and CASP3, and suggest separate evolutions of CASP7 and GSDME in mammals. These findings add new insights into CASP-regulated GSDME activation in lower and higher vertebrates.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
In this study, Xu et al. provide insights into the substrate divergence of caspase 3 and 7 (CASP3 and CASP7) for gasdermin E (GSDME) cleavage and activation during evolution in vertebrates. Using a diverse set of biochemical assays, domain swapping, site-directed mutagenesis, and bioinformatics tools, the authors demonstrate that the human GSDME C-terminal region and the S234 residue of human CASP7 are the key determinants that impede the cleavage of human GSDME by human CASP7. Their findings suggest that mutations affecting the function of caspases have enabled the functional divergence of distinct caspase family members to specialize in controlling complicated cellular functions in mammals.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
The authors made an important contribution to the field by demonstrating how human CASP7 has functionally diverged to lose the ability to cleave GSDME and showing that reverse-mutations in CASP7 can restore GSDME cleavage. The use of multiple methods to support their conclusions strengthens the authors' findings. The unbiased mutagenesis screen performed to identify S234 in huCASP7 as the determinant of its GSDME cleavability is also a strength.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
While the authors employed a comprehensive experimental setup to investigate the CASP7-mediated GSDME cleavage across evolution, future studies will be required to fully understand the physiological implications of this evolutionary divergence.</p>

<p>The authors wanted to address the differential processing of GSDME by caspase 3 and 7, finding that while in humans GSDME is only processed by CASP3, Takifugu GSDME, and other mammalian can be processed by CASP3 and 7. This is due to a change in a residue in the human CAPS7 active site that abrogates GSDME cleavage. This phenomenon is present in humans and other primates, but not in other mammals such as cats or rodents. This study sheds light on the evolutionary changes inside CASP7, using sequences from different species. Although the study is somehow interesting and elegantly provides strong evidence of this observation, it lacks the physiological relevance of this finding, i.e. on human side, mouse side, and fish what are the consequences of CASP3/7 vs CASP3 cleavage of GSDME.</p>
<p>Fish also present a duplication of GSDME gene and Takifugu present GSDMEa and GSDMEb. It is not clear in the whole study if when referring to TrGSDME is the a or b. This should be stated in the text and discussed in the differential function of both GSDME in fish physiology (i.e. PMIDs: 34252476, 32111733 or 36685536).</p>

<p>(1) The authors should expand their evaluation of the physiological relevance by assessing GSDME cleavage by the human CASP7 S234N mutant in response to triggers such as etoposide or VSV, which are known to induce CASP3 to cleave GSDME (PMID: 28045099). The authors could also test whether the human CASP7 S234N mutation affects substrate preference beyond human GSDME by testing cleavage of mouse GSDME and other CASP3 and CASP7 substrates in this mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) The physiological relevance was discussed in the revised manuscript (lines 328-340). Our study revealed the molecular mechanism underlying the divergence of CASP3- and CASP7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate. One of the physiological consequences is that in humans, CASP7 no longer directly participates in GSDME-mediated cell death, which enables CASP7 to be engaged in other cellular processes. Another physiological consequence is that GSDME activation is limited to CASP3 cleavage, thus restricting GSDME activity to situations more specific, such as that inducing CASP3 activation. The divergence and specialization of the physiological functions of different CASPs are consistent with and possibly conducive to the development of refined regulations of the sophisticated human GSDM pathways, which are executed by multiple GSDM members (A , B, C, D, and E), rather than by GSDME solely in teleost, such as Takifugu. More physiological consequences of CASP3/7 divergence in GSDME activation need to be explored in future studies.</p>
<p>With respect to the reviewer’s suggestion of assessing GSDME cleavage by the human CASP7 S234N mutant in response to triggers such as etoposide or VSV: (i) CASP7 S234N is a creation of our study, not a natural human product, hence its response to CASP7 triggers cannot happen under normal physiological conditions except in the case of application, such as medical application, which is not the aim of our study. (ii)  CASP3/7 activators (such as raptinal) induced robust activation of the endogenous CASP3 (Heimer et al., Cell Death Dis. 2019;10:556) and CASP7 (Author response image 1, below) in human cells. Since CASP3 is the natural activator of GSDME, the presence of the triggers inevitably activates GSDME via CASP3. Hence, under this condition, it will be difficult to examine the effect of CASP7 S234N.</p>

<p>(2) As suggested by the reviewer, the cleavage of other CASP7 substrates, i.e., poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and gelsolin, by HsCASP7 and S234N mutant was determined. The results showed that HsCASP7 and HsCASP7-S234N exhibited similar cleavage capacities. Figure 5-figure supplement 1 and lines 212-214.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It would also be interesting to examine the GSDME structure in different species to gain insight into the nature of mouse GSDME, which cannot be cleaved by either mouse or human CASP7.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because the three-dimensional structure of GSDME is not solved, we are unable to explore the structural mechanism underlying the GSDME cleavage by caspase. Since our results showed that the C-terminal domain was essential for caspase-mediated cleavage of GSDME, it is likely that the C-terminal domain of mouse GSDME may possess some specific features that render it to resist mouse and human CASP7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The evolutionary analysis does not explain why mammalian CASP7 evolved independently to acquire an amino acid change (N234 to S234) in the substrate-binding motif. Since it is difficult to experimentally identify why a functional divergence occurs, it would be beneficial for the authors to speculate on how CASP7 may have acquired functional divergence in mammals; potentially this occurred because of functional redundancies in cell death pathways, for example.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, a speculation was added. Lines 328-340.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) For the recombinant proteins produced for these analyses, it would be helpful to know whether size-exclusion chromatography was used to purify these proteins and whether these purified proteins are soluble. Additionally, the SDS-PAGE in Figure S1B and C show multiple bands for recombinant mutants of TrCASP7 and HsCASP7. Performing protein ID to confirm that the detected bands belong to the respective proteins would be beneficial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The recombinant proteins in this study are soluble and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Size-exclusion chromatography was not used in protein purification.</p>
<p>For the SDS-PAGE in Figure 4-figure supplement 1B and C (Figure S1B and C in the previous submission), the multiple bands are most likely due to the activation cleavage of the TrCASP7 and HsCASP7 variants, which can result in multiple bands, including p10 and p20. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the cleaved p10 was verified by immunoblotting. Figure 4-figure supplement 1B and C.</p>

<p>(5) For Figures 3C and 4A, it would be helpful to mention what parameters or PDB files were used to attribute these secondary structural features to the proteins. In particular, in Figure 3C, residues 261-266 are displayed as a β-strand; however, the well-known α-model represents this region as a loop. Providing the parameters used for these callouts could explain this difference.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For Figure 3C, in the revised manuscript, we used the structure of mouse GSDMA3 (PDB: 5b5r) for the structural analysis of HsGSDME. As indicated by the reviewer, the region of 261-266 is a loop. The description was revised in lines 172 and 174, Figure 3C and Figure 3C legend.</p>
<p>For Figure 4A, the alignment of CASP7 was constructed by using Esprit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi">https://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi</ext-link>) with human CASP7 (PDB:1k86) as the template. The description was revised in the Figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Were divergent sequences selected for the sequence alignment analyses (particularly in Figure 6A)? The selection of sequences can directly influence the outcome of the amino acid residues in each position, and using diverse sequences can reduce the impact of the number of sequences on the LOGO in each phylogenetic group.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 6A, the sequences were selected without bias. For Mammalia, 45 CASP3 and 43 CASP7 were selected; for Aves, 41 CASP3 and 52 CASP7 were selected; for Reptilia, 31CASP3 and 39 CASP7 were selected; for Amphibia, 11 CASP3 and 12 CASP7 were selected; for Osteichthyes, 40 CASP3 and 43 CASP7 were selected. The sequence information was shown in Table 1 and Table 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) For clarity, it would help if the authors provided additional rationale for the selection of residues for mutagenesis, such as selecting Q276, D278, and H283 as exosite residues, when the CASP7 PDB structures (4jr2, 3ibf, and 1k86) suggest that these residues are enriched with loop elements rather than the β sheets expected to facilitate substrate recognition in exosites for caspases (PMID: 32109412). It is possible that the inability to form β-sheets around these positions might indicate the absence of an exosite in CASP7, which further supports the functional effect of the exosite mutations performed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the suggestion, the rationale for the selection of residues for mutagenesis was added (lines 216-222). Unlike the exosite in HsCASP1/4, which is located in a β sheet, the Q276, D278, and H283 of HsCASP7 are located in a loop region (Figure 5-figure supplement 2), which may explain the mutation results and the absence of an exosite in HsCASP7 as suggested by the reviewer.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors wanted to address the differential processing of GSDME by caspase 3 and 7, finding that while in humans GSDME is only processed by CASP3, Takifugu GSDME, and other mammalian can be processed by CASP3 and 7. This is due to a change in a residue in the human CAPS7 active site that abrogates GSDME cleavage. This phenomenon is present in humans and other primates, but not in other mammals such as cats or rodents. This study sheds light on the evolutionary changes inside CASP7, using sequences from different species. Although the study is somehow interesting and elegantly provides strong evidence of this observation, it lacks the physiological relevance of this finding, i.e. on human side, mouse side, and fish what are the consequences of CASP3/7 vs CASP3 cleavage of GSDME.</p>

<p>Fish also present a duplication of GSDME gene and Takifugu present GSDMEa and GSDMEb. It is not clear in the whole study if when referring to TrGSDME is the a or b.

<p>(1) For the chimeric and truncated constructs, such as HsNT-TrCT, TrNT-HsCT, Hsp20-Trp10, Trp20-Hsp10, etc., the authors should provide a table denoting which amino acids were taken from each protein to create the fusion or truncation.</p>

<p>(2) Both reviewers agree that functional physiological experiments are needed to increase the significance of the work. Specifically, the physiological relevance of these findings can be assessed by using western blotting to monitor GSDME cleavage by the human CASP7 S234N mutant compared with wild type CASP7 in response to triggers such as etoposide or VSV, which are known to induce CASP3 to cleave GSDME (PMID: 28045099).</p>
<p>Additionally, the authors can assess cell death in HEK293 cells, HEK293 cells transfected with TrGSDME, HEK293 cells expressing TrCASP3/7 plus TrGSDME, and TrCASP3/7 plus the D255R/D258A mutant. These cells can be stimulated, and pyroptosis can be assessed by using ELISA to measure the release of the cytoplasmic enzyme LDH as well as IL-1β and IL-18, and the percentage of cell death (PI+ positive cells) may also be assessed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) With respect to the physiological relevance, please see the above reply to Reviewer 1’s comment of “Specific recommendations for the authors, 1”.</p>
<p>(2) As shown in our results (Fig. 2), co-expression of TrCASP3/7 and TrGSDME in HEK293T cells induced robust cell death without the need of any stimulation, as evidenced by LDH release and TrGSDME cleavage. In the revised manuscript, similar experiments were performed as suggested, and cell death was assessed by Sytox Green staining (Figure 2-figure supplement 3A and B) and immunoblot to detect the cleavage of both wild type and mutant TrGSDME (Figure 2-figure supplement 3C).
