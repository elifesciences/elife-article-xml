<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The immune and sensory nervous systems, having evolved together, use a shared language of receptors and transmitters to maintain homeostasis by responding to external and internal disruptions. Although beneficial in many cases, neurons can exacerbate inflammation during allergic reactions, such as asthma. Our research modeled asthma aggravated by pollution, exposing mice to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles and ovalbumin. This exposure significantly increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid neutrophils and γδ T cells compared to exposure to ovalbumin alone. We normalized airway inflammation and lung neutrophil levels by silencing nociceptor neurons at inflammation’s peak using intranasal QX-314 or ablating TRPV1-expressing neurons. Additionally, we observed heightened sensitivity in chemical-sensing TRPA1 channels in neurons from pollution-exacerbated asthmatic mice. Elevated levels of artemin were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from pollution-exposed mice, with artemin levels normalizing in mice with ablated nociceptor neurons. Upon exposure PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles, alveolar macrophages expressing pollution-sensing aryl hydrocarbon receptors, were identified as the source of artemin. This molecule enhanced TRPA1 responsiveness and increased neutrophil influx, providing a novel mechanism by which lung-innervating neurons respond to air pollution and suggesting a potential therapeutic target for controlling neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma, a clinically intractable condition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Wildfire events and severity have increased significantly, with substantial adverse health impacts from wildfire-attributable (particulate matter) PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure. The mortality burden from PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure due to California fires from 2008 to 2018 was evaluated to ∼53,000 premature deaths over the 11 years, resulting in an economic impact of $432 to $450 billion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. This form of asthma characterized by significant neutrophilic infiltration is often resistant to traditional treatments, highlighting a significant unmet need in respiratory healthcare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Recent estimates suggest that neutrophilic asthma accounts for approximately 15-25% of all asthma cases, with around 50% of these cases being refractory to standard asthma treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Taken together, resolving neutrophilic asthma constitutes an unmet clinical need of increasing importance.</p>
<p>Organisms have evolved complex fail-safe systems to maintain homeostasis, integrating mechanisms for threat detection, reflex responses, and tailored immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. These functions are co-orchestrated by the immune and sensory nervous systems and designed to detect external threats and internal disturbances. To achieve this, both systems utilize shared metabolic pathways and a common signaling repertoire, including receptors, cytokines, and neuropeptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This shared molecular framework facilitates continuous interactions between these systems, which is crucial for regulating various processes. These include the physiological monitoring of barrier tissues such as skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and involve anticipatory immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> as well as the management of pathologies like allergic reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In lung disease, vasoactive intestinal peptide <bold>(VIP</bold>), released from a subset of pulmonary sensory neurons stimulated by the inflammatory cytokine IL-5, promotes allergic inflammation. It acts on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and resident innate lymphoid type 2 cells (<bold>ILC2</bold>s), increasing T helper type-2 (<bold>T</bold><sub><bold>H</bold></sub><bold>2</bold>) cytokines, which are key drivers of asthmatic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Building on these findings, our research indicates that vagal nociceptor neurons contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, mucus metaplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and sensing of immunoglobulin E and G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. These neurons also direct antibody class switching in B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and IgG production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Our recent studies have revealed that a subset of nociceptor neurons is actively reprogrammed by asthma-driving cytokines IL-4/IL-13, making them sensitive to the inhibitory signal provided by NPY secreted by lung-innervating sympathetic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Additionally, we have discovered that lung-resident basophils sustain the pro-inflammatory phenotype of a population of vagal preceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Other work shows that leukotriene C4 and IL-4 receptors, namely CysLTR2 and IL-4Rα, are associated with chronic itching and exacerbated bronchial contraction and inflammation in asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Urban pollution and the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires contribute to higher concentrations of small particulate matter (less than 2.5 µm). This change shifts asthma from treatment-responsive eosinophilic and T<sub>H</sub>2 types to treatment-resistant neutrophilic and mixed T<sub>H</sub>17/T<sub>H</sub>2 types. To address this unmet clinical need and explore whether neuron silencing can alleviate this type of airway inflammation, we used a novel model of neutrophilic asthma. In this model, fine particulate matter (<bold>FPM</bold>) is added to ovalbumin. We also investigated the molecular mechanisms behind the heightened neuronal sensitivity observed in this context, identifying alveolar macrophages-produced artemin as a key driver of this hypersensitivity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The group led by Prof. Ya-Jen Chang29 has recently developed a novel method to model pollution-exacerbated asthma and to explore how fine particulate matter (<bold>FPM</bold>) causes airway inflammation. Their research demonstrates that FPM exposure triggers airway hyperreactivity (<bold>AHR</bold>) and neutrophilic inflammation, increases T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>17 immune responses, and elevates epithelial cell apoptosis rates. A key finding is that γδ T cells significantly contribute to this inflammation and AHR by producing IL-17A.</p>
<p>Building on this foundation, our team is investigating whether lung-innervating nociceptor neurons become sensitized during asthma exacerbations. To test this, male and female C57BL6 mice aged 6-10 weeks were sensitized with an emulsion of ovalbumin (OVA, 200 µg/dose) and aluminum hydroxide (1 mg/dose) on days 0 and 7 and later challenged intranasally with OVA (50 µg/dose) with or without fine particulate matter (FPM, 20 µg/dose) on days 14-16. JNC neurons were harvested on day 17, cultured for 24 hours, and then loaded with the calcium indicator Fura-2AM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Subsequent stimulation with the TRPA1 agonist AITC (10 µM) and the pan-neuronal activator KCl (40 mM) revealed increased neuronal responsiveness in mice exposed to the FPM and OVA combination compared to those exposed only to OVA. The latter showed similar sensitivity to the one of wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>).</p>

Following culturing, the cells were loaded with the calcium indicator Fura-2AM and sequentially stimulated with AITC (10 µM at 60-90 seconds, 30 µM at 90-120 seconds, 100 µM at 120-150 seconds) and KCl (40 mM at 420-435 seconds). Calcium flux was recorded throughout these stimulations (<bold>B</bold>), and the amplitude of AITC responses was calculated as the ratio of peak F340/F380 after stimulation to the baseline F340/F380 30 seconds before stimulation (<bold>C</bold>). <italic>Data are presented as means ± 95% CI (</italic><bold><italic>B</italic></bold><italic>), means ± SEM (</italic><bold><italic>C</italic></bold><italic>)</italic></p>

<p>Building on recent findings that the asthma-promoting cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 reprogram lung-innervating nociceptor neurons to adopt a pro-allergic phenotype26, we sought to understand how pollution-exacerbated asthma might reprogram these neurons. To do so, TRPV1cre::td-Tomatocre/wt mice underwent the classic ovalbumin protocol with or without FPM exposure. TRPV1+ JNC neurons were isolated, dissociated, and enriched to exclude adjacent satellite glial and immune cells, followed by FACS-sorting and RNA sequencing. Our data suggest the induction of several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between OVA-FPM vs naïve groups (<italic>Lifr, Oprm1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>), OVA-FPM vs OVA alone groups (<italic>Oprm1, Nefh, P2ry1, Prkcb, Gabra1, Kcnv1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>), and OVA alone vs naïve groups (<italic>Npy1r, Kcna1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-F</xref>). Together, the induction of pollution-exacerbated asthma transcriptomically and functionally reprogram lung-innervating nociceptor neurons.</p>

</fig>
<p>Building on this finding, we explore whether silencing these neurons affects pollution-exacerbated asthma. To test this, we adapted a neuron-blocking strategy, originally developed for pain and itch neurons, to silence tumor-innervating nociceptors. This approach utilizes non-selective ion channels (TRPA1 and TRPV1) as drug-entry ports for delivering a charged, membrane-impermeable form of lidocaine (QX-314). QX-314 enters sensory fibers during inflammation to block sodium currents, providing a targeted and durable (&gt; 9h) electrical blockade of nociceptors without affecting immune cell function30–33. Intranasal injection of QX-314, a charged calcium channel blocker reversed allergic airway inflammation, coughing, mucus metaplasia, and hyperreactivity18. Here, we found that an acute intranasal dose of QX-314 at the peak of inflammation (day 17, 5 nmol, 50 μL) significantly reduced bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) eosinophil and neutrophil counts, normalizing these levels to the one observed in asthmatic mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). To substantiate these findings, we genetically engineered mice with either intact (TRPV1wt::DTAfl/wt) or ablated (TRPV1cre::DTAfl/wt) TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons13,34,35. Compared to controls, the ablated mice showed a marked reduction in BALF neutrophils and γδ T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-E</xref>), confirming the significant role of nociceptors in modulating inflammation and immune responses in pollution-exacerbated asthma.</p>
<p>To further understand how nociceptor neurons regulate airway inflammation, we conducted an unbiased multiplex cytokine array. This analysis revealed elevated levels of asthma-driving cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, CCL2, and TNFα, with TNFα levels normalizing following the ablation of nociceptor neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Additionally, targeted ELISA analysis showed increased levels of artemin, which returned to normal in the absence of nociceptor neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Artemin is a significant protein within the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family, which is crucial for the development and functionality of the nervous system. Artemin is vital in developing sympathetic36 and sensory neurons37 by binding to the GFRα3-RET receptor complex on their surfaces, including many nociceptors. Activation of this receptor by artemin not only supports the survival and growth of these neurons during embryonic development but also leads to their increased sensitivity and hyperactivity under inflammatory conditions38–40.</p>
<p>To better understand the role of artemin and its interactions in respiratory health, we focused on identifying the specific populations of vagal neurons that express the artemin receptor, Gfrα3. To achieve this, we conducted an in-silico analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from the jugular-nodose ganglion cells of Kupari (dataset GSE124312)41. This analysis revealed that <italic>Gfra3</italic> is expressed in several nociceptor neuron subtypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>), specifically JG3 (OSM-R-expressing neurons), JG4 (TRPA1 and SSTR2-expressing), and JG6 (TRPM8-expressing).</p>

<p>In parallel, we explored the cellular sources of artemin and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) using Immgen. Our analysis indicated high expression of the artemin gene (<italic>Artn</italic>) by macrophages, showing significant levels of AhR expression. However, slightly less than ILC2s and eosinophils (<bold>SF. 1</bold>). Based on these in silico findings, we harvested alveolar macrophages from naïve C57BL/6 mice and exposed them to fine particulate matter (FPM). This resulted in time-dependent increases in <italic>Artn</italic> transcript expression, underscoring the dynamic response of these cells to environmental stimuli (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). These findings elucidate significant cellular interactions involving artemin and AhR, highlighting their roles in inflammation and potentially in the pathophysiology of respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>A recent study has linked the overexpression of artemin with increased mRNA levels of several key nociceptor neurons inflammation markers including <italic>Gfrα3, TrkA, Trpv1</italic>, and <italic>Trpa1</italic>, which was associated with the enhancement of thermal sensitivity in mice by lowering heat thresholds and amplifying responses to thermal stimuli39. Building on this, our investigations into FPM-sensitized neurons revealed heightened calcium responses to the TRPA1 agonist AITC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B-C</xref>), suggesting a potential role for artemin in this enhanced activity. Subsequent experiments conducted with naïve C57BL/6 mice provided further evidence; JNC neurons from these mice demonstrated increased AITC responses compared to those treated with a vehicle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F-H</xref>). These findings collectively suggest that alveolar macrophages, by releasing artemin, act as an upstream mediator sensitive to pollutants. This mechanism leads to sensitizing nociceptor neurons, facilitating their role in upregulating allergic airway inflammation. This pathway underscores a critical interaction between environmental pollutants and the neurogenic exacerbation of allergic responses (<bold>SF 2</bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our research, along with others, indicates that nociceptor neurons typically promote regulatory immunity in the context of bacterial42, viral43, fungal44 infections, or malignancies13. To our knowledge, the impact of neuro-immunity in regulating T<sub>H</sub>17 immunity is more limited, with only one study showing that TRPV1<sup>+</sup> neuron activation elicits a local type 17 immune response that augmented host defense to C. albicans and S. aureus9. Given the knowledge gap in lung inflammation, we set out to assess how neuro-immunity shapes neutrophil influx and T<sub>H</sub>17/T<sub>H</sub>2 activation in a model of pollution-exacerbated airway inflammation. We found that ablation or silencing of nociceptor neurons prevented the induction of airway inflammation, highlighting a potential novel therapeutic pathway for treating refractory asthma. This finding phenocopy our previous preclinical data showing that nociceptor neuron silencing using a charged voltage-gated sodium channel18,24,30 or calcium channel31 blocker can stop eosinophilic airway inflammation. It also matches the absence of effect we found in nociceptor neuron ablation in a model of T<sub>H</sub>1 inflammation induced by CFA/OVA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Dissecting lung neuro-immunity</title>
<p>Chiu’s group demonstrated that during bacterial infections, nociceptor neurons limit neutrophil influx and their antimicrobial activity by releasing the neuropeptide CGRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In support of this, Ugolini’s team found that ablating NaV1.8<sup>+</sup> nociceptor neurons during HSV-1 viral infections led to a significant increase in neutrophils in the skin, associated with heightened cytokine production and viral skin lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Here, we report that ablating TRPV1 neurons, a subset of NaV1.8-expressing sensory neurons, decreases the influx of neutrophils exacerbated by pollution, suggesting a different underlying mechanism, likely involving substance P rather than CGRP.</p>
<p>Thus, we showed that vagal nociceptor neurons can detect immune complexes formed between allergens and IgE, triggering the release of substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) but not CGRP22. We confirmed these findings in asthmatic mice’s bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)24. Further, we demonstrated that SP promotes mucus metaplasia in the lungs of asthmatic mice20 and influences B cell antibody class switching24. Other researchers corroborated both findings25,45–47. Additionally, we observed that TRPV1+ nociceptor neuron ablation impairs antigen trafficking in lymph nodes48, and antibody class-switching25 potentially reducing the severity or development of allergic reactions49.</p>
<p>Emerging research highlights the varied immunomodulatory effects of different neuropeptides. For instance, CGRP hinders the migration of dendritic cells in psoriasis11,50, whereas SP enhances their migration to lymph nodes in atopic dermatitis10. VIP and neuromedin U (NMU) increase the production of pro-asthmatic cytokines by lung ILC2 cells18,51–54, whereas CGRP has similar55,56 or opposite effect57. In the lungs, CGRP reduces the infiltration of neutrophils and gamma-delta T (γδT) cells, offering protection against Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia58,59. Conversely, CGRP can worsen psoriasis in the skin by inducing dendritic cells to produce IL-23, which activates IL-17-producing γδT cells, exacerbating inflammation44. In response to C. albicans, sensory neurons also release CGRP, prompting CD301b+ dendritic cells to produce IL-23 and initiating a T helper type-17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) and γδT cell-mediated response marked by IL-17A and IL-22 production, which enhances host resistance to infection9. Our findings indicate that nociceptor neuron ablation reduces γδ T-cell activation, an effect we attribute to SP/VIP-driven responses due to our model’s lack of heighten CGRP release18,24. Future research will focus on how neurons directly regulate γδ T-cell and neutrophil function in these contexts.</p>

<title>Aryl hydrocarbon receptor and alveolar macrophages</title>
<p>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is essential in modulating inflammation, as evidenced by its ability to decrease inflammation in the skin of psoriasis patients60. Mice lacking AhR display worsened symptoms, underscoring its vital role in controlling inflammation61. Beyond its expression in alveolar macrophages, as we observed, AhR is also present in various other innate immune cells such as ILC2, eosinophils, and neurons. A recent preprint highlights AhR’s dual function as a critical molecular sensor and regulator, balancing neural protection and axon regeneration62. It shows that while AhR activation in DRG sensory neurons inhibits axon regeneration, its deletion activates gene programs associated with axonogenesis, reduces inflammation and stress signaling, and enhances pro-growth pathways following peripheral axotomy62. AhR has also been implicated in regulating the gut-brain axis63. Although we have not formally tested this, it is plausible that AhR-expressing neurons, similar to alveolar macrophages, can directly sense fine particulate matter (FPM), potentially explaining the direct neuronal reprogramming we observed after pollutant exposure. Future research will explore this hypothesis using nociceptor neurons with conditional AhR knockout.</p>

<title>Artemin sensing, TRPA1 sensitization, and airway inflammation</title>
<p>Alveolar macrophages serve as an early warning system in the lungs64. We found that they detect pollutants like fine particulate matter and trigger defensive reflexes by releasing artemin. This action activates and sensitizes nociceptor neurons to TRPA1-sensing noxious stimuli. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that a subtype of TRPA1, SST2R neurons, express the GDNF receptor GFRα3 and are sensitized by artemin. This finding complements previous research showing that keratinocyte-produced TSLP sensitizes skin-innervating nociceptor neurons, promoting itch and skin atopy65. In the lungs, TRPA1 germline knockout reduces allergic airway inflammation66,67, while Genentech’s recent Phase 1 research demonstrated that TRPA1 agonists are elevated in asthmatic human airways and contribute to inflammation and hyperreactivity. Their development of GDC-0334, a selective TRPA1 antagonist, effectively reduces inflammation, cough, and allergic reactions in preclinical trials and decreases pain and itch in human studies68, supporting TRPA1 sensitization and nociceptor neuron as a whole as a major upstream asthma driver.</p>
<p>We previously observed that neurons in the nodose ganglia express high levels of TRPA1 and exhibit increased thermal sensitivity and neuron outgrowth in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) yet remain unresponsive to nerve growth factor35. Here, we showed that lung-innervating vagal neurons express GFRa3 and respond to artemin, which sensitizes TRPA1 responses and promotes subsequent airway inflammation. JNC neurons show significant transcriptomic reprogramming when exposed to ovalbumin plus fine particulate matter (OVA+FPM), like their response to pro-asthmatic cytokines. Previous studies support this reprogramming and TRPA1 sensitization. Among others, data shows that EGR1 and artemin levels are elevated in atopic dermatitis patients, where EGR1-deficient mice showed reduced nerve density and scratching behavior mediated by artemin signaling69. Overexpression of artemin also increases the sensitivity of sensory neurons to thermal stimuli39, highlighting its crucial role in regulating neuronal outgrowth and sensitivity in atopic conditions. Taking together, preventing artemin’s action on neurons by blocking GFRa3 might also reveal novel therapeutic targets to avoid the maladaptive involvement of nociceptor neurons in pollution-exacerbated asthma.</p>
<p>In the context of pollution-exacerbated asthma, our research links the sensitization of TRPA1+ nociceptor neurons and heightened allergic inflammation to artemin produced by macrophages. We propose new therapeutic targets to dampen neutrophilic airway inflammation by i) targeting the AhR-mediated pollution sensing by alveolar macrophages (AM), ii) inhibiting artemin’s effect on neurons by blocking GFRa3, iii) blocking TRPA1 using novel antagonists such as GDC-0334, and iv) silencing nociceptor neurons with charged lidocaine derivatives.</p>

<caption><title>Schematic of nociceptor involvement in air pollution-exacerbated allergic asthma.</title>
<p>In our study, we modeled pollution-exacerbated asthma in mice by exposing them to PM2.5 particles and ovalbumin. This exposure significantly increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) neutrophils and γδ T-cells compared to exposure to ovalbumin alone. To address the heightened airway inflammation, we applied intranasal QX-314, a charged derivative of lidocaine, during peak inflammation, which effectively normalized the inflammation. Similarly, ablating TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons also normalized lung neutrophil levels.</p>
<p>Further analysis using calcium microscopy on neurons from the jugular-nodose complex showed increased sensitivity of TRPA1 channels in neurons from pollution-exacerbated asthmatic mice. Elevated TNFα and the growth factor artemin levels were found in the BALF of pollution-exposed mice, which normalized following nociceptor neuron ablation.</p>
<p>We pinpointed alveolar macrophages as the source of artemin, which, expressing aryl hydrocarbon receptors, responded to fine particulate matter (FPM) by releasing artemin. This release increased TRPA1 responsiveness to its agonist, mustard oil, exacerbating airway inflammation. Our findings indicate that silencing nociceptor neurons can interrupt this mechanistic pathway and offer a novel approach to mitigating neutrophilic airway inflammation in pollution-driven asthma.</p></caption>

<p>All procedures involving animals adhered to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) and the Queen’s University Animal Care Committee (UACC). Mice were accommodated in individually ventilated cages with free water and food access under 12-hour light cycles. The strains used, C57BL6/J (000664), DTAfl/fl (010527), and TRPV1cre (017769), were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and bred in-house.</p>
<p>For the ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation model, C57BL6 mice were sensitized via intraperitoneal injection with a mix of grade V OVA (200 µg/dose; Sigma-Aldrich A5503) and Imject® Alum (1 mg/dose; ThermoFisher 77161) on days 0 and 7. Subsequently, they underwent intranasal challenges with OVA (50 µg/dose), with or without fine particulate matter (FPM; 20 µg/dose; NIST 2786), from day 14 to 16. Control mice were sensitized but not challenged. The mice were euthanized on day 17, and samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung tissue, and the jugular-nodose complex (JNC) were collected.</p>

<p>The study is a <bold>valuable</bold> addition to the field, showing how particulate matter may be acting via nociceptor neurons towards neutrophilic asthma exacerbations. The <bold>solid</bold> evidence for the role of a nociceptive pathway in model systems is relevant to human asthma in its current form but would be further strengthened by mechanistic insights. This would be particularly relevant to further translational research towards blocking the exacerbating effect of air pollution on asthma.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the presented study, the authors aim to explore the role of nociceptors in the fine particulate matter (FPM) mediated Asthma phenotype, using rodent models of allergic airway inflammation. This manuscript builds on previous studies, and identify transciptomic reprogramming and an increased sensitivity of the jugular nodose complex (JNC) neurons, one of the major sensory ganglion for the airways, on exposure to FPM along with Ova during the challenge phase. The authors then use OX-314 a selectively permeable form of lidocaine, and TRPV1 knockouts to demonstrate that nociceptor blocking can reduce airway inflammation in their experimental setup.</p>
<p>The authors further identify the presence of Gfra3 on the JNC neurons, a receptor for the protein Artemin, and demonstrate their sensitivity to Artmein as a ligand. They further show that alveolar macrophages release Artemin on exposure to FPM.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study builds on results available from multiple previous work, and presents important results which allow insights into the mixed phenotypes of Asthma seen clinically. In addition, by identifying the role of nociceptors, they identify potential therapeutic targets which bear high translational potential.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the results presented in the study are highly relevant, there is a need for further mechanistic dissection to allow better inferences. Currently certain results seem assocaitive. Also, certain visualisations and experimental protocols presented in the manuscript need careful assessment and interpretation.</p>
<p>While Asthma is a chronic disease, the presented results are particularly important to explore Asthma exacerbations in response to acute expsoure to air pollutants. This is relevant in today's age of increasing air pollution and increasing global travel.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors sought to investigate the role of nociceptor neurons in the pathogenesis of pollution-mediated neutrophilic asthma.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors utilize TRPV1 ablated mice to confirm effects of intranasally administered QX-314 utilized to block sodium currents.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that via artemin, which is upregulated in alveolar macrophages in response to pollution, sensitizes JNC neurons thereby increasing their responsiveness to pollution. Ablation or inactivity of nociceptor neurons prevented the pollution induced increase in inflammation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While neutrophilic, the model used doesn't appear to truly recapitulate a Th2/Th17 phenotype. No IL-17A is visible/evident in the BALF fluid within the model. (Figure 3F).</p>
<p>Unclear of the relevance of the RNAseq dataset, none of the identified DEGs were evaluated in the context of mechanism.</p>
<p>The authors overall achieved the aim of demonstrating that nociceptor neurons are important to the pathogenesis of pollution-exacerbated asthma. Their results support their conclusions overall, although there are ways the study findings can be strengthened. This work further evaluates how nociceptor neurons contribute to asthma pathogenesis important for consideration while proposing treatment strategies for undertreated asthma endotypes.</p>

<p>Asthma is a complex disease that includes endogenous epithelial, immune, and neural components that respond awkwardly to environmental stimuli. Small airborne particles with diameters in the range of 2.5 micrometers or less, so-called PM2.5, are generally thought to contribute to some forms of asthma. These forms of asthma may have increased numbers of neutrophils and/or eosinophils present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and are difficult to treat effectively as they tend to be poorly responsive to steroids. Here, Wang and colleagues build on a recent model that incorporated PM2.5 which was found to have a neutrophilic component. Wang altered the model to provide an extra kick via the incorporation of ovalbumin. Building on their prior expertise linking nociceptors and inflammation, they find that silencing TRPV1-expressing neurons either pharmacologically or genetically, abrogated inflammation and the accumulation of neutrophils. By examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, they found not only that levels of the number of cytokines were increased, but also that artemin, a protein that supports neuronal development and function, was elevated, which did not occur in nociceptor-ablated mice. They also found that alveolar macrophages exposed to PM2.5 particles had increased artemin transcription, suggesting a further link between pollutants, and immune and neural interactions.</p>
<p>There are substantial caveats that must be attached to the suggestions by the authors that targeting nociceptors might provide an approach to the treatment of neutrophilic airway inflammation in pollution-driven asthma in general and wildfire-associated respiratory problems in particular. These caveats include the uncertainty of the relevance of the conventional source of PM2.5, to pollution and asthma. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the standard reference material (SRM) 2786 is a mix obtained from an air intake system in the Czech Republic. It is not clear exactly what is in the mix, and a recent bioRxiv preprint, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.18.553903v3.full.pdf">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.18.553903v3.full.pdf</ext-link> reveals the presence of endotoxin. Care should thus be taken in interpreting data using particulate matter. Regarding wildfires, there is data that indicates that such exposure is toxic to macrophages. What impact might that then have on the production of cytokines, and artemin, in humans?</p>
