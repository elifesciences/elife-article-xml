<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The hippocampus is a complex structure critically involved in numerous behavior-regulating systems. In young adults, multiple overlapping spatial modes along its longitudinal and transverse axes describe the organization of its functional integration with neocortex, extending the traditional framework emphasizing functional differences between sharply segregated hippocampal subregions. Yet, it remains unknown whether these modes (i.e., gradients) persist across the adult human lifespan, and relate to memory and molecular markers associated with brain function and cognition. In two independent samples, we demonstrate that the principal anteroposterior and second-order, mid-to-anterior/posterior hippocampal modes of neocortical functional connectivity, representing distinct dimensions of macroscale cortical organization, manifest across the adult lifespan. Specifically, individual differences in topography of the second-order gradient predicted episodic memory and mirrored dopamine D1 receptor distribution, capturing shared functional and molecular organization. Older age was associated with less distinct transitions along gradients (i.e., increased functional homogeneity). Importantly, a youth-like gradient profile predicted preserved episodic memory – emphasizing age-related gradient dedifferentiation as a marker of cognitive decline. Our results underscore a critical role of mapping multidimensional hippocampal organization in understanding the neural circuits that support memory across the adult lifespan.</p>

<sec>
<p>The hippocampus plays a critical role in human behavior beyond its well-established involvement in memory and spatial navigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Contemporary views hold that its broad involvement in cognition emerges through the combination of its intrinsic circuitry and its widespread neocortical connections – placing it at the interface of multiple behavioral systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Characterizing organizational principles of hippocampal integration with the larger neocortical landscape is therefore key to our understanding of its contribution to cognition and to the many diseases associated with its dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, together with histological and functional descriptions in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, emphasize the hippocampus transverse (mediolateral) and longitudinal (anteroposterior) axes in determining its functional organization, contribution to behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and vulnerability to neurological disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In humans, functional analogues of the hippocampus canonical internal circuitry and its anatomical connections with neocortical areas have successfully been provided by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, at a coarse scale confirming the anteroposterior differentiation in connectivity observed in the animal literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Despite the consistency by which this anteroposterior organizational dimension emerges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, significant questions however remain regarding its spatial distribution across cortex and its contribution to behavior across the adult human lifespan.</p>
<p>Lack of consensus is especially evident in terms of the hippocampus functional connectivity with the default-mode network (DMN), encompassing core areas of the brain’s system for memory-guided behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Several studies primarily attribute integration with the DMN to the posterior hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, consistent with its anatomical connections to midline posterior parietal areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Other sources emphasize the anterior hippocampus as driving connectivity with the DMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, on the basis of its anatomical connections with ventromedial prefrontal areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. These inconsistencies ultimately limit our understanding of hippocampal functional specialization, and the impact on cognition of the heterogeneous vulnerability to aging and disease observed along the hippocampus longitudinal axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We propose that inconsistencies in part stem from overlooking multiple overlapping and complementary functional modes, not discernable through traditional parcellation-based approaches, which assume homogeneous function within distinct, pre-defined, portions of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence in young adults indicate that hippocampal neocortical connectivity is indeed fundamentally multidimensional – organized in several overlapping, but distinct, spatial modes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Whereas such gradient-based observations describe a principal anteroposterior mode of neocortical connectivity, they also identify orthogonal modes of long-axis and transverse variation in connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Importantly, these hippocampal gradients appear to reflect well-known gradients of macroscale brain function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, which express functional differentiation across distinct cortical hierarchies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The principal anteroposterior gradient has been linked to functional differentiation along a task-negative/task-positive cortical dimension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, separating neural communities involved in the formation of representations from sensory input (e.g., visual, somatosensory, and DMN areas) and those involved in the modulation of these representations (e.g., frontoparietal areas of attention and control)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In parallel, a secondary, non-linear, long-axis gradient is suggested to correspond to the principal unimodal-transmodal gradient of cortical function (oppositely anchored in associative DMN areas and in unimodal sensory and motor cortices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, the biological underpinnings of this secondary gradient are still unknown, in contrast to the principal gradient, demonstrated also in microstructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, gray matter covariance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Differences in the topography (i.e., the spatial layout) of the principal, anteroposterior, hippocampal gradient may predict episodic memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, but current findings are restricted to younger age – and to mainly the same sample (i.e., the Human Connectome Project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Moreover, it remains unknown in which capacity the secondary long-axis gradient contributes to behavior. Yet, a comprehensive model of the spatial properties of hippocampal functional organization should consider that hippocampal functional alterations occur across the adult lifespan, and manifest across the hippocampus in a heterogeneous manner. Specifically, aging has been linked to differential functional isolation of anterior and posterior hippocampal regions from prefrontal areas and large-scale brain networks including the DMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Such neocortical disconnection of hippocampal subregions has been linked to dysfunction during memory encoding and retrieval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and in turn, to episodic memory decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Findings which link hippocampal isolation to increased functional homogeneity within the region, suggest that its disconnection from neocortex is driven by the spatial patterns in which Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology accumulates in cognitively healthy older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Importantly, loss of functional segregation between task-negative and task-positive poles is a functional hallmark of both healthy aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> – introducing overall ambiguity as to whether hippocampal gradients established in young adults persist into older age.</p>
<p>Dopamine (DA) is one of the most important modulators of hippocampus-dependent function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, and influences the brain’s functional architecture through enhancing specificity of neuronal signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Consistently, there is a DA-dependent aspect of maintained functional network segregation in aging which supports cognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Animal models suggest heterogeneous patterns of DA innervation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and postsynaptic DA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, across both transverse and longitudinal hippocampal axes, likely allowing for separation between DA modulation of distinct hippocampus-dependent behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Moreover, the human hippocampus has been linked to distinct DA circuits on the basis of long-axis variation in functional connectivity with midbrain and striatal regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the organization of hippocampal neocortical connectivity partly reflects the underlying distribution of hippocampal DA receptors. Based on recent findings revealing a unimodal-transmodal organization of the most abundantly expressed DA receptor subtype, D1 (D1DR), across cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, we predicted predominant spatial correspondence for any hippocampal gradient conveying a unimodal-transmodal pattern across cortex.</p>
<p>Here, we characterize the multidimensional functional organization of the hippocampus in two independent adult-lifespan samples, and map individual differences in fine-scale topographic properties of connectivity gradients onto behavioral and molecular phenotypes. We report three hippocampal gradients displaying distinct correspondence to a) canonical gradients of cortical function, b) the organization of hippocampal DA receptors, and c) individual differences in memory function. Multivariate, data-driven, classification on gradient topography identified older adults exhibiting a youth-like gradient profile and superior memory function as distinct from age-matched older counterparts, emphasizing a behavioral significance of preserved functional hippocampal topography in older age.</p>

<title>Multiple dimensions of hippocampal-neocortical integration across the adult lifespan</title>
<p>Connectopic mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> was applied to resting-state fMRI data (n=180, 90 men/90 women; 20-79 years; mean age = 49.8±17.4) from the DyNAMiC study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. For replication, we used an independent sample of 224 adults (122 men/102 women; 29-85 years mean age = 65.0±13.0) from the Betula project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Connectopic mapping was used to extract the dominant modes of functional cortical connectivity within the hippocampus based on non-linear manifold learning (Laplacian eigenmaps) applied to a similarity matrix derived from connectivity fingerprints computed between each hippocampal voxel and each voxel within neocortex. This identified a set of orthogonal connectopic maps (i.e., eigenvectors) describing overlapping connectivity topographies (i.e., gradients) within the hippocampus. Gradients were computed at subject level, and at group level across the sample, separately for the left and right hippocampus. We analyzed the first three gradients, together explaining 63% and 71% of the variance in left and right-hemispheres, respectively. This number corresponded to a clear elbow in the scree plot (Supplementary Figure 1).</p>
<p>The principal gradient (G1), explaining 44% and 53% of the variance in left and right hemispheres, was organized along the hippocampus longitudinal axis, conveying gradual anterior-to-posterior variation in cortical connectivity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This pattern of connectivity change is illustrated by dividing subject-level G1 connectopic maps into 23 long-axis bins of ∼2mm and plotting the average gradient values as a function of their distance from the most anterior hippocampal voxel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The second-order gradient (G2), explaining 11% of the variance in both hemispheres, expressed a secondary long-axis gradient organized from the middle hippocampus towards anterior and posterior ends (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Finally, the third-order gradient (G3: explaining 8% and 7% of the variance), reflected variation along the hippocampus transverse axis, such that inferior-lateral parts of the hippocampus were separated from medial-superior parts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This pattern was most pronounced in the anterior hippocampus. Inspecting G3 across sample-specific segmentations of cornu ammonis (CA1-3), dentate gyrus (DG/CA4), and subiculum subfields suggested that while CA1-3 expressed the full extent of the gradient, and DG/CA4 variation around its center, the subiculum expressed only the most inferior section of the gradient (Supplementary Figure 2).</p>
<p>The three gradients reflected gradients identified in young adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and were highly reproducible in the independent replication data set (Supplementary Figure 3). Correspondence between samples was determined by spatial correlations (left hemisphere: G1: <italic>r</italic> = 0.990, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; G2: <italic>r</italic> = 0.946, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; G3: <italic>r</italic> = 0.918, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; right hemisphere: G1: <italic>r</italic> = 0.996, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; G2: <italic>r</italic> = 0.969, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; G3: <italic>r</italic> = 0.897, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the reliability of connectopic mapping to produce functional connectivity gradients was determined across varying degrees of spatial smoothing, and contrasted against connectopic maps derived from random data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Results confirmed high stability of resting-state gradients and their efficacy in capturing inter-individual differences, whereas random data failed to produce meaningful gradients (Supplementary Figure 4).</p>

Values range between 0 (blue) and 1 (yellow). B) Plots convey change in connectivity along the anteroposterior hippocampal axis. Mean values from 23 hippocampal bins (each ∼2mm) are plotted against their distance (in mm) from the most anterior hippocampal voxel. Values were estimated based on subject-level gradients and averaged across participants. G1 conveys gradual change in connectivity along an anteroposterior gradient. G2 conveys gradual change in connectivity along a second-order long-axis gradient, separating the middle hippocampus from anterior and posterior ends. G3 conveys close to no change in connectivity along the longitudinal axis, with connectivity change instead organized in a primarily medial-lateral gradient.

<title>Hippocampal gradients reflect distinct dimensions of macroscale cortical organization</title>
<p>The projection of G1 onto cortex conveyed a pattern linking medial orbitofrontal, temporolimbic, and medial parietal regions at the anterior end of the gradient with occipital and frontoparietal regions at the posterior end (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). For further characterization, we computed G1 gradient values within seven cortical networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, and examined their position in gradient space. This placed the DMN, limbic, and somatomotor networks at anterior-to-middle parts of the gradient, whereas visual, ventral attention, and frontoparietal networks toward the posterior end of the gradient (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, G2 exhibited a unimodal-transmodal pattern across cortex, linking the middle hippocampus to frontal and posterior parietal regions, and anterior and posterior hippocampal ends to somatomotor and occipital regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistently, the DMN and frontoparietal network mapped onto G2 at one end, and visual and somatomotor networks at the other (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Across cortex, G3 primarily separated temporal and insular areas from medial parietal and medial frontal areas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Aligning with cortical connectivity previously reported for hippocampal subfields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, areas of the DMN most strongly mapped onto the most inferior end of G3, consistent with the connectivity profile of the subiculum, whereas ventral attention and somatomotor networks had a stronger medial position along G3, aligning with reported connectivity of CA1-3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we linked the cortical patterns of gradients to the established macroscale layout of cortical function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> using Spearman’s rank correlation analyses. G1 showed significant correspondence with the cortical representation-modulation gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, differentiating the task-negative DMN and somatomotor networks from task-positive areas of attention and control (left G1: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = -0.353, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> &lt; 0.001; right G1: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = -0.406, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). G1’s correlation with this cortical gradient was greater than its correlations to other cortical gradients (6.3 &lt; Z &lt; 9.6, <italic>ps</italic> &lt; 0.001), as well as significantly stronger than correlations observed for G2 and G3 (1.6 &lt; Z &lt; 6.5, <italic>ps</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, G2 corresponded to the principal unimodal-transmodal gradient of cortical function (left G2: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.502, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> &lt; 0.001; right G2: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.536, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), to a greater extent than G1 and G3 (4.9 &lt; Z &lt; 10.9, <italic>ps</italic> &lt; 0.001) and in comparison to other cortical gradients (5.2 &lt; Z &lt; 9.4, <italic>ps</italic> &lt; 0.001). Finally, the cortical pattern of G3 showed overall weaker correspondence with the canonical cortical gradients. G3’s correlations with the unimodal-transmodal gradient (left G3: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = -0.32, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> = 0.011), and the representation-modulation gradient (right G3: Spearman’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.191, <italic>p</italic><sub>spin</sub> = 0.009), were significantly weaker compared their counterparts of G2 (Z<sub>(998)</sub> = 4.9, p &lt; 0.001) and G1 (Z<sub>(998)</sub> = 5.3, p &lt; 0.001). These multiple lines of evidence contribute to a model of hippocampal functional organization across the adult human lifespan in which G1 and G2 constitute local representations of distinct macroscale cortical motifs.</p>

<title>Distinct patterns of behavioral transitions along G1 and G2</title>

Correlations were assessed between meta-analytical maps of behavioral terms and twenty-percentile bins of each gradient’s cortical projection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).

<title>Topography of G2 reflects distribution of hippocampal dopamine D1 receptors</title>
<p>Next, we tested the spatial correspondence between functional gradients and the distribution of hippocampal DA D1 receptors (D1DR) measured by [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 PET in the DyNAMiC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> sample. To estimate individual differences in gradients’ spatial layout, trend surface modelling (TSM) was applied to each subject-level connectopic map<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. This spatial-statistics approach parameterizes gradients at subject level, yielding a set of model parameters describing the topographic characteristics of each gradient in x, y, z directions (see Methods, and Supplementary Figure 5 for model selection). Unlike voxel-wise statistical inference on gradients, which overlooks the high interdependence between voxels’ gradient values and demands rigorous correction for multiple comparisons, TSM allows for statistical inference across a region’s internal heterogeneity using a concise set of independent parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Moreover, by adjusting the number of polynomial terms, TSM facilitates examination of spatial trends across gradients at coarser-to-finer levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Individual maps of D1DR binding potential (BP) were also submitted to TSM, yielding a set of spatial model parameters describing the topographic characteristics of hippocampal D1DR distribution for each participant. D1DR parameters were subsequently used as predictors of gradient parameters in a multivariate GLM (controlled for age, sex, and mean FD). Individual differences in D1DR topography significantly explained topography of right-hemisphere G2 (F = 1.207, p = 0.041; partial η2 = 0.118), but not of G1 nor G3 (F 0.902-1.108, <italic>p</italic> 0.222-0.750) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This association was robust across multiple TSM model orders (Supplementary Figure 6). Further characterization of G2 as reflecting DA organization was conducted by utilizing additional DA markers at group-level. First, a map of D1DR distribution was formed by averaging the [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 BP images across DyNAMiC participants (n=176), and a map of D2DR distribution was formed by averaging [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride BP images in a subsample of DyNAMiC participants (n = 20). Previously published maps of DAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> and FDOPA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/spmtemplates">https://www.nitrc.org/projects/spmtemplates</ext-link>) were also analyzed. Correlations across group-level TSM parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, revealed significant positive associations between G2 and D1, DAT, and FDOPA (D1: <italic>r</italic> = 0.501, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; DAT: <italic>r</italic> = 0.378, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; FDOPA: <italic>r</italic> = 0.584, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), although not D2 (D2: <italic>r</italic> = 0.131, <italic>p</italic> = 0.44), whereas correlations were not significant for G1 or G3, indicating that G2 best captures shared principles of functional and molecular organization.</p>

<p>Effects of age on gradient topography was assessed using multivariate GLMs including age as the predictor and gradient TSM parameters as dependent variables (controlling for sex and mean frame-wise displacement; FD).

<title>Youth-like gradient topography supports memory in older age</title>
<p>To investigate the functional role of G1 in old age, the principal and most age-sensitive gradient, we tested whether memory in older adults would be facilitated by youth-like gradient topography using two independent datasets. In DyNAMiC, we applied data-driven latent class analysis (LCA) to TSM parameters (residualized to account for age, sex, and mean FD) of left-hemisphere G1, which predicted episodic memory performance in younger adults. LCA yielded a two-class solution identifying two subgroups (n=19 vs. n=30) of older adults (60-79 years), which by definition differed in left-hemisphere G1 characteristics (F<sub>(9,37)</sub> = 13.778, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.770).

<p>Plotting connectivity change along G1 and G2 in the aged and youth-like subgroups revealed that the diminished topographic specificity observed across gradients in older individuals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) was driven by older adults with an aged gradient profile (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Both older subgroups displayed altered gradient organization across cortex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>).

<p>In line with our hypothesis, we observed superior memory in older adults exhibiting a youth-like gradient profile (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>): at trend-level for the composite episodic measure (aged: 43.2±3.7; youth-like: 46.5±6.6; <italic>t</italic> = 1.958, <italic>p</italic> = 0.056), driven by a significant group difference on its word recall sub test (aged: 40.9±4.5; youth-like: 43.4±6.8; <italic>t</italic> = 2.600, <italic>p</italic> = 0.012).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we present a comprehensive multidimensional characterization of functional hippocampal-neocortical integration across the adult human lifespan, and methodically map topography of connectivity gradients onto behavioral and molecular phenotypes. Our findings reveal the presence of two distinct connectivity gradients distributed along the hippocampus longitudinal axis which contribute to episodic memory function across the lifespan. These observations underscore the importance of disentangling multiple dimensions of hippocampal functional organization in advancing our understanding of cortico-hippocampal systems for memory-related behavior. Moreover, we demonstrate in two independent samples, that maintaining a youth-like gradient profile in older age – characterized by preserved distinctiveness of connectivity change along gradients – supports mnemonic functioning, and that increased homogeneity of gradient topography may precede gray matter atrophy.</p>
<p>Despite converging evidence in young adults indicating multiple overlapping modes of functional connectivity across the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, significant questions have remained regarding their spatial distribution across cortex, and their role in behavior. Here, connectopic mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> identified a principal anteroposterior gradient (G1); a second-order gradient of mid-to-anterior/posterior long-axis variation (G2); and a third-order gradient conveying variation across the hippocampus transverse axis (G3). Although we restrict our discussion of G3 given its low proportion of explained variance, we note that it mirrors patterns previously observed in both structure and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Consistently, cortical patterns of G3 matched cortical connectivity profiles previously reported for hippocampal subfields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Our results confirm that functional data favors detection of anteroposterior hippocampal organization in contrast to that determined by its cytoarchitecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, but indicate that higher-order connectivity modes may indeed carry coarse-scale information about subfield-determined organization.</p>
<p>The general organization of neocortical connectivity within the hippocampus showed stability across the lifespan (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), although clear effects of age were evident in the fine-scale topography of connectivity modes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Older age was associated with less distinct transitions in connectivity along G1 and G2, an effect that was exacerbated in a subgroup of older adults exhibiting an aged gradient profile – separated from older adults exhibiting youth-like gradient topography (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref>). This finding constitutes an important addition to evidence highlighting increased homogeneity in hippocampal function in aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Current theories view this loss of specificity as a consequence of its functional isolation from neocortical areas, linked to tau-driven degeneration of the perforant pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Notably, a consequence of age-related deterioration of this entorhinal-hippocampal pathway is impaired mnemonic functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Importantly, older individuals exhibiting dedifferentiated gradient topography, but comparable hippocampal volumes, displayed less efficient episodic memory compared to older adults maintaining youth-like gradient topography (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>; Supplementary Figure 7). This underscores the potential of gradient-based techniques to capture behaviorally relevant alterations in hippocampal function at a stage preceding structural decline.</p>
<p>Testing the correspondence across cortex of G1 and G2 to canonical gradients of cortical function provided support for G1 reflecting differentiation along a representation-modulation dimension (e.g., task-negative/task-positive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-E</xref>), separating frontoparietal areas of attention and control from sensorimotor and DMN areas. Consistent with age-related loss of segregation between task-positive and task-negative poles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, also evident in numerous diseases involving hippocampal dysfunction (e.g., depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, and Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>), we observed altered cortical organization of G1 in both older subgroups. A main difference between subgroups, however, included a unimodal-transmodal organization instead emerging in youth-like older adults, whereas not in the aged subgroup (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). A meaningful role of this potential reorganization was indicated by an association between G1 topography and memory in the youth-like older adults only. In terms of G2, we provide support of its characterization as a local representation of the principal unimodal-transmodal cortical gradient (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-E</xref>), widely demonstrated across functional, structural, and molecular modalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Taken together, our observations support a framework of cortico-hippocampal integration in which the DMN is positioned in different neural contexts: in one case at the opposite end from frontoparietal networks of attention and control, and in the other, opposite to sensorimotor and visual networks – indicating that an account of the hippocampus functional connectivity with the DMN is dependent on multiple neurofunctional hierarchies. The overlap of G1 and G2 may potentially reflect the superimposition of gradients and hubs of long-axis anatomical connections indicated in both the human and animal hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Moreover, the observation that macroscale relationships between distinct cortical systems are mapped out by G1 and G2 in this manner may reflect the hippocampus primordial position in the laminar development of the cerebral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>, supporting the idea that hippocampal function stands, from a phylogenetic perspective, to inform general principles of brain organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Notably, we discovered that G2, specifically, manifests organizational principles shared among function, behavior, and neuromodulation. Meta-analytical decoding reproduced a unimodal-associative axis across G2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), and analyses in relation to the distribution of D1DRs – which similarly varies across cortex along a unimodal-transmodal axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> – demonstrated topographic correspondence both at the level of individual differences and across the group. The topographic correspondence observed between G2 and several DA markers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), suggests that G2 may constitute a mode reflecting a dopaminergic phenotype, contributing to the currently limited understanding of its biological underpinnings.</p>
<p>Finally, whereas the topography of G1 predicted memory in young adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and informed a meaningful classification of older adults, our results emphasize a primary role of G2 in episodic memory across the adult lifespan. It is noteworthy that meta-analytical decoding of G2 primarily linked the unimodal connectivity patterns of anterior and posterior subregions to terms of episodic memory, encoding, and navigation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). G2’s role in memory might as such be considered in light of hippocampal integration with the visual system, by which it contributes to complex perceptual processes supporting memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. In humans, there is evidence of direct hippocampal connections to early visual areas, with recent tractography-based work demonstrating connectivity as primarily localized to the posterior hippocampus and to a smaller region in the anterior hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The verbal nature of our memory tasks likely contributed to the left-lateralization of effects, yet, predominant left-hemisphere vulnerability to aging and age-related pathology should not be ruled out as a meaningful contributor to these effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. Average hippocampal D1DR availability did not differ between older subgroups, but a tendency towards youth-like and aged functional profiles being mirrored in D1DR topography was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). However, longitudinal data is ultimately required to inform the underlying mechanisms of individual differences in hippocampal gradient topography in older age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Future studies should, furthermore, assess gradient modulation by behavioral conditions and extend these method to clinical samples characterized by hippocampal dysfunction.</p>
<p>This study establishes behavioral relevance of two overlapping long-axis modes of hippocampal-neocortical functional connectivity, shedding light on their age-related dedifferentiation, and its impact on cognition. In sum, this study introduces a multidimensional framework for understanding hippocampal-neocortical integration and its interplay with memory and neuromodulation throughout the adult human lifespan.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The DyNAMiC sample included 180 participants (20-79 years; mean age = 49.8±17.4; 90 men/90 women equally distributed within each decade). Individuals were randomly selected from the population register of Umeå, Sweden, and recruited via postal mail. Exclusion criteria implemented during the recruitment procedure included brain pathology, impaired cognitive functioning (Mini Mental State Examination &lt; 26), medical conditions and treatment that could affect brain functioning and cognition (e.g. dementia, diabetes, and psychiatric diagnosis), and brain imaging contraindications (e.g. metal implants). All participants were native Swedish speakers. A total of 16 participants were excluded from connectopic mapping due to excessive in-scanner motion, leaving resting-state fMRI data for 164 participants (20-78 years; mean age = 48.7±17.3). As a replication data set, we used an independent sample of 224 cognitively healthy and native Swedish-speaking adults (122 men/102 women; 29-85 years mean age = 65.0±13.0) from the population-based Betula project, for which the design and recruitment procedures have been reported in detail elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Episodic memory</title>
<p>Episodic memory was measured using three tasks testing word recall, number-word recall and object-location recall, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. In the word recall task, participants were presented with 16 Swedish concrete nouns that appeared successively on a computer screen. Each word was presented for 6 s during encoding with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 1 s. Following encoding, participants reported as many words as they could recall by typing them using the keyboard. Two trials were completed, yielding a maximum score of 32. In the number-word task, participants encoded pairs of 2-digit numbers and concrete plural nouns (e.g., 46 dogs). During encoding, eight number-word pairs were presented, each displayed for 6 s, with an ISI of 1 s. Following encoding, nouns were presented again, in a re-arranged order, and participants had to report the 2-digit number associated with each presented noun (e.g. How many dogs?). This task included two trials with a total maximum score of 16. The third task was an object-location memory task. Here, participants were presented with a 6 × 6 square grid in which 12 objects were, one by one, shown at distinct locations. Each object-position pairing was displayed for 8 s, with an ISI of 1 s. Following encoding, all objects were simultaneously shown next to the grid for the participant to move them (in any order) to their correct position in the grid. If unable to recall the correct position of an object, participants had to guess and place the object in the grid to the best of their ability. Two trials of this task were completed, making the total maximum score 24.</p>
<p>A composite score of performances across the three tasks was calculated and used as the measure of episodic memory. For each of the three tasks, scores were summarized across the total number of trials. The three resulting sum scores were z-standardized and averaged to form one composite score of episodic memory performance (T score: mean = 50; SD = 10). Missing values were replaced by the average of the available observed scores.</p>

The functional data were subsequently co-registered to the anatomical T1-images again, temporally demeaned and linear and quadratic effects were removed. Next, a 36-parameter nuisance regression model was applied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>, including mean cerebrospinal, white-matter, and whole-brain signal in addition to six motion parameters, including parameters’ squares, derivatives, and squared derivatives. To further control for in-scanner motion, the model also included a set of spike regressors, defined as binary vectors of motion-contaminated volumes exceeding a volume-to-volume root-mean-squared (RMS) displacement of 0.25 mm. A temporal high-pass filter (with a threshold of 0.009 Hz) was applied simultaneously as nuisance regression in order to not re-introduce nuisance signals.

Binding potential relative to non-displaceable binding in a reference region (BP<sub>ND</sub>; Innis et al., 2007), was used as an estimate of receptor availability (i.e. D1DR) in the hippocampus, for each participant defined using the FreeSurfer segmentation of their anatomical images.

The simplified reference-tissue model (SRTM) was used to model regional time-activity course (TAC) data. Regional TAC data were adjusted for partial volume effects (PVE) by using the symmetric geometric transfer matrix (SGTM) method implemented in FreeSurfer, and an estimated point-spread-function of 2.5 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM).

<title>Mapping gradients of functional connectivity</title>
<p>Connectopic mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> was run through the ConGrads toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> implemented in FSL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. Mapping was conducted on both subject level and group level, for the left and right hippocampus separately, and involved two main steps. First, for every hippocampal voxel, connectivity fingerprints were computed as the Pearson correlation between the voxel-wise time-series and a singular-value decomposition (SVD) representation of all cortical voxels. In a second step, non-linear manifold learning (Laplacian eigenmaps) was applied to a matrix expressing the degree of similarity between the voxel-wise fingerprints. This yields eigenvectors, so called connectopic maps, representing modes of functional connectivity (i.e. functional gradients). Each connectopic map is then projected onto cortex, for which each vertex is color coded according to the voxel in the hippocampus it correlates the most with. Since connectopic mapping at group level involves applying Laplacian eigenmaps to a group-average similarity matrix, group level mapping across the sample was conducted using the hippocampal and cortical masks derived from the FreeSurfer segmentation of a sample-mean structural image. Mapping was specified to compute 20 gradients, and a subsequent scree plot over explained variance indicated meaningful contributions of the three first connectopic maps, together explaining 67% of the variance across hemispheres (Supplementary Figure 1).</p>

<title>Stability of functional gradients across levels of spatial smoothing</title>
<p>It has recently been suggested that the reliability of connectopic mapping to detect meaningful gradients of resting-state functional connectivity may be limited due to spatial smoothing implemented during preprocessing of fMRI data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. To determine the stability of our hippocampal gradients, we conducted a series of control analyses across varying levels of smoothing, and in contrast to connectopic maps derived through connectopic mapping on random data. These analyses are presented in the Supplementary Information, and confirmed high stability of resting-state gradients and their ability to capture inter-individual differences, whereas random data failed to produce meaningful gradients (Supplementary Figure 4).</p>

<title>Alignment of connectopic maps across participants</title>
<p>To ensure optimal alignment of identified connectopic maps across participants, we employed Procrustes alignment, based on voxel-wise correlations, to order subject-level connectopic maps according to their correspondence with a set of reference maps (i.e. gradients computed at group level across the full sample). Moreover, whereas the sign of connectopic maps is arbitrary, differences therein have an impact on the spatial model parameters describing the topographic characteristics of gradients, derived through TSM in a later step. As such, the sign of subject-level connectopic maps showing negative correlations with the corresponding group-level reference map were inversed.</p>

<title>Trend surface modelling</title>
<p>Using spatial statistics, the topography of a connectopic map can be represented by a small number of spatial model parameters. This parameterization enables analyses of inter-individual differences, and is achieved through trend surface modelling (TSM), implemented in a third step of the ConGrads analysis pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. In this step, the spatial pattern of each subject-level connectopic map is approximated by estimating a spatial statistical model. Model estimation involves fitting a set of polynomial basis functions along canonical axes of the connectopic map. In MNI space, this entails estimation along x, y, and z axes of the hippocampus. Thus, fitting a polynomial of degree 1 yields three TSM parameters (x, y, z), with any increase in model order corresponding to an increase in number of parameters (e.g. 6 parameters for the second model order: x, y, z, x<sup>2</sup>, y<sup>2</sup>, z<sup>2</sup>; 9 parameters for the third model order, etc.). Trend surface models are fitted with an increasing polynomial degree using Bayesian linear regression, which provides likelihood estimates that can be used for subsequent model selection. Here, model selection was based on three information sources: a) the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) across subjects for models estimated at orders 1-10; b) the % explained variance in connectopic maps by each model; and c) visual inspection of group-level gradients reconstructed from TSM parameters at different model orders. The purpose of using multiple information sources, as opposed to simply BIC, was to find a trade-off between high-quality reconstructions of gradients by TSM models, while keeping the number of model parameters sufficiently low for multivariate statistical analyses. A model order of 3 (=9 TSM parameters) was selected for G1, whereas a model order of 4 (=12 TSM parameters) was selected for G2 and G3 (Supplementary Figure 5). Each gradient’s set of TSM parameters were then used as either dependent or independent variables in multivariate GLMs investigating links between gradient topography and variables such as age, episodic memory performance, and D1DR distribution.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> work demonstrates the importance of considering overlapping modes of functional organization (i.e. gradients) in the hippocampus, showing associations between with aging, dopaminergic receptor distribution and episodic memory. The evidence supporting the conclusions is <bold>solid</bold>, although some clarifications about testing procedures and a discussion of the limitations of the dopaminergic receptor mapping techniques employed should be provided along with analysis code. The work will be of broad interest to basic and clinical neuroscientists.</p>

<p>The authors studied how hippocampal connectivity gradients across the lifespan, and how these relate to memory function and neurotransmitter distributions. They observed older age with less distinct transitions and observed an association between gradient de-differentiation and cognitive decline.</p>
<p>This is overall an innovative and interesting study to assess gradient alterations across the lifespan and its associations to cognition.</p>
<p>The paper is well-written, and the methods appear sound and thoughtful. There are several strengths, including the inclusion of two independent cohorts, the use of gradient mapping and alignment techniques, and an overall sound statistical and analysis framework. There are several areas for potential improvements in the paper, and these are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) The reported D1 associations appear a bit post-hoc in the current work and I was unclear why the authors specifically focussed on dopamine here, as other transmitter systems are similar present at the level of the hippocampus and implicated in aging.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors may be aware that multiple PET tracers are somewhat challenged in the mesiotemporal region. Is this the case for the D1 receptor as well? The hippocampus is a small and complex structure, and PET more of a low res technique so one would want to highlight and discuss the limitations of the correlations with PET maps here and/or evaluate whether the analysis adds necessary findings to the study.</p>
<p>From my (perhaps somewhat biased) perspective, it might be valuable to instead or in addition look at measures of hippocampal microstructure and how these relate to the functional aging effects. This could be done, if available, using data from the same subjects (eg based on quantitative MRI contrasts and/or structural MRI) and/or using contextualization findings as implemented in eg hippomaps.readthedocs.io</p>
<p>(2) Can the authors clarify why they did not replicate based on cohorts that are more widely used in the community and open access, such as CamCAN and/or HCP-Aging? It might connect their results with other studies if an attempt was made to also show that findings persist in either of these repositories.</p>
<p>(3) The authors applied TSM and related these parameters to topographic changes in the gradients. I was wondering whether and how such an approach controls for autocorrelation present in both the PET map and gradients. Could the authors clarify?</p>
<p>(4) The TSM approach quantifies the gradients in terms of x/y/z direction in a cartesian coordinate system. Wouldn't a shape intrinsic coordinate system in the hippocampus also be interesting, and perhaps even be more efficient to look at here (see eg DeKraker 2022 eLife or Paquola et al 2020 eLife)?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper derives the first three functional gradients in the left and right hippocampus across two datasets. These gradient maps are then compared to dopamine receptor maps obtained with PET, associated with age, and linked to memory. Results reveal links between dopamine maps and gradient 2, age with gradients 1 and 2, and memory performance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper investigates how hippocampal gradients relate to aging, memory, and dopamine receptors, which are interesting and important questions. A strength of the paper is that some of the findings were replicated in a separate sample.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The paper would benefit from added clarification on the number of models/comparisons for each test. Furthermore, it would be helpful to clarify whether or not multiple comparison correction was performed and - if so - what type or - if not - to provide a justification. The manuscript would furthermore benefit from code sharing and clarifying which results did/did not replicate.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors analyzed the complex functional organization of the hippocampus using two separate adult lifespan datasets. They investigated how individual variations in the detailed connectivity patterns within the hippocampus relate to behavioral and molecular traits. The findings confirm three overlapping hippocampal gradients and reveal that each is linked to established functional patterns in the cortex, the arrangement of dopamine receptors within the hippocampus, and differences in memory abilities among individuals. By employing multivariate data analysis techniques, they identified older adults who display a hippocampal gradient pattern resembling that of younger individuals and exhibit better memory performance compared to their age-matched peers. This underscores the behavioral importance of maintaining a specific functional organization within the hippocampus as people age.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The evidence supporting the conclusions is overall compelling, based on a unique dataset, rich set of carefully unpacked results, and an in-depth data analysis. Possible confounds are carefully considered and ruled out.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses. The transparency of the statistical analyses could be improved by explicitly (1) stating what tests and corrections (if any) were performed, and (2) justifying the elected statistical approaches. Further, some of the findings related to the DA markers are borderline statistically significant and therefore perhaps less compelling but they line up nicely with results obtained using experimental animals and I expect the small effect sizes to be largely related to the quality and specificity of the PET data rather than the derived functional connectivity gradients.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the eLife Editors and Reviewers for their positive assessment and constructive comments, and for the opportunity to revise our manuscript. We greatly appreciate the Reviewers’ recommendations and believe that they will further improve our manuscript.</p>
<p>In revising the manuscript, our primary focus will be enhancing the clarity surrounding testing procedures and addressing corrections for multiple comparisons. Additionally, we intend to offer more explicit information about the statistical tests employed, along with the details about the number of models/comparisons for each test. We will also include an extended discussion on potential limitations of the dopaminergic receptor mapping methods used, addressing the Reviewers’ comments relating to the quality of PET imaging with different dopaminergic tracers in mesiotemporal regions such as the hippocampus. While the code used for connectopic mapping is publicly available through the ConGrads toolbox, we will provide the additional code we have used for data processing and analysis, visualization of hippocampal gradients, and the cortical projections. The data used in the current study is not publicly available due to ethical considerations concerning data sharing, but can be shared upon reasonable request from the senior author. Additional plans include clarifying and discussing which findings were successfully replicated, and addressing Reviewers’ suggestions for using other openly available cohorts for replication, and implementing alternative coordinate systems to quantify connectivity change along gradients.</p>
