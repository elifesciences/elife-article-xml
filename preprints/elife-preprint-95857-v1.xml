<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In macroecology, a classic empirical observation has been positive relationships between local abundance and species’ range, known as the abundance-occupancy relationships (AORs). The existence of this empirical relationship has informed both theory development and applied questions. Notably, the spatial neutral model of biodiversity predicts AORs. Yet, based on the largest known meta-analysis of 16,562,995 correlations from ~3 billion bird observations, this relationship was indistinguishable from zero. Further, in a phylogenetic comparative analysis, species range had no predictive power over the global mean abundance of 7,464 bird species. We suggest that publication and confirmation biases may have created AORs, an illusion of a ‘universal’ pattern. This nullification highlights the need for ecologists to instigate a credibility revolution like psychology, where many classic phenomena have been nullified.</p>

<p>A positive interspecific relationship between abundance and distribution —abundance-occupancy relationships (AORs) — is considered one of the most general and robust patterns in ecology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Sometimes referred to as a macroecological law <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, the AOR asserts that empirically locally abundant species tend to be widely distributed, and conversely, locally rare species tend to be geographically restricted in their range. The mechanism driving this relationship was never proven, and it remains unresolved why species distribution should affect per-unit-area abundance (or <italic>vice versa</italic>). Nonetheless, the existence of a pervasive AOR has underpinned many practical applications in ecology and conservation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, for example, setting harvest rates for fisheries <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, managing invasive species by restricting expansion rather than local elimination, and identifying species at high risk of extinction in biodiversity inventories such as the IUCN Red List Criteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Given the increasing human-induced land-use changes in the Anthropocene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, concomitantly with increasing debate about global biodiversity change [cf. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>], fully understanding the relationship between abundance and range size is of increasing importance.</p>
<p>Many plausible biological mechanisms have been proposed for AORs, yet none of them has unequivocal support <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Among all mechanisms, it is noteworthy that a spatially explicit neutral model of biodiversity and biogeography can generate AORs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Specifically, this macroecological ‘null’ model can produce a positive correlation between species range (or occupancy) and their per-unit-area local as well as total global abundance. This observation, in turn, supports the utility of neutral theory as a null model of community and macroecology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Although neutral theory may provide a biological null model, an additional null hypothesis is that AOR does not exist. Indeed, sampling bias can create AORs because locally rare species are more likely to be missed, resulting in an underestimation of range size or occupancy, thereby generating a positive relationship <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Yet, this sampling explanation has long been discarded as a plausible mechanism leading to observed patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. This is because of substantial empirical evidence for positive interspecific relationships, including a meta-analysis of 279 effect sizes with an overall effect of <italic>r</italic> = 0.58 (or its Fisher’s transformation: <italic>Zr</italic> = 0.66) in 2006 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. It does not seem that sampling bias alone could explain this remarkably strong relationship.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a large amount of variation does exist in empirical patterns of AORs, including strikingly negative relationships <sup>12,18-20</sup>. Some of the observed heterogeneity is likely to be due to different aspects of sampling, such as the number of species and spatial and temporal coverage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Also, other types of bias could generate artefactual AORs: namely ‘confirmation bias’, where sampling is prejudiced to support one’s hypothesis and ‘publication bias’, where statistically significant relationships are preferentially reported and published. Although both biases are widespread, including in ecological studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, no studies so far systematically considered or quantified both biases in the context of AORs [cf. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>]. Furthermore, there has, until recently, been a lack of large and methodologically consistent data resources, therefore leaving a traditional meta-analytic approach as the best available option for testing the validity and generality of the AOR.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>A citizen-science dataset to test AORs</title>
<p>Here, we use data from eBird — a global citizen science dataset aimed at counting birds — to quantify the relationship between abundance and occupancy (AOR). Large citizen science datasets collected for non-hypothesis-driven purposes are not random samples [see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>], but they have the advantage of avoiding biases such as confirmation and publication bias. Also, using the eBird dataset allows us to estimate heterogeneity due to sampling intensity (e.g., the duration of a sampling event directly influences the number of species recorded). Specifically, we can quantify how AOR will change in relation to increases in species richness and sampling duration, both of which are predicted to reduce the magnitude of AORs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For occupancy, we use global range size not only because global range size should be relatively stable — ‘local’ range sizes for one species could vary dramatically — but also because different types of occupancy measures were deemed to contribute less to the observation heterogeneity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Fortunately, for birds, a large database of global range sizes has already been compiled <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. For abundance, we use two different measurements: local species counts and local mean density, as follows. First, we carry out the largest known meta-analysis by synthesizing correlations between global range sizes of 7,635 species and local species counts collected across 16,562,995 eBird checklists (resulting in 16,562,995 <italic>Zr</italic> values and corresponding sampling variances; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). These checklists all included counts of each species present and the duration of observation (hereafter, effort time).</p>

<label>Figure 1</label>
<caption><title>A conceptual overview of our methods.</title>
<p>We aggregated individual eBird checklists across the world (shown on the map), represented by the three colored insets which show the relationship between global range size (x-axis) and local abundance (y-axis) and the associated correlation value. We then aggregated these checklist level measures for 16,562,995 eBird checklists into the largest-ever meta-analysis to find the global level relationship between global range size and local abundance.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Second, we conduct a phylogenetically controlled comparative analysis, regressing species range sizes on 7,464 estimates of globally derived species’ mean density, equivalent to mean local density (per 5-degree grid cell), estimated in earlier work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (see Methods for more details). Given the different potential biases mentioned before, we expected a more modest relationship in relation to that of the previous meta-analysis (<italic>r</italic> = 0.58; note that this relationship included many different taxa; if restricted to bird species, it was even stronger <italic>r</italic> = 0.74 or <italic>Zr</italic> = 0.95) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Also, although no such empirical evidence appears to exist, it seems feasible that in filling in an eBird checklist, some people may undercount common and widespread species while they may overcount rare and geographically restricted species. If this is the case, the relationship (AORs) could be further weakened. Yet, if such overcounting and undercounting were present, we expect it would introduce large heterogeneity into our dataset because that type of behaviour would not be consistent across all contributors, and they would sometimes result in negative AORs, increasing variability among the 16,562,995 <italic>Zr</italic> values.</p>

<title>Overwhelming support against AOR</title>
<p>Surprisingly, the overall (aggregated) relationship between local abundance and global occupancy was near-zero (<italic>r</italic> = 0.015), although this relationship was statistically significant due to our extremely large sample size (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0005, <italic>z</italic> = 2.805, <italic>Zr</italic> = <italic>b</italic><sub>[overall mean]</sub> = 0.015, 95% confidence interval, CI = [0.004, 0.025]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>). However, this significant relationship disappeared (<italic>r</italic> = 0.0009) once we controlled for species number and effort time (<italic>p</italic> = 0.863, <italic>z</italic> = 0.173, <italic>Zr</italic> = <italic>b</italic><sub>[overall mean]</sub> = 0.0009, 95% CI = [-0.0092, 0.0111]); both variables were statistically significant predictors of the effect. As expected, the increase in species number (modelled as the inverse of species number - 3, which is equivalent to sampling error for <italic>Zr</italic>) and effort time on the natural log scale, decreased the strength of the relationship (sampling variance: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>z</italic> = 140.29; <italic>b</italic><sub>[sampling variance]</sub> = 0.0147, 95% CI = [-0.0149, -0.0145]); ln(effort time): <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>z</italic> = -183.45, <italic>b</italic><sub>[ln(effort time)]</sub> = 0.230, 95% CI = [0.226, 0.233]; marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 5.1% for the model with these two predictors; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS2">Table S2</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS4">4</xref>). These observations are consistent with the explanation that sampling protocols can create positive artifactual relationships between range and abundance.</p>

</fig>
<p>Even more remarkably, our meta-analysis suggested that the AOR is likely indistinguishable from zero even with a larger dataset because the observed heterogeneity among effect sizes was very small (i.e., most effect sizes were effectively zero after accounting for sample size). A measure of relative heterogeneity <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>[total]</sub> was 13.5%, meaning that 86.5% of all the observed variation (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) is due to sampling error, therefore, is neither biological nor ecological (country level; <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 5.5%, σ<sup>2</sup> = 0.005; state level: <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 6.3%, σ<sup>2</sup> = 0.005; effect-size level; <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1.5%, σ<sup>2</sup> = 0.001); in contrast, the average <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>[total]</sub> across 86 ecological meta-analyses was approximately 92% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, making our observed heterogeneity unusually low. Low relative heterogeneity, however, does not necessarily mean absolute heterogeneity is also low <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We found the absolute heterogeneity, σ<sup>2</sup><sub>[total]</sub> = 0.011, approximately one-thirtieth of the heterogeneity (σ<sup>2</sup><sub>[total]</sub> = 0.323) found in the previous meta-analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Also, this is around one-tenth of the average heterogeneity (σ<sup>2</sup><sub>[total]</sub> = 0.125; median = 0.105), found in 31 meta-analyses in ecology and evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Overall, low relative and absolute heterogeneities indicate that our dataset of 16,562,995 effect sizes does not have much variability left to be explained despite our observations coming from many different locations across the globe and contributed by tens of thousands of individual birdwatchers. Importantly, we emphasize that this combination of zero effect and very small heterogeneity is only expected when a particular phenomenon is not real.</p>
<p>Moreover, our phylogenetic comparative analysis, which accounted for phylogenetic uncertainty <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, corroborated our meta-analytic results [cf. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>]. The global range sizes had little predictive power on mean species density (both on log10; <italic>p</italic> = 0.808, <italic>t</italic><sub>99.6</sub> = 0.0227, <italic>b</italic><sub>[slope]</sub> = 0.0928, 95% CI = [-0.1615, 0.2068]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS5">Table S5</xref>). Taken together, our results provide overwhelming evidence against the fundamental relationship between species range and local abundance, while the results are consistent with this relationship as a sampling artifact. Nevertheless, our results are also consistent with previously published empirical evidence. This is because we have shown that relationships between global species ranges and local counts can be null, strongly negative, or strongly positive, which can be generated primarily by sampling (error) variance (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Lawless macroecology and non-neutral theory: implications</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate clearly that the AOR is not observed in a very large global dataset, with both applied and theoretical ramifications. First, we must reconsider fishing quotas, conservation priorities, and invasive species control strategies based on AORs [cf. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>]. Second, it is probably futile to pursue all ecological or biological mechanisms proposed for AORs [see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>]. We cannot exclude, however, the possibility of AORs occasionally emerging in some restricted areas because there was a small unexplained variance in the meta-analytic dataset. Most notably, our near-zero results with small heterogeneity suggest that contrary to earlier suggestions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, the spatial neutral model is not a suitable null model of macroecology. Within the neutral theoretical framework, AORs can be broken by local adaptation (an alternative hypothesis) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. If local adaptation were to disrupt a predicted positive relationship (AOR), we would have observed substantial heterogeneity and a reduced relationship, not a near-zero relationship. This is because it is extremely unlikely that local adaptation and neutral processes are in a perfect balance, resulting in an exact-zero relationship with little heterogeneity. In other words, local adaptions are expected to create local specificities and global variability/heterogeneity; our meta-analysis did not find such variability.</p>
<p>We point out that any model of a positive AOR posits a mechanism that connects species range and local abundance, whereas Rabinowitz effectively decoupled these two variables <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Our results are consistent with this decoupling. By adding habit specificity to species range and abundance, she suggests seven forms of rarity, which could reflect different underlying macroecological mechanisms; for example, two forms of rarity are geographically restricted but locally abundant with narrow or broad habitat types. Unlike the world created by the spatial neutral model, our results support many such ‘rare’ species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In this regard, it is no longer surprising that AORs do not exist. Therefore, we believe Rabinowitz’s framework, rather than the AOR, has more empirical support from global-scale patterns of species abundance and provides a useful conceptual structure for future theoretical and applied work, although this line of work is still limited.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5">
<title>A credibility revolution in ecology beyond biases and crises</title>
<p>Whilst we provided an explanation for the non-existence of AOR, it still feels hard to comprehend the extent of overestimation in the previous meta-analysis (<italic>r</italic> = 0.58 for all taxa; <italic>r</italic> = 0.74 for birds) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. We have shown that some bias may be due to sampling bias. However, we speculate that much of the overestimation originates from publication bias and confirmation bias, which is supported by mounting evidence from meta-research studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Although we do not have direct evidence, our eBird datasets are free from these two types of biases (i.e., birdwatchers generally do not think of the macroecological patterns that would later be tested with the data they submit), while the literature-based meta-analyses are not. Regarding publication bias, the original meta-analysis of AOR states, “the fail-safe number indicates that more than half a million unpublished null results would be required to nullify an effect of this magnitude” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Indeed, we provided much more than a half million null effects to reach our null conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), although we should note that large datasets like eBird have other biases than publication or confirmation biases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. For example, it is possible that by excluding checklists with a single ‘X’ (see Methods), we are preferentially removing abundant species as birdwatchers may report ‘X’ for more common species with high abundances.</p>
<p>A recent study reexamining 86 ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses demonstrated a 23% reduction in overall effects due to publication bias, turning 33 of 50 statistically significant meta-analytic conclusions (66%) into non-significant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Similarly, a study examining 83 topics in life sciences showed that the effect size of non-blind studies, which are at risk of confirmation bias, was twice as large as blinded counterparts protected against confirmation bias <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> [see also <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>].</p>
<p>We finish with an intriguing parallel topic to AORs in psychology, where the current replication crisis started <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. There have been over 100 studies, and many theoretical models support the hypothesis of ‘ego depletion’ where self-control is a finite resource, so self-control will decrease once it is exerted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The first meta-analysis of ego depletion, like AOR, suggested a very strong support for it (standardized mean difference, or <italic>d</italic> = 0.62). Yet a subsequent multi-lab replication found that ego-depletion does not exist is so weak as to be negligible (<italic>d</italic> = 0.04) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Indeed, a series of multi-lab replications has indicated that several psychological phenomena, which were once believed to be real beyond a reasonable doubt, are too weak to be useful or are nonexistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In ecology, recently collated large datasets collected for non-hypothesis-driven purposes offer a unique opportunity to revisit and retest longstanding ideas.</p>
<p>Taken together, we call for reexamining all ecological laws, rules, and patterns, as very few topics are free from sampling, confirmation, and publication biases [cf. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>]. To counter such biases, we urgently require a ‘credibility revolution’, a more optimistic name for a replication crisis, turning this crisis into an opportunity to improve science. A credibility revolution in ecology, like in psychology, needs to embrace non-traditional to avoid confirmation and publication bias, such as pre-registration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, registered reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, prospective and living meta-analyses, open synthesis communities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and big-team-science collaborations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> involving community (citizen) scientists <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Quantifying abundance-occupancy relationship at the local-scale</title>
<p>We used the eBird dataset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> to assess the relationship between local-scale abundance and occupancy (i.e., global range size). eBird, launched in 2002 by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, is a global citizen science project which enlists volunteer birdwatchers to submit ‘checklists’ of birds seen and/or heard while birdwatching. Data undergo a semi-automated filtering process before being entered into the dataset, and expert reviewers additionally review species (or counts of species) that surpass pre-set filters before being accepted into the dataset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Importantly, birdwatchers must indicate whether they are submitting a ‘complete’ checklist representing all birds that an individual birdwatcher was able to identify during their birdwatching outing. Further, birdwatchers can either submit the count of a species during their birding, or they can submit an ‘X’ to signify that a species was present but not estimate the number of individuals present during their birdwatching outing.</p>
<p>We downloaded the eBird basic dataset (version ebd_rel-May2020) and considered all eBird checklists between January 1st, 2005 and May 31st 2020. We then performed some quality assurance, applying an additional set of filters to the data, potentially removing any ‘outliers’ that could produce undue leverage on our results. The following filtering was completed [<italic>sensu</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>]. We only included: (1) complete checklists; (2) checklists that were &lt;240 minutes and &gt;5 minutes; (3) checklists that travelled &lt; 5km; and (4) checklists that travelled &lt; 500 ha. Because birdwatchers will sometimes use an ‘X’ to signify presence, and this is most likely to happen for more abundant species, we excluded any checklist which had at least any “X” on it, as this could potentially influence the correlation between the abundance of a species and range size by disproportionately removing the most abundant species from the correlation. We further only considered checklists that had at least ten species recorded on them, and a correlation test was performed only if we had range size data (see below) for a minimum of 4 species on the checklist.</p>
<p>We used range size maps from BirdLife International <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. When an eBird checklist met the aforementioned criteria, we performed a correlation test using Pearson’s correlation coefficient from the <italic>cor.test</italic> function in <italic>R</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Both the counts of every species and the range size were log-transformed before estimating a correlation (for a workflow, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). We obtained 16,562,995 correlations based on 3,005,668,285 individual bird observations, including 7,635 species. We note that we conducted all computational and statistical work using <italic>R</italic> and we created plots using the R package, <italic>ggplot2</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, patchwork <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> and their dependencies.</p>

<title>Meta-analysis of Big Data</title>
<p>We transformed correlations between species abundance and range into Fisher’s <italic>Z</italic> o <italic>Zr</italic> to unbound and calculated sampling variance for each <italic>Zr</italic> value; note that the inverse of the sampling variance of <italic>Zr</italic> is <italic>N</italic> (the number of species) – 3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). We used the <italic>R</italic> package, <italic>asreml</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> to run a multilevel random-effects model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>; note the <italic>asreml</italic> is a commercial package, so it is not free. Our large meta-analyses with ~17 million effect sizes were only able to run with <italic>asreml</italic> given the computational time required for such a large dataset. We had ‘country’ (245 levels) and state code (2,871 levels) as random factors in the model to control for non-independence. In addition, to quantify the variance component for these two clustering factors and also at the level of effect sizes (16,562,995 levels), we modelled ‘units’ (the effect size level random effect or residuals) in the <italic>asreml</italic> function with ‘the number of species - 3’ as the ‘weights’ argument and <italic>asr_gaussian(dispersion = 1)</italic> as the ‘family’ argument. We also obtained the multilevel versions of <italic>I</italic><sup>2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> to obtain relative heterogeneity for our meta-analytic model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To gauge the impacts of potential biases, we fitted two moderators: 1) the z-transformed version of ln(checklist duration) as a surrogate for the amount of effort for observation and 2) sampling variance, which is usually used to detect publication bias, more specifically, small study bias where effect sizes from small studies can create ‘funnel asymmetry’, creating bias in meta-analytic overall mean <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). We ran two uni-moderator models and one multi-moderator model with both moderators (three meta-regression models in total; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS2">Table S2</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS4">4</xref>).

<title>Quantifying the abundance-occupancy relationship at the macro-scale</title>
<p>To corroborate our local-level analysis described above, we quantified an additional macro-scale analysis of the relationship between abundance (i.e., density) and occupancy (global range size). For this, we used data from a recently published analysis of global abundances for birds within 5-degree grid cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. This dataset was derived by integrating expert-derived abundance measures with a large, less structured global citizen science dataset using a multiple-imputation technique to estimate density within 5-degree grids for 9,700 bird species (575 girds). We used these predicted density estimates from each grid cell and, for each species, took the mean of all density estimates in the grid cells for which a species was found. This mean density was then our measure of macro-scale abundance. For our measure of occupancy, we used a summation of all range sizes for the grids a species was found in, calculated by using range maps from BirdLife International focusing on the entire extent of a species’ extant range, ignoring the effect of transient species. Our analysis incorporated a total of 7,464 species of bird species, corresponding to the species for which we had both range maps and estimated density, along with phylogenetic information included in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s6-4">
<title>Phylogenetic comparative analysis</title>
<p>To statistically test whether there was an effect of abundance and occupancy at the macro-scale, we used phylogenetic comparative analysis. We used avian phylogeny from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> and analysed 100 phylogenetic trees using the R function <italic>phylolm</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Resulting estimates from the 100 models were merged using Rubin’s rules, as described in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, to obtain current estimates and errors that accounted for phylogenetic uncertainty (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS5">Table S5</xref>); we implemented this procedure using the R function <italic>miInference</italic> from the <italic>norm2</italic> package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This article presents a meta-analysis that challenges established abundance-occupancy relationships (AORs) by utilizing the largest known bird observation database. The analysis yields contentious outcomes, raising the question of whether these findings could potentially refute AORs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study employed an extensive aggregation of datasets to date to scrutinize the abundance-occupancy relationships (AORs).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the dataset employed in this research holds promise, a rigorous justification of the core assumptions underpinning the analytical framework is inadequate. The authors should thoroughly address the correlation between checklist data and global range data, ensuring that the foundational assumptions and potential confounding factors are explicitly examined and articulated within the study's context.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The goal is to ask if common species when studied across their range tend to have larger ranges in total. To do this the authors examined a very large citizen science database which gives estimates of numbers, and correlated that with the total range size, available from Birdlife. The average correlation is positive but close to zero, and the distribution around zero is also narrow, leading to the conclusion that, even if applicable in some cases, there is no evidence for consistent trends in one or other direction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study raises a dormant question, with a large dataset.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study combines information from across the whole world, with many different habitats, taxa, and observations, which surely leads to a quite heterogeneous collection.</p>
<p>First, scale. Many of the earlier analyses were within smaller areas, and for example, ranges are not obviously bounded by a physical barrier. I assume this study is only looking at breeding ranges; that should be stated, as 40% of all bird species migrate, and winter limitation of populations is important. Also are abundances only breeding abundances or are they measured through the year? Are alien distributions removed?</p>
<p>Second, consider various reasons why abundance and range size may be correlated (sometimes positively and sometimes negatively) at large scales. Combining studies across such a large diversity of ecological situations seems to create many possibilities to miss interesting patterns. For example:</p>
<p>(1) Islands are small and often show density release.</p>
<p>(2) North temperate regions have large ranges (Rapoport's rule) and higher population sizes than the tropics.</p>
<p>(3) Body size correlates with global range size (I am unsure if this has recently been tested but is present in older papers) and with density. For example, cosmopolitan species (barn owl, osprey, peregrine) are relatively large and relatively rare.</p>
<p>(4) In the consideration of alien species, it certainly looks to me as if the law is followed, with pigeon, starling, and sparrow both common and widely distributed. I guess one needs to make some sort of statement about anthropogenic influences, given the dramatic changes in both populations and environments over the past 50 years.</p>
<p>(5) Wing shape correlates with ecological niche and range size (e.g. White, American Naturalist). Aerial foraging species with pointed wings are likely to be easily detected, and several have large ranges reflecting dispersal (e.g. barn swallow).</p>
<p>Third, biases. I am not conversant with ebird methodology, but the number appearing on checklists seems a very poor estimate of local abundance. As noted in the paper, common species may be underestimated in their abundance. Flocking species must generate large numbers, skulking species few. The survey is often likely to be in areas favorable to some species and not others. The alternative approach in the paper comes from an earlier study, based on ebird but then creating densities within grids and surely comes with similar issues.</p>
<p>
Biases are present in range as well. Notably, tropical mountain-occupying species have range sizes over-estimated because holes in the range are not generally accounted for (Ocampo-Peñuela et al Nature communications). These species are often quite rare too.</p>
<p>Fourth, random error. Random error in ebird assessments is likely to be large, with differences among observers, seasons, days, and weather (e.g. Callaghan et al. 2021, PNAS). Range sizes also come with many errors, which is why occupancy is usually seen as the more appropriate measure.</p>
<p>If we consider both range and abundance measurements to be subject to random error in any one species list, then the removal of all these errors will surely increase the correlation for that list (the covariance shouldn't change but the variances will decrease). I think (but am not sure) that this will affect the mean correlation because more of the positive correlations appear 'real' given the overall mean is positive. It will definitely affect the variance of the correlations; the low variance is one of the main points in the paper. A high variance would point to the operation of multiple mechanisms, some perhaps producing negative correlations (Blackburn et al. 2006).</p>
<p>On P.80 it is stated: &quot;Specifically, we can quantify how AOR will change in relation to increases in species richness and sampling duration, both of which are predicted to reduce the magnitude of AORs&quot; I haven't checked the references that make this statement, but intuitively the opposite is expected? More species and longer durations should both increase the accuracy of the estimate, so removing them introduces more error? Perhaps dividing by an uncertain estimate introduces more error anyway. At any rate, the authors should explain the quoted statement in this paper.</p>
<p>It would be of considerable interest to look at the extreme negative and extreme positive correlations: do they make any biological sense?</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>I can see how publication bias can affect meta-analyses (addressed in the Gaston et al. 2006 paper) but less easily see how confirmation bias can. It seems to me that some of the points made above must explain the difference between this study and Blackburn et al. 2006's strong result.</p>
<p>Certainly, AOR really does seem to be present in at least some cases (e.g. British breeding birds) and a discussion of individual cases would be valuable. Previous studies have also noted that there are at least some negative and some non-significant associations, and understanding the underlying causes is of great interest (e.g. Kotiaho et al. Biology Letters).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper claims to overturn the longstanding abundance occupancy relationship.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The above would be important if true.</p>
<p>
(2) The dataset is large.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors are not really measuring the abundance-occupancy relationship (AOR). They are measuring abundance-range size. The AOR typically measures patches in a metapopulation, i.e. at a local scale. Range size is not an interchangeable notion with local occupancy.</p>
<p>(2) Ebird is a poor dataset for this. The sampling unit is non-standard. So abundance can at best be estimated by controlling for sampling effort. Comparisons across space are also likely to be highly heterogenous. They also threw out checklists in which abundances were too high to be estimated (reported as &quot;X&quot;). As evidence of the biases in using eBird for this pattern, the North American Breeding Bird Survey, a very similar taxonomic and geographic scope but with a consistent sampling protocol across space does show clear support for the AOR.</p>
<p>(3) In general, I wonder if a pattern demonstrated in thousands of data sets can be overturned by findings in one data set. It may be a big dataset but any biases in the dataset are repeated across all of those observations.</p>
<p>Overturning a major conclusion requires careful work. This paper did not rise to this level.</p>
