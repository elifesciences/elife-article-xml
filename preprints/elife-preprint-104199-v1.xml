<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 <italic>(</italic>Ct<italic>),</italic> an obligate intracellular bacterium that does not encode FtsZ, divides by a polarized budding process. In the absence of FtsZ, we show that divisome assembly in <italic>Ct</italic> is initiated by FtsK, a chromosomal translocase. Chlamydial FtsK forms discrete foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, and our data indicate that FtsK foci at the base of the mother cell mark the location of nascent divisome complexes that form at the site where a daughter cell will emerge in the next round of division. The divisome in <italic>Ct</italic> has a hybrid composition, containing elements of the divisome and elongasome from other bacteria, and FtsK is recruited to nascent divisomes prior to the other chlamydial divisome proteins assayed, including the PBP2 and PBP3 transpeptidases, and MreB and MreC. Knocking down FtsK prevents divisome assembly in <italic>Ct</italic> and inhibits cell division and septal peptidoglycan synthesis. We further show that MreB does not function like FtsZ and serve as a scaffold for the assembly of the <italic>Ct</italic> divisome. Rather, MreB is one of the last proteins recruited to the chlamydial divisome, and it is necessary for the formation of septal peptidoglycan rings. Our studies illustrate the critical function of chlamydial FtsK in coordinating divisome assembly and peptidoglycan synthesis in this obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most bacteria divide by a highly conserved process termed binary fission, which occurs through the symmetric division of the parental cell into two daughter cells (Harpring 2023). However, <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 (<italic>Ct</italic>), a coccoid, gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium divides by a polarized cell division process characterized by an asymmetric expansion of the membrane from one pole of a coccoid cell resulting in the formation of a nascent daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelrahman 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ouellette SP 2022</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Ct</italic> undergoes a biphasic developmental cycle during infection. Non-replicating and infectious elementary bodies (EBs) bind to and are internalized by target cells. Following internalization, EBs within a membrane vacuole, termed the inclusion, differentiate into replicating reticulate bodies (RBs). After replication, RBs undergo secondary differentiation into EBs, which are released from cells to initiate another round of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abdelrahman 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In evolving to obligate intracellular dependence, <italic>Ct</italic> has eliminated several gene products essential for cell division in other bacteria, including the central coordinator of divisome formation, FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Stephens 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ouellette SP 2020</xref>). This tubulin-like protein forms filaments that associate to form a ring at the division plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barrows 2021</xref>), which serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the other components of the bacterial divisome that regulate the processes of septal peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis and chromosomal translocation. Of the twelve divisome proteins shown to be essential for cell division in the model gammaproteobacterial organism, <italic>E. coli, Ct</italic> encodes homologues of FtsK, a chromosomal translocase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>); FtsQLB, regulators of septal PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ouellette SP 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Kaur 2022</xref>), FtsW, a septal transglycosylase (Putman T 2019), and penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3/FtsI), a septal transpeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the divisome, rod-shaped bacteria employ another multiprotein complex, the elongasome, which directs sidewall PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Liu 2020</xref>) necessary for cell lengthening and the maintenance of cell shape prior to division. Although <italic>Ct</italic> is a coccoid organism, it encodes several elongasome proteins, including MreB, MreC, RodA, RodZ, and penicillin binding protein 2 (PBP2), a sidewall transpeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ouellette SP 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cox 2020</xref>). The actin-like protein MreB is essential for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelrahman 2016</xref>) and forms septal rings in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kemege 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Liechti 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Lee 2020</xref>). These observations led to the proposal that MreB replaces FtsZ in <italic>Ct</italic> and serves as a scaffold necessary for the assembly of the chlamydial divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Lee 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>While inhibitor studies suggest that chlamydial cell division is dependent upon elements of the divisome and elongasome from other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelrahman 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cox 2020</xref>), the composition and ordered assembly of the chlamydial divisome and its distribution during polarized budding are undefined. We hypothesized that FtsK, a chromosomal translocase, serves a critical function in regulating the division process of <italic>Ct,</italic> given previous observations demonstrating it interacts with elements of both the elongasome and divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>). We show here that FtsK initiates the assembly of a hybrid divisome complex in <italic>Ct</italic> and that MreB does not serve as a scaffold necessary for the assembly of the chlamydial divisome. Rather, chlamydial MreB associates with this hybrid divisome complex late in the chlamydial divisome assembly process, and MreB filament formation is necessary for the formation of septal PG rings. Therefore, our data identify FtsK as the initiator of the cell division process of <italic>Ct</italic>.</p>

<title>FtsK Forms Foci in <italic>Ct</italic> that Mark the Location of Divisome Complexes</title>
<p>In the <italic>E. coli</italic> linear divisome assembly pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Du 2017</xref>), FtsK is the first protein downstream of FtsZ encoded by <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In other organisms, FtsK is uniformly distributed at the septum of dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Yu 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wang 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Veiga 2017</xref>). To investigate the localization of FtsK during cell division in <italic>Ct</italic>, HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic>. To overcome the challenges associated with assessing cell morphologies in densely packed inclusions in infected cells, we analyzed FtsK localization in <italic>Ct</italic> derived from lysates of infected HeLa cells at 21 hrs post-infection (hpi) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ouellette SP 2022</xref>). <italic>Ct</italic> were stained with an antibody against the chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP) and an antibody that recognizes endogenous FtsK. Blotting analysis revealed that this FtsK antibody recognizes a single protein with the predicted molecular mass of FtsK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. S1A</xref>). Our results showed that, unlike FtsK in other organisms, chlamydial FtsK accumulates in discrete foci in the membrane of coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In cell division intermediates, FtsK localized in foci at the septum, foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, or foci at the base of the progenitor mother cell only (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The chlamydial FtsK foci observed during cell division were not uniformly distributed at the septum, rather septal foci of FtsK were restricted to one side of the MOMP-stained septum. In addition, the FtsK foci were often above or below (marked with arrowheads in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) the MOMP-stained septum. Similar analyses were performed using <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with the pBOMB4-Tet (-GFP) plasmid encoding FtsK with a C-terminal mCherry tag. The expression of this mCherry fusion is under the control of an anhydrotetracycline (aTc)-inducible promoter. HeLa cells were infected with the transformant, and the expression of the fusion was induced by the addition of 10nM aTc to the media of infected cells at 19hpi. RBs were harvested from the induced cells at 21hpi and stained with MOMP antibodies. Imaging analyses revealed that like endogenous FtsK, FtsK-mCherry accumulated in foci in coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), and in division intermediates, it localized in foci at the septum, foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, or foci at the base of the progenitor mother cell only (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The foci of FtsK-mCherry, like endogenous FtsK, were often offset relative to the plane defined by MOMP staining at the septum (arrowhead in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Inclusion forming unit (IFU) assays demonstrated that overexpression of the FtsK-mCherry fusion had no effect on chlamydial developmental cycle progression and the production of infectious EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. S2A</xref>). While it is possible that the population of FtsK at the base of the mother cell is a remnant of FtsK from a previous division, ∼20% of dividing cells have a secondary bud (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), and FtsK and FtsK-mCherry accumulate in foci at the base of secondary buds (arrowheads in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), suggesting that the population of FtsK at the base of the mother cell corresponds to a nascent divisome complex that forms at the site where the daughter cell will arise in the next round of division.</p>

<p>To investigate the distribution of other putative chlamydial divisome components during budding, we transformed <italic>Ct</italic> with plasmids encoding PBP2, PBP3, or MreC with an N-terminal mCherry tag. IFU assays demonstrated that the aTc induced overexpression of the PBP2, PBP3, and MreC fusions had no effect on the developmental cycle progression of <italic>C</italic>t (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. S2A</xref>). In addition, blotting analyses revealed that mCherry antibodies primarily detected single species with the predicted molecular mass of the FtsK, PBP2, PBP3, and MreC fusions in lysates prepared from induced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. S1B</xref>). The PBP2, PBP3, and MreC fusions were induced by the addition of 10nM aTc to infected cells at 19hpi, and the induced cells were harvested at 21hpi and stained with MOMP antibodies. Imaging analyses revealed that the PBP2, PBP3, and MreC fusions accumulated in foci in coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), and in cell division intermediates, the fusions accumulated in foci at the septum, in foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, or in foci only at the base of the progenitor mother cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similar analyses with an MreB_6xHis fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Lee 2020</xref>) revealed that MreB exhibited a similar localization profile (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A and B</xref>). Each of these fusions, like FtsK, were restricted to one side and were often slightly above or slightly below (marked with arrowheads in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) the MOMP-stained septum in dividing cells. The foci of the fusions were also detected at the base of secondary buds (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2B</xref>). Quantification of the localization profiles of endogenous FtsK and the various fusion proteins revealed that the distribution profile of FtsK-mCherry accurately reflected the distribution of endogenous FtsK (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, a greater percentage of FtsK was associated with the base of dividing cells (including cells with septum and base, and cells with base alone) suggesting that FtsK associates with nascent divisomes at the base of dividing cells prior to the other putative divisome proteins. Finally, this analysis suggested that MreB associated with nascent divisomes at the base of dividing cells after mCherry-PBP2 and mCherry-PBP3 (marked with # in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The localization profiles of the chlamydial divisome proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) likely reflect the assembly of divisome complexes at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, and the disassembly of the septal divisome when divisome proteins are only present at the base of the mother cell.</p>

<caption><p>HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with PBP2, PBP3, or MreC with an N-terminal mCherry tag, or with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with an MreB_6xHis fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Lee 2020</xref>). Each of the fusions was induced by adding 10nM aTc to the media at 17hpi. Lysates were prepared at 21hpi and the cells were fixed and stained with a MOMP antibody. The distribution of the mCherry fluorescence in (A) coccoid cells and in (B) dividing cells that had not initiated secondary bud formation is shown. The MreB_6x His fusion was stained with rabbit anti-6x his antibody (red) and MOMP antibodies (green). Dividing cells with foci at the septum, foci at the septum and foci at the base of the mother cell, or foci at the base alone are shown for each of the fusions. Arrowheads in B denote foci of the divisome proteins above or below the plane of the MOMP-stained septum. (C) HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> L2 or with <italic>Ct</italic> that inducibly express FtsK-mCherry, mCherry-PBP2, mCherry-PBP3, mCherry-MreC, or MreB_6xHis. The cells were fixed at 21hpi and the distribution of endogenous FtsK, or the mCherry fluorescence in cells inducibly expressing the mCherry fusions, or the distribution of MreB in cells where the MreB_6xHis fusion was inducibly expressed were compared to the distribution of MOMP. The localization profiles were quantified in 100 cells. Three independent replicates were performed, and the values shown are the average of the 3 replicates. Chi-squared analysis revealed that the localization profiles of endogenous FtsK and FtsK-mCherry are not statistically different from each other, but they are statistically different than the PBP2, PBP3, MreC and MreB localization profiles (* – p&lt;0.009). The localization profile of the MreB fusion is also statistically different than the localization profiles of the mCherry fusions of PBP2 and PBP3 (#-p = 0.05). (D) Hela cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with PBP2, PBP3, or MreC with a N-terminal mCherry tag, or with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with an MreB_6xHis fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Lee 2020</xref>). The fusions were induced by adding 10 nM aTc to the media at 17hpi. The cells were harvested at 21hpi and <italic>Ct</italic> were harvested and stained with FtsK and MOMP antibodies. The cells expressing the MreB fusion were stained with FtsK, MOMP, and 6xHis antibodies. Imaging analyses revealed that FtsK was present in foci at the septum and in foci at the base in these cells, while each of the fusions was only detected at the septum where they overlapped the distribution of septal FtsK (Bars are1μM).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="620021v1_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Since it was possible that the localization profiles of the mCherry-PBP2 and mCherry-PBP3 fusions were at least in part due to their induced over-expression, we performed similar studies with rabbit antibodies generated against peptides derived from PBP2 or PBP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>). Blotting analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. S1C</xref>) with these antibodies revealed that they recognized mCherry-PBP2 and mCherry-PBP3 in <italic>Ct</italic> lysates, and immunofluorescent staining with the PBP2 and PBP3-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. S1D</xref>) completely overlapped the mCherry fluorescence in cells when the mCherry PBP2 and PBP3 fusions were inducibly expressed in <italic>Ct</italic>. Imaging analyses with the antibodies that recognize endogenous PBP2 and endogenous PBP3 indicated that these antisera detected foci in coccoid cells, and in cell division intermediates, the PBP2 and PBP3 antibodies detected foci at the septum, foci at the septum and at the base of the mother cell, or foci at the base alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. S3A</xref>). Quantification revealed that the localization profiles of endogenous PBP2 and PBP3 in division intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. S3B</xref>) were not statistically different than the localization profiles observed for the mCherry fusions of PBP2 and PBP3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The quantification in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> suggested that FtsK is recruited to nascent divisomes that form at the base of dividing cells prior to the other divisome components. This hypothesis was tested by staining cells expressing the PBP2, PBP3, MreC, or MreB fusions with antibodies that recognize endogenous FtsK. Imaging analyses revealed that in a subset of cells, FtsK was detected in foci at the septum and at the base of dividing cells, while each of the fusions was only detected at the septum where they overlapped the distribution of septal FtsK (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), indicating that FtsK is recruited to nascent divisomes at the base of the cell prior to the other divisome components.</p>

To investigate whether MreB filament formation was required for the formation of foci by the other chlamydial divisome components, HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with the FtsK, PBP2, PBP3, MreC, or MreB fusions, and the fusions were induced by adding 10nM aTc to the media of the infected cells at 20hpi for 1hr.</p>
<p>During the induction period, cells were incubated in the absence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>) or presence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>) of the MreB inhibitor, A22, which inhibits MreB filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bean, 2009</xref>). RBs were harvested at 21hpi and stained with the appropriate antibodies to assess the effect of A22 on the cellular distribution of the fusions. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cox 2020</xref>), A22 inhibits chlamydial budding and most cells in the population were coccoid following A22 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Furthermore, approximately 50% of the untreated control cells were coccoid, which is consistent with prior estimates of the number of non-dividing RBs at this stage of the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lee 2018</xref>), indicating that our lysis procedure does not lead to a bias in the number of non-dividing coccoid cells in the population. MreB in coccoid cells adopted a diffuse pattern of localization following A22 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). A22 also had a statistically significant effect on the percent of coccoid cells containing MreC foci, but it did not affect the ability of FtsK, PBP2, or PBP3 to form foci in coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). These data indicate that MreB filaments do not function as a scaffold that is necessary for the assembly of all divisome components in <italic>Ct</italic>.</p>

<title>Effect of <italic>ftsk</italic> and <italic>pbp2</italic> Knockdown on Cell Division and Divisome Assembly in <italic>Ct</italic></title>
<p>To further investigate the mechanisms that regulate divisome assembly in <italic>Ct</italic>, we inducibly repressed the expression of <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> using CRISPRi technology, which has been used to inducibly repress the expression of genes in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ouellette SP 2021</xref>). CRISPRi employs a constitutively expressed crRNA that targets an inducible dCas enzyme (dCas12) to specific genes where it binds but fails to cut, thus inhibiting transcription. We transformed <italic>Ct</italic> with the pBOMBL12CRia plasmid that constitutively expresses an <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic>-specific crRNA, which targets sequences in the <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> promoter regions. To determine whether <italic>ftsK</italic> and <italic>pbp2</italic> transcript levels were altered using this CRISPRi approach, dCas12 expression was induced by the addition of 5nM aTc to the media of infected cells at 8hpi. Control cells were not induced. Nucleic acids were isolated from induced cells and from uninduced control cells at various times, and RT-qPCR was used to measure <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> transcript levels. This analysis revealed that the induction of dCas12 resulted in ∼10-fold reduction in <italic>ftsK</italic> transcript levels by 15hpi in cells expressing the <italic>ftsK-</italic>targeting crRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. S3A</xref>), and ∼8-fold reduction in <italic>pbp2</italic> transcript levels in cells expressing the <italic>pbp2</italic>-targeting crRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. S3B</xref>), while these crRNAs had minimal or no effect on chlamydial <italic>euo</italic> and <italic>omcB</italic> transcript levels, suggesting that the <italic>ftsK</italic> and <italic>pbp2</italic> crRNAs specifically inhibit the transcription of <italic>ftsK</italic> and <italic>pbp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Figs. S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3B</xref>). To investigate the effect of <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> down-regulation on developmental cycle progression, dCas12 was induced by the addition of aTc to the media of infected cells at 4hpi. Control cells were not induced. The cells were then fixed at 24hpi and stained with MOMP and Cas12 antibodies. Imaging analysis revealed that <italic>Ct</italic> morphology was normal and dCas12 was undetectable in the inclusions of uninduced control cells, while foci of dCas12 were observed in the induced cells, and <italic>Ct</italic> in the inclusion exhibited an enlarged aberrant morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Figs. S3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3D</xref>), suggesting that the inducible knockdown of <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> blocks chlamydial cell division. In additional studies, we induced dCas12 at 17hpi in cells expressing the <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic>-targeting crRNAs. Lysates were prepared and the cells were fixed at 21hpi, and localization studies revealed that foci of endogenous FtsK and PBP2 were almost undetectable when <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> were transiently knocked down using this CRISPRi approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. S3E</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess whether the knockdown of <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> arrests <italic>Ct</italic> division at a specific stage of polarized budding, HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with the pBOMBL12CRia plasmids encoding the <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic>-targeting crRNAs. At 17hpi, dCas12 was induced by the addition of 20nM aTc to the media. Control cells were not induced. RBs were harvested from induced and uninduced control cells at 22hpi and stained with MOMP antibodies, and imaging analyses quantified the division intermediates present in the population. These analyses revealed that &gt;60% of the <italic>Ct</italic> in the uninduced controls were at various stages of polarized budding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4A and B</xref>), while ∼90% of the cells were coccoid when <italic>ftsK</italic> was knocked down (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), and ∼85% of the cells were coccoid following <italic>pbp2</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that the initiation of polarized budding of <italic>Ct</italic> is inhibited when <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>pbp2</italic> are knocked down.</p>

<p>We next examined whether the knockdown of <italic>ftsK</italic> affected foci formation by PBP2 or PBP3 in coccoid cells. HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with the pBOMBL12CRia plasmid encoding the <italic>ftsK</italic>-targeting crRNA. At 17hpi, dCas12 was induced by the addition of 10nM aTc to the media. Control cells were not induced. RBs were harvested from induced and uninduced control cells at 22hpi, and the localization of endogenous PBP2 and PBP3 in coccoid cells was assessed. This analysis revealed that the number of polarized foci of PBP2 and PBP3 were reduced by approximately 80% in coccoid cells following <italic>ftsK</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In similar analyses, we assessed the effect of <italic>pbp2</italic> knockdown on the ability of FtsK and PBP3 to form foci in coccoid cells. While FtsK retained its ability to form foci in coccoid cells following <italic>pbp2</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), foci of PBP3 were almost entirely absent in <italic>pbp2</italic> knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Quantification of these assays revealed that FtsK is necessary for foci formation by both the PBP2 and PBP3 transpeptidases, while PBP2 is necessary for foci formation by PBP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Our data place FtsK upstream of, and necessary for, the addition of PBP2 and PBP3 to the <italic>Ct</italic> divisome, and PBP2 upstream of and necessary for the addition of PBP3 to the <italic>Ct</italic> divisome. These results are consistent with inhibitor studies that indicated PBP2 acts upstream of PBP3 in the polarized budding process of <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cox 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether the catalytic activity of PBP2 is necessary to maintain its association with the <italic>Ct</italic> divisome, HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic>, and mecillinam, an inhibitor of the transpeptidase activity of PBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kocaoglu 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cox 2020</xref>), was added to the media of infected cells at 20hpi. Cells incubated in the absence of mecillinam were included as a control.</p>
<p>Mecillinam-treated and control cells were harvested at 22hpi and the effect of inhibiting the catalytic activity of PBP2 on the localization of FtsK, PBP2, and PBP3 was determined. As shown previously, mecillinam blocks chlamydial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cox 2020</xref>), and most cells in the population assumed a coccoid morphology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

<p>Mecillinam treatment resulted in a ∼50% reduction in the number of cells with polarized foci of PBP2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). There was a similar reduction in polarized foci of PBP3 following mecillinam treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). These data indicate that the catalytic activity of PBP2 is necessary for PBP2 to efficiently associate with or maintain its association with polarized divisome complexes. Furthermore, consistent with <italic>pbp2</italic> knockdown studies, PBP3 association with the divisome complex is dependent on the prior addition of PBP2 to the complex, but foci formation by FtsK is unaffected when PBP2 foci are reduced in number (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Effect of Inhibitors and <italic>ftsk</italic> Knockdown on PG Organization in <italic>Ct</italic></title>
<p>To assess the morphology of PG at the septum and the base of dividing cells, we used an EDA-DA labeling strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Liechti 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cox 2020</xref>).

In additional analyses, we compared the localization of mCherry-PBP3 to the localization of PG in cells where the expression of this mCherry fusion had been induced by the addition of aTc to the media. This analysis, which was restricted to PG formation at the septum of dividing cells, revealed that multiple foci of PBP3 were associated with a septal PG ring (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).

<p>Similar analyses revealed that 2 foci of endogenous FtsK were associated with PG that was again at a slight angle to the MOMP-stained septum. This was true even though the PG had not fully reorganized into a ring structure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). To our knowledge, these are the first data in any system to suggest that septal PG synthesis/modification is simultaneously directed by multiple independent divisome complexes.</p>
<p>We then determined the effect of A22 and mecillinam on PG synthesis/morphology. Since both of these drugs induce <italic>Ct</italic> to assume a coccoid morphology, we initially characterized PG organization in untreated coccoid cells. We detected foci, bars, or rings in ∼80% of untreated coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>), which make up ∼50% of the cells in the inclusion at this stage of the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lee 2018</xref>). Furthermore, each of these PG intermediates exhibited a polarized distribution in untreated coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Although we cannot rule out that continued PG synthesis and reorganization occurs in polarized division intermediates, PG rings can arise prior to any of the morphological changes that occur during the polarized division of <italic>Ct</italic>.</p>
<p>Prior studies have shown that inhibitors of MreB filament formation prevent the appearance of PG-containing structures in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Liechti 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ouellette SP 2022</xref>). To assess the effect of MreB filament formation on PG synthesis and organization, we infected HeLa cells with <italic>Ct</italic>, and EDA-DA and A22 were added to the media of infected cells at 18hpi. The cells were harvested at 22hpi, lysates were prepared, and PG localization was determined. These analyses revealed that PG was diffuse/undetectable in the majority of A22-treated cells, and, in those cells where PG was still detected, it could not convert into ring structures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>). In similar experiments, we assessed the effect of mecillinam on the appearance of PG intermediates in coccoid cells. These analyses revealed that PG formed discrete foci or bars in 60% of mecillinam-treated cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>). However, these PG intermediates could not convert into PG rings when the transpeptidase activity of PBP2 was inhibited. Finally, we assessed PG organization in cells where <italic>ftsK</italic> was knocked down by inducing dCas12 in the <italic>ftsK</italic> knockdown strain by the addition of aTc to the media of infected cells at 17hpi. Cells were fixed at 21hpi, and localization studies revealed that <italic>ftsK</italic> knockdown had the most dramatic effect on PG localization, which was diffuse/undetectable in ∼90% of the cells assayed.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results presented here provide insight into the molecular mechanisms governing the FtsZ-less polarized cell division process of <italic>Ct</italic>. This study is the first to document the ordered assembly of divisome proteins in <italic>Ct</italic> and to investigate the roles of divisome proteins in regulating PG synthesis/organization in this obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen. Based on the results described here, a putative pathway for the assembly of the divisome in <italic>Ct</italic> is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>.</p>
<p>Our analyses revealed a novel spatiotemporal localization pattern of FtsK during the chlamydial division process. Chlamydial FtsK forms discrete foci at the septum, foci at the septum <italic>and</italic> at the base of the mother cell, or in foci only at the base of the mother cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Our data indicate that the foci at the base of the mother cell correspond to nascent divisome complexes that form prior to the formation of a secondary bud at the base of the progenitor mother cell. Our analyses further revealed there was no correlation between the stage of bud formation by the initial bud (early, mid-late; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ouellette SP 2022</xref>), and the appearance of nascent divisomes at the base of the progenitor mother cell (data not shown).</p>
<p>The <italic>Ct</italic> divisome is hybrid in nature, containing elements of the divisome (FtsK and PBP3) and elongasome (PBP2, MreB, and MreC) from other bacteria. Each of these proteins form foci at the septum, foci at the septum and at the base of the mother cell, or foci only at the base of the mother cell, and the foci of each protein are restricted to one side of the MOMP-stained septum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>ftsK</italic> using CRISPRi revealed that FtsK is necessary for the assembly of this hybrid divisome complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Knockdown and inhibitor studies further revealed that PBP2 is necessary for the addition of PBP3 to the divisome in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p>
<p>The chlamydial divisome proteins all form foci in coccoid cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and FtsK forms foci in dividing <italic>Ct</italic> that only partially overlap the distribution of PBP2, PBP3, MreC, and MreB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Although it is unclear why FtsK only partially overlaps the distribution of PBP2 and PBP3 in dividing <italic>Ct</italic>, MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Liechti 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kemege 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Lee 2020</xref>) and MreC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Fig. S4A</xref>) form rings in dividing cells, and the MreC rings we detected, like PG rings (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), were at a slight angle relative to the MOMP-stained septum. MreC also forms rings in coccoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Fig. S4B</xref>), which may be necessary for PG ring formation in coccoid cells. The relevance of the angled orientation of PG and MreC rings relative to the MOMP-stained septum in division intermediates is unclear, However, it appears to be a conserved feature of the cell division process and may arise because the divisome proteins are often positioned slightly above or below the plane of the MOMP-stained septum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies hypothesized that MreB filaments may substitute for FtsZ and form a scaffold necessary for the assembly of the divisome in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ouellette SP 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ouellette SP 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ouellette SP 2020</xref>). However, our analyses have indicated that MreB is one of the last components recruited to nascent divisomes that form at the base of the mother cell in <italic>Ct,</italic> and localization studies revealed that foci formation by FtsK, PBP2, and PBP3 are not dependent on MreB filament formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Although our data indicate that MreB filaments do not form a scaffold necessary for the assembly of all components of the divisome in <italic>Ct</italic>, MreB filaments are necessary for the conversion of PG foci into PG rings in <italic>Ct</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p>FtsZ treadmilling drives its rotational movement at the septum and this may be required for the positioning of peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzymes at the division plane in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bisson-Filho 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Yang 2017</xref>). However, to our knowledge, our studies are the first to indicate that multiple independent divisome complexes can simultaneously direct PG synthesis/modification at the septum of a dividing bacterium. The knockdown studies presented here further demonstrated that in the absence of FtsZ, chlamydial FtsK is critical for the initiation of divisome assembly and PG synthesis in <italic>Ct</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Ct</italic> is a member of the Planctomycetes/Verrucomicrobia/Chlamydia superphylum and members of the Chlamydia and Planctomycetes phyla do not encode FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Rivas-Marín 2016</xref>). Planctospirus limnophila is a member of the Planctomycetes that divides by polarized budding, and recent knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rivas-Marin 2023</xref>) indicated that FtsK is the only protein of the chlamydial divisome we characterized here that is essential for the growth of this free-living organism. These results suggest that multiple mechanisms of FtsZ-independent polarized budding have evolved in members of this superphyla. It will be of interest in future studies to determine whether other members of the Planctomycetes that bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Wiegand 2020</xref>) divide using a divisome apparatus similar to <italic>Ct</italic>.</p>

<title>Transformation of <italic>Ct</italic></title>
<p><italic>Ct</italic> was transformed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Wang 2011</xref>). Briefly, HeLa cells were plated in a 10cm plate at a density of 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells the day before beginning the transformation procedure. <italic>Ct</italic> lacking its endogenous plasmid (-pL2) was incubated with 10μg of plasmid DNA in Tris-CaCl<sub>2</sub> buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 50 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 30 min at room temperature.</p>
<p>HeLa cells were trypsinized, washed with 8mL of 1x DPBS (Gibco), and pelleted. The pellet was resuspended in 300μL of the Tris-CaCl<sub>2</sub> buffer. <italic>Ct</italic> was mixed with the HeLa cells and incubated at room temperature for an additional 20 min. The mixture was added to 10mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 μg/mL gentamicin and transferred to a 10cm plate. At 48hpi, the HeLa cells were harvested and <italic>Ct</italic> in the population were used to infect a new HeLa cell monolayer in media containing 0.36 U/ml of penicillin G to select for transformants.

<title>Immunofluorescence Microscopy</title>
<p>HeLa cells were seeded in 10cm plates at a density of 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well the day before the infection. <italic>Ct</italic> L2 or chlamydial strains transformed with plasmids encoding FtsK-mCherry, mCherry-PBP2, mCherry-PBP3, or mCherry-MreC or with plasmids that direct the constitutive expression of the crRNAs targeting the <italic>pbp2</italic> or <italic>ftsK</italic> promoters were used to infect HeLa cells in DMEM. For experiments with the transformants, aTc was added to the media of infected cells at the indicated concentration and time. At 21hpi, cells were detached from the 10cm plate by scraping and pelleted by centrifugation for 30 seconds. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of 0.1x PBS (Gibco) and transferred to a 2mL tube containing 0.5mm glass beads (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were vortexed for 3 mins. then centrifuged at 800rpm for 2 mins. in a microfuge. 20μLs of the supernatant was mixed with 20μLs of 2x fixing solution (6.4% formaldehyde and 0.044% glutaraldehyde) and incubated on a glass slide for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 3 times with PBS, and the cells were permeabilized by incubation with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min. Cells were washed with PBS two times. For experiments with <italic>Ct</italic> L2, the cells were incubated with a goat primary antibody against the major outer-membrane protein (MOMP; Meridian, Memphis, TN), and the mouse primary antibody that recognizes endogenous FtsK raised against recombinant CT739 protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.047746-0">https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.047746-0</ext-link>), or with rabbit antibodies raised against peptides derived from PBP 2 or PBP3 (Ouellette SP 2012) . Briefly, chlamydial antigens or peptides emulsified with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant were used to immunize animals via intramuscular injections three times with an interval of 2 weeks. Antisera were collected from the immunized animals 2 to 4 weeks after the final immunization as the primary antibodies. After the primary antibody labeling, the cells were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG (Alexa 488) and donkey anti-mouse IgG (Alexa 594) or donkey-anti-rabbit IgG (Alexa 594) secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Experiments in which we visualized the distribution of the various mCherry fusions, the localization of the mCherry fluorescence was compared to the distribution of MOMP. In some experiments, we determined the distribution of the MreB_6x His fusion by staining cells expressing the fusion with a rabbit anti-6x His antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and the goat anti-MOMP antibody followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies. Cells were imaged using Zeiss AxioImager2 microscope equipped with a 100x oil immersion PlanApochromat objective and a CCD camera. During image acquisition, 0.3μm xy-slices were collected that extended above and below the cell. The images were collected such that the brightest spot in the image was saturated. The images were deconvolved using the nearest neighbor algorithm in the Zeiss Axiovision 4.7 software. Deconvolved images were viewed and assembled using Zeiss Zen-Blue software. For each experiment, three independent replicates were performed, and the values shown for localization are the average of the 3 experiments. In some instances, 3D projections of the acquired xy slices were generated using the Zeiss Zen-Blue software.</p>

<p>HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> (-pL2) transformed with the pBOMB4 Tet (-GFP) plasmid encoding the indicated aTc-inducible gene. At 8hpi, aTc was added to the culture media at the indicated concentration. Control cells were not induced. At 48hpi, the HeLa cells were dislodged from the culture dishes by scraping and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of 0.1x PBS (Gibco) and transferred to a 2mL tube containing 0.5mm glass bead tubes (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were vortexed for 3 min. followed by centrifugation at 800rpm for 2 min. The supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of a 2x sucrose-phosphate (2SP) solution (ref) and frozen at -80°C. At the time of the secondary infection, the chlamydiae were thawed on ice and vortexed. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1k x g at 4°C. The EBs in the resulting supernatant were serially diluted and used to infect a monolayer of HeLa cells in a 24-well plate. The secondary infections were allowed to grow at 37°C for 24 hrs before they were fixed and labeled for immunofluorescence microscopy by incubating with a goat anti-MOMP antibody followed by a secondary donkey anti-goat antibody (Alexa Fluor 594). The cells were rinsed in PBS and inclusions were imaged using an EVOS imaging system (Invitrogen). The number of inclusions were counted in 5 fields of view and averaged. Three independent replicates were performed, and the values from the replicates were averaged to determine the number of inclusion forming units. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare IFUs in induced and uninduced samples.</p>

(C) HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed N-terminal fusions of PBP2 or PBP3. The fusions were induced (+aTc) at17hpi. Controls were not induced (-aTc). The cells were harvested at 21hpi and lysates were prepared as described in the Methods and characterized by immunoblotting analysis with rabbit antibodies raised against peptides derived from chlamydial PBP2 or PBP3. The PBP3 antibody primarily detects a single species with the predicted molecular mass of mCherry-PBP3 in the induced sample, The PBP2 antibody primarily detects a single species of 120kD in the induced sample, which is smaller than the predicted molecular mass of mCherry-PBP2 (∼150kD). The failure to detect full length mCherry-PBP2 may be due to the masking of the epitope recognized by the PBP2 antibody by the N-terminal mCherry tag in the full-length protein. (D) HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ct</italic> transformed with mCherry-PBP2 or mCherry-PBP3. The fusions were induced by the addition of 10nM aTc to the media of the infected cells at 19hpi. Infected cells were harvested at 21hpi and lysates were prepared and stained with the PBP2 or PBP3 antibodies. The staining with the PBP2 and PBP3 antibodies completely overlaps the mCherry fluorescence from the mCherry-PBP2 and mCherry-PBP3 fusions (Bars are 3μM)</p></caption>

<p>In this <bold>important</bold> study, significant advancements are made in how cell division in Chlamydia trachomatis, lacking FtsZ, is mediated. With the careful use of fluorescence microscopy and genetic tools, the evidence identifying the DNA translocase, FtsK, as an early and essential component of the divisome, is <bold>convincing</bold>. As this role is distinct from what has been found in most other bacteria, this study will be of broad interest to microbiologists and molecular biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Harpring et al. investigated divisome assembly in Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 (Ct), an obligate intracellular bacterium that lacks FtsZ, the canonical master regulator of bacterial cell division. They find that divisome assembly is initiated by the protein FtsK in Ct by showing that it forms discrete foci at the septum and future division sites. Additionally, knocking down ftsK prevents divisome assembly and inhibits cell division, further supporting their hypothesis that FtsK regulates divisome assembly. Finally, they show that MreB is one of the last chlamydial divisome proteins to arrive at the site of division and is necessary for the formation of septal peptidoglycan rings but does not act as a scaffold for division assembly as previously proposed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use microscopy to clearly show that FtsK forms foci both at the septum as well as at the base of the progenitor cell where the next septum will form. They also show that the Ct proteins PBP2, PBP3, MreC, and MreB localize to these same sites suggesting they are involved in the divisome complex.</p>
<p>Using CRISPRi the authors knock down ftsK and find that most cells are no longer able to divide and that PBP2 and PBP3 no longer localized to sites of division suggesting that FtsK is responsible for initiating divisome assembly. They also performed a knockdown of pbp2 using the same approach and found that this also mostly inhibited cell division. Additionally, FtsK was still able to localize in this strain, however PBP3 did not, suggesting that FtsK acts upstream of PBP2 in the divisome assembly process while PBP2 is responsible for the localization of PBP3.</p>
<p>The authors also find that performing a knockdown of ftsK also prevents new PG synthesis further supporting the idea that FtsK regulates divisome assembly. They also find that inhibiting MreB filament formation using A22 results in diffuse PG, suggesting that MreB filament formation is necessary for proper PG synthesis to drive cell division.</p>
<p>Overall the authors propose a new hypothesis for divisome assembly in an organism that lacks FtsZ and use a combination of microscopy and genetics to support their model that is rigorous and convincing. The finding that FtsK, rather than a cytoskeletal or &quot;scaffolding&quot; protein is the first division protein to localize to the incipient division site is unexpected and opens up a host of questions about its regulation. The findings will progress our understanding of how cell division is accomplished in bacteria with non-canonical cell wall structure and/or that lack FtsZ.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses were noted in the data supporting the main conclusions. However, there was a claim of novelty in showing that multiple divisome complexes can drive cell wall synthesis simultaneously that was not well-supported (i.e. this has been shown previously in other organisms). In addition, there were minor weaknesses in data presentation that do not substantially impact interpretation (e.g. presenting the number of cells rather than the percentage of the population when quantifying phenotypes and showing partial western blots instead of total western blots).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chlamydial cell division is a peculiar event, whose mechanism was mysterious for many years. C. trachomatis division was shown to be polar and involve a minimal divisome machinery composed of both homologues of divisome and elongasome components, in the absence of an homologue of the classical division organizer FtsZ. In this paper, Harpring et al., show that FtsK is required at an early stage of the chlamydial divisome formation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written and the results are convincing. Quantification of divisome component localization is well performed, number of replicas and number of cells assessed are sufficient to get convincing data. The use of a CRISPRi approach to knock down some divisome components is an asset and allows a mechanistic understanding of the hierarchy of divisome components.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors did not analyse the role of all potential chlamydial divisome components and did not show how FtsK may initiate the positioning of the divisome. Their conclusion that FtsK initiates the assembly of the divisome is an overinterpretation and is not backed by the data. However, data show convincingly that FtsK, if perhaps not the initiator of chlamydial division, is definitely an early and essential component of the chlamydial divisome.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) divides by binary fission. It lacks FtsZ, but still has many other proteins that regulate the synthesis of septal peptidoglycan, including FtsW and FtsI (PBP3) as well as divisome proteins that recruit and activate them, such as FtsK and FtsQLB. Interestingly, MreB is also required for the division of Ct cells, perhaps by polymerizing to form an FtsZ-like scaffold. Here, Harpring et al. show that MreB does not act early in division and instead is recruited to a protein complex that includes FtsK and PBP2/PBP3. This indicates that Ct cell division is organized by a chimera between conserved divisome and elongasome proteins. Their work also shows convincingly that FtsK is the earliest known step of divisome activity, potentially nucleating the divisome as a single protein complex at the future division site. This is reminiscent of the activity of FtsZ, yet fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is very well written and presented, and the data are convincing and rigorous. The data underlying the proposed localization dependency order of the various proteins for cell division is well justified by several different approaches using small molecule inhibitors, knockdowns, and fluorescent protein fusions. The proposed dependency pathway of divisome assembly is consistent with the data and with a novel mechanism for MreB in septum synthesis in Ct.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper could be improved by including more information about FtsK, the &quot;focus&quot; of this study. For example, if FtsK really is the FtsZ-like nucleator of the Ct divisome, how is the Ct FtsK different sequence-wise or structurally from FtsK of, e.g. E. coli? Is the N-terminal part of FtsK sufficient for cell division in Ct like it is in E. coli, or is the DNA translocase also involved in focus formation or localization? Addressing those questions would put the proposed initiator role of FtsK in Ct in a better context and make the conclusions more attractive to a wider readership.</p>
<p>Another weakness is that the title of the paper implies that FtsK alone initiates divisome assembly. However, the data indicate only that FtsK is important at an early stage of divisome assembly, not that it is THE initiator. I suggest modifying the title to account for this--perhaps &quot;FtsK is required to initiate....&quot;.</p>
