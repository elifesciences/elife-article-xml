<title>Abstract</title>
<sec><title>Background</title>
<p>Comorbidity with type 2 diabetes (T2D) results in worsening of cancer-specific and overall prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The treatment of CRC <italic>per se</italic> may be diabetogenic. We assessed the impact of different types of surgical cancer resections and oncological treatment on risk of T2D development in CRC patients.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Method</title>
<p>We developed a population-based cohort study including all Danish CRC patients, who had undergone CRC surgery between 2001-2018. Using nationwide register data, we identified and followed patients from date of surgery and until new-onset of T2D, death or end of follow-up.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 46,373 CRC patients were included and divided into six groups according to type of surgical resection: 10,566 Right-No-Chemo (23%), 4,645 Right-Chemo (10%), 10,151 Left-No-Chemo (22%), 5,257 Left-Chemo (11%), 9,618 Rectal-No-Chemo (21%) and 6,136 Rectal-Chemo (13%). During 245,466 person-years of follow-up 2,556 patients developed T2D. The incidence rate (IR) of T2D was highest in the Left-Chemo group 11.3 (95%CI: 10.4-12.2) per 1,000 person-years and lowest in the Rectal-No-Chemo group 9.6 (95%CI: 8.8-10.4). Between-group unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of developing T2D was similar and non-significant. In the adjusted analysis, Rectal-No-Chemo was associated with lower T2D risk (HR 0.86 [95%CI 0.75-0.98]) compared to Right-No-Chemo.</p>
<p>For all six groups, an increased level of BMI resulted in a nearly twofold increased risk of developing T2D</p></sec>
<sec><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study suggests postoperative T2D screening should be prioritized in CRC survivors with overweight/obesity regardless of type of colorectal cancer treatment applied.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and the incidence rate is still increasing. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> The same applies to the global incidence rate of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The association between CRC and T2D is well-established, as patients with T2D have approximately 30% increased risk of developing CRC, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and T2D is known to negatively influence the prognosis of CRC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, some studies even show an increased T2D risk in CRC survivors. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> Fortunately, survival after a CRC diagnosis is steadily improving due to early detection, diagnostic precision, and more advanced cancer treatment; and today, more than 70% of non-metastatic CRC patients are alive after 5 years. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Accordingly, it becomes increasingly important to identify CRC patients at risk of developing long-term health problems like T2D in order to initiate preventive strategies or treatment. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> The underlying mechanisms behind the increased T2D risk in CRC survivors are poorly understood. However, shared life-style related risk factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet may play a role. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another explanation may be treatment-induced hyperglycemia. Prior studies showed that treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy can induce hyperglycemia and development of T2D in CRC patients. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Moreover, glucocorticoid, administered to alleviate side effects of chemotherapy, may impair glucose homeostasis and thus increase the risk of T2D. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> In addition to the drug-induced metabolic disturbances, a recent study revealed that the type of CRC surgery <italic>per se</italic> is associated with diverging risk of T2D. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> A previous nationwide Danish study revealed that patients, who had undergone left-sided colon resection for CRC and other colonic illnesses had an increased risk of developing T2D, whereas this risk was unaltered in patients who had undergone right-sided colonic resections compared with a control group. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> However, this study lacks essential information on the role of potential modifying factors like BMI, treatment with chemotherapy etc. Along the same line, in a population of non-CRC patients, Lee et al. published that patients who had undergone right-sided or transversal colonic resections had a reduced risk of developing T2D compared with a matched non-colectomy control group. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> These findings raise an intriguing question of whether the risk of developing T2D in CRC survivors may be casually affected by the type of CRC surgery. Possible explanations of this side-specific risk modification include removal of different enteroendocrine cell types resulting in gut changes that is important for insulin secretion and action and for appetite regulation as well as changes in the microbiome, but causality remains to be investigated further. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, we tested the hypothesis whether different types of surgical cancer resection and oncological treatment have an impact on risk of developing diabetes in CRC survivors. For this purpose, we used a nationwide register to compare the frequency of diabetes development in CRC patients who had undergone right-sided colectomy, left-sided colectomy or rectal resection with and without chemotherapy, when adjusting for potential modifying factors like BMI etc.</p>

<title>Methods and material</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>The study was based on information from Danish nationwide health registers. All data are recorded with reference to a civil registration number, which is a unique personal identification number assigned to all Danish residents. This number permits accurate linkage of recorded information at the personal level. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study population was identified through the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG) database, which contains prospectively collected and validated data on all patients with CRC since 2001, including data on patient’s characteristics, diagnostics and treatment. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> The degree of patient inclusion in the database is high (&gt;95%) and thus adequately represents the population of Danish CRC patients undergoing anti-cancer resections. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>We included all CRC cancer patients undergoing cancer surgery between 1<sup>st</sup> of May 2001 until 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2018 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Patients with unspecified surgery or total colectomy were excluded as these procedures are not standard treatment for CRC. Finally, individuals with a preoperatively diagnosed T2D or Type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis, as well as those who were diagnosed with T2D within the first 2 weeks postoperatively were excluded, as the last group probably represents patients with preoperatively unknown pre-existing prediabetes or diabetes.</p>

<title>Exposure</title>
<p>Patients were subdivided into six groups according to the surgical procedure and whether the patients had received chemotherapy or not. The group “right-sided colonic resection” (Right) included patients with cancer in coecum, ascending colon, or the oral part of colon transversum, the group “left-sided colonic resection” (Left) included patients with cancer in the anal part of colon transversum, descending colon, and sigmoid colon, and the group “rectal resection“ (Rectal) included patients with rectal cancer. Information regarding chemotherapy was limited to whether the patient had received chemotherapy (Chemo) or not (No-Chemo).</p>
<p>Based on the combination of surgical procedures and chemotherapy, the study population was divided into six groups: Right-No-Chemo, Right-Chemo, Left-No-Chemo, Left-Chemo, Rectal-No-Chemo, Rectal-Chemo.</p>
<p>Radiation therapy is only part of standard treatment for rectal cancer, and therefore this oncological modality was restricted to Rectal patients (Rectal-No-Radiation vs. Rectal-Radiation).</p>
<p>Finally, a sub analysis was made comparing all colonic resected patients (All Colon) with all rectal resected (All Rectal)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Outcome</title>
<p>The primary outcome was first-time diagnosis of T2D after different types of CRC cancer surgery and chemotherapy. Patients were followed from date of surgery until time to T2D diagnosis, emigration, death, or the end of follow up (31<sup>st</sup> of December 2018), whichever came first. Individuals with T2D were identified from data in the Danish National Patient Register (comprising information on diagnoses during all hospital contacts in Denmark), the National Prescription Registry (comprising information on all prescriptions filled at any pharmacy in Denmark), and the Danish National Health Service Register (comprising information on podiatrist services) as described by Carstensen et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Individuals were classified as having T1D if they had received prescriptions for insulin combined with a diagnosis of type 1 from a medical hospital department. Otherwise, diabetes was classified as type 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive data was presented as means with standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and proportions (n, %) for categorical variables. Crude incidence rates (number of T2D diagnoses by person-time at risk) were calculated for the six groups (type of surgery ± chemo), and characterised by preoperative variables (sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol status, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification score (ASA), and treatment with radiotherapy in Rectal cancer patients). Unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression analyses were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for developing T2D after different types of surgery with and without chemotherapy (using Right-No-Chemo as a reference group), after radiation therapy among Rectal resected (using Rectal-No-Radiation as reference), and after overall type of surgery (All Colon (ref) vs All Rectal). The adjusted analyses were performed stepwise by first adjusting for year of surgery, age at surgery, sex and BMI (Model 1), then further adjusting ASA, smoking and alcohol consumption (Model 2a), and lastly, further adjusting for chemotherapy (Model 2b) in the analyses on radiation therapy and overall type of surgery Finally, the impact of BMI on the risk of developing of T2D was investigated within each of the six groups. BMI was categorized into 4 subgroups (18.5-24.9, 25.0-29.9, 30-34.9 and 35-39.9), and underweight (BMI&lt;18.5) or severely obese (BMI ≥ 40) subjects were excluded from these analyses due to low numbers. For each group (type of surgery ± chemotherapy), the HR for developing T2D depending on BMI subgroups was calculated by using Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, year of surgery, and ASA score using normal weight (BMI:18.5-24.9) as the reference group. A sensitivity analyses was performed restricting the inclusion period of surgery patients from 2001-2018 to 2010-2018, as baseline information was complete from 2010.</p>
<p>All analyzes were conducted using STATA version 16 (STATA Corp., College Station, Tex., USA). P-value of P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results were presented with 95% confidence interval (CI) when relevant.</p>

<p>A total of 46,373 CRC patients without preoperatively recorded diabetes were found eligible for the study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and were divided into six groups: 10,566 Right-No-Chemo (23%), 4,645 Right-Chemo (10%), 10,151 Left-No-Chemo (22%), 5,257 Left-Chemo (11%), 9,618 Rectal-No-Chemo (21%) and 6,136 Rectal-Chemo (13%).</p>
<p>Compared with the Right groups, the Left and Rectal groups were younger, more often men, and less often classified as ASA&gt;II (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<p>BMI had a strong association with T2D regardless of surgical resection and treatment with chemotherapy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The risk of developing T2D increased near twofold every time the BMI group increased one level, for example in the Right-No-Chemo group: HR 2.13 in BMI 25-30, HR 3.63 in BMI 30-35, HR 8.01 in BMI 35-40, compared with the reference BMI of 18.5-25. A similar pattern was observed within each of the other five groups, although a less pronounced impact of BMI was observed in the Left-No-Chemo group: HR 1.85 in 25-30, 2.93 in 30-35, 4.21 in 35-40 BMI group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This national cohort study demonstrated that rectal cancer resected patients had a slightly lower risk of developing T2D when compared to colon cancer resected patients. Treatment with chemotherapy had no impact on T2D risk in any of the resection groups, and radiation therapy didn’t affect T2D risk either.</p>
<p>Within each of the six groups (different types of surgery with and without chemotherapy), BMI was strongly associated to developing T2D, the risk increased almost twofold every time the BMI group increased one level.</p>
<p>Only few studies have examined the risk of developing T2D after different kinds of colonic- and rectal surgical procedures, and in contrast to the present study the following studies were not able to adjust for several confounders incl. preoperative BMI. Jensen et al. found a higher risk of T2D after the left-sided compared with the right-sided colonic resections, but, in contrast to the current study, patients operated for both non-malignant as well as malignant diseases were included. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> In support of side-specific effect of colonic resections, Wu et al. investigated a population of non-CRC patients and showed that right-sided and transversal colonic resections were associated with a reduced risk of T2D development compared with patients without colectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> In contrast to both the abovementioned studies the most recent epidemiological study found an increased T2D risk after colectomy compared with small bowel resection in non-cancer patients, but when stratifying by resection type, they found no difference in T2D risk. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Obesity is one of the predominant factors in the development of T2D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and the linear increase in new onset T2D with increased BMI reported in this study is well described in the literature. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> It is important to emphasize that only pre-operative BMI was included in the adjustments as post-surgery BMI information was not available and accordingly, weight trajectories after surgery could not be included in the analyses. It’s still unknown how body weight and body composition changes after different types of CRC resection, and thus it is not clear whether changes in weight in any groups play a role in diabetes development.</p>
<p>Like our findings, Jensen et al. and Wu et al. found a tendency towards a decreased risk of T2D after rectal resection, although these findings were not statistically significant in the previous studies. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential mechanism behind this finding.</p>
<p>We found no impact of treatment with chemotherapy on T2D risk, which was a bit surprising. Prior studies indicated that treatment with chemotherapy may induce hyperglycemia, and especially the combined use of chemotherapy and glucocorticoid, administered to alleviate side-effects of chemotherapy, may have synergistic effects on later diabetes risk. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the study period of the present study, different types of chemotherapy have been part of the standard treatment of colon and rectum cancer respectively, and knowledge regarding the specific effects of each drug on glucose homeostasis is sparse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> In most cases CRC patients included in the study, will however have been treated with the chemotherapy 5-Flourouracil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> In a recent study a significant increase in glycemic variability, a precursor of T2D development, was found in non-diabetic early-stage colon cancer patients during 5-Flourouracil and Capecitabine chemotherapy treatment. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, Feng et al. showed a 10% increased risk of developing T2D in CRC patients during and after treatment with adjuvant 5-Flourouracil. They argued that 5-Flourouracil could induce toxicity in B-cells leading to hyperglycaemia. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Similarly, Lee et al revealed an impairment in glucose homeostasis in both breast cancer and CRC patients treated with chemotherapy and glucocorticoid following treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Nonetheless 65% of the newly diagnosed T2D cases remitted 6 months after discontinuation of chemotherapy, suggesting that chemotherapy is a reversible diabetogenic factor. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Thus, in summary, treatment with chemotherapy may primarily induce transient effects on glucose homeostasis in CRC patients. In contrast to the lack of influence of chemotherapy treatment, it was not surprising that radiation therapy had no impact on diabetes risk in our study.</p>
<p>Due to the strong negative prognostic effects of comorbidity with T2D on CRC outcomes, identifying CRC patients at increased risk of developing T2D is of great clinical importance. Our study didn’t support a role of cancer surgery with left-sided colonic resection or treatment with chemotherapy in T2D development in CRC survivors. However, in line with existing literature we found BMI to be strongly associated with T2D development.</p>
<p>A core strength of the present study is the use of a nationwide database, allowing inclusion of large numbers of CRC patients treated with different types of CRC resections, providing valid real-life data regarding with close to complete coverage and long-term follow-up and a register-based approach to identify individuals with T2D. We were able to adjust for several confounders such as BMI, alcohol consumption and smoking, which has been a limitation in previous studies. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The limitation of the present study includes that information on BMI and other risk factors for developing T2D were only available preoperatively, eliminating the possibility of exploring an impact of BMI trajectories after cancer treatment until the T2D diagnosis. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> Secondly, information on dose, length of treatment and type of chemotherapy were not available. Thirdly, information on physical activity, diet, medication, and comorbidities, apart from the ASA score, were not available. In addition, our findings are limited by the register-based data collection method. Clinical well-designed mechanistic investigations are warranted to establish whether left-sided CRC resection <italic>per se</italic> drives metabolic alterations leading to an increased risk of T2D.</p>
<p>In summary, we report a slightly increased risk of developing T2D after CRC treatment with colonic resection compared with rectal resection, whereas chemotherapy had no impact on new onset T2D. Within each surgical subgroup, BMI at time of surgery was strongly associated to developing T2D. This study suggests that postoperative diabetes screening should be prioritized in CRC survivors with overweight/obesity regardless of type of colorectal cancer treatment applied.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings on diabetogenic risk from colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. The authors claim that postoperative screening for type 2 diabetes should be prioritized in CRC survivors with overweight/obesity, irrespective of the oncological treatment received. The evidence supporting the claims is <bold>solid</bold> but requires confirmation in different populations. These results have theoretical or practical implications and will be of interest to endocrinologists, oncologists, general practitioners, gastrointestinal surgeons, and policymakers working on CRC and diabetes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, the authors set out to determine whether colorectal cancer surgery site (right, left, rectal) and chemotherapy impact the subsequent risk of developing T2DM in the Danish national health register.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- The research question is conceptually interesting</p>
<p>
- The Danish national health register is a comprehensive health database</p>
<p>
- The data analysis was thorough and appropriate</p>
<p>
-The findings are interesting, and a little surprising that there was no impact of chemotherapy on the development of T2DM</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- This is not a weakness as such, but in the discussion, I would consider adding some brief comment on the international generalizability of the findings - e.g. demographic make up of the Danish population health register and background rates of DM and obesity in this population with CRC compared to countries on other continents.</p>
<p>
- A little more information would be helpful regarding how T2DM was diagnosed in the registry. If someone did develop transient hyperglycemia requiring DM medications during chemotherapy, would the investigators have been able to identify these people? Would they have been classified as T2DM based on filling a prescription for DM meds for a period of time? Also, did the authors have information regarding time to development of T2DM after surgery?</p>
<p>
- In the adjusted Models, the authors did not adjust for cancer stage, even though cancer stage appears to be very different between the chemo and no chemo groups. It would be interesting to know if it affects the results if the model adjusted for cancer stage</p>
<p>
- It would be worthwhile to report if mortality rates were different between the groups during follow up, and if the authors investigated whether perhaps differences in mortality rates led to specific groups living longer, and therefore having more time to develop DM</p>
<p>Overall, the authors achieved their aims, and the conclusions are supported by their results as reported.</p>
<p>
The results are unlikely to significantly change patient treatment or T2DM screening in this population. With some additional information, as described above, the results would be of interest to the community.</p>

<p>Summary: The study showed the impact of cancer treatment on new onset of diabetes among patients with colorectal cancer using the national database. Findings reported that individuals with rectal cancer without chemotherapy were less likely to develop diabetes but among other groups, treatment didn't show any impact on the development of diabetes. BMI still played a significant role in developing diabetes regardless of treatment types.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
One of the strengths of this study is innovative findings about the prognosis of colorectal cancer treatment stratified by treatment types. Especially, as it examined the impact of treatment on the risk of new chronic disease after diagnosis, it became significant evidence that suggests practical insights in developing a proper monitoring system for patients with colorectal cancer and their outcomes after treatment and diagnosis. It is imperative for providers to guide patients and caregivers to prevent adverse outcomes like new onset of chronic disease based on BMI and types of treatment. The next strength is the national database. As the study used the national database, the generalizability is validated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Even though the study attempted to examine the impact of each treatment option, the dosage of chemotherapy and the types of chemotherapy were not able to be examined due to the data source.</p>
