<title>Abstract</title><p>Pigment patterns and skin appendages are prominent features of vertebrate skin. In zebrafish, regularly patterned pigment stripes and an array of calcified scales form simultaneously in the skin during post-embryonic development. Understanding mechanisms that regulate stripe patterning and scale morphogenesis may lead to discovery of fundamental mechanisms that govern development of animal form. To learn about cell types and signaling interactions that govern skin patterning and morphogenesis we generated and analyzed single cell transcriptomes of skin from wild-type fish as well as fish having genetic or transgenically induced defects in squamation or pigmentation. These data reveal a previously undescribed population of epidermal cells that express transcripts encoding enamel matrix proteins, suggest hormonal control of epithelial-mesenchymal signaling, clarify the signaling network that governs scale papillae development, and identify a critical role for the hypodermis in supporting pigment cell development. Additionally, these comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic data representing skin phenotypes of biomedical relevance should provide a useful resource for accelerating discovery of mechanisms that govern skin development and homeostasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The steady-state chemistry of life on earth occurs within compartments bounded from the rest of the cosmos. Providing this boundary function and serving as the primary interface between organisms and their environments are sophisticated integuments that, in vertebrates, comprise marvelous and varied skins, decorated with patterns of pigmentation and arrayed appendages including feathers, fur or scales. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of animal form and phenotypic diversity is an enduring goal of basic biology and studying skin patterning and morphogenesis can advance that goal. Additionally, while human skin is a major contributor to our outward appearance, bears all our physical interactions, and detects all our tactile sensations, it remains a failure-prone organ system with numerous poorly understood and debilitating pathologies.</p>
<p>Studying the skin of research organisms chosen based on phylogeny or experimental exigency can improve our understanding of regulatory mechanisms underlying integumental patterning and morphogenesis. Comparing developmental mechanisms across species can provide clues to the origin and evolution of this important organ system and may also reveal fundamental mechanisms relevant to human health and disease. To these ends, the development of skin, and cell types within the skin, have been studied across a variety of research organisms, yielding insights into both general and species-specific mechanisms (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Duverger and Morasso, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Parichy, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Aman and Parichy, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) is an outstanding research organism for studying vertebrate skin patterning and morphogenesis. Zebrafish skin, like all vertebrate skin, has a superficial epidermis composed of ectoderm-derived epithelial cells and an underlying dermis composed of mesoderm-derived mesenchymal cells and collagenous stromal matrix (<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">Le Guellec et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Aman and Parichy, 2020</xref>). During post-embryonic development, zebrafish skin simultaneously develops arrays of calcified scales and pigmented stripes. Both form superficially on the surface of the animal and are dispensable for survival in the laboratory, making them readily amenable to imaging and experimental perturbation, and enabling analyses of underlying cellular dynamics and molecular mechanisms (<xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Kimelman, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c100" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Parichy, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">De Simone et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>To reveal potentially rare cell populations important for zebrafish scale development and pigment patterning we used unbiased single-cell transcriptional profiling and live imaging of skins undergoing post-embryonic morphogenesis. Additionally, to gain insights into molecular mechanisms underlying human skin pathologies we profiled skins from <italic>ectodysplasin a</italic> (<italic>eda</italic>) mutants, <italic>basonuclin 2</italic> (<italic>bnc2</italic>) mutants, and hypothyroid fish (hypoTH; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic></bold>). Eda-Edar-NF-κB is a conserved signaling pathway that is necessary for normal skin appendage development in all vertebrates examined to date (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">Kere et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="c116" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">Kondo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Houghton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Di-Poï and Milinkovitch, 2016</xref>). Mutations in the signaling ligand Eda-A (Ectodysplasin-A), its receptor Edar, or downstream signal transduction molecules in the NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) pathway underlie human ectodermal dysplasias, hereditary disorders defined by loss of skin appendages and teeth (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Cluzeau et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, <italic>eda</italic> mutant zebrafish completely lack scales, though specific mechanisms linking Eda signaling to scale formation remain unclear (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2008</xref>). To learn more about potential interactions between pigment cells and their skin microenvironment, we profiled a mutant for <italic>bnc2</italic>, a conserved zinc finger containing protein implicated in human pigment variation that acts through the tissue environment to promote pigment cell development in zebrafish (<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c89" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Parichy, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c125" ref-type="bibr">Visser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Endo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Ayoola et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, we profiled skins from hypothyroid fish (hypoTH) that are unable to synthesize thyroid hormone owing to transgene-mediated ablation of the thyroid gland (<xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>). Thyroid hormone (TH) is a potent regulator of vertebrate skin development, and thyroid dysfunction underlies debilitating skin pathologies (<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">Mancino et al., 2021</xref>). We have shown that TH is necessary for dermal morphogenesis as well as pigment cell maturation and pattern formation though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive (<xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c105" ref-type="bibr">Saunders et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>Our analyses, using single cell transcriptomics supplemented by histological analyses of gene expression, fate mapping and experimental manipulations revealed a previously undescribed epidermal cell type that expresses transcripts encoding enamel matrix proteins, relevant to understanding the ancient origins of calcified tissues, and have clarified the position of Eda within the signaling network that governs scale papilla induction. We also discovered a novel regulatory pathway that connects globally circulating TH to local epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during dermal development. We further identify the hypodermis as a crucial pigment cell supporting tissue that provides a permissive environment for the self-organizing interactions of adult stripe formation. Lastly, by comparing analyses of single cell transcriptomes with spatial analyses of gene expression and cell-type differentiation we uncover instances in which single cell bioinformatic inferences represent, and fail to represent, true cell state transformations. Together, these analyses provide new insights into the development and evolution of vertebrate skin and highlight the importance of validating inferences of differentiation and lineage from single cell transcriptomics with paradigms for assessing developmental events <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>sci-RNA-seq of whole skin reveals cell type diversity during post-embryonic development</title>
<p>Skin is a large and complex organ system, with contributions from multiple embryonic germ layers and a variety of distinct cell types. Likely due to a shared requirement for TH, pigment pattern formation and squamation occur simultaneously during post-embryonic development, in different layers of the skin (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></italic></bold>)(<xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c105" ref-type="bibr">Saunders et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2021</xref>). To capture individual transcriptomes from a minimally biased sampling of skin cells, we performed single nucleus combinatorial indexing (sci)-RNA-seq (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2019</xref>) on nuclei from pooled, fresh-frozen whole skins at 9.6 mm standardized standard length [9.6 SSL (<xref rid="c84" ref-type="bibr">Parichy et al., 2009</xref>)], a key developmental stage of skin patterning and morphogenesis. In 9.2 SSL wild-type fish, all steps of scale morphogenesis are represented and a ‘primary’ pigment pattern is apparent with secondary pattern elements just beginning to form (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref></italic></bold>)(Aman et al, 2019; <xref rid="c84" ref-type="bibr">Parichy et al, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To better understand the contributions of individual cell types and key factors involved in the major skin patterning events at this stage, we included three additional backgrounds representing distinct developmental perturbations: <italic>eda</italic> mutants, hypoTH fish and <italic>bnc2</italic> mutants (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>). We processed all tissue in a single sci-RNA-seq experiment, barcoding each genotype by reverse transcription index during library preparation. In total, we recovered high quality transcriptomes from 144,466 individual nuclei with an average of 1,300 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and 720 genes detected per cell (∼60% duplication rate). Cell recovery, UMIs per cell, and numbers of genes detected were consistent across all sample groups (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref></italic></bold>). We removed likely multiplets (11%) using Scrublet (<xref rid="c129" ref-type="bibr">Wolock et al., 2019</xref>) and further processed the data and performed dimensionality reduction and clustering with Monocle3 (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). To characterize cell types and developmental trajectories, we focused on the wild-type data alone (35,114 cells). We classified cells into major cell types by assessing expression of published markers for different skin and skin-associated cell types (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic>Supplementary file 1—Table 1</italic></bold>; <bold><italic>Supplementary file 2—Table 2</italic></bold>). The majority of cells were from epidermal and dermal populations, where we recovered transcripts from relatively rare subsets, including the <italic>edn3b/bnc2</italic>+ hypodermal monolayer that forms the deep limit of the dermis and <italic>shha</italic>+ epidermal placode cells at the posterior scale margin (<xref rid="c110" ref-type="bibr">Sire and Akimenko, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Budi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c89" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Parichy, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2018</xref>). It is likely that additional cell-state heterogeneity exists within these major cell types beyond what we have annotated here (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic>Supplementary file 2—Table 5)</italic></bold>. As expected, based on our stage selection, we recovered dermal scale forming cells (SFCs) and their progenitors (pre-SFCs)(<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref></italic></bold>). We also recovered less abundant cell types including pigment cells, lateral line cells, goblet cells, ionocytes, glia and immune cells (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Decoupling of transcriptional dynamics and inferred lineage relationships during scale development and epidermal maturation</title>
<p>One goal of our study was to resolve transcriptional dynamics during differentiation of cell lineages that underlie skin patterning and morphogenesis. Adult zebrafish are adorned with a full coat of partially overlapping elasmoid scales, thin plates of calcified ECM that grow between the dermis and epidermis during post-embryonic development (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref></italic></bold>) (<xref rid="c107" ref-type="bibr">Sire et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2018</xref>). Scale development is associated with a population of dermal cells—referred to here as SFCs—that express genes encoding transcription factors, including <italic>sp7</italic> (also known as <italic>osterix, osx</italic>) and <italic>runx2a/b,</italic> that are necessary for differentiation of osteoblasts and odontoblasts (<xref rid="c107" ref-type="bibr">Sire et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">Komori, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c132" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Bae et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c100" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2018</xref>). Given the presence of all steps of scale development in our sampled timepoint, we captured single cells along the continuum of SFC differentiation from pre-SFCs to mature, matrix-secreting cells. Scale development also coincides with expansion of the three major epidermal cell types – periderm (also known as superficial epidermal cells), suprabasal cells, and basal cells – of which basal cells give rise to both of the other cell types (<xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al.. 2014</xref>). Our transcriptomic analyses confirmed that SFCs express <italic>sp7</italic> and suggested that they likely differentiate from <italic>runx2b</italic>+ progenitors (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic></bold>). Comparing <italic>runx2b</italic> and <italic>sp7</italic> mRNA distributions during scale development revealed that <italic>runx2b</italic> is consistently more broadly expressed than <italic>sp7,</italic> suggesting the existence of a restricted halo of SFC progenitors surrounding the growing scale (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,D</xref></italic></bold>). To confirm that these cells represent SFC progenitors, we exploited the differential localization of two transgenic reporters, cytosolic <italic>ET37</italic>:EGFP, labeling all dermal cells but having markedly reduced expression in SFCs, and photoconvertible, nuclear-localizing <italic>sp7</italic>:nEOS, restricted to differentiated SFCs (<xref rid="c87" ref-type="bibr">Parinov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2021</xref>): if peripheral <italic>runx2</italic>+ cells give rise to SFCs, initially cytosolic reporter expression should transition to nuclear reporter expression. We excluded previously differentiated <italic>sp7:nEOS</italic>+ SFCs from consideration by photoconversion (green → red), and looked for <italic>ET37:EGFP</italic>+ cells (green cytosol) newly expressing <italic>sp7:nEOS</italic> (green nucleus, without red). As expected, over three days of scale development, we observed numerous cells acquire nuclear nEOS expression as they were incorporated into growing scales, supporting the inference that peripheral, presumptively <italic>runx2b</italic>+ dermal cells differentiate as SFCs (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>Because the stage at which cells were collected contains SFCs at all steps of differentiation, and because the transcriptomes of SFCs displayed a continuous path between pre-SFC and differentiated SFC in UMAP space (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic></bold>), we anticipated that the cell fate transition during SFC differentiation would be captured by pseudotemporal ordering, which can reveal cell state transitions in asynchronous populations of differentiating cells (<xref rid="c121" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). To test this idea, we compared gene expression in UMAP space to spatial patterns of gene expression as revealed by <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization, using a combination of new staining and previously published staining (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c100" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2018</xref>). We predicted that cells having the intermediate state predicted by pseudotemporal ordering should be present circumferentially, between the halo of <italic>runx2</italic>+ dermal cells and differentiated <italic>sp7</italic>+ SFCs. Instead, these pseudotemporally intermediate cells were located at scale radii, a relatively late-appearing structure comprising cells unlikely to be in a transitional state of SFC differentiation (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref></italic></bold>). To resolve the true SFC differentiation trajectory, we fate-mapped individual SFCs <italic>in-vivo</italic> by photoconverting <italic>sp7</italic>:nEOS+ SFCs within specific scale regions and following them over several days (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></italic></bold>, <bold><italic><xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref></italic></bold>). These analyses showed that SFCs at the posterior margin are progressively displaced towards the scale focus, presumably by addition of newly differentiated SFCs from <italic>sp7</italic>-negative progenitors (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></italic></bold>, top). SFCs in the sub-marginal region contributed to elongated marginal cells, scale radii cells, and an SFC subset that rapidly displaced toward the scale focus (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></italic></bold>, middle). Lastly, cells at the focus in a nascent scale remained in the focus as the scale grew (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></italic></bold>, bottom). These results demonstrate that radii cells descend from marginal SFCs, consistent with previous live imaging results (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c100" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2018</xref>), confirming that SFCs do not pass through an intermediate state as scale radii cells during differentiation, which a facile interpretation of pseudotemporal ordering might suggest. Thus, although cell state transitions inferred from transcriptomes alone can suggest cell lineage relationships and cell states along a differentiation continuum, we find that the pseudotemporal ordering, while continuous from pre-SFC to differentiated SFC, did not faithfully represent the cell state path during SFC differentiation. Instead, the continuity of cell states revealed by pseudotemporal ordering could reflect continuous variation in other biological processes apart from differentiation, like states of the cell cycle or migration (Buettner et al, 2015; McFaline-Figueroa, et al. 2019). Given the mesenchymal appearance of pre-SFC dermal cells and the epithelial appearance of differentiated SFCs (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref></italic></bold>) (<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2021</xref>), we predicted that pseudotemporal order in this dataset might reflect differences in gene expression associated with these different cellular morphologies. To test this possibility, we constructed gene expression signatures for mesenchymal and epithelial states from the literature and mapped the ratio of epithelial-to-mesenchymal scores on cells in UMAP space, which revealed an overall correspondence of these scores with pseudotemporal order (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F,G</xref></italic></bold>). Finally, our observations also provided an opportunity to resolve a controversy as to whether differentiated SFCs are capable of proliferating or whether scale growth occurs exclusively by hypertrophic growth of individual cells (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki et al., 2018</xref>): both transcriptomic analyses and live imaging experiments showed that differentiated SFCs remain proliferative (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>In addition to SFC differentiation, we sought to understand the transitional dynamics of epidermal differentiation during post-embryonic skin maturation. During this stage of development, basal epidermal cells are the stem cell population that differentiate into both suprabasal and periderm cells, and each of the three major epidermal cell types are well represented in our dataset (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H,I</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref></italic></bold>)(<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Guzman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). While periderm cells at the sampled stage are likely of dual origin, representing a mixture of early embryonic and stem cell derived cells, suprabasal cells are entirely derived from basal cells (Kimmel et al., 1990; <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Guzman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Given the known lineage relationships, we predicted that the single cell transcriptome data would reveal a continuum of cell state transitions during the differentiation of both cell types. While the established cell type markers for basal cells and periderm cells, <italic>tp63</italic> and <italic>krt4</italic>, displayed a clear transition between basal cells (<italic>tp63</italic>+<italic>, krt4</italic>-<italic>)</italic>, suprabasal cells (<italic>tp63</italic>+, <italic>krt4</italic>+), and periderm (<italic>tp63</italic>-, <italic>krt4</italic>+), the trajectories were discontinuous in UMAP space (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I,J</xref></italic></bold>). These discontinuities were present in both global and tissue-specific UMAP projections and across a wide range of UMAP parameters (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref></italic></bold>). Moreover, the number of differentially expressed genes between each of the epidermal types was about twice as large as between cell clusters having continuous trajectories (basal cell vs. periderm, 7341 DEGs; basal cell vs. suprabasal, 4024 DEGs; pre-SFC vs. SFC, 2373 DEGs; all <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.01), suggesting that discontinuities among epidermal cell subtypes reflect abrupt transcriptional changes during differentiation, rather than artifacts of the dimensionality reduction itself. Together, our results highlight the importance of coupling true lineage information with well sampled, high-resolution single cell transcriptomes in order to understand complex transcriptional dynamics over the course of differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>A heterogenous population of epidermal and dermal cells contributes to scale plate formation</title>
<p>Zebrafish elasmoid scales represent one of several forms of calcified skin appendages that cover the bodies of most non-tetrapod fish species (hereafter referred to as ‘fish’). Calcified skin appendages are an ancient vertebrate trait with a robust fossil record, first appearing in the Ordovician 450 million years ago, prior to the appearance of paired fins, jaws and teeth (<xref rid="c114" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">Märss, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c108" ref-type="bibr">Sire et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Fraser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c122" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Janvier, 2015</xref>). These ancestral skin appendages were morphologically and compositionally similar to modern-day teeth, with a hypercalcified, enamel-like matrix capping collagen-rich calcified matrices resembling dentin, bone or both (<xref rid="c109" ref-type="bibr">Sire, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="c114" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">Märss, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c108" ref-type="bibr">Sire et al., 2009</xref>) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>). While certain extant non-teleost fishes, like sharks, bichir and gar, have scales that resemble skin appendages of ancient fishes and modern teeth, the flattened morphology and elastic flexibility of elasmoid scales typical of most extant fish is highly derived (<xref rid="c109" ref-type="bibr">Sire, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="c108" ref-type="bibr">Sire et al., 2009</xref>). Histological and ultrastructural studies have shown that the elasmoid scales of zebrafish and other teleosts are composed of weakly calcified collagenous matrix, known as elasmoidin, capped by a collagen-free, hypermineralized limiting layer that forms in close proximity to basal epidermal cells with an overtly secretory morphology (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>) (<xref rid="c109" ref-type="bibr">Sire, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="c112" ref-type="bibr">Sire et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="c95" ref-type="bibr">Quan et al., 2020</xref>). In vertebrate teeth and tooth-like scales of non-teleost fish, layers of calcified matrix are deposited by two cooperating cell types, mesenchymal cells of dermal or neural crest origin that form collagen-rich calcified matrix like dentin, bone or both, and overlying epithelial cells of epidermal or endodermal origin that produce hypermineralized matrices like enamel (<xref rid="c109" ref-type="bibr">Sire, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="c111" ref-type="bibr">Sire and Huysseune, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c81" ref-type="bibr">Oralová et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">Kawasaki et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Hypothesizing that epidermis of zebrafish retains this ancient enamel deposition function, we predicted that a subset of epidermal basal cells would express transcripts encoding enamel matrix proteins (EMPs). EMPs were originally discovered in human patients suffering from Amelogenesis Imperfecta, a congenital condition characterized by defective enamel formation (<xref rid="c113" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). EMPs are part of family of proteins know as secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins (SCPPs) that are critical for calcification of bone, dentin and enamel (<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">Kawasaki, 2009</xref>). The zebrafish genome harbors two previously identified EMP-gene orthologs, including orthologs of human Enamelin (encoded by <italic>enam</italic>) and Ameloblastin (encoded by <italic>ambn</italic>) in addition to fish-specific orthologs that likely originated by tandem duplication (<xref rid="c94" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Braasch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">Kawasaki et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore analyzed the distribution of SCPP-encoding transcripts, predicting that EMP-transcript expressing cells would be found among basal epidermal cells. Consistent with our prediction, we identified a transcriptionally distinct population of basal epidermal cells, separated from other basal epidermal cells in UMAP projections, that expressed EMP genes (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,C</xref></italic></bold>). Strikingly, transcripts of the conserved EMP gene <italic>ambn</italic> was found almost exclusively in this subpopulation of basal cells, which we refer to as EMP+ epidermal cells (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,C</xref></italic></bold>). A previous ultrastructure study revealed epidermal basal cells with a secretory morphology in contact with the calcified scale matrix (<xref rid="c107" ref-type="bibr">Sire et al., 1997</xref>). To test correspondence of that population with EMP+ epidermal cells identified in our transcriptomic data, we visualized <italic>ambn</italic> expression by <italic>in-situ</italic> mRNA hybridization, which revealed that EMP+ epidermal cells are positioned precisely where epidermal cells contact the scale matrix (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Although enamel-like capping matrix is common in phylogenetically diverse vertebrates (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>) (<xref rid="c108" ref-type="bibr">Sire et al., 2009</xref>), it is possible that epidermal expression of EMP transcripts evolved convergently in zebrafish. If epidermal EMP+ basal cells are homologous with mammalian ameloblasts, we reasoned that in addition to genes encoding matrix proteins, these cells should express transcription factors that regulate mammalian ameloblast differentiation. Indeed, we find that <italic>dlx3a</italic>, <italic>dlx4a</italic>, <italic>msx2a</italic> and <italic>runx2b</italic> are expressed in these cells (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></italic></bold>) (Pemberton et al., 2007; Debiais-Thibaud et al., 2011; <xref rid="c123" ref-type="bibr">Urzúa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Babajko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2018</xref>; Woodruff et al., 2022). Together, these results suggest that the enamel-like, hypermineralized limiting layer of the scale is produced by deeply conserved, ameloblast-like epidermal cells.</p>
<p>In teeth and tooth-like skin appendages, enamel-like matrix caps more collagen-rich calcified matrices such as dentin or bone that are deposited by condensed mesenchymal cells (<xref rid="c108" ref-type="bibr">Sire et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Fraser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c79" ref-type="bibr">Murcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Arola et al., 2018</xref>). Although dermal SFCs are frequently referred to as ‘osteoblasts’ due to their association with calcified matrices and their expression of conserved transcription factor genes <italic>sp7</italic> and <italic>runx2a/b</italic>, the elasmoidin matrix they deposit, characterized by weakly calcified, plywood-like layers of hydrated collagen fibrils, is materially distinct from bone or dentin (<xref rid="c108" ref-type="bibr">Sire et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c76" ref-type="bibr">Metz et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that SFCs would express a distinct complement of SCPP transcripts. To elucidate this repertoire and compare dermal SFCs with osteogenic cell types like osteoblasts, odontoblasts and ameloblasts, we assessed the expression SCPP transcripts. For these analyses, we subclustered the SFCs/pre-SFCs and identified five major cell states based on gene expression from sci-RNA-seq and <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G,H</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref></italic></bold>). Consistent with an overall similarity between osteoblasts and SFCs, we detected transcripts of Osteopontin (<italic>spp1</italic>) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,I</xref></italic></bold>) and Chondroadherin (<italic>chad</italic>) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,I</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref></italic></bold>), encoding bone matrix proteins, in addition to Secretory-calcium-binding Phosphoprotein 1 (<italic>scpp1),</italic> which is homologous to human Dentin-Matrix-Acidic Proteins that form a component of both bone and dentin (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,I</xref></italic></bold>) (<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">Larsson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="c98" ref-type="bibr">Raouf et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Hessle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c124" ref-type="bibr">Venkatesh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Braasch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">Kawasaki et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, we failed to detect robust expression of transcripts encoding bone matrix proteins Osteocrin (<italic>ostn</italic>) or Osteocalcin (Bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein, <italic>bglap</italic>) in SFCs (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></italic></bold>) (<xref rid="c118" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to a subset of bone-specific transcripts, SFCs also expressed EMP genes and genes encoding fish-specific SCPPs (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,I</xref>)</italic></bold>. Expression was spatially restricted among SFCs, with the bone-associated transcripts, <italic>spp1</italic> and <italic>chad</italic> primarily expressed in the scale focus and radii SFCs, while EMP genes were restricted to SFCs at the scale margin (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,G,H,I</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Scale elasmoidin is a flexible, collagenous ECM, material properties that are similar to cartilage (<xref rid="c95" ref-type="bibr">Quan et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore wondered whether dermal SFCs express matrix proteins associated with cartilage formation. Col10a1 and Col2a1 are major structural molecules in collagen, although <italic>col10a1</italic> transcription its expression has also been documented in osteoblasts (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c131" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">Kawasaki et al., 2021</xref>). The zebrafish genome harbors genes encoding two Col10a1 orthologs (<italic>col10a1a</italic> and <italic>col10a1b)</italic> and we found both transcripts in SFCs representing distinct steps of maturation, however, transcripts of Col2a1 genes (<italic>col2a1a</italic> and <italic>col2a1b</italic>) were not robustly detected in these cells (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,I</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F,I</xref></italic></bold>). Transcripts of genes encoding additional factors associated with mineralized matrix formation, such as Osteonectin (<italic>sparc</italic>), were expressed broadly in skin (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,H</xref></italic></bold>) raising the possibility of additional roles beyond assembly of calcified matrix (<xref rid="c102" ref-type="bibr">Rosset and Bradshaw, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these analyses revealed the presence of epidermal EMP expressing cells and support a hypothesis of ancient homology between ameloblast-like cells in fish skin and the mammalian dental lamina, and between the enamel-like materials that coat zebrafish scales and tetrapod teeth. Furthermore, our observations that dermal SFCs express a subset of genes associated with bone development, as well as genes encoding EMPs and cartilage proteins, suggest that the distinct properties of elasmoid matrix are due to a distinct complement of matrix proteins. While these conclusions are correlational, this work will facilitate functionally testing the role of candidate matrix proteins in the material properties of calcified matrices.</p>

<p>Eda-Edar-NF-κB signaling plays conserved roles in regulating the patterning and morphogenesis of vertebrate skin appendages (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Cui and Schlessinger, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">Lefebvre and Mikkola, 2014</xref>), whereas TH regulates multiple aspects of skin development and homeostasis (<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">Mancino et al., 2021</xref>). Both <italic>eda</italic> mutants and hypoTH fish completely lack scales at the stage sampled, allowing us to compare transcriptomic signatures and cell type complements associated with scale loss in these different backgrounds (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic></bold>). Analyses of cell type abundance revealed that both scale-free conditions were characterized by a complete lack of fully differentiated dermal SFCs (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref></italic></bold>). These analyses further showed that <italic>eda</italic> mutants—despite homozygosity for a presumptive null allele—retained a small subset of dermal pre-SFC progenitors, whereas hypoTH skins lacked pre-SFC entirely. We have previously shown that hypoTH fish lack superficial dermal cell types at the stage sampled for sequencing, though these cell types do appear later in development (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2021</xref>). To confirm the presence of residual, pre-SFC in <italic>eda</italic> mutants, we imaged live fish expressing <italic>ET37</italic>:<italic>EGFP</italic> (<xref rid="c87" ref-type="bibr">Parinov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, <italic>eda</italic> mutants exhibited a population of <italic>ET37</italic>:<italic>EGFP</italic>+ dermal cells—presumptive pre-SFC—beneath the epidermis that was not present in hypoTH fish (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C,D</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>In previous work, we found that Eda-Edar-NF-κB signals are transmitted from the dermis to epidermis during scale morphogenesis (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2018</xref>). The apparently monogamous receptor for Eda, encoded by <italic>edar</italic>, is expressed in the epidermis during scale morphogenesis. The signaling ligand, encoded by <italic>eda</italic>, has a dynamic expression pattern that shifts from broad expression in unspecified epidermis to localized expression in dermal papillae during scale morphogenesis. These expression dynamics are strikingly similar during mouse hair follicle and chicken feather patterning (<xref rid="c77" ref-type="bibr">Montonen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Headon and Overbeek, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Houghton et al., 2005</xref>). We confirmed that these expression domains were reflected in our sci-RNA-seq data, in which <italic>edar</italic> is detected primarily in basal epidermal cells, with most intense expression in the <italic>shha</italic>+ epidermal placode (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></italic></bold>)(<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>eda</italic> transcripts were detected at much lower levels and were much more dispersed across cell types than <italic>edar</italic> transcripts but were nevertheless enriched in pre-SFC as expected (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>Since Eda-Edar-NF-κB pathway activation occurs exclusively in epidermis but drives morphogenesis of dermal cells, we predicted the existence of an Eda-dependent signaling ligand expressed in basal epidermal cells that would complete a presumptive epithelial-mesenchymal signaling loop (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2018</xref>). We previously observed that global misexpression of an Fgf ligand rescued scale development in <italic>eda</italic> mutant fish, and that Edar expression in epidermal cells, but not dermal cells, was sufficient to drive scale formation (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2018</xref>). Those results suggested that Eda signaling drives SFC differentiation via epidermal expression of one or more Fgf ligands. Our transcriptomic analysis showed that, indeed, epidermal expression of Fgf ligands is Eda-dependent (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B,C</xref></italic></bold>). Among Fgf ligand transcripts detected in epidermis was that of <italic>fgf20a</italic>, which plays a conserved role in regulating dermal morphogenesis in amniote skin appendage development and has been implicated in scale development and regeneration in zebrafish (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">Huh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Daane et al., 2015</xref>). If Fgf20a functions downstream of epidermal Eda-Edar-NF-κB signaling, we predicted that experimental restoration of <italic>fgf20a</italic> expression in <italic>eda</italic> mutant skin should bypass the requirement for Eda in scale formation, thereby rescuing scales even in the absence of Eda function. Indeed, heatshock-driven expression in F0 mosaics stringently selected for basal epidermal expression of Fgf20a in the skin of Eda mutants led to localized rescue of scales where transgene expression was detectable (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></italic></bold>). Notably, <italic>fgf20a</italic> mutant zebrafish do not have a squamation phenotype unless present in an <italic>fgfr1a</italic> mutant background, suggesting functional redundancy among Fgf ligands (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Daane et al., 2015</xref>). Those results and our present findings together suggest that Eda-Edar-NF-κB signaling regulates SFC differentiation via multiple epidermal Fgf ligands, including Fgf20a.</p>
<p>Unlike Eda signaling, very little is known of potential TH targets in the skin. Therefore, we compared between wild-type and hypoTH backgrounds the expression of transcripts within each of 5 major cell types. This analysis revealed substantial differences in gene expression between backgrounds in dermal and epidermal cell types, and particularly in basal cells of the epidermis (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></italic></bold>). Given the absence of superficial pre-SFC in hypoTH skin (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B–D</xref></italic></bold>), we hypothesized that TH regulates the expression of cues in epidermal basal cells that recruit dermal cells to the most-superficial layer of the dermis, subjacent to the epidermis, prior to scale papilla formation (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2021</xref>). To test this idea we examined ligand genes with detectable expression across each of 7 major pathways between wild-type and hypoTH basal cells, which revealed markedly reduced expression for several non-FGF MAPK ligand genes, including PDGFα orthologs (<italic>pdgfaa</italic>, <italic>pdgfab)</italic> that are known in amniotes to regulate mesenchymal cell motility and proliferation (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-D</xref></italic></bold>) (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Karlsson et al., 1999</xref>). If PDGFα ligands are responsible for recruiting dermal cells similarly in zebrafish skin, then restoring expression of <italic>pdgfaa</italic> in basal cells of the epidermis in hypoTH fish should rescue the formation of superficial dermal cells in this background. When we forced expression of Pdgfaa in basal cells of epidermis by heatshock induction and stringent selection of basal epidermal expression in F0 mosaics, we found, as predicted, a recruitment of dermal cells in hypoTH skin, leading to a locally stratified dermis (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></italic></bold>) similar to that of the wild-type (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></italic></bold>). Early, heatshock-induced Pdgfaa expression also led to precocious dermal stratification in wild-type and <italic>eda</italic> mutant fish (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref></italic></bold>). Pdgfaa expression did not, however, rescue the onset of squamation in hypoTH fish, which begins at a larger size and only after about twice the time as in wild-type fish (14 SSL vs. 9 SSL, 40 vs. 21 days post-fertilization in our rearing conditions) (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2021</xref>). Nor did Pdgfaa lead to mis-patterned and dysmorphic scales in wild-type fish, or a rescue of squamation in <italic>eda</italic> mutants, as we observed for Fgf20a (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></italic></bold>). Together these observations suggest that Pdgfaa-dependent stratification of dermis and Fgf-dependent differentiation of SFC are functionally decoupled processes that occur sequentially during skin morphogenesis (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref></italic></bold>). Because Pdgfaa rescued dermis stratification, but not scale development in hypoTH skin, we predict that additional TH transcriptional targets regulate skin morphogenesis. Indeed, differential expression analyses suggested several excellent candidates for mediating additional signals from epidermal basal cells to pre-SFC (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>These observations from scaleless skins indicate that epidermal basal cells are critical targets for TH and Eda-Edar-NF-κB signals, and that epidermally expressed Pdgfaa and Fgf ligands link TH and Eda signaling to dermal cell recruitment and dermal papilla development, respectively (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></italic></bold>).

<title>Hypodermal contribution to the microenvironment of stripe-forming pigment cells</title>
<p>Zebrafish pigment patterning is a useful study system for elucidating principles that govern developmental patterning and post-embryonic developmental progression (<xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Parichy, 2019</xref>). The alternating dark stripes of melanophores with sparse blue-tinted iridophores and light interstripes of yellow-tinted iridophores with orange xanthophores form deep in the skin (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Hirata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">Gur et al., 2020</xref>), which remains remarkably transparent throughout the life of the animal (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref></italic></bold>). Although pigment cells are an integral part of the skin and comprise its major visual element, we know little about how these cells interact with other cell types in this microenvironment.</p>
<p>To better define how pigment cells are integrated with other skin cell types and identify tissue environmental factors that may influence pigment patterning, we included in our study the <italic>bonaparte</italic> mutant, homozygous for a presumptive loss of function mutation in <italic>basonuclin 2</italic> (<italic>bnc2</italic>) (<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2009</xref>)<italic>. bnc2</italic> mutants have a very sparse complement of pigment cells as adults owing to progressive pigment cell death during the larva-to-adult transition, with iridophores especially affected (<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c89" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Parichy, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>At the stage of tissue collection, fewer iridophores and melanophores were evident in <italic>bnc2</italic> mutants compared to wild-type controls, mirroring prior quantitative comparisons (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></italic></bold>). Previous analysis of genetic mosaics demonstrated that Bnc2 function is required in the hypodermis for survival and patterning of pigment cells (<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, we predicted that wild-type and <italic>bnc2</italic> mutant fish should have substantial differences in gene expression within the hypodermal cell population. Yet alignment of UMAP projections for wild-type and <italic>bnc2</italic> mutant cells revealed instead a profound deficiency of hypodermal cells themselves (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref></italic></bold>). We quantified the proportion of various dermal cell types and pigment cells relative to wild-type controls in our sci-RNA-Seq dataset and found marked deficits in hypodermal cells, as well as iridophores, melanophores, and xanthophores, whereas numbers of dermal mesenchyme cells were relatively unchanged between genotypes (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>Based on these findings, we predicted that hypodermis would be malformed or missing in live <italic>bnc2</italic> mutants. To test this prediction and validate inferences from the single cell transcriptome data, we imaged the dermis of live fish expressing <italic>ET37:EGFP</italic> (<xref rid="c87" ref-type="bibr">Parinov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2021</xref>). In wild-type controls, the hypodermis appeared as a thin, nearly confluent cell layer deep in the dermis, whereas in <italic>bnc2</italic> mutants no such layer was apparent; instead the deepest dermis appeared to contain only dermal mesenchyme (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref></italic></bold>). Consistent with the hypodermis having roles in supporting pigment cells, we observed iridophores, expressing <italic>pnp4a:palm-mCherry</italic> and melanophores, expressing <italic>tyrp1b:palm-mCherry</italic> in close proximity to <italic>ET37:EGFP</italic>+ hypodermal cells in wild-type skin (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref></italic></bold>) (<xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible that hypodermal cells physically persist in <italic>bnc2</italic> mutants but have sufficiently altered transcriptional profiles such that they no longer cluster together with wild-type hypodermal cells or express the <italic>ET37:EGFP</italic> transgene. Nevertheless, these analyses suggest that <italic>ET37:EGFP+</italic> hypodermal cells likely play a role in pigment pattern development.</p>
<p>Given the close contact of wild-type melanophores and iridophores with hypodermal cells, together with loss of hypodermis and pigment cells in <italic>bnc2</italic> mutant fish, we hypothesized that factors important for pigment cell development and pattern formation are provided particularly by hypodermal cells, as opposed to other non-pigment cells of the local tissue environment (i.e., non-hypodermal stromal cells, developing SFCs, or superficially located muscle progenitor cells, also present in our data set). To test this idea, we examined the expression of genes encoding signaling ligands and adhesion factors implicated previously in pigment pattern development.</p>
<p>These analyses revealed that hypodermal cells are likely to be an important driver of iridophore development as they were the principal cells to express <italic>endothelin 3b</italic> (<italic>edn3b</italic>) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref></italic></bold>), encoding a secreted protein that is processed to an active 21 amino acid peptide required by iridophores. Diminished expression of <italic>edn3b</italic> is associated with reduced numbers of iridophores and attenuated interstripes and stripes both in zebrafish mutants and in the naturally occurring pattern of the zebrafish relative, <italic>D. nigrofasciatus</italic> (<xref rid="c115" ref-type="bibr">Spiewak et al., 2018</xref>). Edn3 acts directly on iridophores but only indirectly on melanophores, through an interaction between these cells and Edn3-dependent iridophores (<xref rid="c85" ref-type="bibr">Parichy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">Krauss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c115" ref-type="bibr">Spiewak et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>More direct roles for hypodermal cells in regulating melanophore development were suggested by expression of other factors, including <italic>agouti signaling protein 1</italic> (<italic>asip1</italic>), which encodes a secreted protein that represses melanophore differentiation in ventral regions of the flank (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Cal et al., 2019</xref>), though our dataset does not allow us to segment cells spatially. Interestingly, <italic>kit ligand a</italic> (<italic>kitlga</italic>), encoding a melanogenic factor that promotes survival, migration, and differentiation, was expressed at only moderate levels by hypodermal cells at this stage, despite its broad expression in the much simpler skin of embryos and early larvae (<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">Hultman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Budi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Dooley et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, <italic>kitlga</italic> was expressed at higher levels by melanophores themselves, whereas <italic>junctional adhesion molecule 3b</italic> (<italic>jam3b</italic>), encoding a 2-Immunoglobulin like domain adhesion receptor, was expressed by both hypodermal cells and melanophores. Jam3b mediates homophilic and heterophilic adhesive interactions, and is required autonomously by melanophores for an adherent phenotype; a Jam3b fusion protein accumulates at sites of overlap between mature melanophores (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">Ebnet, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Eom et al., 2021</xref>). In the absence of Jam3b, melanophores tend to be hypopigmented, fail to acquire their mature, well-spread morphology and orderly arrangement, and many die. Together with prior studies, our observations suggest a model in which Jam3b facilitates interactions between immature melanophores and hypodermis, with subsequent Jam3b-mediated interactions between melanophores facilitating Kitlga-dependent maturation and survival (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref></italic></bold>). That a second factor likely repressive for melanogenesis, <italic>asip2b</italic>, was expressed by xanthophores further suggests a mechanism for preventing differentiation of new melanophores within the interstripe.</p>
<p>Our analyses point to a role for hypodermal cells in regulating xanthophore differentiation as well. Xanthophores require signaling through Colony stimulating factor-1 receptor-a (Csf1ra) for migration, survival and differentiation (<xref rid="c86" ref-type="bibr">Parichy and Turner, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c89" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Parichy, 2013</xref>). One source of Csf1 is iridophores, which express <italic>csf1a</italic> (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref></italic></bold>): in <italic>bnc2</italic> mutants xanthophores are tightly associated with residual iridophores. Nevertheless, xanthophores eventually cover the flank of <italic>bnc2</italic> mutants, as well as other iridophore-deficient mutants in which xanthophore development is delayed. This recovery presumably reflects expression of <italic>csf1b</italic>, encoding a ligand that is similarly potent to Csf1a in its ability to induce xanthophore differentiation, by a previously undefined population of cells in the skin (<xref rid="c89" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Parichy, 2013</xref>). Our sci-RNA-seq dataset shows hypodermal cells to be the presumptive major source of Csf1b, though its transcripts were detected at lower levels in other dermal mesenchyme, superficial pre-SFCs and other cell types as well (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F–H</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref></italic></bold>). To test requirements for Csf1 genes in adult pigmentation we generated alleles having premature termination codons. As late juveniles (∼16 SSL), fish homozygous for <italic>csf1a</italic> mutations had overtly normal pigment patterns on the trunk but less regular patterns of pigment cells on the fins as compared to wild-type (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref></italic></bold>). By contrast, fish homozygous for a <italic>csf1b</italic> mutation were deficient for pigmented xanthophores, evident particularly on the dorsum, which lacks <italic>csf1a</italic>-expressing iridophores in the hypodermis, though some xanthophores persisted along scale margins where a few iridophores occur (e.g., Supplementary Figure 4 of <xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">Gur et al., 2020</xref>). Fish doubly homozygous for <italic>csf1a</italic> and <italic>csf1b</italic> mutations lacked virtually all xanthophores, recapitulating the phenotype of <italic>csf1ra</italic> mutants. These observations support a model in which hypodermally derived Csf1b promotes xanthophore differentiation during normal development, and can substitute for iridophore-derived Csf1a in backgrounds deficient for iridophores; we presume that eventual recovery of xanthophores in <italic>bnc2</italic> mutants deficient for both iridophores and hypodermis reflects residual Csf1b availability from other dermal cell types.</p>
<p>Finally, genes that affect each of the major classes of pigment cell were expressed by hypodermal cells, yet <italic>bnc2</italic> mutants are particularly deficient for iridophores at early stages (<xref rid="c89" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Parichy, 2013</xref>). We therefore predicted that transcriptomic states of iridophores would be more severely affected by loss of <italic>bnc2</italic> than transcriptomic states of melanophores or xanthophores. Consistent with this idea and a greater impact of <italic>bnc2</italic> loss on iridophores than other pigment cells, we found more differentially expressed genes in iridophores than xanthophores or melanophores (∼1000 cells of each cell type) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref></italic></bold>). This disproportionality may be a consequence of the markedly fewer hypodermal cells and attendant loss of Edn3b or other iridogenic signals. Alternatively, <italic>bnc2</italic> may have more pronounced activities within iridophores, as these cells express <italic>bnc2</italic> and at levels greater than melanophores or xanthophores (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref></italic></bold>), in addition to its non-autonomous functions in pattern formation through the hypodermis (<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2009</xref>). Though further manipulative analyses will be needed to test these several interactions, our analyses of gene expression and cell-type abundance identify hypodermal cells as a key source of factors permissive, and possibly instructive, for adult interstripe and stripe development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Skin is a large, heterogenous and biomedically important organ and the skin of zebrafish is a useful system in which to elucidate mechanisms of skin patterning and morphogenesis. We have generated a minimally biased singe-cell resolution transcriptional atlas of zebrafish skin at a key stage during the larva-to-adult transition, during squamation and pigment patterning. These data include transcriptomes for all major epidermal and dermal skin cell types in addition to numerous skin-associated cell types including pigment cells.</p>
<p>Zebrafish skin is endowed with an array of elasmoid scales, thin plates of calcified extracellular material deposited in the skin from dermal papillae that aggregate at the interface of dermis and epidermis. Calcified skin appendages in extant fish are diverse, encompassing various and sundry spines, plates, odontodes and scales. These forms are composed of extracellular matrices that range from among the hardest material in biology to some of the most flexible (<xref rid="c111" ref-type="bibr">Sire and Huysseune, 2003</xref>). We systematically assessed the expression of genes encoding non-collagen calcified matrix proteins throughout the skin during squamation, leading to the discovery of a transcriptionally distinct population of basal epidermal cells that express EMP transcripts, likely corresponding to epidermal secretory cells proposed to participate in scale matrix formation based on ultrastructure (<xref rid="c107" ref-type="bibr">Sire et al., 1997</xref>). These cells also express <italic>dlx3a</italic>, <italic>dlx4a</italic>, <italic>runx2b</italic> and <italic>msx2a</italic> but not <italic>sp7</italic>, a transcription factor suite that is shared with ameloblasts that form tooth enamel. While these transcription factors are not exclusive to ameloblasts and have been reported in osteoblasts and odontoblasts, in addition to cell types that do not produce calcified matrix, such as neurons, their co-expression along with EMP-encoding transcripts in basal epidermal cells is consistent with a common origin of ameloblasts and the EMP+ epidermal cells reported here. One alternative hypothesis is that co-expression of these gene products arose convergently and can be explained by mechanistic linkages among them. Future work aimed at functionally dissecting the regulatory mechanisms that govern EMP gene expression in a variety of organisms may clarify these issues either by providing evidence of additional commonalities, supporting a shared ancestor, or by revealing diverse, lineage-specific regulatory architectures, supporting convergent evolution of superficial enamel deposition in teeth and fish skin appendages.</p>
<p>Additionally, the complement of genes encoding matrix proteins expressed by dermal SFC suggests that although these cells may share fundamental regulatory machinery with mammalian osteoblasts and odontoblasts, including regulation by Runx2 and Sp7 transcription factors, they likely produce a derived form of calcified matrix, fibrillary plate elasmoidin, which is distinct from bone or dentin. Independent patterning of epidermal EMP-expressing cells and dermal SFCs might underlie some of the morphological diversity among fish skin appendages. For example, it is possible that hard spines, as in pufferfish and armored catfish, are formed by patterned expression of epidermal EMP gene products. Manipulation of matrix protein expression in zebrafish SFC and EMP+ epidermal cells may provide a powerful new system to elucidate general mechanisms of biomineralization and genetic encoding of material properties that could, in turn, inform future research in clinical dentistry.</p>
<p>Scales develop from dermal papillae that form under the epidermis. The regulatory underpinnings of scale papillae patterning and morphogenesis depend on reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal signaling interactions, including contributions of Eda-A-Edar-NF-κB signaling, that are widely conserved across vertebrate skin appendages (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Cui and Schlessinger, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2018</xref>). Analysis of scale development therefore affords a relatively accessible approach to understanding epithelial mesenchymal signaling interactions that underlie dermal morphogenesis. To this end, we generated and analyzed single cell transcriptomes for two scaleless conditions, <italic>eda</italic> mutants and hypoTH fish (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>). Eda is a paracrine factor that binds receptors expressed in the epidermis and thyroid hormone is an endocrine factor with potential to regulate transcription in any cell (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Cui and Schlessinger, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Brent, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2018</xref>). Despite widely different spatial ranges over which signals are transmitted, our transcriptomic analysis suggests that both molecules regulate transcription of signaling ligands in basal epidermal cells that ultimately affect dermal morphogenesis. We further showed that Eda signaling indirectly regulates SFC differentiation by triggering expression of Fgf ligands. TH is implicated in human dermatopathies; myxedema, characterized by dry, waxy skin, is clinically synonymous with hypothyroidism (<xref rid="c103" ref-type="bibr">Safer, 2011</xref>). Yet we know remarkably little about cutaneous transcriptional targets of TH. Our analyses show that genes encoding PDGFα ligands are transcriptionally regulated by TH and can themselves regulate dermal-epidermal morphogenesis. This finding may be of relevance to understanding and potentially treating skin conditions associated with treatment-resistant TH insensitivity. Indeed, PDGFα and TH gain and loss of function studies in mouse yield similar hair cycle phenotypes (<xref rid="c104" ref-type="bibr">Safer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="c119" ref-type="bibr">Tomita et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Contreras-Jurado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">González et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The eponymous striped pattern of zebrafish arises from neural crest derived pigment cells that reside deep within the skin, beneath the concurrently forming scales (<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">Le Guellec et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Hirata et al., 2005</xref>), and depends on interactions among all three pigment cell types (<xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Parichy, 2019</xref>). Although much has been learned about stripe pattern formation from analyses of mutants lacking one or more pigment cell types, much less is known about how pigment cells integrate into the skin microenvironment. Analyses of genetic mosaics have hinted at an important role for skin cells (<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">Krauss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c88" ref-type="bibr">Patterson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Eskova et al., 2017</xref>); still, this aspect of pigment patterning remains largely unexplored empirically or computationally (<xref rid="c126" ref-type="bibr">Volkening and Sandstede, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c128" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe and Kondo, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c127" ref-type="bibr">Volkening and Sandstede, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c82" ref-type="bibr">Owen et al., 2020</xref>). Using single cell transcriptomics and live imaging of wild-type and <italic>bnc2</italic> mutant fish, we have identified a discrete population of dermal cells express genes that regulate differentiation and morphogenesis of pigment cells, including <italic>edn3b</italic>, which is required for iridophore population expansion.</p>
<p>Our analyses have focused on scales and pigmentation, however, zebrafish skin is a fruitful study system for many areas of biology including regeneration and wound healing (<xref rid="c101" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c78" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c92" ref-type="bibr">Pfalzgraff et al., 2018</xref>); innate immunity (<xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr">Lü et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c130" ref-type="bibr">Wurster et al., 2021</xref>), stem cell regulation (<xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Brock et al., 2019</xref>), sensory physiology and developmental neuroscience (<xref rid="c99" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c100" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c91" ref-type="bibr">Peloggia et al., 2021</xref>), and human disease modeling (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Feitosa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, considerable insight into general mechanisms of development can emerge from comparing developmental mechanisms across species or between organ system. We expect the transcriptomic data presented here will help in identifying useful markers for cross-species comparisons, enabling a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular bases of phenotypic evolution.</p>

<p>Differentially expressed genes were computed by fitting the size-factor normalized UMI counts for each gene from each individual nucleus with a generalized linear model using the “fit_models” function in monocle3. To fit the regression model for each background’s effect on each gene in each cell type, we first selected the pair-wise backgrounds and cells that were relevant for the model (i.e. Basal cells from wild-type and <italic>eda</italic>). Then we filtered for genes expressed in at least 10 cells, and used background as the model formula (model_formula_str = “∼genotype”) and extracted the coefficient table, p-values and multiple testing corrected q-values with the “coefficient_table” function. Genes were considered significantly background-dependent differentially expressed (DEGs) if their q-value was less than 0.05. For analysis of specific pathways, we used <italic>D. rerio</italic> gene-pathway associations from WikiPathways (<xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr">Martens et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All of the animals were handled according to approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol 4170 of the University of Virginia. For imaging and other procedures animals were anesthetized with MS222 or euthanized by overdose of MS222 and every effort was made to minimize suffering.</p>

<p>This study provides a clearly presented and thoughtfully analyzed single cell-resolution dataset of gene expression in wildtype and mutant zebrafish skin. These data are used by the authors to develop and test hypotheses about cell lineage relationships and signaling interactions between cell types in the skin, allowing them to identify roles for several signaling pathways and the hypodermis in scale and pigment cell development. These findings constitute a <bold>fundamental</bold> contribution to the field, and the rigor of the analyses make this manuscript <bold>compelling</bold>.</p>

<p>In their study, Aman et al. utilized single cell transcriptome analysis to investigate wild-type and mutant zebrafish skin tissues during the post-embryonic growth period. They identified new epidermal cell types, such as ameloblasts, and shed light on the effects of TH on skin morphogenesis. Additionally, they revealed the important role of the hypodermis in supporting pigment cells and adult stripe formation. Overall, I find their figures to be of high quality, their analyses to be appropriate and compelling, and their major claims to be well-supported by additional experiments. Therefore, this study will be an important contribution to the field of vertebrate skin research.</p>

<p>This work describes transcriptome profiling of dissected skin of zebrafish at post-embryonic stages, at a time when adult structures and patterns are forming. The authors have used the state-of-the-art combinatorial indexing RNA-seq approach to generate single cell (nucleus) resolution. The data appears robust and is coherent across the four different genotypes used by the authors.</p>
<p>The authors present the data in a logical and accessible manner, with appropriate reference to the anatomy. They include helpful images of the biology and schematics to illustrate their interpretations.</p>
<p>The datasets are then interrogated to define cell and signalling relationships between skin compartments in six diverse contexts. The hypotheses generated from the datasets are then tested experimentally. Overall, the experiments are appropriate and rigorously performed. They ask very interesting questions of interactions in the skin and identify novel and specific mechanisms. They validate these well.</p>
<p>The authors use their datasets to define lineage relationships in the dermal scales and also in the epidermis. They show that circumferential pre-scale forming cells are precursors of focal scale forming cells while there appeared a more discontinuous relationship between lineages in the epidermis.</p>
<p>The authors present transcriptome evidence for enamel deposition function in epidermal subdomains. This is convincingly confirmed with an ameloblastin in situ. They further demonstrate distinct expression of SCPP and collagen genes in the SFC regions.</p>
<p>The authors then demonstrate that Eda and TH signalling to the basal epidermal cells generates FGF and PDGF ligands to signal to surrounding mesenchyme, regulating SFC differentiation and dermal stratification respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, they exploit RNA-seq data performed in parallel in the bnc2 mutants to identify the hypodermal cells as critical regulators of pigment patterning and define the signalling systems used.</p>
<p>Whilst these six interactions in the skin are disparate, the stories are unified by use of the sci-RNA-seq data to define interactions. Overall, it's an assembly of work which identifies novel and interesting cell interactions and cross-talk mechanisms.</p>
<p>The paper provides robust evidence of cell interrelationships in the skin undergoing morphogenesis and will be a welcome dataset for the field.</p>

I think this comment on the absence of Col2 transcripts should be explicitly included in that paragraph as it is a reasonable and expected question given the cartilage angle the authors begin the paragraph with. Including this in no way weakens their point, rather adds clarity.</p>

<p>This version includes some modifications to fix typos and add a sentence in response to the concern above.</p>
