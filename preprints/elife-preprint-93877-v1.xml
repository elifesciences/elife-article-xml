<title>Abstract</title><p>Apicomplexan parasites balance proliferation, persistence, and spread in their metazoan hosts. AGC kinases, such as PKG, PKA, and the PDK1 ortholog SPARK, integrate environmental signals to toggle parasites between replicative and motile life stages. Recent studies have cataloged pathways downstream of apicomplexan PKG and PKA; however, less is known about the global integration of AGC kinase signaling cascades. Here, conditional genetics coupled to unbiased proteomics demonstrates that SPARK complexes with an elongin-like protein to regulate the stability of PKA and PKG in the model apicomplexan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. Defects attributed to SPARK depletion develop after PKG and PKA are down-regulated. Parasites lacking SPARK differentiate into the chronic form of infection, which may arise from reduced activity of a coccidian-specific PKA ortholog. This work delineates the signaling topology of AGC kinases that together control transitions within the asexual cycle of this important family of parasites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Apicomplexans parasitize a majority of warm-blooded species, including an estimated quarter of the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). Central to parasite success is the ability to transition between different life cycle stages to balance proliferation and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Lourido, 2019</xref>). The acute phase of infection by <italic>T. gondii,</italic> a model apicomplexan, induces the pathology of disease. Parasites invade host cells, establish an intracellular niche that subverts innate immune responses, replicate, and exit the host via lysis to establish new sites of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Blader et al., 2015</xref>). These pathogens transcend the inverted biomolecular gradients within and without the host cell in minutes. Such rapid changes in cellular state depend on signal transduction in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and related apicomplexans. Second messenger cascades within the parasite cytoplasm are especially well-suited to rapidly transduce and amplify signals from a changing environment. Accordingly, apicomplexans—and <italic>T. gondii</italic> in particular—have an expanded repertoire of second messenger signaling components, from kinases to cyclases and phosphodiesterases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Brown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pace et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The roles of second messenger kinases—collectively referred to as AGC kinases for the founding members protein kinases A, G, and C—in apicomplexan life cycles have been elaborated in candidate-by-candidate approaches. cGMP-dependent protein kinase (or protein kinase G, PKG) is necessary for the secretion of parasite-specific adhesins and perforins enabling efficient escape and invasion of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Brown et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Wiersma et al., 2004</xref>). In apicomplexan cells, PKG operates upstream of calcium release and thus potentiates an orthogonal second messenger signaling network. Consequently, PKG inhibitors have been pursued as anti-parasitic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Donald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Sidik et al., 2016b</xref>). Another cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase, PKA, similarly promotes parasite spread during infection; in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. merozoites, PKA function enables parasite invasion of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Flueck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Wilde et al., 2019</xref>), and in <italic>T. gondii</italic> balanced PKA C1 function is required to ensure that parasites do not exit the host cell prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Uboldi et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>T. gondii</italic> has an additional ortholog of the PKA catalytic subunit, PKA C3, which maintains parasites in the acute phase of the infection and reduces conversion to a slowly proliferating, chronic infection termed the bradyzoite stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Several recent studies have sought to characterize the downstream targets of second messenger kinases in apicomplexans, including PKA, PKG, and calcium-dependent protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Balestra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brochet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Herneisen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Nofal et al., 2022</xref>). The second messenger networks in these parasites are intricately interwoven, with documented crosstalk between parasite cAMP, cGMP, and calcium signaling cascades. Comparatively little work has addressed upstream signal integration in apicomplexans. In metazoans, growth factor kinases such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) prime numerous AGC kinases for further second messenger-based activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mora et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We recently identified the <italic>S</italic>tore <italic>P</italic>otentiating/<italic>A</italic>ctivating <italic>R</italic>egulatory <italic>K</italic>inase (SPARK), an apicomplexan ortholog of metazoan PDK1, as a fitness-conferring candidate in pooled screens of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> kinome. Parasites depleted of SPARK for multiple replication cycles failed to enter and exit host cells upon stimulation with zaprinast, a chemical that elevates cGMP in parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). In a concurrent study, chemical mutagenesis implicated the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> ortholog of SPARK in invasion and proliferation through the regulation of the PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hitz et al., 2021</xref>). Although parasites with disrupted SPARK alleles were characterized phenotypically, evidence for the PDK1 activity of SPARK was indirect. Here, we map the topology of the signaling network regulated by SPARK in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. SPARK complexes with an elongin-like protein we name SPARKEL. Phenotypic and proteomic experiments show that SPARK dysregulation lessens PKA C1, PKG, and PKA C3 function. Phenotypes attributed to SPARK depletion—reduced invasion, host cell lysis, calcium signaling, and elevated differentiation—can be explained by the attenuated activities of SPARK’s client kinases. The proper functioning of SPARK thus ensures that <italic>T. gondii</italic> progresses through the acute stage of its infection cycle.</p>

<title>SPARK complexes with an elongin-like protein, SPARKEL</title>
<p>To identify proteins interacting with SPARK, we immunopurified the mNG epitope of the previously described SPARK-mNG-AID strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>) with anti-mNG nanobodies and quantified protein abundance using label-free quantitative proteomics (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary File 1</bold>). The immunoprecipitation (IP) successfully enriched SPARK as well as a hypothetical protein, TGGT1_291010. IPs with lysates of parasites expressing SPARK-mNG lacking AID demonstrated that the interaction was not due to the presence of the degron; TGGT1_291010 was once again highly enriched (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>), along with a putative AGC kinase (TGGT1_205550). The AGC kinase is restricted to coccidians but is dispensable during acute <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Sidik et al., 2016a</xref>); we therefore focused our efforts on the hypothetical protein, which contributes to parasite fitness.</p>

<p>TGGT1_291010 is a 23 kDa protein with a C-terminal SKP1/BTB/POZ domain (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). This domain shares homology with that seen in metazoan Elongin C. For this reason, we named the gene TGGT1_291010 “SPARK Elongin-Like protein” (SPARKEL, <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). SPARKEL homologs are found in the free-living alveolates <italic>Vitrella brassicaformis</italic> and <italic>Chromera velia</italic> but are absent in Aconoidasida (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>), suggesting that the gene was present in the ancestor of apicomplexans but was selectively lost in some lineages.</p>

<p>Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of SPARKEL enriched SPARK (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary File 1</bold>) and several putative components of daughter cell replication, including TGGT1_212770 (Dos Santos Pacheco et al., 2021), BCC10, and EFPP/BCC5. To confirm that SPARKEL and SPARK interact <italic>in situ</italic>, we introduced a C-terminal TurboID fusion at the SPARKEL endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). These transgenic parasites were treated with biotin while intracellular, and biotinylated proteins were enriched from lysates via streptavidin precipitation. As a control, we conducted a parallel experiment with transgenic parasites expressing TurboID fused to a cytosolic mNG fluorophore. SPARK and the AGC kinase TGGT1_205550 were highly enriched in the SPARKEL proximity-labeling experiment (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary File 2</bold>). A proximity labeling experiment with parasites expressing TurboID at the N terminus of SPARKEL similarly enriched SPARK and TGGT1_205550 (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary File 2</bold>). Thus, the interactions between SPARK, SPARKEL, and TGGT1_205550 were consistently observed across a variety of approaches.</p>
<p>Endogenous tagging of SPARK and SPARKEL in the same parasite strain revealed punctate cytosolic staining for each protein (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>); however, the low expression level of SPARKEL precluded robust colocalization. Nevertheless, strong mass spectrometry evidence for the physical interaction between SPARK and SPARKEL motivated further analysis of their functional relationship.</p>

<title>SPARK and SPARKEL depletion phenocopies at multiple steps in the lytic cycle</title>
<p>To determine the regulatory interaction between SPARK and SPARKEL, we first generated a SPARKEL conditional knockdown allele by inserting V5, HaloTag, mini auxin-inducible degron (mAID), and Ty epitopes at the endogenous SPARKEL C terminus. In this strain, we tagged SPARK with a C-terminal V5-mCherry-HA. Parasites treated with IAA to deplete SPARKEL failed to form plaques in host cell monolayers (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). As indicated by immunoblot, IAA treatment led to a reduction in detectable SPARKEL signal within one hour, as well as co-depletion of SPARK on a similar time scale (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). We next generated a strain expressing SPARK-V5-mAID-HA. Similarly, SPARK levels were reduced within one hour of IAA addition (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), as reported for a similar strain previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). In this genetic background, we tagged SPARKEL endogenously with a C-terminal V5-mNG-Ty. IAA treatment reduced SPARK levels and led to a reduction in SPARKEL abundance (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Together, these results suggest that the AID system leads to co-depletion of SPARK and SPARKEL.</p>

<p>To assess the impact of complex knockdown on parasite replication and transitions between intracellular and extracellular environments, we treated SPARKEL-AID and SPARK-AID parasites with IAA and performed replication, invasion, and egress assays. SPARKEL-AID parasites exhibited normal replication kinetics after 24h of IAA treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). Invasion and egress efficiency of the AID- tagged strains were reduced after parasites were treated with IAA for 24 hours (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref></bold>), as previously reported for SPARK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). Intracellular calcium measurements of GCaMP- expressing parasites revealed a similar trend, with SPARKEL- and SPARK-depleted cells exhibiting reduced calcium mobilization after 24 hours of IAA and treatment when stimulated with zaprinast, a compound that stimulates calcium release from parasite intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Sidik et al., 2016b</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G, 2H</xref></bold>, and <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>SPARK was previously identified in a genetic screen that distinguished acute and delayed death phenotypes in a pooled population of parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). As parasites with conditional SPARK alleles were assessed only in the context of delayed death phenotypes—<italic>i.e</italic>. after several replication cycles with IAA treatment—we characterized the ability of SPARK- and SPARKEL-AID parasites to invade and egress after 3 hours of IAA, which is shorter than the <italic>T. gondii</italic> cell cycle. In marked contrast to the 24 hour treatment regime, SPARKEL- and SPARK-AID parasites exhibited no deficiencies in their ability to invade, egress, or mobilize calcium after 3 hours of depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E– J</xref></bold>). Thus, in all measured assays, mutants lacking SPARK and SPARKEL are phenotypically identical, likely due to reciprocal co-depletion, but such phenotypes develop over time.</p>

<p>To determine the critical window of SPARK and SPARKEL function, we performed quantitative proteomics with tandem mass tag multiplexing that included samples with 0, 3, 8, and 24 hours of SPARK or SPARKEL depletion. The experiments included internal TIR1 parental strain controls to account for basal downregulation arising from the degron (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). We detected 3,333 and 3,880 proteins with quantification values in the SPARK and SPARKEL depletion time courses, respectively (<bold>Supplementary File 3</bold>). PKA C1, PKA R, and PKG protein abundances only began to drop after 8 hours of IAA treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). Globally, these kinase subunits were the most down-regulated proteins following 24 hours of either SPARK or SPARKEL depletion (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Bradyzoite proteins up-regulated upon SPARK depletion primarily increased between 8 and 24 hours of IAA treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>); the same proteins were initially down-regulated in SPARKEL-AID parasites relative to the parental strain and increased most in abundance before 24 hours of IAA treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). Thus, depletion of the SPARK-SPARKEL complex consistently leads to up-regulation of proteins associated with the bradyzoite stage of development, as well as down-regulation of PKG and the PKA C1 complex.</p>

<title>A depletion phosphoproteome implicates SPARK in the signaling, gene regulation, and metabolic states of the lytic cycle</title>
<p>To determine SPARK-dependent phosphoregulation, we enriched and analyzed phosphopeptides from the depletion proteome. We identified 18,518 phosphopeptides with quantification values, of which 8,867 were quantified with more than one peptide sequence match (PSM). Principal component analysis (PCA) separated the SPARK-AID samples treated for 24 h with IAA from all other samples, while closely clustering biological replicates (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Despite the low abundance of SPARK and SPARKEL, individual phosphopeptides were detected for each protein. Likely due to basal degradation, the abundance of the SPARK peptide was ten-fold lower in SPARK-AID samples compared to the TIR1 control such that further depletion could not be measured (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3— figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). The SPARKEL peptide abundance was also reduced relative to the TIR1 control sample; however, it decreased further between 3 and 8 hours of IAA treatment (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Because no other SPARKEL peptides were detected, it is not possible to determine whether this decrease is phosphosite-specific or due to a general decrease in SPARKEL protein abundance.</p>
<p>SPARK-regulated phosphopeptides may manifest in a strain-dependent or IAA-dependent manner. To account for basal downregulation, we ranked peptides by their log<sub>2</sub>-ratios of altered abundances in the SPARK-AID strain relative to the TIR1 parental strain (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). When a cutoff of 3.5 modified Z- scores was used, 91 peptides (44 with &gt;1 PSMs) and 69 peptides (19 with &gt;1 PSMs) were down- or up-regulated, respectively. The aforementioned phosphosite belonging to SPARK was the most down-regulated peptide by this metric. A phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinase (PI3,4K) was also strongly down-regulated (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>); however, the protein abundance of this enzyme was not quantified. To identify peptides most altered by IAA treatment, and hence SPARK depletion, we summed and ranked peptides by log<sub>2</sub>-ratios of abundances in the SPARK-AID strain relative to the untreated samples (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>). By this metric, 138 peptides (51 with &gt;1 PSMs) and 93 peptides (36 with &gt;1 PSMs) were down- or up-regulated by more than 3.5 modified Z-scores, respectively. Phosphoproteins belonging to this category are discussed in greater depth below.</p>
<p>To uncover the molecular pathways regulated by SPARK, we performed enrichment analysis of the peptides exhibiting the highest degree of altered abundance upon SPARK depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref></bold>). Changes in SPARK function altered PTM cascades both directly and indirectly. SPARK depletion reduced the abundance of phosphopeptides belonging to cyclic nucleotide-regulated kinases, which was in part driven by a reduction in kinase abundance. SPARK depletion also coincided with a reduction in phosphosites on several phosphatases (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>), including BCC6, PPM1, and an uncharacterized dual-specificity phosphatase. By contrast, phosphorylation of other kinases and phosphatases increased upon SPARK depletion, which may arise as an indirect consequence of SPARK function. Upregulated phosphosites were found on pyruvate dehydrogenase and STE kinase, CDPK3, cyclin2-related protein, and the kinases TGGT1_204280 and TGGT1_239885; as well as the protein phosphatases PPM2B, calcineurin, and EFPP. Phosphosites belonging to proteins involved in ubiquitin transfer and hydrolysis also increased in abundance upon SPARK depletion. Examples of this class included UBP1, USP39, an RBR E3 ligase, CCR4-NOT subunit, and UBR box E3 ligase. To a lesser degree, phosphosites on ubiquitin ligases were also down-regulated following SPARK depletion—for example, a HECT E3 and putative E2 enzyme. Thus, SPARK function has large implications for PTM cascades.</p>
<p>Additional functional categories enriched for SPARK-dependent regulation included nucleic acid– binding proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). A number of down-regulated phosphosites belong to proteins involved in DNA accessibility and transcription—for example, TFIIS, SET1, NOC3p, and <italic>Tg</italic>SRCAP. RNA modification enzymes also exhibited phosphoregulation, such as two PUS proteins, PRP8, SLU7, a FHA protein, three KH proteins, and a DCP2 homolog. Other regulated phosphoproteins may function in mRNA cap or untranslated region (UTR) binding, such as <italic>Tg</italic>PUF1, a MIF4G protein, CBP80, eIF3, and GCN1. Some of these proteins have been linked to expression changes during stage conversion, with PUF1 and SRCAP levels having been noted to increase during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Joyce et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; Sullivan et al., 2003). Moreover, CBP80, eIF3, and the KH protein TGGT1_216670 co-purified with the Alba complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Gissot et al., 2013</xref>), which is necessary for bradyzoite differentiation. Regulation of these proteins thus may be linked to the elevated expression of bradyzoite-stage proteins upon SPARK depletion.</p>
<p>Several putative transporters also exhibited decreased phospho-abundance upon SPARK knockdown (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref></bold>). Some of these phosphoproteins channel inorganic cations, such as <italic>Tg</italic>ZnT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chasen et al., 2019</xref>). Others likely transport small organic molecules—for example, a nucleoside and two ABC transporters. In aggregate, these analyses implicate SPARK function in signaling, gene regulation, and metabolic exchange.</p>

<title>Clustering of phosphopeptide kinetics identifies seven response signatures</title>
<p>Mammalian PDK1 phosphorylates numerous AGC kinases at activation loop threonines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mora et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Pearce et al., 2010</xref>), as well as non-kinase substrates. We reasoned that SPARK-dependent phosphopeptides depleted within 3 hours of IAA treatment may represent sites constitutively regulated by the kinase. By contrast, phosphosites down-regulated only after 8 hours of SPARK depletion—in excess of the length of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> cell cycle—may represent newly synthesized proteins dependent on SPARK for activation. We sought to resolve the phosphoproteome into kinetically distinct clusters. Gaussian mixture-model algorithms heuristically clustered peptides identified by more than one PSM into seven classes on the basis of their response signatures following SPARK depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref></bold>). Two phosphopeptides in Cluster 1 were distinguished by their rapid and sustained depletion kinetics and corresponded to CBP80 and eIF3, both of which function in mRNA and translational regulation. The second cluster of phosphopeptides was largely down-regulated by 3 hours of IAA treatment and lacked dynamics following this window. PKA and PKG phosphopeptides belonged to Cluster 3, which decreased only after 8 hours of IAA treatment. The final cluster of depleted phosphopeptides, Cluster 4, only exhibits down-regulation at 8h of IAA treatment and may reflect phosphoregulation specific to the cell cycle.</p>
<p>Up-regulated phosphopeptides mirrored the dynamics of the down-regulated clusters. Cluster 5 phosphopeptides were elevated within 3 hours of IAA treatment and continued to increase thereafter. Cluster 6 was up-regulated by 3 hours of IAA treatment and lacked dynamics following this window. Cluster 7 increased gradually and predominantly after 8 hours of IAA treatment. Upregulated phosphosites may arise from a number of mechanisms following SPARK depletion. For example, SPARK activity may inhibit downstream kinases or activate downstream phosphatases; sterically block access of serines/threonines to other enzymes; or give rise to crosstalk between PTMs. Approaches that take into account subcellular proximity were required to distinguish direct substrates from pathways downstream of SPARK function.</p>

<title>Proximity labeling identifies putative SPARK targets <italic>in situ</italic></title>
<p>To gain insight into proximal SPARK interactors in intracellular parasites, we tagged the endogenous C terminus of SPARK with a TurboID domain and carried out proximity labeling experiments, as previously described for SPARKEL. We observed overlap in the phosphoproteomics and proximity labeling experiments. PKG was enriched (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref></bold>), while PKA C1 and PI4P5K only narrowly missed our cutoffs. A putative HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase with two phosphosites down-regulated in the SPARK- dependent phosphoproteome was a candidate interactor. We also detected enrichment of PKA C3. PKA C3 is a coccidian-specific ortholog of the apicomplexan PKA catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>); however, no PKA C3 peptides were quantified in our depletion phosphoproteome experiments, likely due to the low abundance of the protein. These integrated proteomics approaches hint that the phenotypes associated with SPARK depletion may arise from the altered activity of AGC kinases regulated by SPARK.</p>

<title>SPARK functionally interacts with PKA and PKG</title>
<p>Our proteomic data suggest SPARK controls the lytic cycle via activation of PKA C1 and PKG. SPARK depletion reduced levels of PKA C1 T190—which corresponds to the kinase activation loop—more rapidly than the corresponding protein levels (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). Similarly, SPARK depletion triggered the down-regulation of several phosphosites residing in the N terminus of PKA R (e.g. S17, S27, and S94) more robustly than the changes in protein levels (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). To confirm the depletion kinetics of PKA, we tagged the kinase subunits with fluorophores in the SPARK-AID parasite strain (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). Prolonged SPARK depletion (24 hours) reduced PKA C1 and PKA R immunofluorescence signals in intracellular parasites (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>). To monitor kinase levels kinetically, we performed flow cytometry at several time points following the addition of IAA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). PKA C1 and PKA R fluorophore intensity decreased predominantly after 8 hours of IAA treatment, consistent with proteomic results. In parallel experiments, we tagged PKA C1 and PKA R in the SPARKEL-AID strain, revealing a comparable loss of the two markers following SPARKEL depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We considered the possibility that the SPARK depletion phosphoproteome represents a convolution of phosphoproteomes arising from broader AGC kinase down-regulation. We systematically tested this possibility by generating phosphoproteomes of parasites depleted of PKA R and PKG (<bold>Supplementary File 4</bold>). As association with PKA R inhibits PKA C1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>), we reasoned that phosphosites up-regulated after a short window of PKA R depletion represent candidate PKA C1 targets. Similarly, phosphosites down-regulated after PKG depletion represent candidate PKG substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Peptides above two modified Z-scores were considered candidate targets of each kinase.</p>
<p>Compared to the bulk phosphoproteome, the PKA C1-dependent phosphopeptides significantly decreased in abundance between 8 and 24 hours of SPARK depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>). When we applied the same analysis to a similarly acquired PP1-dependent phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Herneisen et al., 2022</xref>), we found no significant relationship to the SPARK phosphoproteome (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), suggesting that the association with PKA C1 is specific. Several of the overlapping SPARK and PKA C1– dependent phosphoproteins localized to the parasite periphery and apex (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref></bold>), for example, IMC25, AC13, CIP1, CIP2, and AC3. Others are putatively involved in RNA-binding functions, such as eIF4E and two KH proteins, including a component of the METTL3/METTL14 core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Farhat et al., 2021</xref>). We also observed regulation of phosphoproteins involved in ubiquitin transfer, including the aforementioned E2 and HECT E3 proteins (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Regulation of these proteins may account for both the kinetic- and replicative-phase phenotypes attributed to perturbed PKA C1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Uboldi et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We carried out related experiments to validate that SPARK regulates PKG function. SPARK depletion reduced levels of several PKG phosphopeptides more rapidly than the corresponding protein levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). Notably, T838 corresponds to the PKG activation loop. Attempts to tag PKG with a fluorophore in a functional SPARK-AID background were unsuccessful. Global genetic screens have indicated that parasites with hypomorphic PKG—as can arise through endogenous tagging—are rapidly outcompeted by wildtype parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we instead relied on chemical-genetic interactions to validate the relationship between PKG and SPARK. We reasoned that parasites with down-regulated PKG activity might be sensitized to the specific PKG inhibitor Compound 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Donald et al., 2002</xref>). Previous studies had shown that SPARK was dispensable for A23187- induced egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>); however, PKG function is required for ionophore-induced egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>). We performed egress assays using parasites depleted of SPARK for 24 hours and treated with different concentrations of Compound 1. As anticipated, SPARK depletion sensitized parasites to A23187-induced egress inhibition with Compound 1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B–C</xref></bold>), suggesting that PKG activity is decreased in the absence of SPARK.</p>

<p>As with PKA, we quantified the behavior of putative PKG substrates in the SPARK-AID phosphoproteome. Compared to the bulk phosphoproteome, the PKG-dependent phosphopeptides significantly decreased in abundance between 8 and 24 hours of SPARK depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). Several overlapping SPARK and PKG-dependent phosphoproteins localized to the parasite periphery, including an MFS transporter, <italic>Tg</italic>A1, MyoG, IMC18, IMC28, and IMC41. Other PKG/SPARK-dependent sites were found in the apical proteins AAP3, AC5/TLAP3, AC13, and SPM1; while several other proteins localized to the ER, including two TB2/DP1, HVA22 family proteins, a TPR protein, and an ABC transporter (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). Others function in the secretory or protein trafficking pathways, such as Sec7, COG6, <italic>Tg</italic>TBC10, and <italic>Tg</italic>DHHC1. We also observed down-regulation of phosphosites belonging to proteins involved in ubiquitin transfer, such as an E2 enzyme and a ubiquitin family protein with a C-terminal extension.

<title>Depletion of SPARK, SPARKEL, or PKA C3 promotes chronic differentiation</title>
<p>Several pieces of evidence suggested that SPARK and SPARKEL depletion may prompt differentiation from the tachyzoite to bradyzoite state through dysregulation of another AGC kinase, PKA C3. First, down-regulation of SPARK and SPARKEL coincided with up-regulation of bradyzoite markers (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref></bold>). Second, SPARK proximity labeling resulted in enrichment of PKA C3 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref></bold>)—a negative regulator of the bradyzoite stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>) and, to date, the only AGC kinase characterized with a function in differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Augusto et al., 2020</xref>). Prolonged SPARK and SPARKEL depletion indeed elevated differentiation under normal culture conditions, as measured by staining of the cyst walls with dolichos binding lectin, a characteristic of chronic-stage bradyzoite vacuoles (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A–B</xref></bold>). N-terminal tagging of SPARKEL with AID similarly elevated differentiation upon IAA treatment (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Alkaline media in combination with serum starvation and low carbon dioxide is commonly used to elevate bradyzoite transformation in cell culture, and SPARK and SPARKEL down-regulation enhanced differentiation under such conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To dissect the hypothesized PKA C3–dependent arm of SPARK regulation, we altered the PKA C3 genomic locus with a V5-mAID-mNG-Ty tagging payload. Addition of auxin to the culture medium resulted in down-regulation of PKA C3 levels to below the detection limit within one hour (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C– D</xref></bold>). PKA C3 exhibited low expression levels in cytoplasmic puncta (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>). We confirmed that prolonged PKA C3 depletion led to elevated differentiation rates under normal and alkaline-stress culture conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A–B</xref></bold>) and observed that the effect was similar to SPARK or SPARKEL knock-down. Given that SPARK also regulates PKG and PKA C1, we considered the possibility that differentiation may be linked to a block in motility. However, the inability to egress is not sufficient for transformation, as conditional knockdown of PKG or CDPK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Shortt et al., 2022</xref>) failed to significantly enhance the frequency of differentiation markers (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A–B</xref></bold>). We did not assess differentiation in PKA C1 knockdown parasites, as these mutants spontaneously egress from host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Uboldi et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The RH strain in which we generated mutants is reported to be refractory to differentiation into the bradyzoite form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dubey et al., 1999</xref>), like due to defects downstream of the pathways that lead to the initial synthesis of the cyst wall. We generated SPARKEL- and PKA C3-AID strains in the ME49 background (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref></bold>), which readily undergoes differentiation in tissue culture and mice, and confirmed that depletion prompts spontaneous differentiation in tissue culture (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E–F</xref></bold>). We did not assess alkaline-induced differentiation, as this stress treatment results in near-complete differentiation in the ME49 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>), and thus does not provide a differential for mutants that enhance differentiation.</p>
<p>To assess whether differentiation in the RH-type strain is dependent on the master regulator of differentiation, BFD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>), we knocked out <italic>BFD1</italic> CDS with a sortable dTomato cassette in the SPARK- and PKA C3-AID strains (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). The resulting Δ<italic>bfd1</italic> mutants failed to undergo differentiation as measured by cyst wall staining (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G–H</xref></bold>). We additionally profiled transcriptomic remodeling in PKA C3-AID parasites that had been depleted of the kinase for 24 hours and compared these changes to the chronic-stage transcriptome of parasites overexpressing BFD1 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref></bold> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>)). We observed up-regulation of several chronic-stage proteins upon PKA C3 depletion, including the bradyzoite antigen BAG1, CST1, CST10, MIC13; and <italic>Tg</italic>SPT2, which functions in ceramide synthesis and was recently reported to exhibit BFD2- dependent abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Licon et al., 2023</xref>). PKA C3 mRNA abundance was down-regulated, suggesting that the tagging payload may alter steady-state transcript levels. Together, these results suggest that the bradyzoite stage conversion induced by knockdown of PKA C3 and SPARK proceeds through the canonical transcriptional pathway.</p>

<title>PKA C3 interacts with the SPARK complex</title>
<p>Several AGC kinases, including PKA C3, share the activation loop motif TLC/VGTxxY, which displayed SPARK-dependent phosphorylation in PKA C1 and PKG. PKA C3 was not detected in our SPARK depletion proteomics experiments (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>).

<title>SPARK down-regulation does not reduce PKA C3 protein levels</title>
<p>To determine whether SPARK activity affects PKA C3 abundance, as for PKA C1 and PKG, we tagged the endogenous PKA C3 C terminus with an mNG fluorophore in the SPARK-AID background. After 24 hours of IAA treatment, PKA C3 levels were unaltered or slightly elevated, as measured by immunoblot (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B–C</xref></bold>). Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry measuring mNG intensity after 0, 3, 8, and 24 hours of IAA treatment revealed a trend towards increasing PKA C3 abundance, although this difference was not significant (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D–F</xref></bold>). Thus, unlike PKA C1, PKA C3 does not exhibit down-regulation following SPARK depletion. We considered the possibility that SPARK function could instead alter PKA C3 activity levels.</p>

<title>The PKA C3 phosphoproteome identifies candidates regulating the transition to the bradyzoite state</title>
<p>To pursue the functional consequences of PKA C3 inhibition, we performed a depletion phosphoproteomics time course experiment with the PKA C3-AID strain following 1, 3, 8, and 24 hours of IAA treatment. PKA C3-dependent phosphopeptides were identified as for the SPARK depletion proteome (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref></bold>). The resulting proteome identified 4,792 proteins and 12,721 phosphopeptides, of which 9,576 were quantified with more than one PSM. PCA separated the 24 hour IAA samples from all others (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Similar to the SPARK depletion proteome, several of the up-regulated proteins were reported to be transcriptional signatures of the bradyzoite stage, including BRP1, TGGT1_208740, two secreted cAMP-dependent protein kinases, and BFD2 (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To identify peptides most altered by IAA treatment, we summed and ranked peptides by log<sub>2</sub>-ratios of abundances in the PKA C3-AID strain relative to the untreated (0 h) samples (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref></bold>). By this metric, 129 peptides (94 with &gt;1 PSMs) and 49 peptides (31 with &gt;1 PSMs) were down- or up-regulated by more than 3.5 in the modified Z-scores, respectively. Gaussian mixture-model algorithms heuristically clustered peptides identified by more than one PSM into three classes (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref></bold>). Cluster 1 contained 12 peptides that rapidly decreased within 1–3 hours of PKA C3 depletion, and continued to decrease thereafter. This cluster includes CBP80, a DEP domain protein, <italic>Tg</italic>ZnT, <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT3-1, AC13, and FtsH1 (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Cluster 2 comprised 82 peptides that also decreased within 1–3 hours of IAA treatment, after which their abundances remained stable and decreased overall to a lesser extent than cluster 1 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref></bold>). Cluster 2 included genes putatively involved in gene regulation, including eIF4G1, NOC3p, a zinc finger protein, a DNA repair protein, SET1, and a nucleotidyltransferase (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Several phosphosites belonging to proteins involved in daughter cell biogenesis were also down-regulated, including AC13, IAP2, BCC8, and condensin 2. We also observed down-regulation of transporters belonging to this cluster–for example, TgApiAT2, ATP4, and a nucleoside transporter. The early events in bradyzoite differentiation have not been extensively characterized but involve translational regulation of BFD1 enhanced by a BFD1/BFD2 feed-forward loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Licon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>). Down-regulation of PKA C3 may enhance conditions that activate this loop, for example due to global down-regulation of cap-dependent translation (CBP80, eIF4G1) or alteration of the replicative cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Radke et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Cluster 2 also contains numerous proteins trafficking through secretory organelles, including the micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules. Modified phosphosites belonging to micronemal proteins included CRMP-b, TGGT1_221180, and TGGT1_304490 (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). The rhoptry proteins ROP1, ROP13, ROP17, ROP40, and RON9 were also differentially regulated. Modified dense granule/parasitophorous vacuole proteins included GRA3, GRA4, GRA6, GRA7, GRA8, GRA31, GRA57, GRA62, GRA70, SFP1, and MAG1. Many of these proteins are lumenal within their respective organelles, and regulation by PKA C3 is therefore likely indirect. Nonetheless, each of the secretory organelles contain stage-specific subproteomes with implications for metabolism and protein complex assembly in bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Sinai et al., 2020</xref>); the regulation observed here may reflect such early stages of proteomic remodeling.</p>
<p>The 31 phosphopeptides belonging to cluster 3 increased in abundance following PKA C3 depletion and therefore are likely indirect targets of the kinase. This cluster contained phosphoproteins involved in gene regulation (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>), such as AP2XII-9, an ISWI protein, CAF1, PLU-1, GCFC, and two zinc finger proteins: TGGT1_223880 and BFD2. We also identified several candidates involved in proteostasis, including HSP90, p23, CSN3, PSME4. Regulation of such proteins may be related to the transition and maintenance of the bradyzoite state, albeit not as a direct consequence of PKA activity.</p>
<p>The protein phosphatase PP2A has recently been characterized as a regulator of bradyzoite differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). We therefore analyzed proteins that exhibited both PKA C3- and PP2A-dependent phosphoregulation. Several candidates in this category were identified as differentially important in interferon-stimulated cells, including TGGT1_209500, GRA57, and GRA70. Numerous phosphosites belonging to AC13 were differentially regulated in both phosphoproteomes. Some proteins involved in endo- and exocytosis also exhibited dynamic phosphoregulation, including CRMP-b and Kelch13. PKA R S<sup>27</sup> was up-regulated upon PKA C3 depletion and was also up-regulated in <italic>Δpp2a</italic> mutants. Finally, nucleic acid-binding proteins exhibited differential phosphoregulation, including BFD2, a KH protein, eIF4G2, and AP2XII-1. Given the stage conversion phenotypes of parasites lacking PKA C3 or PP2A, the phosphoregulation of overlapping targets may be functionally important in the context of bradyzoite differentiation.</p>

<title>The SPARK phosphoproteome shares signatures with the PKA C3–depletion phosphoproteome</title>
<p>We anecdotally observed overlap between SPARK- and PKA C3-dependent phosphopeptides, and in particular those with putative nucleic acid binding functions. We therefore systematically compared the abundances of candidate PKA C3 targets (as defined above) to overlapping phosphosites in the SPARK phosphoproteome. Compared to the bulk phosphoproteome, the PKA C3–dependent phosphopeptides significantly decreased in abundance within three hours of SPARK depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref></bold>). Several of phosphoproteins found to be altered by both PKA C3 and SPARK depletion belonged to proteins involved in gene regulation (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>), including CBP80, eIF4G2, SET1, NOC3p, Spt5, a KH protein, a nucleotidyltransferase, and PRP4. Some of these proteins associate with large transcription factor assemblies, including the AP2IX4/MORC and GCN5-B complexes. Transporters also overlapped between the two phosphoproteomes, including ZnT, TgApiAT2, and TgApiAT3-1. Several phosphosites belonging to apical cap proteins were also shared between the phosphoproteomes, including numerous AC13 peptides.</p>
<p>The SPARK and PKA C3 phosphoproteomes notably diverged with regards to regulation of dense granule proteins, which was observed as a subpopulation of PKA C3–dependent peptides that increased in abundance upon SPARK depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7K</xref></bold>). This effect was specific to the indicated phosphopeptides, as corresponding protein levels of the dense granule proteins were not changed (<bold>Supplementary File 4</bold>). The differentially regulated dense granule proteins include many of those belonging to cluster 2 of the PKA C3 depletion proteome (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7K</xref></bold>). The phosphoproteome of SPARK shares signatures of reduced PKA C3 activity; however, due to concomitant down-regulation of other AGC kinases, the phosphoproteomes of SPARK and PKA C3 depletion diverge in ways that remain to be explored.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PDK1, the closest mammalian homolog to SPARK, is considered a key regulator of AGC kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mora et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Pearce et al., 2010</xref>). These kinases are united by general structural features required for activity and integrity, such as the activation segment (also known as the activation loop or T-loop), and the C-terminal hydrophobic and turn motifs, which are common loci of regulation that can position the kinase into an active conformation. In mammals, AGC kinases depend on PDK1 in various ways. For example, phosphorylation of the Akt (PKB) activation loop by PDK1 leads to partial activation; additional phosphorylation by the target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex produces maximal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Pearce et al., 2010</xref>). Some protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms undergo ordered phosphorylation by upstream enzymes—including PDK1—that prime PKC for activity and prevent kinase degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Newton, 2010</xref>). PKA catalytic isoforms require T-loop phosphorylation for activity; however, whether this modification is installed autocatalytically or by PDK1 depends on the cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cheng et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Moore et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Williams et al., 2000</xref>). Consequently, PDK1 dysregulation provokes diverse cellular consequences, including enhanced growth, migration, and cell survival—processes associated with cancer in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Gagliardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Mora et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Raimondi and Falasca, 2011</xref>). In this study, we characterize the diverse consequences of PDK1 dysregulation in the ubiquitous and divergent eukaryotic parasite of such animals, <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>
<p>SPARK down-regulation coincides with reduced PKG and PKA C1 activity due to reduced protein levels. From our own studies, multiple mass spectrometric and cell biological experiments support this observation. Furthermore, PDK1 mutations in the related apicomplexan <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> were observed to act as suppressors of toxicity related to overexpression of <italic>Pf</italic>PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hitz et al., 2021</xref>). Both <italic>Tg</italic>PKG and <italic>Tg</italic>PKA C1 possess features of AGC kinases involved in PDK1 interaction, such as the PDK1- interacting fragment FXXF. PKA C1 terminates in the sequence FTSW, whereas PKG has two non-terminal FXXF motifs, FGDF and FLYF. Although these motifs are not strictly C-terminal, as in animals, their position resembles that observed in some plant AGC kinases, up to 50 amino acids upstream of the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Rademacher and Offringa, 2012</xref>). The T-loop phosphorylation of each kinase—PKA C1 T190 and PKG T838—are down-regulated to a greater extent than corresponding protein levels following SPARK knockdown (<bold>Supplementary File 3</bold>). Heterologous expression and activity assays of PKA C1 and PKG may resolve the importance of activation loop phosphorylation for kinase function; however, such biochemical assays are not currently available for the <italic>T. gondii</italic> kinases. The requirement of T-loop threonine for PKG activity is unclear, as recombinant <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. PKG was still active when this residue was mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bakkouri et al., 2019</xref>). Conformational changes due to cGMP binding— in particular, rearrangement of the N-terminal autoinhibitory segment otherwise adjacent to the activation loop—appeared particularly important for PKG activity. Upon SPARK depletion, multiple phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal and cyclic nucleotide-binding domains of PKG (S20, S22, T59, S62, T96, T99, and S105) similarly decrease in abundance to a greater extent than protein levels, and may function in the regulation of these domains. The cause for reduction of PKA C1 and PKG levels requires further study; in principle, active degradation or dilution mechanisms due to cell division are possible. In support of the latter, down-regulation of both kinases was only observed after 8 hours of SPARK depletion, a period in excess of the duration of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> cell cycle.</p>
<p>Independent of biochemical mechanisms, genetic evidence supports the hypothesis that SPARK phenotypes associated with kinetic transitions in the lytic cycle—such as motility, egress, and invasion—arise from dysregulated PKA C1 and PKG activity. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, PKA negatively regulates egress and positively regulates the transition between invasion and the establishment of a replicative niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Uboldi et al., 2018</xref>); by contrast, in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, PKA mediates parasite invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Flueck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Wilde et al., 2019</xref>). PKG is more broadly required for apicomplexan motility, invasion, and egress and functions by mobilizing parasite intracellular calcium stores. Genetic pathway analysis of <italic>T. gondii</italic> PKA C1 and PKG inhibition supports a model in which PKG lies downstream of PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Jia et al., 2017</xref>). Increasingly, proteomic, genetic, and physiological studies implicate negative feedback mechanisms between cAMP and cGMP signaling pathways in apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bisio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brochet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Moss et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Nofal et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, SPARK inhibition releases the breaks that PKA C1 holds on egress and jams the engine of PKG activity, resulting in parasite stasis. The PKA signaling circuit differs in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., where a sole PKA C subunit is indispensable for invasion but not egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Wilde et al., 2019</xref>). However, SPARK inhibition would lead to a similarly inhibitory effect on parasite proliferation, as has been suggested recently in studies employing altered <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PDK1 and PKA alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hitz et al., 2021</xref>).
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>T. gondii</italic> has two additional paralogs of the PKA catalytic subunit, relative to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., PKA C2 and PKA C3. PKA C2 expression levels are low outside of the parasite sexual stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>). PKA C3 disruption was previously reported to increase conversion to the bradyzoite stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sugi et al., 2016</xref>). Our results using a PKA C3 conditional knockdown support this finding. Furthermore, PKA C3 and SPARK associate, as revealed through approaches that probe reciprocal interactions. PKA C3 possesses a canonical PDK1-interacting fragment (FDNF) and shares an activation loop motif with PKA C1. Although PKA C3 peptide levels were below the detection limit in our depletion phosphoproteome experiments, we propose that SPARK depletion leads to down-regulation of PKA C3 activity separately from a reduction in PKA C3 protein abundance. SPARK and PKA C3 depletion phenocopy each other with respect to <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation. Candidates for the molecular targets responsible for differentiation may reside in the overlapping phosphosites in the SPARK and PKA C3 depletion phosphoproteomes.</p></list-item>
</list>
The regulation of SPARK remains an open inquiry. Mammalian PDK1 is constitutively active due to auto-phosphorylation in <italic>trans</italic>. The PH domain triggers mammalian PDK1 homodimerization upon binding of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Levina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Masters et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Pearce et al., 2010</xref>). SPARK lacks the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Smith et al., 2022</xref>); therefore, apicomplexans have likely evolved alternative mechanisms for regulating PDK1. The complex of proteins interacting with SPARK—the elongin-like protein SPARKEL and the putative AGC kinase TGME49_205550—may represent a means of modulating SPARK activity. Elongin C forms a component of multiprotein complexes. E3 ubiquitin ligases are well-known examples; however, elongin C can affect steady-state protein levels through mechanisms distinct from ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Hyman et al., 2002</xref>). In metazoans, PDK1 has been reported to associate with E3 ligases and exhibit monobiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Uras et al., 2012</xref>). The anti-correlated cell cycle expression profiles of SPARK and SPARKEL suggest a specific window of activity for the complex. However, given the co-depletion of the complex—as has been reported for other tightly associated proteins studied with the AID system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Tosetti et al., 2020</xref>)— further biochemical studies are required to discern the regulatory interactions between SPARK and SPARKEL. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. appear to have lost SPARKEL, which is otherwise conserved in the apicomplexans, possibly requiring tight regulation of SPARK expression or other mechanism to control its activity.</p>
<p>Our unbiased and integrative proteomic approaches uncovered ancient features of signaling networks <italic>de novo</italic> and revealed how such relationships can be repurposed for parasitism. Apicomplexans are well-adapted to transition between life stages in their hosts. Synthesizing genetic, proteomic, and phenotypic data, we propose that SPARK fundamentally integrates the topology of cyclic nucleotide signaling networks in apicomplexan parasites. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, proper SPARK function preserves tachyzoite physiology by activating PKG, PKA C1, and PKA C3, thus promoting cycling within the acute stages of the infection in favor of differentiation into the chronic stage wherein AGC kinase activity is lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Fu et al., 2021</xref>). In principle, SPARK may serve as a central node for regulation of the asexual stages.</p>

<p>Exported peptide and protein abundance files from Proteome Discoverer 2.4 were loaded into R (version 4.0.4). The normalized abundance values of all peptides were used as input for a principal component analysis using the R stats package (version 3.6.2). The strain basal downregulation score was determined for the SPARK-AID phosphoproteome by calculating the modified z-score of the log<sub>2</sub>- ratios of altered abundances in the SPARK-AID strain with no IAA treatment relative to the TIR1 parental strain. The IAA score was calculated by summing the log<sub>2</sub>-ratios of altered abundances in the SPARK-AID strain relative to the SPARK-AID untreated samples, followed by transformation into a modified z-score. Clustering analysis was performed with the mclust package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Scrucca et al., 2016</xref>) (version 5.4.7) using the log<sub>2</sub> ratios of relative to the vehicle-treated SPARK-AID samples. Cluster assignments are reported in <bold>Supplementary File X</bold>. The PKA C3-AID phosphoproteome IAA score was calculated as described above; a strain basal downregulation score was not calculated because the experiment did not include a TIR1 parental sample.</p>

<title>Enrichment Analysis</title>
<p>Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Herneisen et al., 2022</xref>). Sets of gene ontology terms from the differentially regulated (SPARK-dependent) and background proteome (all proteins with quantification values in the SPARK-AID mass spectrometry experiment) were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ToxoDB.org">ToxoDB.org</ext-link> (Molecular Function, Computed evidence, P-Value cutoff set to 1). Gene ontology terms were tested for enrichment across all gene ontology terms identified in the background proteome. A p-value for the likelihood of a given enrichment to have occurred by chance was obtained using a hypergeometric test.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Herneisen et al characterise the Toxoplasma PDK1 orthologue SPARK and an associated protein SPARKEL in controlling important fate decisions in Toxoplasma. Over recent years this group and others have characterised the role of cAMP and cGMP signalling in negatively and positively regulating egress, motility, and invasion, respectively. This manuscript furthers this work by showing that SPARK and SPARKEL likely act upstream, or at least control the levels of the cAMP and cGMP-dependent kinases PKA and PKG, respectively, thus controlling the transition of intracellular replicating parasites into extracellular motile forms (and back again).</p>
<p>The authors use quantitative (phospho)proteomic techniques to elegantly demonstrate the upstream role of SPARK in controlling cAMP and cGMP pathways. They use sophisticated analysis techniques (at least for parasitology) to show the functional association between cGMP and cAMP signalling pathways. They therefore begin to unify our understanding of the complicated signalling pathways used by Toxoplasma to control key regulatory processes that control the activation and suppression of motility. The authors then use molecular and cellular assays on a range of generated transgenic lines to back up their observations made by quantitative proteomics that are clear in their design and approach.</p>
<p>The authors then extend their work by showing that SPARK/SPARKEL also control PKAc3 function. PKAc3 has previously been shown to negatively regulate differentiation into bradyzoite forms and this work backs up and extends this finding to show that SPARK also controls this. The authors conclude that SPARK could act as a central node of regulation of the asexual stage, keeping parasites in their lytic cell growth and preventing differentiation. Whether this is true is beyond the scope of this paper and will have to be determined at a later date.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is an exceptional body of work. It is elegantly performed, with state-of-the-art proteomic methodologies carefully being applied to Toxoplasma. Observations from the proteomic datasets are masterfully backed up with validation using quantitative molecular and cellular biology assays.</p>
<p>The paper is carefully and concisely written and is not overreaching in its conclusions. This work and its analysis set a new benchmark for the use of proteomics and molecular genetics in apicomplexan parasites.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Herneisen et al. examines the Toxoplasma SPARK kinase orthologous to mammalian PDK1 kinase. The extracellular signals trigger cascades of the second messengers and play a central role in the apicomplexan parasites' survival. In Toxoplasma, these cascades regulate active replication of the tachyzoites, which manifests as acute toxoplasmosis, or the development into drug-resilient bradyzoites characteristic of the chronic stage of the disease. This study focuses on the poorly understood signaling mechanisms acting upstream of such second messenger kinases as PKA and PKG. The authors showed that similar to PDK1, Toxoplasma SPARK appears to regulate several AGC kinases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study demonstrated a strong association of the SPARK kinase with an elongin-like SPARKEL factor and an uncharacterized AGC kinase. Using a set of standard assays, the authors determined the SPARK/SPARKEL role in parasite egress and invasion. Finally, the study presented evidence of the SPARK/SPARKEL involvement in the bradyzoite differentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Although the study can potentially uncover essential sensing mechanisms operating in Toxoplasma, the evidence of the SPARK/SPARKEL mechanisms is weak. Specifically, due to incomplete data analysis, the SPARK/SPARKEL-dependent phosphoregulation of AGC kinases cannot be evaluated. The manuscript requires better organization and lacks guidance on the described experiments. Although the study is built on advanced genetics, at times, it is unnecessarily complicated, raising doubts rather than benefiting the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper focuses on the roles of a toxoplasma protein (SPARKEL) with homology to an elongin C and the kinase SPARK that it interacts with. They demonstrate that the two proteins regulate the abundance of PKA and PKG, and that depletion of SPARKEL reduces invasion and egress (previously shown with SPARK), and that their loss also triggers spontaneous bradyzoite differentiation. The data are overall very convincing and will be of high interest to those who study Toxoplasma and related apicomplexan parasites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study is very well executed with appropriate controls. The manuscript is also very well and clearly written. Overall, the work clearly demonstrates that SPARK/SPARKEL regulate invasion and egress and that their loss triggers differentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. The authors fail to discriminate between SPARK/SPARKEL acting as negative regulators of differentiation as a result of an active role in regulating stage-specific transcription/translation or as a consequence of a stress response activated when either is depleted.</p>
<p>2. The function of SPARKEL has not been addressed. In mammalian cells, Elongin C is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates transcription and other processes. From what I can tell from the proteomic data, homologs of the Elongin B/C complex were not identified. This is an important issue as the authors find that PKG and PKA protein levels are reduced in the knockdown strains</p>
