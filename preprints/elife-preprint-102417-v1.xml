<title>Abstract</title><p>Transcription activation of genes by estrogens is driven by enhancers, which are often located within the same Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) as non-targeted promoters. We investigated how acute enhancer-driven activation affects neighbouring non-target genes within the same TAD. Using single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH), we tracked the transcription of <italic>TFF1</italic> (enhancer-targeted) and <italic>TFF3</italic> (non-targeted) during estrogen stimulation. We observed mutually exclusive expression patterns: <italic>TFF1</italic> expression peaked at 1 hour, while <italic>TFF3</italic> reached its peak at 3 hours, after <italic>TFF1</italic>’s activation had diminished. Chromatin looping data indicated that the enhancer loops with <italic>TFF1</italic> but not <italic>TFF3</italic>, suggesting that <italic>TFF3</italic> upregulation is not due to direct enhancer-promoter interactions. CRISPR deletion of the <italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer and 1,6-hexanediol (HD) exposure revealed that the <italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer:promoter undergo Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS), which sequesters the transcriptional machinery and inhibits <italic>TFF3</italic> expression. As estrogen signalling wanes or LLPS is disrupted, <italic>TFF1</italic> expression declines while <italic>TFF3</italic> expression increases. Our findings reveal that enhancer-driven activation can indirectly influence neighbouring genes, highlighting a dynamic shift in gene expression as signalling progresses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute transcriptional activation of ligand-induced genes drive downstream signalling response. Similar to development-specific genes, signalling induced genes are also driven by enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Uyehara &amp; Apostolou, 2023</xref>). Upon binding with ligand induced transcription factors (TFs), these enhancers loop with their target promoters mostly, in the same TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bulger &amp; Groudine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chepelev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Furlong &amp; Levine, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Panigrahi &amp; O’Malley, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ptashne, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sanyal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Enhancer: promoter pairing is thought to be specific and forms the basis of noise-free gene activation of a subset of genes crucial for signalling response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bojcsuk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Friedman et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Galouzis &amp; Furlong, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zabidi et al., 2015</xref>). Due to such specificity, gene transcription occurs in waves of early and late responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yamamoto &amp; Alberts, 1976</xref>) Often, the protein factors translated from early genes, regulate the expression of late responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dixon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Freter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Herschman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Williams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Winkles, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Winston &amp; Pledger, 1993</xref>). However, it is not known if the genes that are activated early in signalling time course are spatially related to late activating genes. Further, if spatial proximity of any gene to an early gene is enough to cause the temporal differential transcription due to sequestration of the transcriptional machinery from late gene to early gene is poorly understood. Transcription factors (TFs), after binding to cognate DNA motif, recruit RNA polymerase machinery and co-activators for gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Levine &amp; Tjian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). These machinery are limited in supply, and may in effect be sequestered from other genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Koşar &amp; Erbaş, 2022</xref>). Further, acute activation of genes is linked with phase-separation of TFs, polymerases, mediators and other co-factors/activators, most of which harbour low complexity regions to promote weak protein-protein interactions driving formation of TF-condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Boehning et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chong et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mann &amp; Notani, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shrinivas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Stortz et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">2024</xref>). Though the precise stoichiometry of protein molecules in these condensates is unknown, such structures do involve multiple molecules of each transcriptional protein. The formation of such phase-separated compartments potentially can act as a sink for transcriptional machinery depriving neighbouring promoters and enhancers that are not part of the compartment. Such sequestration would cause indirect suppression of these genes that are spatially proximal in the same TAD but not the part of the same condensate.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the effect of an enhancer: promoter pair on a neighbouring gene within the same TAD, we looked at the paradigmatic model of estrogen signalling in mammary epithelial cells namely MCF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Levenson &amp; Jordan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Masiakowski et al., 1982</xref>). We selected E2-induced E-P pair <italic>TFF1</italic> and its neighbouring gene <italic>TFF3</italic> on Chr21 located at a distance of 43kb from each other, as discussed below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chinery et al., 1996</xref>). We chose to answer these questions using an integrated approach consisting of single molecule RNA FISH (smFISH), genome-wide conformation capture and sequencing (4C-seq), and perturbation of cis-acting regulatory elements by CRISPR. E2-signalling can be induced within minutes by treating the cells with estradiol (E2) which causes activation and repression of several genes across the genome. The peak of E2-mediated signalling occurs at 40 minutes post-induction and starts to decay by 160 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hah et al., 2011</xref>). This occurs via the binding of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) on the enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>TFF1</italic> is found in a topologically associated domain (TAD) along with a few other genes including <italic>TFF2</italic>, <italic>TFF3</italic>, <italic>TMPRSS3</italic>, and <italic>UBASH3A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Quintin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> are located at 10kb and 60kb from enhancer respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and this locus has been useful in answering the questions about promoter-enhancer interactions and multi-gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Quintin et al., 2014</xref>;).</p>

<p>Using this system, we identified that <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> genes located within the same TAD show distinct and opposing expression profiles over the course of E2-mediated signalling. In agreement with this, the enhancer also showed increased lopping interaction with the cognate gene promoter during peak expression at 1h of signalling. We also identified the role of TF-mediated LLPS on the regulation of these two genes during signalling. Hence, we propose that ligand dependent condensation of ERα can support the expression of the cognate gene in concert with the enhancer while negatively affecting the expression of a neighbouring gene.</p>

<title>ERα binding and ligand-induced gene expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> change over the course of estrogen signaling</title>
<p>In order to understand how acute activation of one gene in a TAD affects the transcription of a proximate gene, we chose to study <italic>TFF1</italic> and its neighbouring gene <italic>TFF3</italic> at a 43kb distance within same TAD. <italic>TFF1</italic> expression is linked with an enhancer located 10 kb downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Oh et al., 2021</xref>) and the distance between <italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer and <italic>TFF3</italic> gene is 53kb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>17-β-oestradiol exposure leads to ERα binding on regulatory regions leading to gene activation. Gene transcription of E2-regulated genes was shown to peak at 1h and significantly reduces at 3h due to the rapid degradation of ERα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hah et al., 2011</xref>). The binding of ERα in the genome also follows this temporal kinetics where it peaks at 1h and reduces at 3h post ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). At the <italic>TFF1</italic> locus, the <italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer and to some extent, its promoter, were bound by ERα even in the absence of E2 induction, while it increased in strength at these regions and also at various other regions in the locus at 1h of ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, the binding at these regions substantially decreased at 3h. On the other hand, ERα did not bind on <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter throughout the course of signalling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). We have previously shown that such estrogen-induced clustered binding of ERα on <italic>TFF1</italic> region is associated with its acute activation post estrogen stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>). We then tested the level of their expression by nascent RNA-seq (GRO-seq). We observed a dramatic transcriptional activation of <italic>TFF1</italic> at 1h which reduced substantially at 3h. The expression level of <italic>TFF3</italic> was comparatively low and did not fluctuate upon signalling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, qRT-PCR on unspliced <italic>TFF3</italic> exhibited upregulation at 1h and down-regulation at 3h. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) While this broad trend is similar to <italic>TFF1</italic> as shown by both GRO-seq and qRT-PCR, the relative changes for <italic>TFF3</italic> was smaller than <italic>TFF1</italic>. We reasoned that these differences in <italic>TFF3</italic> could be because of its low baseline expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Clark et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Conesa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Svensson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tarazona et al., 2011</xref>), and lower yet expression of unspliced transcripts. Therefore, in order to test the relative induction of these genes and their co-regulation, we decided to perform single cell measurements of RNA (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>) that do not rely on PCR amplification (sc-RNA-seq) and can provide absolute numbers of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> transcripts in a given cell. Towards this, we chose to employ smFISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Femino et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Haimovich &amp; Gerst, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kwon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Raj et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title><italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> exhibit opposite trends during the E2 signalling time-course</title>
<p>MCF7 cells are hypertriploid to hypotetraploid, and each of the three alleles within a nucleus can behave differently, and smFISH is pre-eminently suited to capturing cell-and allele-specific heterogeneity of expression even for low expressing genes, compared to bulk studies that average over cell populations. Briefly, smFISH allows to visualize single RNA molecules in fixed cells using multiple fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes targeted to the RNA of interest and therefore, it can be used to image the transcription and the localization of multiple gene transcripts at same and different time points after signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Femino et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Raj et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We designed the smFISH probes targeting the intronic region of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> to measure their nascent transcripts (referred to as InTFF1 and InTFF3 hereon) whereas the exonic probes were used to primarily measure mature mRNA transcripts (referred to as ExTFF1 and ExTFF3 hereon). Intronic probes are particularly suited for investigating nascent transcriptional status at the time of fixation, while probes against mature mRNA reflects on more steady-state levels of functional mRNA due to finite mRNA lifetimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the intronic probes can help determine the localisation and number of alleles that are transcribing at a given time thus allowing for additional interpretations regarding the expression of multiple genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Representative images from the smFISH experiment probing InTFF1 and InTFF3 are depicted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The smaller foci represent individual intronic/nascent transcripts while the larger foci represent the site of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Raj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>). Since MCF7 cells are hypertriploid in nature, we expected to see 1-3 large foci per cell representing sites of transcription. Additionally, we observed many individual transcripts labelled by intronic probes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, D</xref>) within the same nuclei (probes against mature mRNA are usually more cytoplasmic). This is suggestive of the fact that the transcripts undergo non-co-transcriptional splicing as the transcripts labelled by intronic probes are localised away from the site of transcription. This is not surprising as several reports have shown that nascent transcript can undergo splicing well after transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Coulon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Drexler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Khodor et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, a very recent study has shown that such post-transcriptional splicing occurs in a small zone around genes including <italic>TFF1</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coté et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, observation of nascent transcripts away from the site of transcription as we see for <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, D</xref>) is not unexpected. We quantified the number of such transcripts per nuclei as a proxy for ongoing transcription.</p>

<p>At 1h post E2 induction, <italic>TFF1</italic> mean transcript counts increased significantly compared to uninduced, whereas, the increment was less pronounced for <italic>TFF3</italic> transcripts. In contrast, the mean transcript counts for <italic>TFF3</italic> increased significantly at 3h post induction while <italic>TFF1</italic> transcription showed a decrease at 3h compared to 1h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). To check the transcriptional status of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> in the same cell, we plotted the transcript counts from individual cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The data suggested that the transcript counts for <italic>TFF1</italic> increased at 1h and cells that showed high counts for <italic>TFF1</italic> were likely to have low counts for <italic>TFF3</italic>. But the RNA counts for <italic>TFF1</italic> decreased at 3h and increased for <italic>TFF3</italic>. Overall, it was evident that the transcriptional profile for these two genes located in the same TAD were negatively correlated as they peaked at different time points. To further confirm this, smFISH using probes targeting both the intronic and exonic transcripts in the same experiment was conducted. Intronic probes represent active transcription, while exonic probes show accumulated mature mRNA from past transcriptional events even in the absence of active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>). Representative images from the smFISH experiment probing InTFF1 and ExTFF1 are depicted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). We observed that the exonic transcript counts for both <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> increased at 1h compared to uninduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-F</xref>). Strikingly, at 3h, the exonic transcripts for <italic>TFF1</italic> continued to increase even while the intronic transcript counts reduced, though the fold increase (1.12 ±0.02) was less compared to that between uninduced and 1h (1.63 ± 0.28), indicating a plateauing of steady state levels. Exonic transcripts for <italic>TFF3</italic> at 3h remained comparable to 1h while the intronic counts increased suggesting, <italic>TFF1</italic> transcription reduces at 3h whereas, <italic>TFF3</italic> expression increases. We reasoned that the ratio of intronic transcript number (InTFF1) to exonic transcripts number (ExTFF) should represent the status of transcription as an increase in the number of intronic transcript due to expression would result in a higher ratio while also taking into consideration the number of mature transcripts. As expected, the ratio of intronic transcripts to exonic transcripts also showed that transcription is active at 1h for <italic>TFF1</italic> as the ratio is higher compared to uninduced and 3h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). Contrastingly, the ratio was highest at 3h for <italic>TFF3</italic> suggesting that active transcription takes place much after the peak of E2-mediated signalling and maximal <italic>TFF1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer does not change target promoters during signalling time-course</title>
<p>In order to identify the molecular players behind differential expression of these two genes that are in the same TAD, we asked if the ERα-bound enhancer downstream to <italic>TFF1</italic> gene, loops with <italic>TFF1</italic> at 1h, and with <italic>TFF3</italic> at 3h. This enhancer acutely activates <italic>TFF1</italic> at 1h post estrogen stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>; Ho et al., 2021). We interrogated the looping using enhancer as a viewpoint by 4C-seq in uninduced, 1 and 3h post E2 stimulation. We observed robust interactions between enhancer and <italic>TFF1</italic> promoter at 1h post induction which reduced at 3h. On the other hand, its interaction with <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter exhibited very low counts in uninduced as well as E2-induced conditions at both time points and in both replicates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, Fig. S3A). This suggests that the looping of enhancer was potentially inducing the expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> gene at 1h and loss of interactions at 3h resulted in weak <italic>TFF1</italic> transcription. However, lack of interactions between enhancer and <italic>TFF3</italic> did not explain the gain of <italic>TFF3</italic> expression at 3h post ligand stimulation.</p>

<p>This could mean that enhancer interaction is critical for <italic>TFF1</italic> expression, but is less important for <italic>TFF3</italic> expression. Thus, <italic>TFF1</italic> expression should be affected more severely upon deletion of the enhancer than <italic>TFF3</italic>. To test this, we investigated the expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> in MCF-7 cells where the enhancer downstream to <italic>TFF1</italic> was homozygously deleted using CRISPR-Cas9 (referred to as the Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e from hereon) (Saravanan et al., 2021). Using smFISH, we quantified the intronic transcripts for <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> in the Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e cells, compared to WT cells. We observed that the mean number of <italic>TFF1</italic> transcripts was reduced drastically in the Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e compared to the WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The reduction was far more substantial (49.23 ±2.6 at 1hr and 40.75 ±7.8 at 3h) for <italic>TFF1</italic> than <italic>TFF3</italic> (6.03 ±1.8 at 1hr and 7.6 ±0.7 at 3h) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). The absolute transcript counts for <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> in the Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e cells have also been shown for clearer visualization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), as these are obscured when compared to WT. To get a sense of fold changes, we took a ratio of mean transcript counts in WT cells to Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e cells at each time point. We observed that the drop in gene transcripts between WT and Δ<italic>TFF1</italic>e were several folds higher for <italic>TFF1</italic> compared to <italic>TFF3</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). This suggests that enhancer deletion has a more robust impact on the transcription of <italic>TFF1</italic> compared to <italic>TFF3</italic>. Nonetheless, <italic>TFF3</italic> was also affected even though, it does not loop with the enhancer. This is in accordance with the 4C-seq data where we observed prominent looping between the enhancer and <italic>TFF1</italic> but less so with <italic>TFF3</italic>. These results suggest that the enhancer plays a more important role in the expression of the primary gene while it has less impact on a gene located more distally but within the same TAD during course of signalling.</p>

<title>Levels of ERα in the nucleus dictate the extent of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> inductions</title>
<p>After ruling out enhancer looping as the determinant of differential expression, we looked for other candidates that could regulate the differential gene expression. As discussed above, globally, E2-mediated gene expression is known to peak at 1h after stimulation and drop significantly by 3h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hah et al., 2011</xref>). Upon ligand stimulation, ERα translocates into nucleus, increasing mean ERα intensity in the nucleus which is high at 1h and then decreases significantly by 3h due to degradation. These changes in intensities have been captured using immunofluorescence for ERα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>). We tested if the intensities of ERα in individual cells correlate with the expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> at 1h and 3h of E2 signalling. Towards this, we combined smFISH with immunofluorescence for ERα. To improve contrast for the ERα signal, we additionally performed a chromatin retention assay to get rid of any chromatin unbound ERα (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The representative images show that the cells with very high levels of nuclear ERα (blue circle) exhibited low counts of both <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> while the cells with medium levels of ERα (red circle) possessed higher <italic>TFF1</italic> than <italic>TFF3</italic>. Similarly, the cells with the lower levels of ERα (grey circle) showed higher <italic>TFF3</italic> expression as compared to <italic>TFF1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Histograms depicting the ERα mean intensities across individual cells, showed that the nuclear level of ERα increases post 1h of induction and then goes down at 3h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C</xref>), similar to <italic>TFF1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>To further corroborate this, we parsed the ERα population cells into 3 categories namely low, medium, and high within the cells imaged at 1 and 3h. We plotted the mean counts of <italic>TFF1</italic> in each of these bins at different time points and observed that the mean count was higher in the mid-category (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). While for <italic>TFF3</italic>, the mean count was significantly higher in the low bin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). The transcript counts for <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> against ERα intensities on a cell-by-cell basis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>), also showed this feature where very high levels of ERα in the nucleus were not conducive to the expression of either gene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). To test if ERα had a causal role in intensity based expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic>, we increased the levels of ERα by over expression of ERα-GFP (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A,C</xref>). The representative images from smFISH experiment in cells overexpressing ERα-GFP confirmed that <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> were downregulated in transfected cells while these genes were not perturbed in non-transfected cells in neighbourhood (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A, C</xref>). Meanwhile, the cells overexpressing ERα-GFP do not show any impairment in the expression of GAPDH (housekeeping gene) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A,B</xref>). As another control, we transfected the cells with EGFP-C1 (same backbone as ERα-GFP construct) and observed no effect on <italic>TFF1</italic> or <italic>TFF3</italic> (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D,E</xref>). The data suggest that loss of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> expression upon ERα overexpression was not a general effect of transfection stress, but rather specific to ERα overexpression. These results indicate that high nuclear levels of ERα can be detrimental to the expression of genes it regulates. This could be due to widespread condensate formation which in turn could sequester the transcriptional protein complexes and competitively abrogate transcription across the multiple loci. Thus, the global level of ERα in the nucleus can be predictive of transcriptional status of specific genes. The binding of ERα at 1 and 3h is proportional to its nuclear levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>); suggesting, its overexpression would lead to more binding in the genome which is detrimental to gene expression.</p>

<title>LLPS perturbation down-regulates <italic>TFF1</italic> but supports <italic>TFF3</italic> expression</title>
<p>The data obtained from combined smFISH and ERα immunofluorescence indicates that ERα could be a determining factor in controlling the differential gene expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic>. Existing literature indicates that ERα-mediated condensate plays a role in E2-induced gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nair et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>). It led us to hypothesize that ERα-mediated condensate at the <italic>TFF1</italic> locus could be sequestering all the factors required for active transcription and thus preventing activation of the <italic>TFF3</italic> locus at the active phase of E2 signalling. To validate this, we treated the cells with 3% 1,6-Hexanediol for 5 minutes which is known to disrupt LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gamliel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kroschwald et al., 2017</xref>). Following the treatment, we performed smFISH to look at the transcription of <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> in the same cell and observed a dramatic reduction in <italic>TFF1</italic> transcripts, whereas statistically significant increase in <italic>TFF3</italic> was noted (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Since, ERα forms condensates only after estrogen stimulation, 1,6-Hexanediol had no effect on <italic>TFF1</italic> in the absence of E2 signalling (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the functional loss of <italic>TFF1</italic> promoter transcription due to the dissolution of ERα condensate allowed <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter in the neighbourhood to gain access to transcriptional machinery leading to its upregulation. In order to test the generality of this observation, beyond the <italic>TFF1</italic>, <italic>TFF3</italic> locus, we divided E2-responsive genes in three categories, low, moderate, and high based on their expression upon E2-40m stimulation. We observed the significant increase at 40m and down-regulation at 160m when the binding of ERα is reduced in the genome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Next, we tested the expression of their nearby upregulated genes at 160m compared to 40m post E2 stimulation. The nearby genes are within a distance of 1Mb from the E2-responsive genes which is approximately the average size of a TAD. Indeed, we observed the significant up regulation of nearby genes at 160m when the expression of highly induced genes dropped. Additionally, the expression of these genes was reduced at the peak of signalling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), showing that at 40m of signalling, the acute activation of primary genes and sequestration of transcription machinery by these genes leads to the loss of expression of nearby genes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>smFISH allowed us to simultaneously capture allele level transcription of two genes in the same TAD, <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> at single cell level during the peak and fall of signalling. We were able to capture the anti-correlated expression of these two genes revealing an intricate regulatory feedback between acutely activated enhancer-dependent gene, <italic>TFF1</italic> which caused the dysregulation of non-enhancer targeted gene, <italic>TFF3</italic> within the same TAD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data suggests that while condensate formation on enhancer allows robust activation of target gene however, it negatively impacts the expression of other neighbouring genes potentially due to the sequestration of transcriptional machinery from these genes. When the condensates dissolve, the locally enriched transcriptional machinery is available to the other loci, potentially allowing for increased transcription of the these genes, that are not the direct target of enhancer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Forced dissolution of condensates allows the expression of non-enhancer target genes in the cells although at low levels. The data also suggests that globally, the neighbouring genes to ligand induced genes are upregulated at the fall of signalling as an indirect consequence of excess polymerase availability in the neighbourhood.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Non-enhancer target genes are also regulated indirectly in the same TAD</title>
<p>ERα binding strength increases at the enhancer of <italic>TFF1</italic> at 1h of ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>). Such estrogen-induced binding of ERα leads to robust ligand induced activation of <italic>TFF1</italic> gene. While, as <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter remains unbound by ERα (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and does not interact with <italic>TFF1</italic> enhancer throughout the course of signalling. These data suggest that <italic>TFF3</italic> expression is both ERα and enhancer independent. Despite non-dependence, <italic>TFF3</italic> expression was mutually exclusive to <italic>TFF1</italic> expression and was dampened in the absence of enhancer. The latter could be due to the enhancer mediated repositioning of the entire TAD that benefitted the expression of <italic>TFF3</italic>.</p>
<p>The mean expression of <italic>TFF1</italic> was many fold higher than <italic>TFF3</italic> thus explaining its dependence on an active enhancer to its upstream. These cells that expressed <italic>TFF1</italic>, did not express <italic>TFF3</italic> as efficiently suggesting Pol2 was potentially sequestered from <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter. However, at 3h when liganded ERα degrades leading to dissolution of condensates on enhancer, <italic>TFF3</italic> expression increased suggesting a local redistribution of active transcription machinery to other genes within the same chromatin domain. Even at 1h, when condensates were perturbed by 1,6 HD, the expression of <italic>TFF3</italic> increased suggesting the access to free Pol2 pool by <italic>TFF3</italic> promoter. The data explains negative-correlation between <italic>TFF1</italic> and <italic>TFF3</italic> expression at the peak of signalling and robust activation of <italic>TFF3</italic> at 3h when <italic>TFF1</italic> expression decreased at single cell level.</p>

<title>High and low levels of ERα were detrimental to enhancer mediated activation of TFF1</title>
<p>The cells with very high nuclear levels of ERα do not support optimum transcription of either gene. Further, <italic>TFF1</italic> expression was more in cells showing mid-ERα levels at 3h while, <italic>TFF3</italic> peaked in cells with low ERα levels. The reason for this observation could lie in the fact that very low levels of TF do not reach or exceed the critical concentration required for LLPS (for <italic>TFF1</italic>) but this poor transcriptional state of <italic>TFF1</italic> was favourable for <italic>TFF3</italic>. Alternatively, a very high concentration of the TF could result in the formation of extremely dense homogenous condensates effectively reducing transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ryu et al., 2024</xref>). Our data suggests that such a mechanism may be general and not just applicable to the <italic>TFF1</italic>-<italic>TFF3</italic> pair (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Together, our study underscores the indirect effects of ligand-induced chronic gene transcription that is dependent on enhancer activation and phase-separation within a TAD.</p>

Cells were passaged and seeded into glass bottom dishes in non-stripping media for 24h and allowed to reach 60–80% confluency. These cells were then hormone-stripped for three days in stripping media containing phenol red-free DMEM (Gibco, 21063-029) supplemented with 5% charcoal–stripped FBS(Gibco,12676029) and maintained in the humidified incubator at 37 °C (stripped MCF-7).</p>
<p>In order to induce the estrogen transcriptional responses, on the third day cells were treated with β-estradiol (E2758, Sigma-Aldrich) at 100nM concentration for various periods as mentioned in the respective Figures. For untreated control, cells were either treated with equal microliters of ethanol on the third day or with ERα inhibitor ICI182780 (1047, Tocris Biosciences) at 100nM concentration for 24 h after two days of stripping.</p>
<p>For perturbation of LLPS in E2-induced condition, cells were incubated with media containing 3% 1,6-Hexanediol for 5 minutes (after 30 minutes of E2 treatment) followed by removal of 1,6-Hexanediol and recovery for 25 mins in E2 containing media.</p>
<p>For experiments with overexpression of EGFP-ERα or EGFP, cells were transfected 24 hours before E2 induction using X-tremeGENE™ HP DNA Transfection Reagent (XTGHP-RO) in stripping media.</p>

<title>Chromatin retention assay and smFISH</title>
<p>For smFISH experiments without chromatin retention assay cells, the cells were treated with estradiol or vehicular control for indicated times. Following this, the cells were washed with nuclease-free 1X PBS (Ambion, AM9624) twice. This was followed by fixation using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma, P6148) in 1X PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. The fixative was removed and cells were washed twice with 1X PBS. The cells were permeabilized using 70% ethanol at 4°C overnight. On the next day, the permeabilizing agent was removed and the cells were washed twice with 1X PBS. The cells were washed once with a wash buffer (10% Formamide (Ambion, 9342) and 2X SSC (Ambion, AM9763) in nuclease-free water) for 5 minutes at room temperature. The wash buffer was aspirated and the cells were incubated with a hybridization mix (100 μl of mix contains 10% formamide, 89 μl hybridization buffer, and 1 μl each of indicated probes) overnight at 37°C in a humid chamber. The next day, the solution was removed and cells were washed with the wash buffer at 37°C for 30 minutes. To stain the nuclei, DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306; 2μg/ml) in wash buffer was added to the cells and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C. The cells were then washed with 2X SSC for 5 minutes at 4°C.

<title>Image analysis and representation</title>
<p>The images of mRNA channels were subjected to background subtraction using a rolling ball radius of 10 pixels across the entire stack using Fiji. For representative images, the stacks were Z-projected in Fiji and shown. Transcripts were counted using either Rajlabimagetools (courtesy of Arjun Raj lab) or an in-house MATLAB (Mathworks) script based on earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Femino et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Raj et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, the code uses a nuclear mask to count the intron-containing RNA present in the nucleus (InTFF), and another mask for the whole cell to count the mature mRNA, detected by exonic probes (ExTFF), that are present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm. The mean intensity for the ERα immunofluorescence channel was also quantified using the MATLAB script on a cell-by-cell basis using the nuclear mask.</p>

<p>4C was performed as per the protocol described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">van de Werken et al., 2012</xref> with minor variations. MCF7 cells were fixed with fresh formaldehyde (1.5%) and quenched with glycine (125mM) followed by washes with ice-cold 1XPBS (2X) and scraped, pelleted, and stored at -80<sup>0</sup>C. Lysis buffer [Tris-Cl pH 8.0 (10mM), NaCl (10mM), NP-40 (0.2%), PIC (1X)] was added to the pellets and homogenized by Dounce homogenizer (20 stroked with pestle A followed by pestle B). The 3C digestion was performed with DpnII (200 units, NEB) and ligation was performed by T4 DNA ligase and ligation mix [Triton X-100 (1%), 1x Ligation buffer (10X Ligation buffer-Tris-Cl pH 7.5 (500mM), MgCl2 (100mM), DTT (100mM), BSA (0.105mg/ml), ATP (1.05mM)]. The ligated samples were purified by PCI and subjected to ethanol precipitation. The pellet was eluted in 1X TE (pH 8.0) to obtain the 3C library. The 4C digestion was performed by NlaIII (50 units, NEB), and the samples were ligated, purified, and precipitated similar to the 3C library to obtain the 4C library.

<title>4C Data Analysis</title>
<p>The sequenced reads in fastq file were demultiplexed by matching the appropriate primer sequences for each condition without allowing for any mismatches. Demultiplexed reads were processed using 4cseqpipe software. Restriction site tracks were created for the hg38 human genome by mentioning the restriction sites of the first cutter as GATC and that of the second cutter as CATG. The phred scores of demultiplexed reads were changed to phred64 format and the fastq files were converted into raw format. Further, valid 4C reads were mapped to the generated restriction site tracks. Unique fragment ends/non-unique fragment ends were used. The mapped reads were normalized and near cis domainograms at a maximum height of 0.1 were created by using the truncated log mean statistic with a trend resolution of 1kb for the genomic region chr11:42300000-42400000.</p>

<title>GRO-Seq analysis</title>
<p>Fastq files from GEO accession number GSE43836 were downloaded from European Nucleotide Archive. Reads with base quality &lt;20 in a sliding window of 4 bases and with a length of &lt;36 were removed using Trimmomatic 0.39. Trimmed reads were aligned using bowtie2 2.5.1 with default parameters. Duplicate reads from the alignment files were removed using samtools 1.16.1. De-duplicated aligned reads were assigned in a strand-specific manner to transcript feature of the hg38.ncbiRefSeq.gtf.gz file by allowing multi-mapping reads and considering the largest overlap in case of overlapping features using featureCounts v2.0.3. CPM normalised strand-specific signal files with a bin size of 1 bp were generated using bamCoverage 3.5.1. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with default parameters using Deseq2 1.36.0. Upregulated genes were defined as those with adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 and log2(FC) &gt;1 in their respective conditions. Top, Middle and bottom 10% of upregulated genes based on their base mean value in E2-40m vs VEH condition were subsetted as highly expressing, moderately expressing and low expressing upregulated genes. The closest upregulated genes in E2-160m vs E2-40m near highly expressing, moderately expressing and low expressing upregulated genes in E2-40m vs VEH condition were identified using bedtools closest v2.30.0. Only genes within a genomic distance of 1Mb were considered. Log2 transformed DEseq2 normalised counts with the addition of the arbitrary value 1 was used to compare the gene expression trends across time points and categories of upregulated genes. All plots were generated using R 4.2.2.</p>

<p>The authors use single molecule imaging and in vivo loop-capture genomic approaches to investigate estrogen mediated enhancer-target gene activation in human cancer cells. These potentially <bold>important</bold> results suggest that ER-alpha can, in a temporal delay, activate a non-target gene TFF3, which is in proximity to the main target gene TFF1, even though the estrogen responsive enhancer does not loop with the TFF3 promoter. To explain these results, the authors invoke a transcriptional condensate model. The reviewers were split on the strength and interpretation of the evidence presented, which is considered <bold>incomplete</bold> at this stage. We encourage a revision which buttresses the findings with additional control experiments and careful consideration of alternative explanations and mathematical models. Further, the depth of the discussion on existing literature could be improved. This work will be of interest to those studying transcriptional gene regulation and hormone-aggravated cancers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Bohra et al. describes the indirect effects of ligand-dependent gene activation on neighboring non-target genes. The authors utilized single-molecule RNA-FISH (targeting both mature and intronic regions), 4C-seq, and enhancer deletions to demonstrate that the non-enhancer-targeted gene TFF3, located in the same TAD as the target gene TFF1, alters its expression when TFF1 expression declines at the end of the estrogen signaling peak. Since the enhancer does not loop with TFF3, the authors conclude that mechanisms other than estrogen receptor or enhancer-driven induction are responsible for TFF3 expression. Moreover, ERα intensity correlations show that both high and low levels of ERα are unfavorable for TFF1 expression. The ERa level correlations are further supported by overexpression of GFP-ERa. The authors conclude that transcriptional machinery used by TFF1 for its acute activation can negatively impact the TFF3 at peak of signaling but once, the condensate dissolves, TFF3 benefits from it for its low expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings are indeed intriguing. The authors have maintained appropriate experimental controls, and their conclusions are well-supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some major and minor concerns that related to approach, data presentation and discussion. But I think they can be fixed with more efforts.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript by Bohra et al., the authors use the well-established estrogen response in MCF7 cells to interrogate the role of genome architecture, enhancers, and estrogen receptor concentration in transcriptional regulation. They propose there is competition between the genes TFF1 and TFF3 which is mediated by transcriptional condensates. This reviewer does not find these claims persuasive as presented. Moreover, the results are not placed in the context of current knowledge.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>High level of ERalpha expression seems to diminish the transcriptional response. Thus, the results in Fig. 4 have potential insight into ER-mediated transcription. Yet, this observation is not pursued in great depth however, for example with mutagenesis of ERalpha. However, this phenomenon - which falls under the general description of non monotonic dose response - is treated at great depth in the literature (i.e. PMID: 22419778). For example, the result the authors describe in Fig. 4 has been reported and in fact mathematically modeled in PMID 23134774. One possible avenue for improving this paper would be to dig into this result at the single-cell level using deletion mutants of ERalpha or by perturbing co-activators.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are concerns with the smRNA FISH experiments. It is highly unusual to see so much intronic signal away from the site of transcription (Fig. 2) (PMID: 27932455, 30554876) which suggests to me the authors are carrying out incorrect thresholding or have a substantial amount of labeling background. The Cote paper cited in the manuscript is likewise inconsistent with their findings and is cited in a misleading manner: they see splicing within a very small region away from the site of transcription.</p>
<p>One substantial way to improve the manuscript is to take a careful look at previous single cell analysis of the estrogen response, which in some cases has been done on the exact same genes (PMID: 29476006, 35081348, 30554876, 31930333). In some of these cases, the authors reach different conclusions than those presented in the present manuscript. Likewise, there have been more than a few studies which characterized these enhancers (the first one I know of is: PMID 18728018). Also, Oh et al. 2021 (cited in the manuscript) did show an interaction between TFF1e and TFF3, which seems to contradict the conclusion from Fig. 3. In summary, the results of this paper are not in dialog with the field, which is a major shortcoming.</p>
<p>In the opinion of this reviewer, there are few - if any - experiments to interrogate the existence of LLPS for diffraction limited spots such as those associated with transcription. This difficulty is a general problem with the field and not specific to the present manuscript. For example, transient binding will also appear as a dynamic 'spot' in the nucleus, independently of any higher order interactions. As for Fig. 5, I don't think treating cells with 1,6 hexanediol is any longer considered a credible experiment. For example, there are profound effects on chromatin independent of changes in LLPS (PMID: 33536240).</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In conclusion, I suggest that the authors look at alternative explanations and analyses -- many of which are experimentally and mathematically rigorous and pre-date the condensate model -- to explain their data.</p>
