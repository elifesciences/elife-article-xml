<title>Abstract</title><p>Genomic stability is critical for cellular function, however, in the central nervous system highly metabolically active differentiated neurons are challenged to maintain their genome over the organismal lifespan without replication. DNA damage in neurons increases with chronological age and accelerates in neurodegenerative disorders, resulting in cellular and systemic dysregulation. Distinct DNA damage response strategies have evolved with a host of polymerases. The Y-family translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases are well known for bypassing and repairing damaged DNA in dividing cells. However, their expression, dynamics, and role if any, in enduring postmitotic differentiated neurons of the brain are completely unknown. We show through systematic longitudinal studies for the first time that DNA polymerase kappa (POLK), a member of the Y-family polymerases, is highly expressed in neurons. With chronological age, there is a progressive and significant reduction of nuclear POLK with a concomitant accumulation in the cytoplasm that is predictive of brain tissue age. The reduction of nuclear POLK in old brains is congruent with an increase in DNA damage markers. The nuclear POLK colocalizes with damaged sites and DNA repair proteins. The cytoplasmic POLK accumulates with stress granules and endo/lysosomal markers. Nuclear POLK expression is significantly higher in GABAergic interneurons compared to excitatory pyramidal neurons and lowest in non-neurons, possibly reflective of the inherent biological differences such as firing rates and neuronal activity. Interneurons associated with microglia have significantly higher levels of cytoplasmic POLK in old age. Finally, we show that neuronal activity itself can lead to an increase in nuclear POLK levels and a reduction of the cytoplasmic fraction. Our findings open a new avenue in understanding how different classes of postmitotic neurons deploy TLS polymerase(s) to maintain their genomic integrity over time, which will help design strategies for longevity, healthspan, and prevention of neurodegeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Throughout the organismal lifespan, continuous exposure to exogenous and endogenous agents can damage one or both strands of the DNA thus causing a persistent threat to genomic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Iyama and Wilson 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yan and Vaziri 2020</xref>; Chatterjee and Walker 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tubbs and Nussenzweig 2017</xref>). Due to their long lifespan, increased transcriptional activity, and large energy demands, neurons are highly susceptible to cumulative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Welch and Tsai 2022</xref>; Caldecott, Ward, and Nussenzweig 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wu et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Reid et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Madabhushi, Pan, and Tsai 2014</xref>). Neuronal genomic enhancer regions are hotspots for constant high levels of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) repair synthesis process, thus revealing that neurons are undergoing localized and continuous DNA breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Reid et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wu et al. 2021</xref>). In addition, the threat of genomic instability can also be contributed by normal “programmed” DNA breaks like topoisomerase-induced breaks for the removal of topological stress during transcription. High levels of such programmed DNA breakage occur in neurons, during development, differentiation, and maintenance (Caldecott, Ward, and Nussenzweig 2022). Recently, it was shown that programmed SSBs in the enhancer regions can be repaired by Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP1) and X-ray cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1)-mediated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wu et al. 2021</xref>). XRCC1 is a DNA repair scaffold protein that plays a role in multiple repair pathways including base excision repair (BER) and single-strand break repair (SSBR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">London 2020</xref>). Due to high mitochondrial activity in the neurons, which consumes about 20% of the body’s oxygen supply (Attwell and Laughlin 2001), neurons exhibit high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DNA damage. ROS can damage DNA by oxidizing bases and creating abasic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lindahl and Barnes 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Madabhushi, Pan, and Tsai 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tubbs and Nussenzweig 2017</xref>). One of the most common ROS-induced DNA modifications is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8oxo-dG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amente et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ding, Fleming, and Burrows 2017</xref>), a lesion that is often resolved through BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Markkanen 2017</xref>). Unrepaired SSBs hinder transcription and can also lead to DSBs. A strong association exists between unrepaired DNA damage causing loss of genomic integrity with aging and neurodegeneration (Caldecott, Ward, and Nussenzweig 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Welch and Tsai 2022</xref>). Hence, survival strategies have evolved to preserve genomic stability through multiple DNA damage response (DDR) pathways allowing the neurons to function effectively. Impaired DDR leads to genomic instability triggering signaling cascades, stalling transcription, and creating mutagenesis, thus altering the cellular fate toward anomalous cell cycle activation, apoptosis, or senescence, which are hallmarks of aging and age-associated diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoeijmakers 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Madabhushi, Pan, and Tsai 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chow and Herrup 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">McKinnon 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tubbs and Nussenzweig 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Welch and Tsai 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>One unique mechanism that bypasses DNA adducts, synthesizes DNA past damage, and functions in post-replication DNA repair is through translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sale, Lehmann, and Woodgate 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gao et al. 2017</xref>; Powers and Washington 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lehmann 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Paniagua and Jacobs 2023</xref>). TLS polymerases are well-studied in dividing cells, and the Y-family TLS polymerases include Rev1, Pol kappa (Polk), Pol iota (Poli), and Pol eta (Polh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sale, Lehmann, and Woodgate 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Vaisman and Woodgate 2017</xref>). However, their role in postmitotic cells is not explored. There is evidence of the role of POLK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons upon the treatment of genotoxic agents like cisplatin where POLK is upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhuo, Gorgun, and Englander 2018</xref>) and is essential for efficiently and accurately repairing cisplatin crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jha and Ling 2018</xref>). POLK can perform error-free TLS across bulky DNA adducts at the N2 position of guanine induced by the genotoxic agent benzo[a]pyrene-dihydrodiol-epoxide (BPDE) and mitomycin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kanemaru et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ogi et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avkin et al. 2004</xref>). POLK can also bypass other DNA lesions including 8oxo-dG caused by oxidative stress in association with Werner syndrome helicase (WRN) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Haracska, Prakash, and Prakash 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Maddukuri et al. 2014</xref>) and through strand break repair mechanism (X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhang et al. 2013</xref>). <italic>Polk</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed survival defects, spontaneous mutations, and sensitivity to BPDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Stancel et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Singer, Osimiri, and Friedberg 2013</xref>). Evidence supports that POLK can function in non-S phase cells through a NER-dependent mechanism to protect from UV-induced cytotoxic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ogi and Lehmann 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sertic et al. 2018</xref>). <italic>Polk</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts were sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and showed defects in both SSB and DSB repair, suggesting that Polk may have an important role in the oxidative stress-induced DNA repair process (X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhang et al. 2013</xref>). Although POLK is associated with multiple DNA repair mechanisms, it remains unknown if normative age-associated DNA damage will also recruit POLK and how it may function in postmitotic neurons.</p>
<p>Unlike the long-living postmitotic neurons that endure DNA damage, the non-neuronal cells can go through the cell cycle and are replaceable. Due to the non-replicative status of differentiated neurons in mature circuits, it is critical to understand the different repair strategies and mechanisms that postmitotic neurons employ to maintain their genomic integrity, which will help design therapies for human longevity and the prevention of neurodegeneration. Here we characterize the expression of POLK in the brain, its subcellular localization, how it is altered with chronological age, cell type-specific variability, and the microglial engagement with neurons, and neuronal activity in wild-type mouse brains undergoing healthy aging under unstressed conditions.</p>

<title>A progressive age-associated shift in subcellular localization of POLK</title>
<p>POLK has been studied mostly in proliferating cells; however, its levels are found to be highest in the G0 phase of the cell cycle and upregulated upon exposure to exogeneous agent cisplatin in dorsal root neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhuo, Gorgun, and Englander 2018</xref>). Hence, we explored whether POLK is expressed in the brain, where both replicating and non-replicating cells make it a unique tissue environment. Since neurons endure an onslaught of a lifetime of DNA damage due to activity, genotoxic agents, and physiological age, we investigated if the levels of endogenous POLK in the mice brain also vary as a function of age. In addition, since POLK showed subcellular relocalization in cancer cells undergoing stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Temprine et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Paul et al. 2022</xref>), we further explored whether POLK in the brain shows similar changes during normative aging in C57BL/6J (RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664) wild-type mice. We performed immunoblots using two independently sourced antibodies against POLK on nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from cortical tissue of young 1 month, middle age 10 months, and early-old age 18 months mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Results showed a trend that with increasing age POLK levels decreased in the nuclear fraction, whereas there is a concomitant increase in cytoplasmic POLK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, S1A). However, in total cell lysate, there are no changes in POLK expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, S1B). This data suggests a potential cytoplasmic relocalization of POLK with age.</p>

<p>To confirm the biochemical result, we used an immunofluorescence (IF) assay to visualize the spatial-temporal changes of POLK with age in a healthy wild-type mouse brain. We validated the POLK antibody, previously reported in immunofluorescence assays in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Paul et al. 2022</xref>), using mouse primary neuronal culture and observed a significant decrease in POLK signal upon two independent siRNA knock-downs but not in scrambled siRNA (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1Ci</xref>). qPCR analysis showed a 35% reduction in <italic>Polk</italic> mRNA level upon siRNA knock-down (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1Cii</xref>). Both antibodies showed comparable nuclear and cytoplasmic patterns and distribution of POLK in mice brains (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>). From here on onwards for all IF assays we used anti-POLK antibody SC-166667. We then conducted a longitudinal unbiased survey of POLK expression across multiple brain areas at the subcellular level. To visualize the changes in the subcellular level we developed an automated image analysis pipeline using CellProfiler (Stirling et al. 2021) that segments the nucleus and cytoplasm using the fluorescent Nissl signal that primarily stains cell bodies in brain sections (C. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Paul, Beltz, and Berger-Sweeney 2008</xref>). POLK is detected as small “speckles” inside the nucleus at a young age (1-2 months) and larger “granules” can be seen in the cytoplasm at progressively older time points (&gt;9 months) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In young brains, both the normalized counts of nuclear POLK speckles and their size are consistent across the cingulate cortex (Cg1), motor cortex (M1 and M2), and somatosensory cortex (S1). A comparison of the nuclear POLK speckle counts and size using ANCOVA shows a significant age-associated decline with medium to large effect sizes across the four brain areas surveyed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-G</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>-<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) in agreement with the immunoblot assay. On the other hand, in the cytoplasm, there is a significant age-associated accumulation of POLK in the form of increasingly larger-sized granules with decreasing total counts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F, H</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref>-<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p>

<p>To check if the age-associated decline in nuclear POLK is a more generalized phenomenon in Y-family TLS polymerases we tested the qualitative expression of REV1 and POL iota (POLI) in the mice brain. REV1 protein shows similar expression patterns as clusters of speckles inside the nucleus, a similar decline in nuclear expression, and an increase in cytoplasmic granules in M1 and S1 brain areas at 1, 10, and 18 months (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Comparatively, POLI nuclear expression showed overall lower levels, with decreased age-associated alterations in nuclear expression, however still showed age-associated cytoplasmic accumulation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref>). Antibody against Pol eta (POLH) showed a very weak signal or failed. However, data from publicly available single-cell transcriptomics corroborate low PolH transcript expression in the brain.</p>

<title>Nuclear POLK co-localizes with DNA damage response and repair proteins</title>
<p>Various pathways in the DNA damage response have evolved to detect and repair different types of lesions that threaten the genome. Among these, ROS pose a significant threat to the neurons (Attwell and Laughlin 2001), creating ROS-induced DNA modifications 8oxo-dG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lindahl and Barnes 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Madabhushi, Pan, and Tsai 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tubbs and Nussenzweig 2017</xref>). Repair of 8oxo-dG lesions primarily occurs through BER, where a glycosylase enzyme identifies and removes the damaged base, followed by cleavage of the DNA backbone by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), resulting in a single-strand break (SSB). This intermediate can then be processed by polymerase beta (POLb) which fills in the gap with the correct nucleotide, and the nick is sealed by ligase III (LIG3). Along with single-strand breaks (SSBs), double-strand breaks (DSBs) are more harmful due to their potential for toxicity. Despite this toxicity, DSBs also play crucial roles in cellular physiology. For instance, neurons require DSBs to facilitate the expression of immediate early genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Suberbielle et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Madabhushi et al. 2015</xref>; Alt and Schwer 2018), particularly through transcriptional activity in postmitotic neurons. Additionally, SSBs may also lead to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cannan and Pederson 2016</xref>). DSB repair in postmitotic cells is predominantly managed by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. In canonical NHEJ, DSBs are initially recognized and bound at their ends by KU70/80 and DNA-dependent protein kinase (PRKDC). Subsequently, they are directly reconnected through ligation mediated by Ligase IV (LIG4), X-Ray Repair Cross Complementing 4 (XRCC4), and XRCC4-like factor (XLF). At DSB sites, the protein kinase ATM phosphorylates numerous downstream substrates such as histone variant H2A.X, that form gH2AX foci, which are docking sites for DNA repair proteins like p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) that promote NHEJ mediated DSB repair (Mirman and Lange 2020, 5353; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Panier and Boulton 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>There are hints that TLS polymerases including POLK play a role in NHEJ and BER in dividing cells, for example, POLK inserts the correct base opposite the 8oxo-dG lesion and extends from dC:8oxo-dG base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Maddukuri et al. 2014</xref>). We previously identified DNA repair pathway proteins by performing iPoKD -MS (isolation of proteins on <underline>Po</underline>l <underline>k</underline>appa synthesized <underline>D</underline>NA followed by mass spectrometry), where proteins were captured and bound to the nascent DNA synthesized by Polk in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Paul et al. 2022</xref>). Hence, we tested whether neuronal nuclear POLK is associated with BER and NHEJ pathway proteins identified in our iPoKD-MS data sets. We tested 5 NHEJ pathway markers and 4 BER pathway markers at middle age (9-12 months), in the wild-type mouse brain cortex and analyzed the colocalization of these proteins and the markers at the nuclear POLK sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Images from the mouse cortex with at least 3 biological replicates per age group were parsed into excitatory pyramidal neurons (PN) and inhibitory interneurons (IN). Nissl+, NeuN+, Gad67+ cells were labeled as IN class and Nissl+, NeuN+, Gad67-as PN class neurons. Each IN and PN class cell bodies were subcellularly segmented into nucleus and cytoplasm and individual nuclear POLK speckles were identified. NHEJ and BER marker intensities were then measured within each nuclear POLK speckles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>In middle age, for both IN and PN classes, we observed that POLK intensity positively correlated with DSB marker gH2AX (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>1-2), NHEJ markers 53BP1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>1-2) and PRKDC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>1), and ROS-mediated damage marker 8oxo-dG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>1-2). Interestingly, BER pathway marker APE1 and to a lesser degree LIG3 were only present in POLK speckles in INs but not in PNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>2-3). In the NHEJ pathway only PRKDC showed high colocalization with nuclear POLK in both IN and PN, but other NHEJ proteins like KU70 and XRCC4, did not colocalize and their intensities were not correlated with POLK levels (FigureS2).</p>
<p>Since both gH2AX and 8oxo-dG were positively associated with the nuclear POLK speckles we wanted to examine if their colocalization and intensity correlation with POLK levels varies with progressive age. So, we further tested early-old (18 months) and late-old (24-27 months) time points. This showed that the temporal profile of gH2AX and 8oxo-dG association with POLK are distinct. Broadly, peak colocalization of gH2AX in POLK speckles was at the early-old time point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>3), whereas the presence of 8oxo-dG in POLK speckles declines in early-old age but strikingly increases in the late-old age group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>3). The temporal profile of gH2AX intensities in POLK speckles and gH2AX-POLK correlation was mirrored by 53BP1, which is well-known to promote DSB repair through NHEJ pathway, suggesting higher levels of DSBs at early-old age and spatio-temporal association of POLK. In addition, though both INs and PNs showed similar profiles, nuclear POLK speckles had consistently higher levels of gH2AX intensities in INs compared to PNs with the large effect size for 53BP1, throughout all three age groups studied (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>3), suggesting that nuclear POLK plays a role at DSB sites in INs more compared to PNs. In contrast, there was a smaller difference to ROS induced 8oxo-dG intensities between IN and PNs as well as decreased 8oxo-dG intensities in middle age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>3). We observed POLK association with BER proteins in middle age and reduction in ROS-induced DNA damage, suggesting that POLK plays a role in BER pathway during middle age mostly in INs compared to PNs, and this capacity of POLK is lost with aging.</p>

<title>POLK in the cytoplasm is associated with stress granules and lysosomes in old brains</title>
<p>During the process of aging, protein homeostasis is known to be reduced causing widespread intracellular protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Taylor and Dillin 2011</xref>). A decline in the protein quality control system has been shown to impact the assembly and dynamic maintenance of stress granules (SGs) leading to increased cellular aggregation. SG are nonmembrane assemblies of untranslated mRNAs, RNA-binding proteins, protein translation factors and many non-RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cao, Jin, and Liu 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Guzikowski, Chen, and Zid 2019</xref>), which can be induced by oxidative stress and other stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Federico et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gandhi and Abramov 2012</xref>; Patten et al. 2010). Since we observed that with increasing age gH2AX and 8oxo-dG are elevated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>1-3, 2E1-3), and POLK increasingly accumulates in the cytoplasm as &quot;granules&quot; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-H</xref>), we hypothesized that cytoplasmic POLK may be present with SG. Ras-GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a key player in SG assembly often referred to as SG nucleator (Sidibé, Dubinski, and Vande Velde 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aulas et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sahoo et al. 2018</xref>), hence we tested if cytoplasmic POLK granules colocalize with G3BP1. Further, an emerging theme in aging is that oxidative stress acts as an independent aging factor corrupting lysosome acidification leading to reduced proteolytic susceptibility of the proteins delivered to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nixon 2020</xref>). So, we also tested colocalization with an established endo/lysosomal marker protein lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1).</p>
<p>To characterize the nature of subcellular cytoplasmic POLK granules, we co-immunostained with SG protein G3BP1 and lysosomal protein LAMP1. In young (1-month) brains, there was a minimal expression G3BP1, however by the early-old stage (18 months) cytoplasmic POLK is almost entirely colocalized with both G3BP1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, S3A) and LAMP1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, S3B) in the cytoplasm indicating that older neurons are actively accumulating non-nuclear POLK in stress granules and endo/lysosome. This suggests that with age nuclear POLK accumulates in the cytoplasmic SG and endo/lysosome.</p>

<title>Differentially altered POLK subcellular expression amongst excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal cells in the cortex</title>
<p>To further test if the subcellular shift in POLK impacts all cells uniformly, we performed immunostaining of young (1 month) and old (19-24 months) brains to segregate excitatory pyramidal neurons (PN), inhibitory interneurons (IN), and non-neuronal (NN) cells in the mouse cortex. Brain sections were co-immunostained with i) anti-NeuN to detect pan-neuronal protein RBFOX3, ii) anti-GAD67 to detect GABAergic neurons, iii) fluorescent Nissl to label all cells, and iv) anti-POLK to measure subcellular POLK levels. Our original image quantitation pipeline was modified to register cells positive for GAD67, NeuN, and Nissl as GABAergic interneurons (IN), NeuN and Nissl positives as glutamatergic excitatory pyramidal neurons (PN), and Nissl positives only as non-neuronal (NN) cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The INs and PNs were further segmented into their nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments whereas NN subcellular segmentation was not implemented as their nucleus occupies most of the cellular morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">García-Cabezas et al. 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Hence in NN, the POLK signal was considered to primarily represent the nuclear compartment. We restricted our survey to the GABAergic inhibitory and glutamatergic excitatory neurons in cortical areas M1 and S1, which have extremely low (&lt;0.01%) cholinergic and almost no dopaminergic, serotonergic, glycinergic, and histaminergic neuronal cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al. 2023</xref>). Strikingly, at all ages across the cortical areas observed, the nuclear POLK signal was consistently highest in the cell group identified as INs, followed by PNs and NNs.

<title>Microglia associated with IN and PN have significantly higher levels of cytoplasmic POLK</title>
<p>Synapses and cell bodies are removed by brain microglia and activated microglia have been associated with various neurological disorders. To test if neurons with higher cytoplasmic POLK granules are vulnerable to microglia engagement, we surveyed by immunostaining with microglia marker protein IBA1 in middle (11 months), early-old (18 months) and late-old (24-27 months) time points. Images were analyzed to register IBA1+ cells as microglia (MG class), GAD67+, NeuN+, and Nissl+ cells as IN class and NeuN+, Gad67-, and Nissl+ cells as PN class (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). IN or PNs where MG cells are overlapping or in contact are scored as MG-tied IN or MG-tied PN, and IN and PN cell bodies that are removed by more than one MG cell body length are scored MG-free IN and MG-free PN (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Overall as expected, MGs are more prevalent at older ages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). We then compared the cytoplasmic POLK levels between the MG-tied IN and MG-free INs as well as MG-tied and MG-free PNs. Interestingly, middle and early-old MG-tied INs have significantly more cytoplasmic POLK compared to MG-free INs and MG-free PNs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) and higher cytoplasmic POLK granule counts in the early-old age (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>). However, this effect is lost in late-old age (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), likely due to the MG-mediated removal of the INs. Such differences were not noted in nuclear POLK counts between MG-tied and MG-free INs and PNs (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>).

<title>Subcellular localization of POLK is regulated by neuronal activity</title>
<p>Neuronal activity is essential for proper neuronal maturation and circuit plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yap and Greenberg 2018</xref>). High metabolic demands during increased neuronal activity can generate oxidative damage to actively transcribed regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al. 2004</xref>). Neuronal activity-induced transcription has been linked with the generation of repeated DSBs at gene regulatory elements, potentially contributing to genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Welch and Tsai 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Suberbielle et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Madabhushi et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Delint-Ramirez et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Crowe et al. 2006</xref>). Although the coupling of transcription to DNA breaks occurs in all cell types, this process is especially challenging to long-lived neurons that are postmitotic and cannot use replication-dependent DNA repair pathways. With limited regenerative capacity, neurons are unable to replace the damaged cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Iyama and Wilson 2013</xref>). Recently, a neuronal-specific complex NPAS4–NuA4 was identified to be bound to recurrently damaged regulatory elements and recruits additional DNA repair machinery to stimulate the repair, thus coupling neuronal activity to DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pollina et al. 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Since we observed a decrease in nuclear POLK and concomitant increase in cytoplasmic POLK with age, as well as nuclear POLK to be associated with BER and NHEJ DNA repair pathways in the mice brain, we tested if POLK subcellular localization can be regulated by neuronal activity and if this regulation is influenced by age. For this, we tested two age groups, young (1 month) where POLK was mostly localized in the nucleus as &quot;speckles&quot; and early-old (18 month) brains. Following slice electrophysiology protocol, mouse brains were extracted, and fresh tissue was sectioned coronally and immersed in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) and maintained at physiological temperature. Coronal sections from the same brain were split into two groups. The control group was maintained in ACSF, and the treatment group was exposed to a bath application of kainic acid (KA), a glutamate receptor agonist that synchronously depolarizes neurons, dissolved in ACSF. Sections were exposed for a duration of 80 mins and 160 mins, tissue was fixed to terminate the experiment followed by measurement of c-FOS and POLK protein levels in cells by IF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). c-FOS protein is known to be translated at 90 mins sustaining for 2-5 hours upon neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hudson 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kovács 1998</xref>), and we observed a robust increase in c-FOS intensity in the nucleus at 160 mins in both young and early-old age groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, at 160 mins we observed a significant increase in nuclear POLK speckle counts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) and a concomitant decrease in cytoplasmic POLK granules (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) in young mice brains. However, such changes in POLK levels were not observed in early-old brains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>). Since, we did not distinguish between IN, PN, and NN classes, we cannot exclude the possibility of even higher differences in activity-induced POLK subcellular localization amongst different cell classes. Thus, this data provides the first evidence of a member of the TLS family to be regulated by neuronal activity likely to retain POLK in the nucleus for activity-induced DNA repair process, a capacity that is lost with aging.</p>

<title>POLK as an endogenous “aging clock” for brain tissue</title>
<p>There have been multiple approaches towards estimating biological age using “aging clocks” using sequencing, from tissue and body fluids using epigenetic marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grodstein et al. 2020</xref>) and multi-omics approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nie et al. 2022</xref>). Further genomic instability is increasingly associated with neuronal activity and aging, with Progeroid syndromes are often linked to compromised genomic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gurkar and Niedernhofer 2015</xref>). However, there is a lack of <italic>in situ</italic> methods to determine age from tissues. Hence, we hypothesized that it may be possible to leverage the protein expression of POLK to determine the biological age of brain tissue sections. Specifically, we tested if the naturally occurring shift in the subcellular localization of POLK can be a learnable feature that can predict organismal age from brain sections. For this, we used two related ensemble-based classifiers Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine where 80% of the data was used for training and validation, and then tested on 20% hold-out group. We used data from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and parameters like nuclear and cytoplasmic POLK counts, nuclear area, cytoplasmic area, and replicates were tested to examine if organismal age is discernible. We found that it is indeed possible to predict 1-month, 10-month, and 18-month-old brains with ROC values &gt;0.8 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>1 and A2). Cytoplasmic and nuclear POLK counts were the top features that drove node purity in Random Forest or relative influence in the Boosting classifier. In addition, using data and parameters from <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, where we observed the association of MG with increased cytoplasmic POLK in IN-class, we tested if finer distinctions between middle, early-old, and late-old age groups are possible. Both Random Forest and Boosting classifiers were again able to distinguish between these three age groups with AUROC &gt; 0.8, with cytoplasmic POLK median intensity and cytoplasmic granule counts per unit area as the top influencing factors (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>3 and A4).</p>

Despite evidence of mRNA expression of the Y-family TLS polymerase <italic>Polk</italic> in IN and PN sub-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tasic et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Paul et al. 2017</xref>), the role of POLK in postmitotic cells has not yet been explored in the central nervous system (CNS). There is only one study of POLK in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), whereupon cisplatin treatment <italic>Polk</italic> mRNA was upregulated in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhuo, Gorgun, and Englander 2018</xref>), and POLK was found essential for efficiently and accurately repairing cisplatin crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jha and Ling 2018</xref>). In a cell-free system, POLK faithfully bypasses 8oxo-dG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Maddukuri et al. 2014</xref>), which is a major DNA lesion in the neurons. Interestingly, <italic>Polk</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed decreased survival compared to wild-type (WT) and heterozygous littermates, and increased levels of spontaneous mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Stancel et al. 2009</xref>). Separately, inactivated <italic>Polk</italic> knock-in mice showed a higher frequency of mutations, micronucleated cells, and DNA damage marker gH2AX foci compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Takeiri et al. 2014</xref>). In these studies, the effect of <italic>Polk</italic><sup>−/−</sup> was not explored in the brain. However, <italic>ApoE−/−;Polk−/−</italic> mice showed enhanced DNA mutagenesis in several organs including the brain probably due to cholesterol-induced adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Singer, Osimiri, and Friedberg 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that DNA damage markers 8oxo-dG and gH2AX are highly correlated with aging, and Polk is associated with multiple DNA repair mechanisms, as well as POLK can function in non-S phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ogi and Lehmann 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sertic et al. 2018</xref>), however, it remained unknown if normative age-associated DNA damage will also recruit POLK and how it may function in postmitotic neurons. This is the first systematic and longitudinal study of Y-family TLS polymerase focusing mostly on the POLK in postmitotic neurons.</p>
<p>Here, we found that Y-family TLS polymerases including POLK are highly expressed in several cortical brain areas with characteristic nuclear speckle-like distribution, reminiscent of nuclear foci in dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bi et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bergoglio et al. 2002</xref>). Surprisingly, we noted that even in the absence of any exogenous chemical or behavioral stressors, in wild-type mice, POLK in neurons localizes to the cytoplasm at least as early as 10-11 months (middle age) and continues to do so with further normative aging. In fact, this nuclear to cytoplasm POLK relocalization signal is so robust and reproducible that we could train two ensemble learning models to predict the age of the mouse brain, where cytoplasmic and nuclear POLK counts were the primary featured drivers. Both learning models performed comparatively well, with possible applications as <italic>in situ</italic> immunofluorescence-based physiological “aging clocks”. This can be complementary to existing sequencing-based epigenetic clocks (de Lima Camillo, Lapierre, and Singh 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bell et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Prosz et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Griffin et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Varshavsky et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kerepesi et al. 2021</xref>), allowing simultaneous visual read-out of brain tissue age while scoring for various markers for neurodegeneration, cell stress, and age-associated neuropathologies. We believe other TLS proteins may behave similarly and a combinatorial approach can even increase the age-predictive power. We were able to make even finer distinctions among middle, early, and late-old stages using the cytoplasmic POLK intensity signal.</p>
<p>Our findings showing progressive loss of nuclear POLK and accumulation in the cytoplasm suggest nuclear POLK plays an important role in protecting neurons from DNA damage at a young age. Decline of nuclear POLK is likely correlated with lack of repair leading to DNA damage accumulation during the normative aging process. Our data further confirms nuclear POLK is associated with neuronal DNA damage as observed by colocalization with DSB (gH2AX) and ROS-mediated DNA damage sites (8oxo-dG), as well as POLK’s role in the BER (colocalization with APE1 and LIG3) and NHEJ repair pathways (53BP1 and PRKDC) in the neurons. Association with PRKDC further suggests POLK’s role in the &quot;gap-filling&quot; step in the NHEJ repair pathway in neurons.</p>
<p>An enduring question revolves around the differential vulnerability of neuronal subtypes to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Welch and Tsai 2022</xref>). Remarkably, we observed POLK’s nuclear expression to be cell class-specific, with the highest levels in INs followed by PN and NN. INs and PNs engage in highly demanding cellular functions, both transcriptionally and energetically. While other important and more abundant cell types in the nervous system, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, collectively grouped in this study as NN are also vulnerable to DNA damage, but their characteristics differ significantly from neurons. For instance, NNs can be dispensed as they are largely renewable, possess relatively lower energy demands due to slower physiological kinetics, and can re-enter the cell cycle when necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Welch and Tsai 2022</xref>). These attributes are thought to collectively lessen the dependence of DNA damage repair in glial cells compared to neurons. Hence the observed lowest nuclear expression of POLK in NN at face value can be reconciled with their known biology. On the other hand, a significant fraction of the IN-types like PV basket cells, Chandelier cells, and Martinotti cells across cortical areas have fast-firing kinetics and hence are energetically more demanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Markram et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tremblay, Lee, and Rudy 2016</xref>) arguably accumulating more damage and DNA adducts may require the higher nuclear POLK presence. Here too, the disparity of nuclear POLK was reproducible enough across young and older ages that measuring the nuclear POLK speckle counts per unit area can predict cell class identity using ensemble learning with consistently high AUROC values exceeding 0.8.</p>
<p>The association between neurons harboring DNA damage, age-associated neuroinflammation, and cell-type vulnerability is an important piece of the puzzle to understand age-associated neurodegeneration under normal physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Welch and Tsai 2022</xref>). We observed progressive accumulation of cytoplasmic POLK in stress granules and endo/lysosomal compartments with age. Interestingly, microglia-associated INs labeled as MG-tied INs, have significantly higher cytoplasmic POLK suggesting they are more vulnerable to cumulative age-associated changes. One possibility is that the decline in nuclear POLK in INs causes a reduction in DNA repair that may further initiate cGAS-STING immune signaling thereby recruiting microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gulen et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Talbot et al. 2023</xref>) or higher levels of cytoplasmic POLK may itself lead to immune activation. Further in-depth molecular mechanistic studies are needed to dissect POLK’s role in neuronal cell class-specific genome maintenance and how it intersects with microgliosis during aging.</p>
<p>Another factor contributing to the heightened vulnerability of neurons to genomic damage is their involvement in functional processes like neuronal activity. Such as induced activity of primary neurons with bicuculline or exposure of mice to fear learning was shown to generate DSBs at the promoters of immediate-early genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Madabhushi et al. 2015</xref>; Stott, Kritsky, and Tsai 2021) and even mice experiencing a new environment can induce DSBs in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Suberbielle et al. 2013</xref>). These activity-induced DSBs are thought to aid in the expression of immediate early genes by swiftly resolving topological constraints at their transcription start sites. Here, we showed inducing neuronal activity in brain slices increases nuclear POLK while diminishing cytoplasmic accumulation. While it is an artificial ex-vivo scenario this approach shows that POLK at least in principle can be responsive to induced neuronal activity, and we speculate such an increase in nuclear POLK is likely to be involved in activity-induced DNA repair. However, we noticed that this effect is lost upon aging indicating some yet unknown mechanism at play that remains to be elucidated. Thus, in our study, we provide first-time evidence of Y-family TLS polymerase, POLK’s differential expression in CNS cell classes, and its age-associated and activity-induced subcellular changes with implications in microgliosis under non-pathogenic aging conditions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Abdelmageed et al. investigate age-related changes in the subcellular localization of DNA polymerase kappa (POLK) in the brains of mice. POLK has been actively investigated for its role in translesion DNA synthesis and involvement in other DNA repair pathways in proliferating cells, very little is known about POLK in a tissue-specific context, let alone in post-mitotic cells. The authors investigated POLK subcellular distribution in the brains of young, middle-aged, and old mice via immunoblotting of fractioned tissue extracts and immunofluorescence (IF). Immunoblotting revealed a progressive decrease in the abundance of nuclear POLK, while cytoplasmic POLK levels concomitantly increased. Similar findings were present when IF was performed on brain sections. Further, IF studies of the cingulate cortex (Cg1), the motor cortex (M1, M2), and the somatosensory (S1) cortical regions all showed an age-related decline in nuclear POLK. Nuclear speckles of POLK decrease in each region, meanwhile, the number of cytoplasmic POLK granules decreases in all four regions, but granule size is increasing. The authors report similar findings for REV1, another Y-family DNA polymerase.</p>
<p>The authors then investigate the colocalization of POLK with other DNA damage response (DDR) proteins in either pyramidal neurons or inhibitory interneurons. At 18 months of age, DNA damage marker gH2AX demonstrated colocalization with nuclear POLK, while strong colocalization of POLK and 8-oxo-dG was present in geriatric mice. The authors find that cytoplasmic POLK granules colocalize with stress granule marker G3BP1, suggesting that the accumulated POLK ends up in the lysosome.</p>
<p>Brain regions were further stained to identify POLK patterns in NeuN+ neurons, GABAergic neurons, and other non-neuronal cell types present in the cortex. Microglia associated with pyramidal neurons or inhibitory interneurons were found to have a higher abundance of cytoplasmic POLK. The authors also report that POLK localization can be regulated by neuronal activity induced by Kainic acid treatment. Lastly, the authors suggest that POLK could serve as an aging clock for brain tissue, but POLK deserves further characterization and correlation to functional changes before being considered as a biomarker.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Investigation of TLS polymerases in specific tissues and in post-mitotic cells is largely understudied. The potential changes in sub-cellular localization of POLK and potentially other TLS polymerases open up many questions about DNA repair and damage tolerance in the brain and how it can change with age.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The work is quite novel and interesting, and the authors do suggest some potentially interesting roles for POLK in the brain, but these are in and of themselves a bit speculative. The majority of the findings of this paper draw upon findings from POLK antibody and its presumed specificity for POLK. However, this antibody has not been fully validated and needs further work. Further validation experiments using Polk-deficient or knocked-down cells to investigate antibody specificity for both immunoblotting and immunofluorescence should be performed. More mechanistic investigation is needed before POLK could be considered as a brain aging clock.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Abdelmageed et al., demonstrate POLK expression in nervous tissue and focus mainly on neurons. Here they describe an exciting age-dependent change in POLK subcellular localization, from the nucleus in young tissue to the cytoplasm in old tissue. They argue that the cytosolic POLK is associated with stress granules. They also investigate the cell-type specific expression of POLK, and quantitate expression changes induced by cell-autonomous (activity) and cell nonautonomous (microglia) factors.</p>
<p>I think it is an interesting report but requires a few more experiments to support their findings in the latter half of the paper. Additionally, a more mechanistic understanding of the pathways regulating POLK dynamics between the nucleus and cytosol, what is POLK doing in the cytosol, and what is it interacting with; would greatly increase the impact of this report. However, additional mechanistic experiments are mostly not needed to support much of the currently presented results, again, it would simply increase the impact.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors show that DNA polymerase kappa POLK relocalizes in the cytoplasm as granules with age in mice. The reduction of nuclear POLK in old brains is congruent with an increase in DNA damage markers. The cytoplasmic granules colocalize with stress granules and endo-lysosome. The study proposes that protein localization of POLK could be used to determine the biological age of brain tissue sections.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Very few studies focus on the POLK protein in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The microscopy approach used here is also very relevant: it allows the authors to highlight a radical change in POLK localization (nuclear versus cytoplasmic) depending on the age of the neurons.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the study are strong. Several types of neurones are compared, the colocalization with several proteins from the NHEJ and BER repair pathways is tested, and microscopy images are systematically quantified.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors do not discuss the physical nature of POLK granules. There is a large field of research dedicated to the nature and function of condensates: in particular numerous studies have shown that some condensates but not all exhibit liquid-like properties (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2017.7">https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2017.7</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33510441/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33510441/</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/13/10/1846">https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/13/10/1846</ext-link>). The change of physical properties of condensates is particularly important in cells undergoing stress and during aging. The authors should discuss this literature.</p>

<body>
<p>We sincerely thank all the reviewers for their enthusiasm and positive feedback, which has encouraged us to delve deeper into this research. As this is the first report of POLK in the brain using a longitudinal normative aging model, our primary aim was to establish the observational and phenomenological aspects. We agree with the reviewers that more detailed molecular, biochemical, and cellular studies are essential to elucidate underlying mechanisms. However, as noted by some reviewers, these investigations, while they will raise the impact, may fall outside the scope of the current report. Indeed, many of these lines of investigation are currently ongoing. Below, we provide our provisional responses to individual reviewer comments.</p>
<p><bold>Response to Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>a) Concern over POLK antibody characterization in mice:</p>
<p>We performed knocking down of POLK by siRNA in mice cortical primary neuronal culture (Fig S1C). In the revised version, we will provide a more detailed characterization of POLK antibodies in mouse cells.</p>
<p>b) More mechanistic investigation is needed before POLK could be considered as a brain aging clock:</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the valuable suggestion. In our ongoing work exploring the mechanisms of POLK in postmitotic neurons, preliminary findings using siPOLK indicate an upregulation of senescence markers along with a reduction in DNA repair synthesis (manuscript in preparation). We will reference this companion manuscript in the revised version and are pleased to share these data with the reviewers for their consideration.</p>
<p><bold>Response to Reviewer #2:</bold>  </p>
<p>
a) Concern on more mechanistic understanding of the pathways regulating POLK dynamics between the nucleus and cytosol:</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s enthusiasm and valuable guidance in helping us better understand the mechanism of nuclear-cytoplasmic POLK dynamics. Previously, we developed a modified aniPOND (accelerated native isolation of proteins on nascent DNA) protocol, which we termed iPoKD-MS (isolation of proteins on Pol kappa synthesized DNA  followed by mass spectrometry), to capture proteins bound to nascent DNA synthesized by POLK in human cell lines (bioRxiv <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.27.513845v3">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.27.513845v3</ext-link>). In this dataset, we identified potential candidates that may regulate nuclear/cytoplasmic POLK dynamics. These candidates are currently undergoing validation in human cell lines, and we are preparing a manuscript on these findings. Among these, some candidates, including previously identified proteins such as exportin and importin (Temprine et al., 2020, PMID: 32345725), are being explored further as potential POLK nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttles. We are also conducting tests on these candidates in mouse cortical primary neurons to assess their role in POLK dynamics. In the revised version of the manuscript, we will include a discussion of our current understanding and outline our planned studies.</p>
<p>b) Question on “… what is POLK doing in the cytosol, and what is it interacting with …”:</p>
<p>Our data so far indicate that POLK accumulates in stress granules and lysosomes. We are very grateful for the reviewer’s insightful suggestions and will make every effort to incorporate them in the revised manuscript. Currently, we are characterizing POLK accumulation in the cytoplasm using additional lysosomal markers, as recommended by the reviewer. If these experiments prove challenging in mouse brain tissues, we plan to investigate them in primary neuron cultures. We are hopeful to include these findings in the revised version. Additionally, we have optimized the POLK antibody for immunoprecipitation from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of mouse brain tissue. These findings, which are beyond the scope of the current study, will be reported in a separate manuscript.</p>
<p><bold>Response to Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>We highly appreciate the reviewer bringing up the context of biomolecular condensates. Our iPoKD-MS data referenced above suggests candidates from various biomolecular condensates that we are currently investigating. We are currently investigating by subcellular fractionation the presence of POLK in different biomolecular condensates that will be fully reported in future publications. We appreciate the reviewer providing important literature that will be cited and potential biomolecular condensates will be discussed in the revised version.</p>
