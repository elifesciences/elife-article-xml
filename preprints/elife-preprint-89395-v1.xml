<title>Abstract</title>
<p>CD4 T follicular helper cells (T<sub>fh</sub>) are essential for establishing serological memory and have distinct helper attributes that impact both the quantity and quality of the antibody response. Insights into T<sub>fh</sub> subsets that promote antibody persistence and functional capacity can critically inform vaccine design. Based on the T<sub>fh</sub> profiles evoked by the live attenuated measles virus vaccine, renowned for its ability to establish durable humoral immunity, we investigated the potential of a T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 recall response during the boost phase to enhance persistence of HIV-1 Envelope (Env) antibodies in rhesus macaques. Using a DNA-prime encoding gp160 antigen and T<sub>fh</sub> polarizing cytokines (interferon protein-10 (IP-10) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)), followed by a gp140 protein boost formulated in a cationic liposome-based adjuvant (CAF01), we successfully generated germinal center (GC) T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 cells. In contrast, a similar DNA-prime (including IP-10) followed by gp140 formulated with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)+QS-21 adjuvant predominantly induced GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells. While the generation of GC T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 cells with CAF01 and GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells with MPLA+QS-21 induced comparable peak Env antibodies, the latter group demonstrated significantly greater antibody concentrations at week 8 after final immunization which persisted up to 30 weeks (gp140 IgG ng/ml- MPLA; 5500; CAF01, 2155; p &lt;0.05). Notably, interferon γ+ Env-specific T<sub>fh</sub> responses were consistently higher with gp140 in MPLA+QS-21 and positively correlated with Env antibody persistence. These findings suggest that vaccine platforms maximizing GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 induction promote persistent Env antibodies, important for protective immunity against HIV.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite options for testing and treatment, progress against HIV is slowing, emphasizing the urgent need for an HIV vaccine(<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Fauci 2017</xref>, <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Eisinger and Fauci 2018</xref>). While advances have been made in immunogen design and vaccine approaches, the main challenge lies in generating durable, high-affinity antibodies against the HIV-1 Envelope (Env) glycoprotein, crucial for protection. To design a vaccine that confers long-term protective immunity, effective stimulation of CD4 T follicular helper (T<sub>fh</sub>) cells is essential, as they provide vital costimulatory and cytokine support to B cells within germinal centers (GC), leading to the production of persistent antibodies following immunization (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Slifka, Antia et al. 1998</xref>, <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Crotty 2014</xref>). T<sub>fh</sub> cells possess distinctive T<sub>h</sub>1, T<sub>h</sub>2, and T<sub>h</sub>17-type cell attributes, programmed by the inflammatory response during the T-cell priming phase, with each T<sub>fh</sub> subset differentially contributing to GC B cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Morita, Schmitt et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Barbet, Sander et al. 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Gao, Luo et al. 2023</xref>). Therefore, in addition to antigen selection, promoting the differentiation and expansion of optimal T<sub>fh</sub> subsets to generate potent and enduring humoral immunity is critical for vaccine design. Guiding the type of adaptive response to produce the most effective forms of immunity for each specific pathogen achieve qualitative alteration of the immune response. For vaccines currently under development, adjuvants are increasingly used to promote types of immunity not effectively generated by the nonadjuvanted antigens. For example, adjuvants have been used in preclinical and clinical studies to: (1) provide functionally appropriate types of immune response (e.g., T helper 1 [T<sub>h</sub>1] cell versus T<sub>h</sub>2 cell, CD8<sup>+</sup> versus CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, specific antibody isotypes). Clinical studies have demonstrated that booster immunization with a T<sub>h</sub>1 glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant-stable emulsion (GLA-SE)-formulated malaria antigen leads to enhanced antibodies at memory time points compared to an aluminum adjuvanted vaccine(<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Hill, Pierson et al. 2019</xref>). We demonstrated that promoting the induction of T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells by utilizing interferon-induced protein (IP)10, a ligand for and an inducer of CXCR3, as a molecular adjuvant to a DNA vaccine (DNAIP10) followed by boosting with protein adjuvanted with Army Liposome Formulation (ALFQ) consisting of liposomal monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) plus a saponin derivative, QS-21 (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Alving, Peachman et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Rao, Onkar et al. 2018</xref>) enhanced GC responses, increased HIV anti-Env binding antibodies, and stimulated significantly higher cross-clade reactivity with increased specificity to V1V2 conformational epitopes, and higher avidity (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Verma, Schmidt et al. 2019</xref>). Similarly, a recent macaque study utilizing Clade C DNA+GLA-SE adjuvanted Env protein immunization revealed that frequencies of Env-specific CD28+ IFNγ+ cells, indicative of T<sub>h</sub>1 responses, correlated with the development of Env antibodies following the final immunization (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Felber, Lu et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to IFNγ, interleukin 17 (IL-17) has been shown to enhance cognate T-B cell interactions, leading to an effective GC response (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">Moyron-Quiroz, Rangel-Moreno et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Mitsdoerffer, Lee et al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Kumar, Chen et al. 2013</xref>). Studies conducted in mice have further demonstrated that T<sub>fh</sub>17 cells support efficient antibody recall responses (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Gao, Luo et al. 2023</xref>). Notably, the persistence of peripheral T<sub>fh</sub>17 cells specific to measles has been observed in adults who have received the live attenuated measles virus vaccine (LAMV) during childhood, suggesting that measles vaccine triggers T<sub>fh</sub>17 responses which persist beyond the GC phase (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Gao, Luo et al. 2023</xref>). Intriguingly, earlier studies exploring peripheral CD4 T cell determinants of serological memory elicited by LAMV have led to the hypothesis that LAMV promotes both T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 CD4 differentiation programs, based on production of IFNγ<sup>+</sup> and IL-4, which are cytokines also produced by T<sub>fh</sub> cells (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Ovsyannikova, Dhiman et al. 2003</xref>) (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Ward and Griffin 1993</xref>, <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Ovsyannikova, Reid et al. 2003</xref>). However, our understanding of the GC T<sub>fh</sub> cell response to LAMV, which plays a crucial role in establishing long-term immunity against measles, remains incomplete.</p>
<p>In this study, based on GC T<sub>fh</sub> profiles evoked by LAMV, we explored the potential of a T<sub>fh</sub>1 or mixed T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 targeted vaccine to enhance HIV-1 Env antibodies in rhesus macaques using an DNA-prime/protein boost approach. After booster immunization with a Clade C gp140 protein formulated in CAF01(Wø<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">rzner, Hvannastein et al. 2021</xref>), a cationic liposome-based formulation, we observed the generation of T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 cells within GCs, while T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells were induced when monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)+QS-21 was used as the adjuvant. Notably, stimulating T<sub>fh</sub>1 cell induction with MPLA resulted in significantly greater antibody persistence at week 8 and up to 30 weeks after the final immunization. Moreover, the T<sub>fh</sub>1 regimen with MPLA adjuvant led to higher tier 1 neutralization titers, increased levels of IgG1 subclass antibodies, and improved antibody effector functions. These findings highlight a unique potential of T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells in promoting humoral immunity against HIV and suggest that vaccine strategies maximizing T<sub>fh</sub>1 cell induction may hold promise for eliciting durable protective immunity against HIV.</p>

<title>GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 and GC T<sub>fh</sub>17 cells recalled by measles booster</title>
<p>To decipher the specific T<sub>h</sub> subset of T<sub>fh</sub> cells contributing to the establishment of durable serological memory, we employed live attenuated measles virus vaccine (LAMV) as a model and investigated T<sub>fh</sub> responses in peripheral blood and lymph nodes (LN) in a cohort of 16 healthy adult female rhesus macaques (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Consistent with documented evidence of long-term persistence of the memory B cell response to LAMV, rapid recall of measles virus (MeV) IgG ensued at week 2 post LAMV, irrespective of the booster interval (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). By week 20, MeV IgG concentrations displayed a 2.6-fold increase compared to baseline, signifying the efficacy of LAMV booster in generating persistent antibodies. These augmented levels of memory antibodies were accompanied by enhanced antibody avidity (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>), underscoring robustness of the humoral immune response elicited by LAMV.</p>

<p>Tracking MeV-specific T<sub>fh</sub> cells using the activation-induced marker (AIM) assay showed induction of peripheral (p)T<sub>fh</sub> cells at day 7 post-vaccination (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig Supplementary Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Confirming T<sub>fh</sub> cell induction in response to LAMV, activated pT<sub>fh</sub> cells, identified by co-expression of ICOS and Ki-67, were transiently upregulated at day 7 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref></bold>). These responding pT<sub>fh</sub> cells were PD-1+ and their frequencies at day 7, but not day 0, significantly correlated with MeV IgG at Week 20 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref></bold>). We next proceeded to analyze heterogeneity within pT<sub>fh</sub> cells with respect to expression of T<sub>h</sub>1/2/17 chemokine receptors. Our temporal analysis of the responding pT<sub>fh</sub> compartment demonstrated significant induction of CXCR3+ T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells at day 7 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref></bold>). In contrast, we observed a decrease in frequencies of CCR4-expresisng pT<sub>fh</sub>2 subsets and CCR6-expressing pT<sub>fh</sub>17 subsets. Utilizing Boolean analysis, we further identified that the majority of responding pT<sub>fh</sub> cells expressed CXCR3, indicating induction of pT<sub>fh</sub>1 cells in response to LAMV (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Expanding our investigation to include phenotypic and molecular features of CXCR5<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>++</sup> GC T<sub>fh</sub> cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>),</bold> we found predominance of CXCR3 expression within the GC T<sub>fh</sub> population. Additionally, we observed that up to 25% of GC T<sub>fh</sub> cells expressed CCR6. Notably, our analysis did not reveal substantial expression of CCR4 within GC T<sub>fh</sub> cells. Molecular analysis of sorted CXCR5+ PD-1+/++ LN T<sub>fh</sub> cells (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref></bold>) further provided insights into their functional specialization, with the induction of key transcription factors BATF and IRF4, as well as the expression of chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR6, indicating the activation of T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>17 programs within GC T<sub>fh</sub> cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J-K</xref></bold>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that both blood and GC T<sub>fh</sub> cells, during the peak effector response following LAMV immunization, exhibit a predominant T<sub>fh</sub>1 helper bias, with GC T<sub>fh</sub> cells also demonstrating a T<sub>fh</sub>17 bias.</p>

<title>HIV-1 vaccine modalities for inducing GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 and GC T<sub>fh</sub>17 subsets</title>
<p>Building on our observations made with LAMV, we next investigated the potential of fine-tuning T<sub>fh</sub> responses towards T<sub>fh</sub>1 and T<sub>fh</sub>17 profiles for generation of persistent anti-HIV-1 Env antibodies. We immunized two cohorts of rhesus macaques against HIV Env using a DNA prime and protein boost vaccination strategy tailored towards either a T<sub>fh</sub>1 (n=6) or mixed T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 (n=6) response (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold>). For both vaccine regimens, animals received an initial intradermal DNA prime vaccine encoding HIV-1 Env gp160 (C.1086C) at weeks 0, 4, 8, followed by an subcutaneous HIV C.ZA 1197MB Env gp140 protein boost vaccination at weeks 12 and 20. To tailor vaccine induced T<sub>fh</sub> responses, we included additional T<sub>fh</sub> polarizing factors with DNA prime vaccines encoding for cytokines IP-10 (T<sub>fh</sub>1 regimen) or IP-10 and IL-6 (mixed T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 regimen), coupled with corresponding gp140 protein boost formulated in either the T<sub>h</sub>1 polarizing adjuvants, MPLA+QS-21, or the T<sub>h</sub>1/17 polarizing CAF01 adjuvant platform, respectively. Over the course of both the priming and boost stages, we performed routine collection of both blood and rectal secretions from animals to assess the extent of systemic and mucosal humoral immunity elicited by the two regimens. Additionally, we collected inguinal LN biopsies and fine needle aspirates of LN (FNA) at baseline, during the DNA prime stage, and following both protein boost to comprehensively characterize vaccine-elicited GC T<sub>fh</sub> responses in draining LNs. GC responses typically peak between 2-3 weeks post first booster with more rapid recall kinetics after the second booster (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Iyer, Gangadhara et al. 2015</xref>). Our rationale for sampling LN 3 weeks following the 2<sup>nd</sup> booster was to assess whether the reported effects of CAF01 on sustained antigen release might result in GC persistence (Henriksen-<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Lacey, Christensen et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen, Wørzner et al. 202</xref>0).</p>

<title>Induction of Robust T Cell Activation in GCs with HIV-1 Env Formulated in CAF01 and MPLA+QS-21 Adjuvants</title>
<p>To gain insights into LN T<sub>fh</sub> responses induced by MPLA and CAF01 platforms, we utilized complementary approaches of situ protein expression analysis of GCs and RNA sequencing of Env-stimulated CD95+ CD4 T cells of selected animals in each vaccine group (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>).To track immunological changes within GCs, we applied the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler to assess protein expression of key immune targets longitudinally at baseline (BL, prior to DNA immunization), week 2 of protein 1 (P1w2) and week 3 of protein 2 (P2w3). We stained tissue sections with morphological markers (CD20, CD3, Ki-67) and collected circular regions of interest (ROI) based on co-localization of CD3 with CD20+ Ki-67+ GC B cells. For each tissue, two to three ROIs were selected to ensure adequate representation of GCs within each animal. This approach allowed us to accurately identify GCs and analyze protein expression of both T and B cells within these specific regions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Thirty-two protein targets were profiled simultaneously, along with isotype controls (Ms IgG1, Ms IgG2A, Rb IgG) and housekeeping proteins (S6, Histone H3, GAPDH). After applying quality control measures, we calculated the signal-to-noise ratio for each target which provided robust assessment of protein expression levels (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>-d</bold>). CD45 and B2M were among the most abundantly expressed proteins while LAG3 and PD-L1 demonstrated low signal expression. To address variations in ROI surface area and tissue quality, normalized protein expression (NPE) was calculated for each protein. NPE analysis revealed robust expression of key lineage proteins, CD45, CD20, CD3, CD4, and CD8, as well as GC markers PD-1 and Ki-67 within ROIs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). We observed notable associations between protein expression patterns within the GC microenvironment; specifically, a strong correlation between the expression of CD4 and CD20 was observed (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3E</xref></bold>). Furthermore, a significant association between the co-stimulatory molecule 4-1BB and CD4 expression (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3F</xref></bold>) was observed within the GC. Association of the innate immune protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) with both 4-1BB and CD4 expression suggested a potential interplay between innate and adaptive immune pathways within the context of GC responses. Altogether, the protein expression data provide evidence for coordinated expression of key proteins involved in GC function in both vaccine groups (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3G)</xref></bold>.</p>
<p>To identify specific proteins and pathways activated in response to vaccination, we performed differential expression analysis on a per-protein basis. We modeled NPE using a linear mixed-effect model (LMM), which allowed us to account for sampling multiple ROIs per tissue within each animal (FDR p value cut-off, &lt; 0.05). Volcano plots illustrate proteins induced at P1w2 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>) and P2w3 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>) following vaccination. Induction of 4-1BB, ICOS, PD-1, CD44 post boost indicated activation of T cells to antigen stimulation within GCs in both vaccine groups (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>). The higher relative expression of these proteins at P2w3 was consistent with the reported effects of CAF01 in GC persistence. We found that expression of the checkpoint inhibitors CTLA4 and PD-L1 was significantly reduced post CAF01 vaccination, while CD4 expression increased. In contrast, expression of the regulatory enzyme, IDO1; checkpoint inhibitor, PD-L2; and CD256 (B7-H3), and the innate sensor, STING, was significantly higher post vaccination in the MPLA group (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>, G</bold>).</p>
<p>Across vaccine regimens, significant differences were observed at P1w2 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref></bold>). Significantly higher expression of Ki-67 with MPLA compared to CAF01 was suggestive of a more rapid GC response (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the check point inhibitory receptors LAG3, CTLA4, as well as IDO1, exhibited higher expression levels with MPLA at P1w2. Importantly, no significant differences were observed at BL, validating the specificity of immune activation to vaccination. Altogether, the in-situ protein analysis indicated robust induction of GC responses across vaccine platforms with distinct qualitative and quantitative effects initiated by MPLA versus CAF01 suggesting potential differences in regulatory mechanisms and immune activation pathways between the vaccine regimens.</p>

<title>T<sub>h</sub>1 molecular programs potentiated by HIV-1 Env/MPLA+QS-21</title>
<p>To assess the extent of T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>17 programming in CD4 T cells induced by vaccination, we profiled the transcriptome of CD95+ CD4 T cells isolated from the LN. We sort purified and RNA sequenced naive (CD95-) and CD95+ CD4 T cells at BL, P1w2, and P2w3 following overnight stimulation with HIV-1 Clade C Env peptide pools. A total of 18 samples per group, which included three biological replicates per subset, were sequenced in parallel resulting in over 25 million high-quality reads per sample (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S4A-B</xref></bold>). The transcriptomes of naive versus CD95+ CD4 T cells post immunization, in alignment with their distinctive biological states, exhibited clear demarcations along distinct dimensions within the principal component analysis (PCA) plot (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Transcription factors (TF) involved in regulating distinct cellular differentiation programs were enriched in CD95+ CD4 T cells at P1w2 and P2w3. These included HOPX, IKZF2, PRDM1, RUNX2, associated with effector differentiation. Additionally, TF such as BATF, BCL6, BHLHE40, EGR2, and TOX2 involved in T<sub>fh</sub> differentiation were also identified. Furthermore, we identified genes regulating T<sub>h</sub>1 (STAT1, TBX21, EOMES), T<sub>h</sub>17 (AHR), and Treg (FOXP3, NR4A2) programs. Moreover, the expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) controlling T cell differentiation (IRF1, IRF5, IRF8) was observed, demonstrating that CD95+ cells post vaccination encompassed effector and fully differentiated CD4 T cell subsets (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We first assessed temporal changes in gene expression by focusing on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within CD95+ cells at P1w2 and P2w3, compared to BL (<bold>Venn diagram in 3D</bold>). Notably, a significantly higher level of transcriptional perturbation was observed in response to CAF01, particularly at P2w3, within both naive and CD95+ CD4 T cells (<bold>top bubble plot in 3D, S4C</bold>), suggesting that CAF01 induces extensive gene expression changes in a cell-extrinsic manner. By specifically examining genes induced exclusively in CD95+ cells, but not naive cells, at P1w2, we made several observations. The T<sub>h</sub>1 transcriptional regulator STAT1, as well as IFNγ-induced genes such as IRF7, IRF8, IFI30, XAF-1, and CXCL11, were among the most highly expressed genes in MPLA (<bold>bottom bubble plot, 3D</bold>), highlighting the activation of T<sub>h</sub>1 programs following vaccination. Indeed, interrogation of top 3 eniched pathways utilizing the Reactome database (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Fabregat, Sidiropoulos et al. 2017</xref>) revealed that genes encompassing IFNγ, IL-7, and IL-10 signaling networks were induced with MPLA at P1w2. In the CAF01 group, we observed enrichment of co-stimulatory molecules TNFRSF8 (CD30) and TNFRS13B (TACI), expressed by activated T cells, along with expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule BCL-2 and the transcription factor Foxp3.</p>
<p>Analysis of genes downregulated showed pathways regulating cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p53 were enriched with MPLA while pathways regulating cellular responses to stimuli and stress were downregulated with CAF01 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). Collectively, transcriptional profiles demonstrated activation of effector programs within CD4 T cells with common and unique pathways induced across vaccine platforms.</p>
<p>Consistent with this, CD95<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells at P1w2 and P2w3 exhibited notable clustering patterns across vaccine regimens. Particularly, tighter, and more distinct clusters were observed at P1w2 compared to P2w3 notably with CAF01 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4D-E</xref></bold>). Exploration of genes regulating T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>17 programs within CD95+ CD4 T cells at P1w2 showed that CD95+ CD4 T cells in both MPLA and CAF01 groups exhibited overlapping expression profiles, with genes regulating major classes of cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions represented. The MPLA group exhibited higher expression levels of IFN-induced chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL11, IL1 family members IL18 and IL1RAP, IL15 family members IL15 and IL15RA, as well as TNF cytokine family members FAS, TNFα, TNFRSF8 (CD30), and TNFRSF9 (4-1BB) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-H</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the CAF01 group demonstrated expression of the T<sub>h</sub>17 receptor IL23R, along with TNF family members FASLG, TNFRSF13B (TACI), TNFRSF11 (RANKL), and TNFRSF12 (DR3) within CD95+ cells with higher relative expression of IL17A observed with CAF01, indicative of T<sub>h</sub>17 responses (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4G</xref></bold>). Collectively, this gene-level analysis indicated strong engagement of T<sub>h</sub>1 molecular programs within LN CD4 T cells with MPLA.</p>

<p>To gain insights into the T<sub>fh</sub> helper profiles within the GC, we assessed the expression of CXCR3 (T<sub>fh</sub>1) and CCR6 (T<sub>fh</sub>17) on the GC T<sub>fh</sub> cells. Both adjuvants induced GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells, as evidenced by the expression of CXCR3. However, a selective increase in GC T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 cells was observed with CAF01, as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>. While the frequencies of GC T<sub>fh</sub>17 cells did not show a significant increase following immunization, Boolean analysis revealed a higher relative proportion of this subset with CAF01, along with a corresponding higher proportion of GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 subset with MPLA at P1w2, as demonstrated in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>.</p>
<p>Following the observed induction of LN T<sub>fh</sub>1 responses, we quantified the Env-specific CD4 T cell response using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). The analysis revealed higher relative frequencies of Env-specific T<sub>fh</sub> cells and Env-specific CXCR5-CD4 T cells producing IFNγ with MPLA compared to CAF01 <bold>(Supplementary Figure 5C</bold>). To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the cytokine profile within the LN T<sub>fh</sub>1 and T<sub>fh</sub>17 subsets, we assessed cytokine production after PMA/Ionomycin stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>). By utilizing the discrete expression patterns of CXCR3 and CCR6 on CXCR5+ CD4 T cells in the LN, in conjunction with the canonical cytokines IFNγ (T<sub>h</sub>1), IL-17 (T<sub>h</sub>17), and IL-21 (T<sub>fh</sub>), we made several important observations. Firstly, we found that within the T<sub>fh</sub>1 subset, IL-21+ IFNγ+ co-producing cells were more abundant, and their levels were significantly increased with MPLA stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). Conversely, within the T<sub>fh</sub>17 subset, we observed that IL-21+ IL-17+ co-producing cells were more abundant, and their levels were significantly higher in the CAF01 group. Notably, the T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 subset demonstrated the highest degree of polyfunctionality, as evidenced by the production of multiple cytokines.</p>
<p>We further analyzed the cytokine profiles by gating IFNγ and IL-21 co-producers versus IL-21 single producers. This analysis revealed that both subsets, T<sub>fh</sub>1 and T<sub>fh</sub>17, produced IL-2 and TNFα. However, IL-17 production was predominantly observed in IFNγ-negative, IL-21+ cells (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5D</xref></bold>). To assess systemic levels of IL-21, we measured serum IL-21. We found a significant induction of IL-21 in both vaccine groups at day 7 post-immunization, with no observable differences observed across the adjuvant platforms (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5E</xref></bold>). This suggests that the induction of IL-21 is a common feature of both vaccine formulations. Overall, these findings suggest that MPLA preferentially induces the production of IL-21+ IFNγ+ cells within the T<sub>fh</sub>1 subset, while CAF01 promotes the generation of IL-21+ IL-17+ cells within the T<sub>fh</sub>17 subset. Furthermore, the T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 subset exhibits the most diverse cytokine production profile among the subsets examined.</p>
<p>To investigate whether the effects of MPLA versus CAF01 adjuvants were also evident in circulating T<sub>fh</sub> counterparts, we assessed pT<sub>fh</sub> responses. We observed a significant increase in proliferating pT<sub>fh</sub> cells, with a predominant induction of pT<sub>fh</sub>1 cells similar to the phenotype observed in the LN, when MPLA was used as the adjuvant (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>). In contrast, no evidence of a T<sub>fh</sub>17 or T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 bias in pT<sub>fh</sub> cells was observed with CAF01 (data not shown).</p>
<p>To evaluate Env-specific T<sub>fh</sub> cell abundance, we utilized the AIM assay (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5F</xref></bold>). The analysis showed a higher relative induction of Env-specific T<sub>fh</sub> responses with MPLA at P1w1 but not P2w1 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>), which was further corroborated by ICS assays (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref></bold>). The frequencies of CXCR5+ cells co-producing IL-2 and IFNγ, as well as cells co-producing IL-21 and IFNγ, indicated that higher numbers of IFNγ+ Env-specific pT<sub>fh</sub> cells were induced with MPLA at P1w1 and P2w1 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref></bold>). Therefore, formulation of gp140 with MPLA induced strong T<sub>h</sub>1-polarized GC T<sub>fh</sub> responses, characterized by a higher magnitude of IFNγ+ anti-Env T<sub>fh</sub> cells.</p>

<title>Induction of persistent anti-Env IgG antibodies with HIV-1 Env/MPLA+QS-21</title>
<p>We next sought to determine whether induction of higher frequencies of Env-specific T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells with MPLA could effectively enhance B cell proliferation and differentiation, in turn, promoting the development of Env antibodies with heightened affinity and increased durability. To this end, we performed a wide repertoire of quantitative and functional assays to assess the magnitude, durability, affinity, avidity, breadth, and effector functionality of vaccine induced humoral responses to Env. Longitudinal measures of binding antibody concentrations in sera against C.1086 Env showed rapid and equivalent recall in all animals post P1, with antibodies reaching peak levels after the 2<sup>nd</sup> protein boost. While antibody kinetics were comparable across vaccine groups, significantly higher antibody magnitude was elicited by MPLA at week 8 post 2<sup>nd</sup> boost and until 30 weeks after final immunization (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). At this protracted memory time point, serum antibody concentrations were, on average, 2.5-fold higher with MPLA (median [ng/ml]; MPLA, 5566 versus CAF01, 2155) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). To assess CD4 correlates of antibody durability, we asked whether the magnitude of vaccine-elicited GC T<sub>fh</sub> subsets after each boost predicted antibody concentrations at week 30. Two key cellular determinants of antibody durability emerged from our analysis: GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 cell magnitude (p &lt; 0.05, r=0.65) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>) and frequencies of IFNγ+ IL-2+ Env-specific LN T<sub>fh</sub> cells (p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.62) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). These data in concert with IFNγ-regulated molecular programs induced in LN CD4 T cells support a role for GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 induction in antibody persistence.</p>

<p>Using a binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA), we further confirmed that stronger memory responses were elicited by MPLA evidenced by higher median serum IgG antibody concentrations to C.1086 gp140 and gp120 antigens measured as area-under-the curve (AUC) over time (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-F</xref></bold>). Thus, utilizing two orthogonal approaches, the data showed significantly higher and protracted serum antibody responses against autologous Env with MPLA, indicative of efficient T<sub>fh</sub> cell mediated B cell recruitment into the long-lived plasma cell pool.</p>
<p>We next sought to understand if T<sub>fh</sub>1 profile was also associated with improved Env antibody breadth. Therefore, we tested serum reactivity against an antigen panel comprising of consensus gp140 proteins and found that antibodies with higher cross-clade reactivity were induced with MPLA relative to CAF01 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-H</xref></bold>). We extended these analyses to assess reactivity to V1V2 loops of 1086C and noted that antibodies with significantly higher specificity to these important regions within Env were induced in both vaccine regimens (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Having established induction of robust serum Env antibodies with MPLA, we next determined whether Env-specific IgG reactivity would also be higher within rectal secretions. After normalization for total IgG levels within rectal secretions, the data showed that Env antibodies were effectively recalled in most animals at week 2 post 2<sup>nd</sup> protein boost and persisted in all animals 8 weeks after final immunization. However, akin to the systemic compartment, gp140 IgG in rectal secretions were significantly higher with MPLA at memory time point (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref></bold>), with 6-fold higher levels in MPLA relative to CAF01 at week 8 after final immunization (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref></bold>). In both vaccine regimens, the induction of Env-IgA antibodies was poor, preventing a quantitative assessment of IgA responses in secretions.</p>

<title>Induction of IgG1 subclass antibodies with greater effector functions with HIV-1 Env/MPLA+QS-21</title>
<p>Since antibody effector functions, facilitated by interaction of Ig constant region with cognate Fc receptors on innate cells, mediate protection from acquisition and viral control (Carpenter and <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Ackerman 2020</xref>), we assessed the IgG subclass profile at week 2 post 2<sup>nd</sup> protein boost.

<title>Differentiation of GC T<sub>fh</sub> Subsets initiated during the DNA Priming Phase</title>
<p>Finally, we sought to determine the degree to which T<sub>fh</sub> responses elicited during the priming phase influenced antibody responses post 1<sup>st</sup> protein boost. To this end, we analyzed blood samples at weeks 0, 1, 2, and 4, while also evaluating FNA of the draining LN at week 2 after the 3<sup>rd</sup> DNA prime (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Animals were immunized with C.1086 DNA expressing IP10 (DNAIP10) which primes stronger GC T<sub>fh</sub> responses relative to DNA-alone (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Verma, Schmidt et al. 2019</xref>). To further enhance GC T<sub>fh</sub> responses, beyond that induced by DNAIP10, we engineered DNAIP10 to co-express IL-6, a key cytokine promoting T<sub>fh</sub> differentiation. Our vector achieved coordinate expression of Gag and Env antigens together with IP10+IL6 as confirmed in transfected 293T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). Following three rounds of intradermal immunization with DNAIP10 or DNAIP10+IL6, we assessed proliferating pT<sub>fh</sub> cells (Ki-67<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> of CXCR5+ CD4 T cells in blood, <bold>7C</bold>). We observed a significant increase at weeks 1 and 2 with DNAIP10+IL6 but not DNAIP10 indicating that IP10+IL6 incorporation promoted T<sub>fh</sub> differentiation. Additionally, T<sub>fh</sub> induction was accompanied by notable T<sub>fh</sub>1 skewing within proliferating pT<sub>fh</sub> cells (median pT<sub>fh</sub>1 at day 0 (% CD95), 0.89% versus 1.48% at day 7 and 14). Measurement of antigen-specific responses by AIM assay demonstrated induction of Env and Gag-specific pT<sub>fh</sub> cells with a trend for higher responses elicited by DNAIP10+IL6 (median, 0.42%, IQR 0.3-1.7%) relative to DIP10 (median, 0.12%; IQR: 0.04 – 1.4%, <bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Based on the transient accumulation of pT<sub>fh</sub> cells in the blood, we further explored GC T<sub>fh</sub> responses. Out of twelve collected FNAs, eight were successful (four per vaccine group), and demonstrated significant increase in GC T<sub>fh</sub> frequencies following vaccination (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). Gating on Ki-67+ cells encompassing both CXCR5+ PD-1+ and PD-1++ subsets, an increase in activated T<sub>fh</sub> cells within the LN was observed (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold>), accompanied by a corresponding increase in the T<sub>fh</sub>1 subset (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref></bold>). Altogether, these data demonstrate induction of GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 responses during the priming phase post immunization with DNAIP10 or DNAIP10+IL6.</p>
<p>Measurement of C.1086 Env antibodies in serum revealed induction of antibody responses after the 3<sup>rd</sup> prime in 8/12 animals, with comparable kinetics across vaccine groups. Notably, antibody concentrations 4 weeks post 3<sup>rd</sup> DNA prime strongly correlated with both the frequencies of proliferating T<sub>fh</sub> cells (Ki-67+ PD-1+ CXCR5+) within the LN and with the proliferating T<sub>fh</sub>1 (Ki-67+ PD-1+ CXCR5+ CXCR3+) subset at 2 weeks post 3<sup>rd</sup> DNA prime (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G-H</xref></bold>). Moreover, the strong association of antibody concentrations after the 3<sup>rd</sup> DNA prime with peak antibodies following the 1<sup>st</sup> protein boost (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref></bold>) indicated efficient recall of Env-specific memory B cells induced during the prime. Overall, the data show that stimulation of T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells during the DNA priming stage is closely linked with robust antibodies post boost.</p>
<p>In summary, our results strongly support maximizing GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 responses during both the prime and boost phases as a strategy to generate potent and durable humoral immunity. These findings have significant implications for the development of more effective vaccination strategies aimed at eliciting robust and long-lasting immune responses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>T<sub>fh</sub> cells are fundamental in establishing long-lasting humoral immunity with vaccination. The dynamic interplay between innate immune activation and the ensuing inflammatory response directs the magnitude and composition of T<sub>fh</sub> cell populations, ultimately shaping quantitative and qualitative features of humoral memory (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Hirota, Turner et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Barbet, Sander et al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Olatunde, Hale et al. 2021</xref>). Here we show that maximizing induction of CXCR3+ T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells correlates with serum Env antibodies which exhibit higher persistence. Our studies with LAMV revealed the robust induction of pT<sub>fh</sub>1 and GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 responses, along with a moderate induction of T<sub>fh</sub>17 and T<sub>fh</sub>1/17 cells. These findings led us to compare the adjuvants MPLA+QS-21 and CAF01, known to elicit T<sub>h</sub>1 and mixed T<sub>h</sub>1/17 responses (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Christensen, Bollehuus Hansen et al. 2019</xref>), (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen, Andersen et al. 2018</xref>) respectively, to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing Env antibody persistence. Through proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of lymph nodes, we uncovered evidence of robust GC responses induced by both vaccine adjuvants following a DNA prime. Moreover, we observed notable skewing of T<sub>fh</sub> responses, which corresponded with the elicitation of distinct immunogenicity profiles. Interesting, although peak antibody responses following each protein boost were similar across the vaccine platforms, our investigation revealed a notable distinction in antibody persistence. Specifically, the MPLA+QS-21 regimen exhibited higher antibody levels at week 8,12, and 30, suggestive of enhanced support from T<sub>fh</sub> cells in promoting plasma cell differentiation. Moreover, T<sub>fh</sub>1 cell induction during the DNA priming phase was linked to effective boosting upon subsequent protein immunization. These findings highlight the critical role of T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells in driving the longevity of antibody responses and emphasize the potential of stimulating T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells during the prime and boost to elicit durable humoral immunity against HIV Env.</p>
<p>A significant finding in RV144 vaccine recipients was the correlation between Env-specific peripheral CD4 T cell subsets co-producing IFNγ, TNFα, CD40L, and IL4, and a reduced risk of HIV acquisition [40]. This correlation suggests that productive GC responses elicited by the vaccine fostered protective humoral immunity (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Lin, Finak et al. 2015</xref>). More recently, follow up analysis of this population in n=6 subjects immunized with the RV144 vaccine regimen in South Africa (HVTN 097) reported a pT<sub>h</sub>2 biased transcriptional profile based on observed IL4 and IL13 transcripts (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, Tian et al. 2022</xref>). However, it is important to note that in addition to T<sub>h</sub>2 cells CD4 T<sub>fh</sub> cells also produce IL-4 in a SLAM/SAP dependent manner (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">McCausland, Yusuf et al. 2007</xref>) and T<sub>h</sub>1 cells can produce IL-13 in the presence of IL18 is documented (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi, Yoshimoto et al. 2007</xref>). These findings indicate the need for utilizing multiple immune parameters when categorizing CD4 T cell help and underscore the importance of studying both lymph node and peripheral blood CD4 T<sub>fh</sub> cells to fully understand their respective roles in fostering Env antibody responses.</p>
<p>In the context of vaccination, our observed association between T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells and persistent antibody responses raises the possibly that higher relative production of IL-21 and CD40L may support the proliferation of GC B cells in concert with IFNγ-mediated B cell proliferation. This contention is supported by the observation of higher relative Ki-67 protein levels in the MPLA group at week 2 of the first protein boost. In the context of a T<sub>h</sub>1 driven GC response rich in CXCL chemokines CXCL9, 10, and 11; CXCR3 expression on T<sub>fh</sub> cells may furthermore enable proximity and interaction with GC B cells. CAF01 is composed of cationic liposomal vesicle (dimethyldioctadecylammonium, DDA) together with a synthetic analog of a mycobacterial cell wall (trehalose dibehenate, TDB), a potent activator of macrophages and dendritic cells through the macrophage inducible Ca2<sup>+</sup>-dependent lectin receptor Mincle, a pattern recognition receptor recognizing bacterial lipids (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Davidsen, Rosenkrands et al. 2005</xref>, Martinez-<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Lopez, Iborra et al. 2019</xref>). CAF01 elicits CD4 T<sub>h</sub>1 responses while concurrently driving strong T<sub>h</sub>17 responses to a mycobacterium TB subunit vaccine via induction of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Werninghaus, Babiak et al. 2009</xref>). We observed that CAF01 was effective in inducing robust cellular responses, which were skewed towards a T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>17 profile within GCs. It is possible that employing the CAF06 platform which incorporates MPL into the bilayer of DDA/TDB liposomes may drive stronger T<sub>h</sub>1 responses together with T<sub>h</sub>17 cells thereby enhancing protective immunity by eliciting strong humoral immune responses.</p>
<p>The present studies are the first to our knowledge to assess immunological responses across HIV vaccine platforms with MPLA and CAF01-based adjuvants and strongly support GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 cell induction for enhancing Env antibody responses. However, our study has several limitations. First, priming modalities across MPLA and CAF01 were not identical. Animals boosted with MPLA were primed with DNAIP10, whereas CAF01 boosted animals received the DNAIP10+IL6 prime. Given the stronger immunogenicity of DNAIP10+IL6, it is possible that our studies underestimate immune recall potential of MPLA relative to CAF01. Second, 5/6 animals in each vaccine group were males and therefore our findings do not capture possible variability in vaccine response between sexes. Because females develop higher antibody responses than males, it is important to test our hypothesis in animals of both sexes(<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Fischinger, Boudreau et al. 2019</xref>). Third, the interplay of innate immune cells and the follicular dendritic cell network in regulation of T<sub>fh</sub> help for antibody responses is an important consideration for future studies. Finally, we did not assess vaccine efficacy and therefore whether GC T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells constitute an important correlate of protection from acquisition remains an important unanswered question.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings demonstrate significant skewing of the GC T<sub>fh</sub> response by adjuvants inducing distinct inflammatory responses. We further demonstrate that induction of T<sub>fh</sub>1 cells results in superior persistence of Env antibodies indicating that strategies to harness this CD4 subset may promote protective humoral immunity against HIV.</p>

<p>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks were prepared using lymph node tissue from biopsies at baseline, week2 post protein1, and week3 post protein2 immunization timepoints to analyze the spatial protein profiling using the Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP). The tissue sections of 5-μm thickness were cut from FFPE blocks and mounted on GeoMx-NGS BOND RX slide as per manufacturer’s recommendations. Sections were baked at 60°C for 30 minutes, deparaffinized, rehydrated in CitriSolv, ethanol and washed in water. For antigen retrieval, slides were placed in staining jar containing 1X Citrate Buffer (pH 6) for 15 minutes using a preheated pressure cooker (high pressure and high temp). The tissue slides were washed with 1X TBS-T and blocked tissue sections with Buffer W for 1 hour at room temperature in a closed humidity chamber. Tissue slides were stained with a cocktail of fluorescent morphological markers SYTO13 (nuclear stain; AF532), CD20 (Clone: L26; AF488), CD3 (Clone: CD3-12; AF594), and Ki-67 (Clone: B56; AF647) at 1:10000, 1:250, 1:100, and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively. For protein detection, a multiplex cocktail of primary antibodies was used from core panels; GeoMx immune cell profiling panel, GeoMx IO drug target module, and GeoMx immune activation status module (S<italic>ee supplementary Table2</italic>). In total, 60 regions of interest (ROIs) were selected within GCs based on co-localization of CD3 with CD20+ Ki-67+ GC B cells. Indexing oligos were released from each ROI by exposure to UV light as described(<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Merritt, Ong et al. 2020</xref>), and 10μl of liquid from above the ROI was collected by a microcapillary tip and deposited in a 96-well plate.</p>
<p>Indexing oligos from each ROI were PCR amplified using GeoMx Seq Code primers. PCR products were pooled and purified twice with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Library concentration and purity were measured using a high-sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA). After sequencing, fastq files were run through the GeoMx NGS Pipeline where reads were trimmed, merged, and aligned to a list of indexing oligos to identify the source probe. Analysis of filtered normalized gene expression data was performed in R with Bioconductor. We profiled 32 proteins along with core protein in GeoMx Human Protein array. We first calculated the signal-to-noise ratio by dividing raw count values by the geometric mean of the negative IgG probes.

Plates were washed, and HRP conjugated goat anti-monkey IgG (Nordic MUbio, Netherlands) was added to plate wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Plates were then washed and developed with the addition of TMB substrate (Thermo Fisher, USA). Absorbance was recorded at 450 nm with a reference filter at 570 nm using a Spectramax 5 plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). Baseline sera from each animal served as negative control and optical density (OD) values 2-fold above baseline were considered positive and extrapolated using in-plate standards to determine anti-Env antibody concentrations.</p>

<title>IgG subclass antibodies</title>
<p>ELISA was used to measure concentrations of gp120-specific IgG1-4 antibodies. Ten rows of a 96-well Immulon 4 microtiter plate (VWR) were coated overnight at 4°C with 50ng C.1086 gp120ý7 (HIV Reagent Program) per well in PBS, pH 7.2. To generate a standard curve with a known amount of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 antibody, 2 rows of the plate were coated with 50ng per well recombinant CD40 (NHP Reagent Resource). The following day, the plate was washed with PBST and blocked with PBST containing 0.1% BSA (ELISA buffer: EB). Serum samples diluted in EB were then added to gp120 wells. Duplicate dilutions of anti-CD40 rhesus IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 antibody (NHP Reagent Resource) were added to the CD40 wells. Following overnight reaction at 4°C, the plate was washed and treated for 1h at 37°C with 0.5µg/ml of the appropriate following biotinylated monoclonal antibody (all from NHP Reagent Resource) diluted in EB: anti-rhesus IgG1 clone 7H11 (ena), anti-rhesus IgG2 clone 8D11 (dio), anti-rhesus IgG3 clone 6F5 (tria) or anti-rhesus IgG4 clone 7A8 (tessera). Plates were washed, treated with 1/4,000 neutralite avidin peroxidase (SouthernBiotech) for 30min at room temperature, and developed with TMB substrate and H2SO4 stop solution. After recording absorbance at 450nm, a standard curve constructed from the anti-CD40 IgG subclass antibody was used to interpolate the concentration of anti-gp120 IgG of the same subclass in samples</p>

<title>ADP assay</title>
<p>Serum antibodies were evaluated for ability to enhance phagocytosis of gp120 expressing fluorescent beads by THP-1 monocytes as previously described (Verma 2020). Briefly, 1µm avidin-coated fluorospheres (Invitrogen) were labeled with biotinylated anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (ThermoScientific) and used to capture His-tagged clade C gp120 Du151 protein (Immune Technologies). The gp120-expressing beads were then incubated with triplicate 5-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples in V-bottom plates for 1h at 37°C. THP-1 cells (2×10<sup>4</sup> per well) were then added and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. After 5h, cells were washed with Ca<sup>+2/</sup>Mg<sup>+2</sup>-free DPBS, then treated with 0.12% trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at 37°C. The cells were washed and resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence was measured using a FACSCanto (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo 9 software. Phagocytosis was quantified by multiplying the percentage of fluorescent cells by their median fluorescence intensity. A phagocytic score was then calculated by dividing the phagocytosis measured in each test sample by the phagocytosis observed for pooled preimmune serum at the same dilution.</p>

<title>Neutralization assay</title>
<p>Serum neutralizing activity was quantified using a previously described pseudovirus infectivity assay where TZM-bl cells were co-incubated with tier 1 clade C pseudovirus MW965.26, tier 2 clade C virus Ce1086_B2, tier 2 clade C Ce1176_A3, or a control MLV-pseudotyped virus (to measure non-HIV-specific activity). Neutralization titers were measured in serum samples collected at week 0 and week 2 following the 2<sup>nd</sup> protein boost. Samples neutralizing antibody activity against SIV pseudoviruses was measured relative to MLV pseudovirus negative controls.</p>

<title>Mucosal antibodies</title>
<p>A custom binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA) assay with C.1086 gp140 K160N-conjugated Bio-Rad Bio-plex Pro magnetic COOH beads was used to quantify Env-specific IgG in rectal secretions and specific IgA in IgG-depleted sera and rectal secretions as previously described (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Verma, Schmidt et al. 2019</xref>). Briefly, 50µg gp140 was conjugated to 10 x 10<sup>6</sup> beads as described (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Iyer, Gangadhara et al. 2015</xref>). The gp140-labeled beads (3500 per well) were shaken overnight at 1100 rpm and 4°C with 10-fold dilutions of serum or secretion and standard [Verma 2020]. Beads were then washed with PBST and reacted for 30min at room temperature with biotinylated goat anti-human IgG (Southern Biotech) or goat whole IgG containing anti-monkey IgA (Novus) followed by phycoerythrin-labeled neutralite avidin (Southern Biotech). Fluorescence was measured with a Bio-Rad Bioplex 200. Antibody concentrations were determined using standard curves prepared with Bioplex Manager software (Bio-Rad). Concentrations of gp120-specific IgG in secretions were divided by the concentration of total IgG or IgA measured in the sample by ELISA to obtain the specific activity (ng of gp140-specific IgG or IgA antibody per µg of total IgG or IgA, respectively).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism v.9.5.1 (Graph Pad). Gaussian distribution was not assumed, thus comparisons across time, between groups, and correlations were analyzed using non-parametric tests. For within group comparisons, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test was used. For between group comparisons, Mann-Whitney rank comparisons were used. Correlation coefficients were computed using Spearman correlation. P values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p>

<p>Despite the importance of T follicular helper cells (Tfh cells) in vaccine-induced humoral responses, it is still unclear which type of Tfh cells (Tfh1, Tfh2, and Tfh17) is critical for generating protective humoral immunity. By using the rhesus macaques model (most similar to human), the authors have addressed this potentially <bold>important</bold> question and obtained suggestive data that Tfh1 is critical. Although being suggestive, the evidence for the importance of Tfh1 is <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Developing vaccination capable of inducing persistent antibody responses capable of broadly neutralizing HIV strains is of high importance. However, our ability to design vaccines to achieve this is limited by our relative lack of understanding of the role of T-follicular helper (Tfh) subtypes in the responses. In this report Verma et al investigate the effects of different prime and boost vaccination strategies to induce skewed Tfh responses and its relationship to antibody levels. They initially find that live-attenuated measles vaccine, known to be effective at inducing prolonged antibody responses has a significant minority of germinal center Tfh (GC-Tfh) with a Th1 phenotype (GC-Tfh1) and then explore whether a prime and boost vaccination strategy designed to induce GC-Tfh1 is effective in the context of anti-HIV vaccination. They conclude that a vaccine formulation referred to as MPLA before concluding that this is the case.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>While there is a lot of literature on Tfh subtypes in blood, how this relates to the germinal centers is not always clear. The strength of this paper is that they use a relevant model to allow some longitudinal insight into the detailed events of the germinal center Tfh (GC-Tfh) compartment across time and how this related to antibody production.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors focus strongly on the numbers of GC-Tfh1 as a proportion of memory cells and their comparison to GC-Tfh17. There seems to be little consideration of the large proportion of GC-Tfh which express neither CCR6 and CXCR3 and currently no clear reasoning for excluding the majority of GC-Tfh from most analysis. There seems to be an assumption that since the MPLA vaccine has a higher number of GC-Tfh1 that this explains the higher levels of antibodies. There is not sufficient information to make it clear if the primary difference in vaccine efficacy is due to a greater proportion of GC-Tfh1 or an overall increase in GC-Tfh of which the percentage of GC-Tfh1 is relatively fixed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Anil Verma et al. have performed prime-boost HIV vaccination to enhance HIV-1 Env antibodies in the rhesus macaques model. The authors used two different adjuvants, a cationic liposome-based adjuvant (CAF01) and a monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)+QS-21 adjuvant. They demonstrated that these two adjuvants promote different transcriptomes in the GC-TFH subsets. The MPLA+QS-21 adjuvant induces abundant GC TFH1 cells expressing CXCR3 at first priming, while the CAF01 adjuvant predominantly induced GC TFH1/17 cells co-expressing CXCR3 and CCR6. Both adjuvants initiate comparable Env antibody responses. However, MPLA+QS-21 shows more significant IgG1 antibodies binding to gp140 even after 30 weeks.</p>
<p>The enhancement of memory responses by MPLA+QS-21 consistently associates with the emergence of GC TFH1 cells that preferentially produce IFN-γ.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this manuscript is that all experiments have been done in the rhesus macaque model with great care. This manuscript beautifully indicated that MPLA+QS-21 would be a promising adjuvant to induce the memory B cell response in the HIV vaccine.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors did not provide clear evidence to indicate the functional relevance of GC TFH1 in IgG1 class-switch and B cell memory responses.</p>

<p>Clarification: MPLA serves as the adjuvant, and the vaccine formulation is characterized as a Th1 formulation based on the properties of the adjuvant.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment. Indeed, while there is substantial literature on Tfh subtypes in blood, the strength of our study lies in utilizing a relevant model to provide longitudinal insights into the dynamics of the germinal center Tfh (GC-Tfh) compartment over time and its relationship to antibody production. Regarding the concern about the comprehensive analysis of GC Tfh subsets, including GC-Tfh1, GC-Tfh17, and others not expressing CCR6 and/or CXCR3, we fully acknowledge its importance. To address this, we will conduct a detailed analysis of GC Tfh and GC Tfh1 frequencies, encompassing subsets without CCR6 and CXCR3 expression, to provide a more comprehensive view of the GC-Tfh population in our analysis.</p>

<p>We appreciate the recognition of our meticulous work in the rhesus macaque model and the potential of MPLA+QS-21 as an adjuvant for HIV vaccine-induced humoral immunity. We acknowledge the need to provide clearer evidence of the functional relevance of GC Tfh1 in IgG1 class-switching and B cell memory responses. We will attempt to address this concern in our revisions.</p>
