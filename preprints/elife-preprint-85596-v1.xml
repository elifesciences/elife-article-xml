<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The degradation of sperm-borne mitochondria after fertilization is a conserved event. This process known as post-fertilization sperm mitophagy, ensures exclusively maternal inheritance of the mitochondria-harbored mitochondrial DNA genome. This mitochondrial degradation is in part carried out by the ubiquitin proteasome system. In mammals, ubiquitin-binding pro-autophagic receptors such as SQSTM1 and GABARAP have also been shown to contribute to sperm mitophagy. These systems work in concert to ensure the timely degradation of the sperm-borne mitochondria after fertilization. We hypothesize that other receptors, cofactors, and substrates are involved in post-fertilization mitophagy. Mass spectrometry was used in conjunction with a porcine cell-free system to identify other autophagic cofactors involved in post-fertilization sperm mitophagy. This porcine cell-free system is able to recapitulate early fertilization proteomic interactions. Altogether, 185 proteins were identified as statistically different between control and cell-free treated spermatozoa. Six of these proteins were further investigated, including MVP, PSMG2, PSMA3, FUNDC2, SAMM50, and BAG5. These proteins were phenotyped using porcine <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization, cell imaging, proteomics, and the porcine cell-free system. The present data confirms the involvement of known mitophagy determinants in the regulation of mitochondrial inheritance and provides a master list of candidate mitophagy co-factors to validate in the future hypothesis-driven studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitochondria are specialized cellular organelles which serve as the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria have been designated as such because of the large amounts of adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) which they generate through both the TCA cycle as well as the electron transport chain. Additionally, mitochondria play roles in various cellular signaling pathways, serve as a calcium ion storage structure, help regulate cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">McBride, Neuspiel, &amp; Wasiak, 2006</xref>), and can signal for apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hajnóczky et al., 2006</xref>). Mitochondria are also unique among cellular organelles because they house their own genome distinct from that of the nuclear DNA. This DNA is referred to as mitochondrial or mtDNA. The mtDNA encodes for 13 proteins which are used within the electron transport chain, as well as 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al., 1981</xref>). Mitochondria and the mtDNA which they harbor are almost exclusively inherited from the maternal lineage in most animal species, including humans. This pattern of maternal inheritance results in a single haplotype of the mtDNA being present in offspring.</p>
<p>This pattern of maternal inheritance results in most individual animals inheriting one mitochondrial genome from their mothers. Though naturally occurring maternally derived heteroplasmy (the presence of two distinct populations of mtDNA haplotypes) caused by mutations of the mitochondrial genome is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">McFarland, Taylor, &amp; Turnbull, 2007</xref>), heteroplasmy caused by the inheritance of the father’s mtDNA is very rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Schwartz &amp; Vissing, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, in laboratory settings, researchers have been able to cause heteroplasmy in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Sharpley et al., 2012</xref>). These heteroplasmic mice were both mentally and physiologically insufficient when compared to their homoplasmic counterparts. The nematode roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has also been utilized in this area of research. These worms were given a specific mtDNA deletion which caused the entire population to become heteroplasmic. It was found that embryonic lethality was 23-fold higher; they had reduced metabolic rates, and the males experienced reduced sperm mobility in this population of worms when compared to homoplasmic counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Liau, Gonzalez-Serricchio, Deshommes, Chin, &amp; LaMunyon, 2007</xref>). Thus, in both laboratory animal populations, heteroplasmy was shown to be detrimental. It has also been observed that this mtDNA maternal inheritance pattern has been naturally violated in some human offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Schwartz &amp; Vissing, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Slone et al., 2020</xref>). Several multigenerational families have been identified with various forms of paternal mtDNA leakage. In the case of these studies, the heteroplasmy was identified because one of the family members had a mitochondrial disease. Though some of the relatives seemed to carry benign levels of paternal heteroplasmy, other family members were not so fortunate. Again, showing that when paternal mitochondria are not eliminated, it appears to eventually result in reduced health and fitness outcomes.</p>
<p>The paternal, sperm-borne mitochondria are located on the midpiece of the sperm tail, within a structure known as the mitochondrial sheath. This sheath organizes mitochondria into a compact helical configuration and in the livestock mammalian species, this sheath contains 50 to 75 mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ankel-Simons &amp; Cummins, 1996</xref>). This mitochondrial sheath structure is quickly degraded from the fertilizing spermatozoa upon entry into the oocyte cytoplasm in a process known as post-fertilization sperm mitophagy. This mitophagic process is a nuanced autophagic and proteasome-dependent degradation of the mitochondria. It has been shown that ubiquitin associates with the sperm mitochondria in primate, ruminant, and rodent oocyte cytoplasm (P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sutovsky et al., 1999</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that the ubiquitination of sperm mitochondria takes place in the porcine zygote, where the effect of proteasomal inhibitors on sperm mitophagy was described for the first time and resulted in implicating the ubiquitin proteasome system as a pivotal part of this mitophagic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sutovsky, McCauley, Sutovsky, &amp; Day, 2003</xref>; Sutovsky, Van Leyen, McCauley, Day, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Sutovsky, 2004</xref>). More recently, studies using <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> revisited the concept of ubiquitin-dependent post-fertilization sperm mitophagy, with a focus on the autophagic branch of this complex pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Al Rawi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Politi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sato &amp; Sato, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhou, Li, &amp; Xue, 2011</xref>). Much of the data from this research has focused on a handful of autophagic proteins. These proteins included sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), GABA type A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3α (LC3), and valosin-containing protein (VCP). Further research has shown synergistic efforts between SQSTM1, GABARAP, and VCP in porcine sperm mitophagy (W. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Song, Yi, Sutovsky, Meyers, &amp; Sutovsky, 2016</xref>). To build upon this research, a better understanding of the potential co-factors, substrates, other proteins, and other pathways involved in post-fertilization sperm mitophagy is necessary.</p>
<p>The porcine cell-free system used in the present study is designed to recapitulate early fertilization proteomic interactions which would take place upon the incorporation of the spermatozoa into the ooplasm. It is a powerful tool that was used in this study (W. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Song &amp; Sutovsky, 2018</xref>), adapted from a similar amphibian system utilizing the eggs of an African clawed frog, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Miyamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Miyamoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sutovsky, Simerly, Hewitson, &amp; Schatten, 1998</xref>). Our porcine system utilizes small porcine oocytes (100 µm diameter) matured <italic>in vitro</italic>, instead of very large, easy to harvest frog eggs (1.2 mm diameter). Compared to other mammalian models, porcine oocytes are relatively easy to collect and mature (to fertilization-ready metaphase II stage) in large quantities. Furthermore, the timing of post-fertilization sperm mitophagy in porcine zygotes is favorable as it occurs prior to the 1<sup>st</sup> embryo cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sutovsky et al., 2003</xref>); thus, this system can be utilized to study post-fertilization sperm mitophagy in a shorter time span and without interfering with the established role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in cell division, a feat that would be more complicated in a bovine embryo where the post-fertilization sperm mitophagy occurs between the 2 and 4 cell stage (Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sutovsky et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts do not lend themselves to the study of mammalian sperm mitophagy as it is a species-specific recognition and degradation process. To prepare oocyte extracts for this system, MII oocytes are denuded of their cumulus cells and zona pellucida, then placed in an extraction buffer and subjected to three rounds of flash freezing followed by thawing to disrupt their cellular membranes. At that point, the oocytes are centrifuged at high speed to be crushed, and the supernatant present is collected. This oocyte extract contains cytoplasmic proteins and some of the lysosomal and autophagosomal membrane fractions that participate in mitophagy. The paternal component of this cell-free system is represented by boar spermatozoa primed through a demembranating treatment with lysophosphatidylcholine (lysolecithin) followed by disulfide bond reduction via dithiothreitol (DTT), a stepwise treatment which removes the plasma and outer acrosomal membranes of the spermatozoa and destabilizes the structural sperm proteins in a fashion similar to sperm demembranation during sperm-oocyte fusion and disulfide bond reduction in the sperm head and tail at the time of sperm incorporation in the oocyte cytoplasm. Thus, this chemical demembranation and destabilization is used to replicate <italic>in vivo</italic> spermatozoa processing during natural fertilization. These primed spermatozoa are then co-incubated with the oocyte extract for 4 to 24 hours and early fertilization-specific proteomic interactions can be recapitulated. The porcine cell-free system allows us to observe thousands of spermatozoa interacting with ooplasmic proteins in a single trial, thus overcoming the limiting factor of one spermatozoon per fertilized egg, as seen in <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) protocols. This cell-free system has been previously shown to recapitulate fertilization sperm mitophagy events which take place in a zygote (W.-H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Song et al., 2021</xref>; W. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Song &amp; Sutovsky, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, the porcine cell-free system was used in conjunction with MADLI-TOF mass spectrometry to conduct a quantitative investigation of early fertilization proteomics (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). Two different trials were conducted each containing biological triplicates and based on this data an inventory of 185 proteins (p&lt;0.1) of potential interest in the context of post-fertilization sperm mitophagy was compiled. Six of these proteins were further investigated, including major vault protein (MVP), proteasomal assembly chaperone 2 (PSMG2), proteasomal subunit alpha 3 (PSMA3), FUN14 domain-containing protein 2 (FUNDC2), sorting and assembly machinery component 50 (SAMM50), and BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 5 (BAG5). These six proteins were considered candidate mitophagy proteins of interest based on their known functions in established autophagy-related pathways. The investigation was an attempt to understand these proteins in more detail than what was extrapolated from the mass spectrometry data. We once again used the porcine cell-free system, but this time in conjunction with immunocytochemistry (ICC) and Western blotting (WB), to characterize the localization and modification changes these proteins underwent within the system. Furthermore, we investigated these proteins in zygotes after IVF to characterize their localization patterns during <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization.</p>

<title>Quantitative Proteomics with the Cell-Free System</title>
<p>MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to analyze spermatozoa which were exposed to the porcine cell-free system. The goal of this mass spectrometry trial was to capture changes in protein quantities between control primed spermatozoa samples (no extract exposure) and cell-free system treated sperm samples. Vehicle control sperm samples were also submitted, as were samples of oocyte extract. A workflow diagram of the study is shown in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>. Three biological replicates of this trial were submitted to compare primed control vs cell-free treated sperm after 4 hours of cell-free system co-incubation; separately, three biological replicates were submitted to compare primed control vs cell-free treated spermatozoa after 24 hours of cell-free system co-incubation. During both trials, 3 biological replicates of vehicle control sperm and oocyte extract were submitted as well. Raw data captured from mass spectrometry was referenced against the <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> UniProt Knowledge base, thus capturing an inventory of proteins present in each sample and their relative abundance. The samples were normalized based on the content of outer dense fiber protein 1, 2, and 3 and then subjected to statistical analysis. The primed control and cell-free treated sperm samples were statistically compared by using a paired T-test. This T-test compared the relative normalized protein abundance between the primed control and cell-free treated samples. A P-value of 0.2 (class 1), or 0.1 (class 2 and 3) was considered statistically relevant for the purpose of this study.</p>
<p>After T-test analysis in the 4-hour trial, 138 proteins were found to undergo changes (p&lt;0.1) in abundance between the primed control vs. cell-free treated spermatozoa. In the 24-hour trial, 56 proteins were (p&lt;0.1) different in abundance between the primed control and cell-free treated spermatozoa. Of these significant proteins from each trial, 14 overlapped, resulting in a total of 180 statistically different proteins identified between the two trials. Between the two trials, 24 proteins were only found in cell-free treated sperm samples and were not present in the primed control samples. These proteins were assumed to be proteins from the oocyte extract which remained bound to spermatozoa after extract co-incubation. For proteins that followed this pattern, we loosened our statistical parameters and included proteins in our inventory out to p&lt;0.2. In the 4-hour trial, this resulted in 6 more proteins being included, and in the 24-hour trial, this resulted in 7 additional proteins. Of these 13 proteins, 8 overlapped; thus, this inclusion step added 5 more proteins to our inventory for a grand total of 185 proteins. The 4-hour inventory ultimately included 144 proteins of interest (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>), whereas the 24-hour inventory contained 63 proteins of interest (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). These inventories had an overlap of 22 proteins. The full data sheets including all reps for the 4- and 24-hour trials as well as the normalizations and T-test analyses can be found in <bold>Table S1</bold>.</p>

<p>Both the 4-hour and 24-hour protein inventories were divided into three different classes. Class 1 proteins were detected only in the oocyte extract (absent in the vehicle control and primed control spermatozoa) and found on the spermatozoa only after extract co-incubation. These proteins are interpreted as ooplasmic mitophagy receptors/determinants and nuclear/centrosomal remodeling factors. Class 2 proteins were detected in the primed control spermatozoa but increased in the spermatozoa exposed to cell-free system co-incubation. Class 3 proteins were present in both the gametes or only the primed control spermatozoa, but are decreased in the spermatozoa after co-incubation, interpreted as sperm borne mitophagy determinants and/or sperm-borne proteolytic substrates of the oocyte autophagic system. These protein inventories, sorted by class for both the 4- and 24-hour trials, can be found in <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref></bold> and <bold>2</bold>, respectively.</p>
<p>The functions of all the proteins added to these inventories were manually searched and categorized by using the UniProt Knowledgebase as well as PubMed literature search. Based on known functions, all proteins were categorized, and pie charts were rendered (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-F</xref></bold>). It should be noted that our Mass Spectrometry generated data was analyzed for proteins by using the UniProt Knowledgebase and was only analyzed for known <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> proteins.</p>

<title>Investigation of candidate proteins in the porcine cell-free system</title>
<p>Six candidate proteins were selected from the mass spectrometry results for further investigation. These six proteins were MVP, PSMG2, PSMA3, FUNDC2, SAMM50, and BAG5. Western blot detection and immunocytochemistry were used to describe the presence and localization patterns of these candidate proteins in ejaculated, primed, and cell-free treated spermatozoa. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry was used to observe the localization of these proteins in <italic>in vitro</italic> derived porcine zygotes. Oocytes were fertilized with spermatozoa pre-labeled with MitoTracker so that mitochondrial sheaths could be detected. These oocytes, now presumed zygotes, were then collected at 15 and 25 hours post insemination (sperm and oocytemixing). These time points were selected to ensure that post-fertilization sperm mitophagy was well underway in the zygotes at both timepoints. Furthermore, the 25 hour time point was selected to observe the advanced stages of mitophagy post-gamete mixing. These presumed zygotes were then fixed and stained for immunocytochemistry.</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>MVP</title>
<p>Major vault protein was identified as a Class 1 protein of interest in our MS trials. It was not identified in vehicle control spermatozoa or primed control sperm samples. However, it was identified in oocyte extracts and in spermatozoa exposed to the cell-free system at both the 4- and 24-hour times points. Upon further investigation we confirmed that MVP was not detected in ejaculated spermatozoa by using both Western blotting and immunocytochemistry detection methods (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref></bold>). Additionally, after priming the spermatozoa, MVP was still not detected (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). However, consistent with MS observations, MVP was detected on the tails of treated spermatozoa after both 4 and 24 hours of cell-free system exposure (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D, E</xref></bold>). In zygotes 15 hours post insemination MVP was detected abundantly in the cytoplasm as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sutovsky et al., 2005</xref>) though it did not appear to be associating with forming male pronuclei (PN) or with the mitochondrial sheaths of the fertilizing spermatozoa (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>).

PSMG2 was found to undergo a significant increase in abundance after 24 hours in the cell-free system (p=0.088). However, during the 4-hour trial, PSMG2 increased during two of the replicates but underwent a decrease in one of the replicates and was thus not found to be significant.

<p>FUN14 domain-containing protein 2, a Class 3 protein in our classification, was observed to undergo a significant decrease in abundance after 4 hours of cell-free system exposure (p=0.084). No significant change in the abundance of FUNDC2 was detected during the 24-hour trial. During our 24-hour MS trial, FUNDC2 was found to undergo a reduction during two of the replicates but displayed a slight increase in one of the replicates. FUNDC2 was detected in ejaculated spermatozoa via WB detection (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). In ejaculated spermatozoa, FUNDC2 was detected in the acrosome and equatorial segment of the sperm head and was confined to MS within the sperm tail (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). After sperm capacitation, FUNDC2 changed its localization and was found primarily in the apical ridge of the acrosome but also in the MS (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the last decade, considerable effort has been put forth to better understand the autophagic pathway’s involvement in mitochondrial inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Al Rawi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Politi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sato &amp; Sato, 2011</xref>; W. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). Much headway has been made; however, the knowledge gaps surrounding this post-fertilization sperm mitophagy process remain wide. For example, at present, it is not understood what determines species specificity or timing of sperm mitophagy. It has been observed that mammalian interspecies crosses retain the paternal mitochondria in F1 generation and become heteroplasmic as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kaneda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Shitara, Hayashi, Takahama, Kaneda, &amp; Yonekawa, 1998</xref>; P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sutovsky et al., 1999</xref>). The timing of mitochondrial degradation in embryos also varies between species (Reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zuidema &amp; Sutovsky, 2019</xref>)). Additionally, many protein cofactors, substrates, and autophagic pathways which act within the post-fertilization mitophagic process remain to be identified. This area of research has relied on studies with mammalian oocytes and zygotes. This led to the development of our species-specific mammalian cell-free system (W. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Song &amp; Sutovsky, 2018</xref>). This system was developed to provide a new tool for the study of post-fertilization sperm mitophagy and other early fertilization events. Specifically, the use of this system in conjunction with quantitative mass spectrometry was a type of study which has never been attempted before, even though it is becoming increasingly popular to investigate sperm proteomes by using quantitative proteomic analyses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Martínez-Heredia, Estanyol, Ballescà, &amp; Oliva, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Pilatz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Attempting to identify ooplasmic proteins which bind to spermatozoa at fertilization and those sperm proteins which begin degrading during fertilization by using mass spectrometry would be exceedingly difficult by using zygotes. This is because post-fertilization sperm mitophagy takes place within the oocyte cytoplasm and the ability to identify the differences in those proteins which are found in the sperm or binding the sperm surface from the rest of the oocyte proteome would be extremely challenging/impossible since we are not yet able to reliably map and quantify single cell proteomes. However, our cell-free system presents a unique tool which can be used to capture number of the early proteomic changes which take place specifically on the fertilizing spermatozoa; this cell-free system has been previously shown to mimic some early fertilization events (W.-H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Song et al., 2021</xref>; W. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Song &amp; Sutovsky, 2018</xref>). Thus, we could expect other proteomic events of early fertilization to be mimicked within our cell-free system. By using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we captured differences in relative protein abundance between primed control spermatozoa and cell-free treated spermatozoa. Furthermore, we captured this data at two different time points, i.e. after 4 hours and 24 hours of co-incubation within the cell-free system. Furthermore, we identified proteins of interest which can be further explored by using more targeted sperm phenotype studies.</p>
<p>This study was constrained to two time points, which allows for some temporal differences to be captured, but the differences over time in this cell-free system could be immense and the differences in the protein inventories compiled for each time point may be indicative of this. Furthermore, this cell-free system while useful does not perfectly capture all the events which take place during <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization. The cell-free system is intended to mimic early fertilization events but is presumably not the exact same as <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization. Furthermore, this study only captures changes in protein abundance. Proteins which remain at relatively stable abundances but undergo changes in localization and/or modification resulting in altered biological activity would not be captured by the parameters set forth in this study, but expectedly play important roles in early fertilization mechanisms. Despite these recognized limitations, this cell-free system used in conjunction with mass spectrometry allowed a glimpse into early fertilization proteomics in a way that has not been attempted before.</p>
<p>Our study ultimately identified 185 proteins which underwent a significant change in abundance within our parameters as described above (<bold>Table S1</bold>). Of these proteins, 144 were identified during the 4-hour cell-free system trial (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>) and 63 were found during the 24-hour cell-free system trial (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>), with 22 proteins overlapping between the trials. This lack of overlap was surprising but again may be reflective of our inability to truly detect the dynamic changes which take place within the cell-free system.</p>
<p>Considering the dynamic proteomic remodeling of both the oocyte and spermatozoa which takes place during early fertilization, these 185 proteins which have been identified likely play roles in processes beyond sperm mitophagy. Pathways related to pronuclear development, sperm aster formation, and degradation of the perinuclear theca, acrosome remnants, and tail structures including the mitochondrial sheath may all be captured. However, several autophagy-related proteins were found within our inventory including L-lactate dehydrogenase B chain, keratin 8, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta 5, BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 5, sorting and assembly machinery component 50, and FUN14 domain-containing protein 2. Interestingly these proteins were all found in class 3, and thus these proteins may be mitophagy determinants or regulators which must be recognized by ooplasmic mitophagy receptors and removed from spermatozoa/sperm mitochondria for mitophagy to take place. In addition to these proteins, multiple components and regulators of the ubiquitin-proteasome system were also identified including 20S proteasomal subunits alpha type 2, 3, and 8, 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 2, 26S proteasome subunit ATPase 2, proteasome assembly chaperone 2, ubiquitin specific peptidase 50, E3 ubiquitin ligase cullin 4B and OTU deubiquitinase. These proteins are found in both classes 2 and 3; they may be involved in UPS-mediated mitophagy or play roles in the degradation of other sperm structures including the tail and perinuclear theca. There is also evidence of sperm proteasomes playing a role in acrosomal exocytosis, zona pellucida degradation, and events linked with sperm capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Sutovsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zigo, Manaskova-Postlerova, Jonakova, Kerns, &amp; Sutovsky, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Zimmerman et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Class 1 proteins were proteins that were not identified within our primed control sperm proteome but were found in our cell-free system treated spermatozoa. We interpreted these as oocyte proteins which interacted with the oocyte extract exposed spermatozoa and remained bound to them after thorough washing at the end of co-incubation interval. Indeed, among the identified Class 1 proteins were several well documented oocyte-specific proteins which are known to interact with spermatozoa during early fertilization events, before or after sperm incorporation in the oocyte cytoplasm and are only found in oocytes. Adding to our confidence in the specificity of this cell-free proteomic system, these proteins included zona pellucida proteins 2, 3, and 4; ovastacin, DNA methyltransferase 1, and nucleoplasmin 2. Also, within Class 1, we observed proteins related to polyspermy prevention, pronuclear formation, cell development, and as well as several ROS scavenging proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref></bold>). These pathways all reinforce known oocyte functions taking place during early fertilization events. Being able to capture some of these proteomic interactions is encouraging and shows that our cell-free system is indeed recapitulating specific proteomic interactions such as would be observed during <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization.</p>
<p>Class 2 proteins were identified in the primed control samples but were found in an increased abundance within the cell-free system treated samples. Proteins in this class are expected to be oocyte derived proteins which bind the sperm structures and stay bound. However, this class may also include sperm proteomic changes which are stimulated by the ooplasmic exposure but not directly attributable to oocyte proteins binding the spermatozoa. There is some evidence that during capacitation, nuclear-encoded mRNAs in the spermatozoa are translated by mitochondrial ribosomes, specifically to support capacitation, hyperactivation, acrosomal exocytosis, and fertilization. Mitochondrial proteins, sperm tail axonemal proteins, and acrosomal function related proteins unexpectedly found in this category could be explained by this theory; this concerns cytochrome C1, cytochrome C oxidase subunit 5A, stomatin like 2, A-kinase anchoring protein 4, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B5 and B9, and Tektin 1. In fact, STOML2 is a regulator of mitochondrial translation, further providing some credence to this hypothesis. This sperm translation theory remains controversial, however, and does not necessarily explain these trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Gur &amp; Breitbart, 2006</xref>). During Class 2 protein analysis at both time points, we observed an increase in proteasomal subunits/chaperones, as discussed above. Proteins related to spermatogenesis were also identified at each time point. Within Class 2 at both time points, proteins which are known to interact with sperm nuclear DNA during spermatogenesis were identified, including testis-specific serine kinase 6, spermatogenesis associated 24, and PHD finger protein 7. These proteins could perhaps assist in hyper-condensation of the sperm nucleus during spermatogenesis and may also play a role in decondensation of the sperm nucleus upon fertilization. During the 4-hour trial, proteins related to the acrosome reaction, and proteins within the mitochondrial respiratory chain were also identified which is somewhat surprising as we would expect these proteins to begin to be reduced but perhaps this is an indication of some capacitation-like events still taking place early on during our cell-free system co-incubation. Proteins in these categories are no longer identified at 24 hours, perhaps these proteins are early substrates of the ooplasmic protein recycling machinery (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Among the Class 3 proteins, those which underwent a reduction in abundance after extract co-incubation, we observed sperm tail, acrosomal, mitochondrial, centrosome-related, spermatogenic, capacitation related, and membrane proteins. These aforementioned structures and systems are no longer necessary after fertilization. Specifically, during the 4-hour trials, 14% of the proteins categorized as Class 3 were tail proteins, 12% were mitochondrial proteins, 6% were spermatogenesis related and 6% were testis/epididymal specific proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). All of these sperm protein types being degraded during early fertilization would be expected. During the 24-hour trial, 7% of proteins observed were mitochondrial, and 12% were spermatogenesis related, supporting early degradation of some of these substrates. Surprisingly, there were no known tail proteins identified in the 24-hour trial, though 7% of proteins were known structural proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>). Additionally, several autophagy/mitophagy regulators were found within this class as well. Readers will note that during the 4-hour trial, 108 of the 144 proteins identified, or 75%, fell into Class 3. During the 24-hour trial 43 of the 63 identified proteins, or 68%, fell into Class 3. This means that in both trials, the majority of spermatozoa changes observed were reductions in sperm protein content. This is not surprising when considering the context of sperm structure recycling and remodeling during fertilization. Spermatozoa contribute nuclear, chromosomal DNA; a centriole, mRNAs, and a variety of proteins and other molecules to the newly forming embryo; however, the rest of the spermatozoa structures are recycled in an orderly fashion after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Sutovsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sutovsky &amp; Schatten, 2000</xref>). This includes the mitochondrial sheath, as well as structural sperm tail proteins and the remenants of the acrosome, perinuclear theca, and pericentriolar compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Sutovsky, 2004</xref>). Spermatozoa retain many proteins which ultimately are degraded upon fertilization, a concept which appears to be further reinforced by this study.</p>
<p>Based on this mass spectrometry work, six candidate mitophagy proteins of interest were investigated by using the porcine cell-free system and porcine IVF in conjunction with ICC to detect protein localization patterns within each system. This was done to characterize changes in these proteins during early fertilization events, with an emphasis on exploring their potential roles in post-fertilization mitophagy. We observed that all six proteins appeared to match their mass spectrometry classifications when evaluated by ICC, though PSMG2 and PSMA3 did not increase dramatically in fluorescence intensity (as expected from Class 2 protein), in zygotes, PSMG2 and PSMA3 localization patterns clearly fit the expected increase in abundance. The other 4 proteins corresponded with mass spectrometry results in the cell-free system and in zygotes when observed via ICC. Additional discussion of these 6 candidate proteins can be found in the Supplemental Discussion section.</p>
<p>In summary, our study harnessed comparative proteomic analysis in conjunction with our novel porcine cell-free system to capture proteomic alterations to spermatozoa which take place during oocyte cytoplasm exposure, a system which has been shown to faithfully mimic some early fertilization events. In total, 185 proteins were identified to undergo significant changes in abundance. Six of these proteins were further investigated and their localization patterns were characterized in the porcine cell-free system and porcine zygotes. These six proteins warrant further exploration but were able to showcase that our mass spectrometry data can be replicated and further understood using immunocytochemistry. More work must be done to further understand these six proteins and more candidates from the 185 proteins inventory should be investigated. However, this mass spectrometry study is the first of its kind to be conducted, and along with the further exploration of six candidates, it highlights the usefulness of our porcine cell-free system for the exploration of early fertilization events, such as post-fertilization sperm mitophagy. This novel system will remain a useful tool to explore early fertilization events at the molecular level.</p>

<p>The ICC protocol was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Sutovsky, 2004</xref>). Briefly, to fix oocytes or embryos, cells were fixed with 2% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 40 min at room temperature, washed and processed, or stored in PBS at 4°C until used for immunocytochemistry. In some cases, for oocytes and embryos, zona pellucida was removed using 0.1%, (w/v) pronase in TL-HEPES-PVA and the cells were then fixed with 2% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 40 min at room temp. To fix ejaculated, primed, or cell-free treated boar spermatozoa; microscopy coverslips were overlaid with 300 µL of 1% (w/v) aqueous solution of poly-L-lysine, incubated for 5 min, then shaken off, and allowed to dry. The poly-L-lysin coated coverslips were overlaid with 400 µL of warm KMT medium (37°C; pH = 7.3) and 2 µL of sperm suspension (1 × 10<sup>8</sup> spermatozoa/mL) were added onto coverslips and allowed to settle on the lysine-coated surface for 10 min on a 38.5°C plate. KMT was shaken off from the coverslips and coverslips were overlaid with 2% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 40 min fixation at room temperature, then used for immunocytochemistry immediately or stored at 4°C.

Spermatozoa were suspended in 1× LDS loading buffer supplemented with 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol. Spermatozoa were incubated at room temperature in 1× LDS loading buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail for 1 hour on a rocking platform and spun. Total protein equivalent of 50 to 100 million spermatozoa, and 50 MII oocytes were loaded per lane, respectively, on a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). Electrophoresis was carried out in the Bis-Tris system using MOPS-SDS running buffer (50 mM MOPS, 50 mM Tris base, 0.1% [w/v] SDS, 1 mM EDTA, pH = 7.7) with the cathode buffer supplemented with 5 mM sodium bisulfite. The molecular masses of separated proteins were estimated using Novex<sup>®</sup> Sharp Pre-stained Protein Standard (Invitrogen, LC5800) run in parallel. PAGE was carried out for 5 min at 90 Volts to let the samples delve into the gel and then for another 60–70 min at 200 Volts. The power was limited to 20 Watts. After PAGE, proteins were electro-transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) using Owl wet transfer system (ThermoFischer Scientific) at 65 Volts for 90 min for immunodetection, using Bis-Tris-Bicine transfer buffer (25 mM Bis-Tris base, 25 mM Bicine, 1 mM EDTA, pH = 7.2) supplemented with 10% (v/v) methanol per membrane, and 2.5 mM sodium bisulfite. The membranes with the transferred proteins were blocked with 10% (w/v) non-fat milk in TBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST, Sigma) for 40 min.

<title>Mass Spectrometry Sample Preparation</title>
<p>Cell-free system exposed spermatozoa, spermatozoa controls, and oocyte extract underwent protein precipitation using a TCA protein precipitation protocol from Dr. Luis Sanchez. These samples were then resuspended in acetone and submitted to the University of Missouri Gehrke Proteomics Center for MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry analysis. At the Proteomics Center, these samples were washed by 80% cold acetone twice. Then 10 µl 6M urea 2M thiourea and 100mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to the protein pellet. Solubilized protein was reduced by DTT and alkylated by iodoacetamide. Then trypsin was added for disgestion overnight. The digested peptides were C18 ziptip deslated, lyophilized and resuspended in 10 µL 5/0.1% acetonitrile/formic acid.</p>
<p>A volume of 1 µL of suspended peptides was loaded onto a C18 column with a step gradient of acetonitrile at 300 nL/min. A Bruker nanoElute system was connected to a timsTOF pro mass spectrometer. The loaded peptide was eluted at a flow rate of 300 nl/min with the initial gradient of 3% B (A: 0.1% formic acid in water, B: 99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), followed by 11 min ramp to 17%B, 17-25% B over 21 min, 25-37% B over 10 min, 37-80% B over 4 min, holding at 80% B for 9 min, 80-3% B in 1 min, and holding at 3% B for 3 min. Total running time was 60 min.</p>
<p>Raw data was searched using PEAKs (version X+) with UniProt <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> protein database downloaded March 01, 2019 with 88374 itmes. Samples were searched with trypsin as enzyme, 4 missed cleavages allowed; carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification; oxidized methionine and acetylation on protein N terminus as variable modification. 50 ppm mass tolerance on precursor ions, 0.1Da on fragment ions. For the protein identification, the following criteria were used: peptide FDR and protein FDR &lt; 1%, and &gt;=4 spectrum per protein in each sample.

<p>Both the 4-hour and 24-hour protein inventories were divided into three different classes. Class 1 proteins were detected only in the oocyte extract (not in the vehicle control or primed control spermatozoa) and found on the spermatozoa only after extract co-incubation. These proteins are interpreted as ooplasmic mitophagy receptors/determinants and nuclear/centrosomal remodeling factors (p&lt;0.2). Class 2 proteins were detected in the primed spermatozoa but increased in the spermatozoa exposed to cell-free system co-incubation (p&lt;0.1). Class 3 proteins were present in both the gametes or only the spermatozoa, but are decreased in the spermatozoa after co-incubation, interpreted as sperm-borne mitophagy determinants and/or sperm-borne proteolytic substrates of the oocyte autophagic system (p&lt;0.1).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work reports the identification of a list of proteins that may participate in the clearance of paternal mitochondria during fertilization, which is known as essential for normal fertilization and embryonic and fetal development. While the main method used is state of the art and the supporting data are <bold>solid</bold>, the vigor of the biochemical assays and function validation is <bold>inadequate</bold>. This work will be of interest to developmental and reproductive biologists working on fertilization.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors used an unbiased method to identify proteins from porcine oocyte extracts associated with permeabilised boar spermatozoa in vitro. The identification of the proteins is done by mass spectrometry. A previous publication of this lab validated the cell-free extract purification methods as recapitulating early events after sperm entry in the oocyte. This novel method with mammalian gametes has the advantage that it can be done with many spermatozoa at the time and allows the identification of proteins associated with many permeabilised boar spermatozoa at the time. This allowed the authors to establish a list of proteins either enriched or depleted after incubation with the oocytes extract or even only associated with spermatozoa after incubation for 4h or 24h. The total number of proteins identified in their test is around 2 hundred and with very few present in the sample only when spermatozoa were incubated with the extracts.</p>
<p>The list of proteins identified using this approach and these criteria provide a list of proteins likely associated with spermatozoa remnants after their entry and either removed or recruited for the transformation of spermatozoa-derived structures.</p>
<p>Using WB and histochemistry labelling of spermatozoa and early embryos using specific antibodies the authors confirmed the association/dissociation of 6 proteins suspected to be involved in autophagy.</p>
<p>While this unique approach provides a list of potential proteins involved in sperm mitochondria clearance it's (only) a starting point for many future studies and does not provide the demonstration that any of these proteins has indeed a role in the processes leading to sperm mitochondria clearance since the protein identified may also be involved in other processes going-on in the oocyte at this time of early development.</p>
<p>Concerning the localisation of the 6 proteins further analysed, the authors must add how much the presented picture represents the observed patterns. They must include the details on the fraction of spermatozoa and embryos displaying the presented pattern.</p>

<p>Mitochondria are essential cellular organelles that generate ATPs as the energy source for maintaining regular cellular functions. However, the degradation of sperm-borne mitochondria after fertilization is a conserved event known as mitophagy to ensure the exclusively maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial DNA genome. Defects on post-fertilization sperm mitophagy will lead to fatal consequences in patients. Therefore, understanding the cellular and molecular regulation of the post-fertilization sperm mitophagy process is critically important. In this study, Zuidema et. al applied mass spectrometry in conjunction with a porcine cell-free system to identify potential autophagic cofactors involved in post-fertilization sperm mitophagy. They identified a list of 185 proteins that might be candidates for mitophagy determinants (or their co-factors). Despite the fact that 6 (out of 185) proteins were further studied, based on their known functions, using a porcine cell-free system in conjunction with immunocytochemistry and Western blotting, to characterize the localization and modification changes these proteins, no further functional validation experiments were performed. Nevertheless, the data presented in the current study is of great interest and could be important for future studies in this field.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, a cytosolic extract of porcine oocytes is prepared. To this end, the authors have aspirated follicles from ovaries obtained from by first maturing oocytes to meiose 2 metaphase stage (one polar body) from the slaughterhouse. Cumulus cells (hyaluronidase treatment) and the zona pellucida (pronase treatment) were removed and the resulting naked mature oocytes (1000 per portion) were extracted in a buffer containing divalent cation chelator, beta-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors, and a creatine kinase phosphocreatine cocktail for energy regeneration which was subsequently triple frozen/thawed in liquid nitrogen and crushed by 16 kG centrifugation. The supernatant (1.5 mL) was harvested and 10 microliters of it (used for interaction with 10,000 permeabilized boar sperm per 10 microliter extract (which thus represents the cytosol fraction of 6.67 oocytes).</p>
<p>The sperm were in this assay treated with DTT and lysoPC to prime the sperm's mitochondrial sheath.</p>
<p>After incubation and washing these preps were used for Western blot (see point 2) for Fluorescence microscopy and for proteomic identification of proteins.</p>
<p>Points for consideration:</p>
<p>1. The treatment of sperm cells with DTT and lysoPC will permeabilize sperm cells but will also cause the liberation of soluble proteins as well as proteins that may interact with sperm structures via oxidized cysteine groups (disulfide bridges between proteins that will be reduced by DTT).</p>
<p>2. Figure 3: Did the authors really make Western blots with the amount of sperm cells and oocyte extracts as the description in the figures is not clear? This point relates to point 1. The proteins should also be detected in the following preparations (1) for the oocyte extract only (done) (2) for unextracted nude oocytes to see what is lost by the extraction procedure in proteins that may be relevant (not done) (3) for the permeabilized (LPC and DTT treated and washed) sperm only (not done) (4) For sperm that were intact (done) (5) After the assay was 10,000 permeabilized sperm and the equivalent of 6.67 oocyte extracts were incubated and were washed 3 times (or higher amounts after this incubation; not done). Note that the amount of sperm from one assay (10,000) likely will give insufficient protein for proper Western blotting and or Coomassie staining. In the materials and methods, I cannot find how after incubation material was subjected to western blotting the permeabilized sperm. I only see how 50 oocyte extracts and 100 million sperm were processed separately for Western blot.</p>
<p>3. Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 see point 2. I do miss beyond these conditions also condition 1 despite the fact that the imaged ooplasm does show positive staining.</p>
<p>4. These points 1-3 are all required for understanding what is lost in the sperm and oocyte treatments prior to the incubation step as well as the putative origin of proteins that were shown to interact with the mitochondrial sheath of the oocyte extract incubated permeabilized sperm cells after triple washing. Is the origin from sperm only (Figs 5-8) or also from the oocyte? Is the sperm treatment prior to incubation losing factors of interest (denaturation by DTT or dissolving of interacting proteins pre-incubation Figs 3-8)?</p>
<p>5. Mass spectrometry of the permeabilized sperm incubated with oocyte extracts and subsequent washing has been chosen to identify proteins involved in the autophagy (or cofactors thereof). The interaction of a number of such factors with the mitochondrial sheath of sperm has been shown in some cases from sperm and others for an oocyte origin. Therefore, it is surprising that the authors have not sub-fractionated the sperm after this incubation to work with a mitochondrial-enriched subfraction.</p>
<p>I am very positive about the porcine cell-free assay approach and the results presented here. However, I feel that the shortcomings of the assay are not well discussed (see points 1-5) and some of these points could easily be experimentally implemented in a revised version of this manuscript while others should at least be discussed.</p>
