<title>Abstract</title><p>Adults and children with the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome demonstrate cognitive, social and emotional impairments and high risk for schizophrenia. Work in mouse model of the 22q11.2 deletion provided compelling evidence for abnormal expression and processing of microRNAs. A major transcriptional effect of the microRNA dysregulation is up-regulation of <italic>Emc10,</italic> a component of the ER membrane complex, which promotes membrane insertion of a subset of polytopic and tail-anchored membrane proteins. We previously uncovered a key contribution of EMC10 in mediating the behavioral phenotypes observed in 22q11.2 deletion mouse models. Here we show that expression and processing of miRNAs is abnormal and <italic>EMC10</italic> expression is elevated in neurons derived from 22q11.2 deletion carriers. Reduction of <italic>EMC10 levels</italic> restores defects in neurite outgrowth and calcium signaling in patient neurons. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotide administration and normalization of <italic>Emc10</italic> in the adult mouse brain not only alleviates cognitive deficits in social and spatial memory but sustains these improvements for over two months post injection, indicating its therapeutic potential. Broadly, our study integrates findings from both animal models and human neurons to elucidate the translational potential of modulating <italic>EMC10</italic> levels and downstream targets as a specific venue to ameliorate disease progression in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>The revised manuscript has been restructured and expanded to include additional experiments with both human cell lines and mouse models of the 22q11.2 deletion. We have incorporated new transcriptional profiling data from EMC10 Loss-of-Function neuronal lines derived from the 22q11.2DS patient line Q6, which illustrate the beneficial effects of reducing EMC10 expression, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S8. Additionally, we have introduced a new cognitive behavioral task, the Y-maze delayed alternation test, and showed that deficits in this task are rescued in Emc10 ASO-injected Df16(A)+/− mice, as indicated in Fig. 5. Importantly, we have replicated the ASO-mediated behavioral rescue effects in an independent animal cohort and demonstrated a sustained, long-term improvement of spatial and social memory impairments in mutant mice for up to two months post-injection, highlighted in the new Fig. 6 and Fig. S14. These additions strengthen our findings by further elucidating the translational potential of modulating EMC10 levels and its downstream targets as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adults and children with the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) demonstrate cognitive, social and emotional impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). 22q11.2 deletions are also one of the strongest genetic risk factors for schizophrenia (SCZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Previous work in a model of the 22q11.2 deletion, carrying a hemizygous 1.3-Mb deficiency on mouse chromosome 16 [<italic>Df(16)A</italic>], which is syntenic to the 1.5Mb 22q11.2 deletion [<italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice] revealed a distinct behavioral and cognitive profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Molecular analysis of the <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>strain provided compelling evidence for abnormal processing of brain enriched microRNAs (miRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> related miRNA dysregulation is due to (i) hemizygosity of <italic>Dgcr8</italic>, a component of the “microprocessor” complex that is essential for miRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) and (ii) hemizygosity of miRNA genes residing within the deletion, including <italic>mir185</italic>. Reduction of miR-185 levels and to a lesser degree of miRNAs residing outside the deletion {such as miR-485 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>)} result in a de-repression of <italic>Mirta22IEmc10</italic> gene (herein after referred to as <italic>Emc10</italic>), whose expression is under the repressive control of <italic>miRNAs</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Indeed, comprehensive RNA profiling of <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice found that postnatal elevation in the expression of <italic>Emc10</italic> gene represents a key transcriptional effect of the 22q11.2 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Increased brain expression of <italic>Emc10</italic> is recapitulated in <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+/−</sup></italic> primary neurons(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) as well as in mouse models of the more common 3Mb 22q11.2 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Other miRNA targets are dysregulated, but their levels of change are subtler and more variable. <italic>Emc10</italic> encodes for a component of the ER membrane complex (EMC), which promotes membrane insertion and maturation of a subset of polytopic and tail-anchored membrane proteins including neurotransmitter receptors, channels, and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). <italic>Emc10</italic> is a prenatally biased gene with high expression in embryonic life that gradually subsides after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), a developmental pattern of expression conserved between mice, humans and nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). <italic>Emc10</italic> LoF mutation that leads to reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels rescues key cellular, cognitive and behavioral alterations in the <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we show that 22q11.2 deletion results in abnormal processing of miRNAs in human neurons and in turn drives misexpression of <italic>EMC10</italic> as previously described in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Human <italic>EMC10</italic> expression is elevated in neurons derived from 22q11.2 deletion carriers and reversal of <italic>EMC10</italic> expression leads to restoration of key morphological and functional alterations linked to 22q11.2 deletions, supporting normalization of <italic>EMC10</italic> expression as a disease-modifying intervention. Toward this end, we also show that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated <italic>Emc10</italic> normalization in the adult mouse brain is effective at reversing cognitive alterations. Improvements in cognition are sustained for over two months post ASO administration. The observations that ASO-mediated Emc10 reduction in adult mouse brain rescues cognitive deficits linked to 22q11.2 deletion strongly support a key contribution of Emc10 and Emc10-dependent membrane protein trafficking in mediating the effects of 22q11.2 deletions on cognitive function and pave the way towards translating these observations into potential disease-modifying therapeutic interventions.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To investigate whether miRNA dysregulation and upregulation of <italic>EMC10</italic> is also prominent in cortical neurons from patients carrying 22q11.2 deletions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), we used hiPSC lines obtained from three independent 22q11.2DS/SCZ donors with a 3Mb deletion diagnosed with SCZ and matched healthy controls (Supplementary Table 1). The first patient/control pair is derived from dizygotic twins discordant for the 22q11.2DS and SCZ [Q6 (22q11.2) and Q5 (Ctrl)] (Fig. S1A-D). The second patient/control pair is derived from siblings [Q1 (22q11.2) and Q2 (Ctrl)] while the third patient/control pair is a case and age/sex matched unrelated control pair from the NIMH Repository and Genomic Resource [QR27 (22q11.2) and QR20 (Ctrl)].</p>

<p>We examined whether 22q11.2 deletion results in abnormal processing of miRNAs in human neurons as we have previously described in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). We performed parallel small RNA/miRNA sequencing on DIV8 differentiated human cortical neurons from the sibling (Q5/Q6) pair derived using an approach that combines small-molecule inhibitors to repress SMAD and WNT signaling pathways to promote CNS fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). We confirmed the efficiency of differentiation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene expression assays, which indicated the anticipated increase of TUJ1/TBR1 positive derived neurons and downregulation of embryonic stem cell marker <italic>OCT4</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Fig. S1E-G). We identified a number of mature miRNAs dysregulated in response to the 22q11.2 deletion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, Fig. S2A, B, Supplementary Table S2). As a validation of our approach, we observed the expected downregulation of miRNAs miR-185, miR-1286 and miR-1306 that reside in the 22q11.2 locus (three other predicted 22q11.2 miRNAs, miR-649, miR-3618 and miR-4761 were not detected in DIV8 neurons) (Fig. S2A). Among miRNAs located outside the 22q11.2 region, we note downregulation of miRNAs such as miR-137 as well as miR-134 and several other members form the largest placental mammal-specific miRNA gene cluster miR379-410 (Fig. S2B) that have been previously implicated in neuronal development, differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We used the miRNA-target interaction network tool miRNet 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) to perform target enrichment and network analysis for the dysregulated miRNAs and performed GO term enrichment analysis on this target interaction network. Affected biological processes were prominently centered on cell division and intracellular protein transport (Fig. S3A) whereas cellular components were associated with the nucleus and the perinuclear region (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus) of the cytoplasm (Fig. S3B).</p>
<p>In addition to 22q11.2 deletion region miRNAs, lower abundance of miRNAs in cases is likely due to haploinsufficiency of the <italic>DGCR8</italic> gene and is expected to result in upregulation of target genes. To identify candidate miRNA target genes we performed an unbiased evaluation of the transcriptional responses using bulk RNA sequencing on RNA collected from DIV8 differentiated cortical neurons derived from the patient (Q6) and the corresponding healthy dizygotic twin (Q5) line (Fig. S4A). We observed the expected downregulation of genes within the 22q11.2 locus in patient neurons (Supplementary Table 3). Further, RNA and protein expression characterization confirmed the reductions in the abundance of the 22q11.2 locus residing genes <italic>DGCR8</italic> and <italic>RANBP1</italic> (Fig. S4B, C). Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 2094 were downregulated and 1937 were upregulated. As expected EMC10 expression was elevated in patient neurons while expression of other EMC subunits (<italic>EMC1-4, EMC6-9</italic>) detected in our DIV8 sequencing data did not show significant differences. GO term enrichment analysis on downregulated DEGs identified significantly altered biological processes centered on neurogenesis, neuronal development, and differentiation (Fig. S4D). Among the upregulated DEGs, the GO terms enriched were related to neuronal development as well as neuronal cilia assembly and structure (Fig. S4E).</p>
<p>Intersection of predicted targets of downregulated miRNAs and up-regulated DEGs identified 774 predicted targets of downregulated miRNAs (Fig. S4F, Supplementary Table 4) including <italic>EMC10</italic>. Notably, functional annotation revealed that predicted targets of downregulated miRNAs include genes that modulate neuronal development and are associated with GO terms such as endoplasmic reticulum and endomembrane system of neurons (Fig. S4G, H).</p>
<p>qRT-PCR assays confirmed a robust and significant upregulation of <italic>EMC10</italic> levels in RNA extracted from cortical neurons derived from hiPSCs of the Q5/Q6 pair through SMAD/WNT signaling inhibition, at three distinct stages of in vitro maturation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-F</xref>). Additionally, this upregulation was confirmed in protein extracts from cortical neurons at day 8 of differentiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). To examine whether transcriptional <italic>EMC10</italic> upregulation is independent of the neuronal derivation method, we generated neurons via inducible expression of Neurogenin-2 (NGN2), a widely used protocol that generates a robust population of excitatory neurons (NGN2-iNs) within 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). MAP2 staining was used to demonstrate the successful neuronal differentiation of the hiPSC lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). qRT-PCR assay of <italic>EMC10</italic> mRNA expression level in NGN2-iNs at DIV21 confirmed transcriptional <italic>EMC10</italic> upregulation in three independent pairs of patient and sex-/age matched healthy control lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I-K</xref>). Taken together our results highlight a reproducible and robust upregulation of <italic>EMC10</italic> in neurons derived from patients with 22q11.2 deletions, which is independent of the derivation method. It is noteworthy that in addition to monolayer cultures, <italic>EMC10</italic> shows significant upregulation along the excitatory neuron lineage (radial glia, intermediate progenitors and excitatory neurons) but not in astrocytes, choroid or interneuron lineage cells, in patient forebrain organoids generated by the same hiPSCs lines used in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously shown that upregulation of the murine orthologue of <italic>Emc10</italic> is primarily due to downregulation of miR-185 and to a lesser degree of miR-485 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Both conserved and non-conserved binding sites at the 3’UTR of human <italic>EMC10</italic> are predicted in silico for both miRNAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5SA</xref>). Consistently, the observed upregulation in the levels of <italic>EMC10</italic> gene is accompanied by a robust reciprocal decrease in the levels of the miRNA precursor of miR-185 at DIV8 as indicated both by our miRNA sequencing analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Supplementary Table 2) and follow up qRT-PCR assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). miRNA precursor of miR-485 showed a more modest non-significant reduction in its abundance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Notably, overexpression of miR-185 and miR-485 using miRNA mimics in human cortical neurons at DIV10 resulted in reduction of <italic>EMC10</italic> expression levels in both the healthy control (Q5, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and patient line (Q6, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous miR-185 and miR-485 in the control line by using specific miRNA inhibitors increased <italic>EMC10</italic> expression level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) confirming the predicted conserved functionality of miR-185 and miR-485 miRNA binding sites in <italic>EMC10</italic>. It is worth noting that in addition to miR-185, non-conserved binding sites at the 3’UTR of human <italic>EMC10</italic> are predicted <italic>in silica</italic> for two additional downregulated miRNAs residing within the 22q11.2 locus, miR-1286 and miR-1306 (Supplementary Table S). The functionality of these miRNA binding sites in <italic>EMC10</italic> and whether they contribute to the observed elevation of its expression in human neurons remains to be determined. Taken together our results confirm that miRNA dysregulation emerges in human neurons as a result of the 22q11.2 deletion and in turn drives misexpression of genes primarily involved in intracellular membrane and protein trafficking-related processes required for neuronal development and maturation. Among them, <italic>EMC10</italic> represents a major downstream effector of the 22q11.2-linked miRNA dysregulation.</p>

<p>To investigate the relevance of <italic>EMC10</italic> de-repression in the development and function of patient neurons, we generated derivatives of the Q6 patient hiPSC line carrying either heterozygous (Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup>) or homozygous (Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup>) <italic>EMC10</italic> LoF mutations using standard CRISPR/Cas9 editing approaches (Fig. S6A). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing (Fig. S6A, lower panel) and karyotyping confirmed normal chromosome complement (Fig. S6B). We confirmed reduced expression levels of 22q11.2 gene <italic>RANBP1</italic> by western blot in both derivative hiPSC lines (Fig. S6C) whereas stem-cell marker <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> were equally expressed in all lines assayed by qRT-PCR (Fig. S6D, E). EMC10 mRNA and protein levels were reduced by ∼50% in the Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> hiPSC line and abolished in the Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> line (Fig. S6F, G). It is noteworthy that we did not observe an upregulation of <italic>EMC10</italic> mRNA levels in the Q6 hiPSC lines (Fig. S6F), a finding likely attributed to the general low expression level of miR-185 and miR-485 in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Indeed both miRNAs are developmentally regulated and show increased expression levels during neuronal development (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ethz-ins.org/igNeuronsTimeCourse/">https://ethz-ins.org/igNeuronsTimeCourse/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).

<p><italic>Df(16)A<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice show impaired formation of dendrites in deep layer cortical neurons, which are faithfully recapitulated in primary neuronal cultures and are partially reversed by reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). We asked whether impaired dendritic formation is also observed in human neuronal cultures from patients with 22q11.2 deletions and whether reduction of <italic>EMC10</italic> levels could prevent such morphological alterations during neuronal maturation. We employed monolayer neuronal cultures of NGN2-iNs. Neuronal cells were fixed at DIV21 of differentiation, immuno-stained, traced and key indices of dendritic architecture were quantified (see Materials and Methods). Our analysis confirmed a reduced dendritic complexity in mutant neurons as reflected in total neuronal length, the number of branch points and the total number of dendrites per cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-F</xref>). The number of primary dendrites per cell were unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>) in accordance with previous findings from the murine 22q11.2 deletion model where only subtle changes were detected in the number of primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Importantly, we found that reduction or elimination of <italic>EMC10 expressian</italic> restored to WT levels neuronal length and branchpoints.</p>
<p>Our previous evaluation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis perturbations caused by 22q11.2 deletions using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging on primary neurons from <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice revealed a significantly lower amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation following KCl evoked depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). This impairment was replicated in human cortical neurons from patients with 22q11.2 deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) and shown to be partially restored by exogenous expression of <italic>DGCR8</italic>, indicating a potential role of miRNA dysregulation. Using the green-fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4 and time-lapse microscopy we confirmed a decrease in the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise following KCl evoked depolarization, in patient (Q6) derived NGN2-iNs at DIV37/38 compared to the healthy twin (Q5) (Fig. S7A, B). We asked whether reduction of EMC10 levels could reverse such alterations. Notably, the observed defect in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling were reversed in both Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> and Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> NGN2-iNs as demonstrated by the increased amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise following depolarization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H, I</xref>). The observation that reduction of <italic>EMC10</italic> levels fully restores the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling deficits observed in <italic>patient neurans</italic> suggests that miRNA-dependent elevation in <italic>EMC10</italic> levels may interfere with one or more sources of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a wide range of calcium-dependent processes.</p>
<p>Differentially expressed genes are often organized into functional groups or pathways based on their known biological roles. We used transcriptional profiling as an indirect measure of cellular pathways affected by the reduction of EMC10 levels by identifying genes differentially expressed between the parental Q6/Q5 lines whose expression differences are abolished or nearly abolished in either Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> or Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> NGN2-iNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J, K</xref>). We identified 237 (111 downregulated and 126 upregulated) and 382 (193 downregulated and 189 upregulated) such DEGs, respectively (Supplementary Table 6). In both cases, functional annotation analysis indicated highest enrichment scores for terms related to nervous system development as well as an enrichment in GO terms relevant to neuronal generation and differentiation. Intersection of “rescued” genes in Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> and Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> NGN2-iNs identified 103 shared DEGs (Supplementary Table 7). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis highlighted a functional cluster including 30 of these genes, such as the SCZ-associated genes <italic>PCDHA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>)<italic>, RBFOX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) and <italic>RGS4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5SA</xref>), involved in nervous system development (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5SB</xref>). It should be noted that the beneficial effect of elimination of EMC10 expression is consistent with previous findings indicating that lack of EMC10 does not compromise EMC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) and implying an auxiliary or modulatory role of EMC10 in the EMC function.</p>
<p>Taken together, our analysis of neurons from 22q11.2 deletion carriers indicate that elevation of <italic>EMC10</italic> expression disrupts their development and maturation in a way similar to observations in murine neurons, and support normalization of <italic>EMC10</italic> expression as a disease-modifying intervention. While our previous work has shown that constitutive genetic reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels rescues key cognitive and behavioral alterations in the <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice, translating these observations into therapeutic interventions requires demonstration that it is the sustained elevation of <italic>EMC10</italic> throughout the adult life that interferes with the underlying neural processes rather than an irreversible impact on brain maturation during early development. Toward this end, we first investigated whether restoration of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels in the brain of adult (2– 4-month-old) <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice is effective at reversing cognitive alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Specifically, we examined the effects of <italic>Emc10</italic> reduction in adult brain on SM, a cognitive domain robustly and reproducibly affected in adult <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Notably, SM deficits are also present in juvenile <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice as early as postnatal day 22 (Fig. S9A, B), underscoring the severity of this phenotype, which emerges during early adulthood. Deficits in social cognition are present in individuals with 22q11.2 deletions and use of rodent tasks that evaluate SM can serve as a useful proxy of the human condition. Impaired SM in <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice is fully restored by constitutive genetic reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). To manipulate the expression of the <italic>Emc10</italic> gene in adult <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice we used a <italic>Emc10</italic> conditional ‘knockout-first’ design by conducting a Flp– and Cre-dependent genetic switch strategy (Fig. S10A). Parental <italic>Emc10<sup>+I-</sup> <sup>tm1a</sup></italic> mice were crossed to a germline Flp mouse line that activates global Flp function and leads to the deletion of the frt-flanked sequence(s) in the offspring. The <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c</sup></italic> offspring from this cross carry a <italic>laxP</italic> flanked WT <italic>Emc10</italic> allele and are essentially WT. To achieve temporal control of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression we used an inducible UBC-Cre/ERT2 mouse line that activates global Cre function upon tamoxifen (TAM) treatment. This approach enables postnatal normalization of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression at its endogenous locus preserving <italic>Emc10</italic> expression within its physiological levels. We used UBC-Cre/ERT2 mice in crosses to generate compound <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c+I-</sup></italic>; UBC-cre/ERT2; <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice. These mice have two WT <italic>Emc10</italic> copies upregulated, as expected in the <italic>Df(16)A</italic> background, until TAM-induced Cre expression deletes the tagged <italic>Emc10</italic> allele. We used oral gavage to deliver TAM and implement Cre-mediated <italic>Emc10</italic> deletion during adulthood (postnatal day 56-70). Corn oil treatment served as a control. Behavioral analysis was performed on the following four groups: <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c+I-</sup></italic>; UBC-cre/ERT2; <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I+</sup></italic> mice treated with TAM (WT + TAM), <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c+I-</sup></italic>; UBC-cre/ERT2; <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice treated with TAM (<italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>+ TAM), <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c+I-</sup></italic>; UBC-cre/ERT2; <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I+</sup></italic> mice treated with corn oil vehicle (WT + oil), and <italic>Emc10<sup>tm1c+I-</sup></italic>; UBC-cre/ERT2; <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice treated with corn oil vehicle (<italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> + oil). Investigation of the efficiency of Cre-mediated deletion in brain lysate preparations from prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Fig. S10B, C), hippocampus (HPC) (Fig. S10D, E) and cerebellum (CB) (Fig. S10F) confirmed that upon TAM treatment, <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA and protein levels were restored to near WT levels in the adult brain of <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice. As expected, <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> + oil mice showed impaired SM performance compared to WT + oil control littermates, which was fully rescued upon TAM treatment. Specifically, upon reintroduction of a familiar juvenile mouse <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>+ TAM mice showed a strong reduction in social interaction, indicative of intact SM, comparable to TAM-treated WT littermates and significantly different from <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice treated with corn oil (Fig. S10G). The intact SM of the <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> + TAM mice was further evident in analysis of difference score (Fig. S10H) compared to the corn oil-treated <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice. By contrast, <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice hyperactivity in the open field was not affected upon TAM treatment consistent with our previous results from constitutive genetic reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels (Fig. S10I). Overall, our findings indicate that restoration of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels in adult <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice has substantial effects on ameliorating cognitive deficits, indicating a broad window of therapeutic opportunity and highlighting Emc10 as a promising target for postnatal therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>We explored the translation potential of this finding by employing transient injection of single stranded ASOs targeting the mouse gene as dictated by their demonstrated efficacy as a therapeutic modality in preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) and clinical studies of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) or neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Over 300 chimeric 2′-O-methoxyethyl/DNA gapmer ASOs were generated and screened for <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA reduction in 4T1 cells via electroporation (Fig. S11A). Lead ASOs were then confirmed in a dose-response assay (Fig. S11B), including the lead ASO (1081815, herein referred to as Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup>), which targets intron 2 of mouse <italic>Emc10</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> was selected for subsequent studies, as it was effective in lowering <italic>Emc10</italic> expression both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, following transient intracerebral ventricular (ICV) injection in the posterior ventricle of 8 weeks old WT mice, Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> effectively suppressed the levels of <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA (Fig. S11C) and protein (Fig. S11D) in both left and right HPC compared to WT mice treated with a control ASO (Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup>) without complementarity in the mouse. Analysis of <italic>Gfap</italic> and <italic>Aif1</italic> expression did not reveal any changes (Fig. S11E, F) suggesting lack of astroglial and microglial activation upon Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> injection. Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> injected mice showed normal gait and no signs of behavioral toxicity. IHC analysis using an antibody that selectively recognizes the phosphorothioate backbone verified a robust diffusion primarily in HPC and to a lesser degree in surrounding brain areas. Colocalization with the neuronal marker NeuN and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) confirmed accumulation in hippocampal neurons as well as GFAP-expressing astrocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Analysis of <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice treated by intraventricular injection at 8 weeks of age showed that Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> effectively lowered hippocampal <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA to nearly WT levels 3 weeks post-injection resulting in normalization of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, left panel). By contrast, consistent with the pattern of ASO distribution, we did not observe a significant reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of <italic>Df</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) <italic><sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice treated with Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, right panel). In addition to targeted assays, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing analysis of Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup> and Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup>-treated <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice and WT littermates to evaluate the effect of Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> treatment on the hippocampal transcriptome profile. In the Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup> treated group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, left panel), we observe the tripartite differential gene expression signature characteristic of <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice: upregulation of <italic>Emc10</italic> and non-coding RNAs (pri-forms of miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, left panel and inset, Log2Fold Change = 0.5) as well as the expected downregulation of genes included within the <italic>Df(16)A</italic> deficiency.

Apart from <italic>Emc10</italic>, seven other genes (<italic>Mir9-3hg</italic>, <italic>Plxnd1</italic>, <italic>Cd68</italic>, <italic>Mir22hg</italic>, <italic>Gm28439</italic>, <italic>Adgre1</italic>, and <italic>Tnn</italic>) are significantly upregulated in <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice in the Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup> but not in the Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup>-treated group (Supplementary Table SS). We used the Bowtie mapping tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>) to align short sequencing reads on both genomic and transcript sequence to assess whether these expression changes represent potential off-target effects of the Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> in the mouse transcriptome. Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> exclusively aligned with full complementarity to an intronic region in the <italic>Emc10</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) providing additional support for high target specificity. The observed changes might represent downstream effects of <italic>Emc10</italic> level reduction or reflect expression variability due to low expression levels of the upregulated genes.</p>

<p>Eight-week-old <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice and WT littermates were treated by ICV injection of Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> and Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup> and tested 3 weeks later in SM assays. <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice treated with Ctrl<sup>ASO1</sup> showed the expected deficits in SM as reflected in the sustained high interaction time with the reintroduced familiar juvenile mouse. By contrast, <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice injected with Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup> had significantly improved performance to levels indistinguishable from Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup>-treated WT littermates consistent with improvement of function arising from adult restoration of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). Rescue was observed in both sexes and no significant differences were seen in treatment across sexes. In control experiments, we did not observe any effects of genotype or treatment upon reintroduction of a novel juvenile mouse in trial 2 (Fig. S12A, B), strongly indicating that SM deficits are not driven by a simple task fatigue.</p>
<p>To evaluate the consistency and reproducibility of the ASO-mediated SM rescue, we generated additional ASOs and screened them for <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA reduction <italic>in viva</italic> (Fig. S13A-C). One of these ASOs (1466182, herein referred to as Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup>), which targets intron 1 of mouse <italic>Emc10</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) was selected as the lead ASO for the replication analysis based on its efficacy in reducing <italic>Emc10</italic> levels, distribution pattern, as well as the lack of any signs of astroglial/microglial activation or behavioral toxicity (see Materials and Methods). IHC analysis showed robust distribution in both HPC (Fig. S14A, top panel) and PFC (Fig. S14A, middle panel) as well as diffusion into both neuronal and non-neuronal cells (Fig. S14A, bottom panel). qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice treated by intraventricular injection at 8 weeks of age showed that Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup> effectively lowered <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA to nearly WT levels 3 weeks post-injection resulting in normalization of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression in the HPC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), PFC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) and somatosensory cortex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). To study the effects of Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup>-mediated <italic>Emc10</italic> reduction on SM performance, 8-week-old <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I-</sup></italic> male mice and WT littermates were treated by ICV injection of Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup> and Ctrl<sup>ASO2</sup> and tested 3 weeks later. <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I-</sup></italic> mice injected with Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup> had significantly improved SM performance to levels indistinguishable from Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup>-treated WT littermates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to SM deficits, <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice show a spectrum of cognitive impairments in episodic and spatial memory as reflected, for example, in impaired performance in an Y-maze-based delayed alternations task that probes short-term spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) and contextual fear conditioning a form of associative learning test used for studying episodic learning and spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). We proceeded to investigate the impact of ASO-mediated Emc10 reduction in the adult brain on both of these cognitive tasks. First, we confirmed that adult male <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice exhibit impaired short-term spatial memory during novelty exploration in a two-trial delayed alternation Y-maze task (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) as previously described for another mouse model of the 22q11.2 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). The total number of arm entries remained unchanged, indicating no alternations in locomotor activity (Fig. S14B). To determine whether reducing Emc10 expression in the brain via ASO treatment could rescue short-term spatial memory deficits, we tested a new cohort of <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice and WT littermates 3-weeks following ASO administration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). ASO-treated <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice exhibited a significant improvement in delayed alternations compared to <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice treated with control ASO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Furthermore, no significant differences in total number of arm entries were observed between the groups (Fig. S14C). We confirmed the reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels in the ASO-treated animals through qRT-PCR assays of the HPC, PFC and SSC brain regions (Fig. S14D-F). In the contextual fear conditioning task, while ASO treatment was not sufficient to fully rescue the learning deficit in <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice to WT levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>, right panel), there was a modest improvement in fear memory of ASO-treated <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice, since these mice did not differ significantly from the ASO-treated WT littermates. Interestingly, we have previously shown that genetic reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels in <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice resulted in only partial restoration of deficits in contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Thus our finding faithfully recapitulates results from our previous constitutive genetic rescue assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and likely indicates a more limited role of <italic>Emc10</italic> upregulation in the 22q11.2-linked fear memory deficits rather than requirement for additional treatment time or for earlier onset of <italic>Emc10</italic> normalization.</p>

<p>The application of ASOs as a novel therapeutic strategy has seen a significant rise in recent years, in part due to their versatility in durably modifying RNA transcripts. Therefore, we investigated the longevity of ASO-mediated repression of <italic>Emc10</italic> as an indicator of future therapeutic relevance for the treatment of 22q11.2DS. To this end, we conducted the SM and Y-maze assays on a new cohort of <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice at 3-4 weeks and 8-9 weeks post injection with Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We observed behavioral rescue in Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup>-treated <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic> mice in the SM assay at three weeks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, left panel) and in the Y-maze assay at four weeks post ASO-administration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, left panel) in accordance to our previous findings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F, H</xref>). Remarkably, we replicated these results at 8-9 weeks post injection, demonstrating sustained behavioral rescue of SM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, right panel) and spatial memory deficits (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, right panel). Importantly, locomotor activity remained unchanged in the Y-maze assays at both, four weeks (Fig. S14G) and nine weeks (Fig. S14H) post injection. Finally, we confirmed the downregulation of <italic>Emc10</italic> in ASO-treated animals via qRT-PCR assays of the HPC, PFC, and SSC brain regions at ten weeks post-treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of 22q11.2DS, especially ones related to abnormal expression and processing of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), we still do not have a promising therapeutic avenue for the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with the 22q11.2 deletion. By leveraging our recent understanding of the molecular, cellular and behavioral consequences of 22q11.2-linked miRNA dysregulation, the present study represents an advancement towards developing a potential therapeutic strategy in two ways:</p>
<p><italic>First</italic>, we show that 22q11.2 deletion results in abnormal processing of miRNAs in human neurons and in turn drives upregulation of <italic>EMC10</italic> levels as previously described in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Effective reduction to near WT levels or even complete depletion of <italic>EMC10</italic> leads to restoration of key alterations in morphological and functional neuronal maturation emerging due to 22q11.2 deletions. The miRNA regulatory mechanism underlying <italic>EMC10</italic> upregulation and the restoration of cellular deficits are very similar to the ones we previously described in <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I-</sup></italic> mice, highlighting the robustness of this molecular alteration as well as the translational value of using animal models to probe the link between <italic>Emc10</italic> upregulation and 22q11.2-linked behavioral dysfunction.</p>
<p><italic>Secand</italic>, we show that normalization of <italic>Emc10</italic> levels in adult <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I-</sup></italic> mouse brain, by ASO-mediated targeted knockdown, is effective in rescuing SM deficits (which emerge during postnatal development and are present as early as postnatal day 22) as well as short-term spatial memory deficits. These findings strongly suggest that at least for a subset of 22q11.2-associated cognitive deficits it is the sustained miRNA dysregulation and elevation of <italic>Emc10</italic> throughout the adult life that interferes with the underlying neural processes rather than an irreversible impact on brain maturation during early development and demonstrate the therapeutic potential for treating a wide range of cognitive symptoms associated with 22q11.2DS.</p>
<p>In vivo delivery of ASOs offers a potential venue for emerging treatments of genetically driven and postnatally reversible symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) focusing in reduction of culprit gene expression via sequence-specific knockdown of mRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). A common challenge in efforts to employ gene-knockdown therapies for dosage-sensitive genes such as <italic>EMC10</italic> is restricting target gene expression within optimal levels to avoid potential toxicity due to target hyper-knockdown or complete elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). A large number of relatively rare LoF variants or potentially damaging missense variants have been identified in the human <italic>EMC10</italic> gene among likely healthy individuals in gnomAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) which is depleted of individuals known to be affected by severe NDDs. Taken together with our previous analysis of heterozygous <italic>Emc10</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), these observations strongly indicate that 50% reductions in <italic>Emc10</italic> levels are well tolerated at the level of the organism. The highest dose for both Emc10-specific ASOs used in mutant <italic>Df(16)A<sup>+I–</sup></italic>mice was limited to ∼300 µg and reduced <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA to either normal or below normal (30-50% of WT) expression while attaining full behavioral rescue. While higher dose may be required to ameliorate other behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), it should be noted that an acute injection of 700µg Emc10<sup>ASO</sup> in WT mice that resulted in ∼50% reduction of Emc10 levels (Fig. S13) did not cause secondary cellular and behavioral toxicity. Thus, available evidence indicates that therapeutically effective ASO-mediated normalization of <italic>EMC10</italic> levels can be up-or down-titrated within an unequivocally safe range. Future experiments will determine whether ASO-mediated normalization of adult <italic>Emc10</italic> levels restores additional 22q11.2 behavioral and cognitive alterations and whether earlier onset of postnatal ASO treatment can be employed to prevent the onset of behavioral deficits or to mitigate specific behavioral deficits that do not respond to adult interventions.</p>
<p>In addition to reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> expression our findings have implications for therapeutic interventions aiming to manipulate its downstream targets. In that respect, it is attractive to speculate that different <italic>EMC10</italic> upregulation-linked phenotypes and their developmental requirements may be driven by dysregulation of distinct, individually or in combinations, downstream EMC targets. Such targets are typically multi-transmembrane domain (TMD) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) that contain low-hydrophobicity TMDs which are hard to insert into ER membrane and thus require the aid of EMC as a membrane insertase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Identification of neurotransmitter receptors, channels, and transporters whose biogenesis, trafficking and membrane insertion are affected by EMC10 upregulation could help establish a link between such targets and 22q11.2-related behavioral dysfunction and guide efforts to develop treatments for specific 22q11.2 deletion symptoms.</p>
<p>Overall, by pointing to manipulations of <italic>EMC10</italic> expression and activity as well as of downstream targets as an attractive alternative or augmentation of currently available treatments and highlighting a broad temporal window of therapeutic and preventive opportunity for the 22q11.2 deletion-associated cognitive and behavioral symptoms, our results pave the way for developing mechanism-based therapeutic strategies, leveraging insights from both human and animal models to enhance clinical outcomes in precision medicine for neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>Cell line donors</title>
<p><italic>Q6 and Q5 lines:</italic> The Q6 line donor is a 20-year-old female patient with a history of developmental delay and an overall Full-Scale IQ in the low 80s. She was clinically diagnosed with 22q11.2DS by FISH testing. Her psychotic symptoms, including disorganized behavior and command auditory hallucinations, started when she was 17 years old. During the first break episode, due to the severity of her psychotic symptoms, the patient was hospitalized and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The patient also developed depressive symptoms, including frequent suicidal ideation. One year after her schizophrenia diagnosis, in addition to her severe psychotic symptoms, the patient was also diagnosed to be in a catatonic state. The patient has remained severely psychotic since the onset of these symptoms at age 17 and has been on multiple antipsychotics without experiencing any clinically meaningful benefit. Regarding her treatment history includes various first-line antipsychotics (including olanzapine, stelazine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, risperidone and clozapine); several antidepressants (sertraline and fluoxetine); a mood stabilizer (lithium) and benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam). None of these medications reportedly led to any clinically significant improvement in either the psychotic or the depressive symptoms. The patient has also undergone 2 rounds of electroconvulsive treatment (ECT), but with only short-lived improvement. The Q5 line donor is the probands dizygotic twin sister who does not carry a 22q11.2 deletion and her psychiatric evaluation ruled out any history of psychiatric symptoms (Supplementary Table S1). Sibling are of Caucasian Western European descent.</p>
<p><italic>Q1 and Q2 lines:</italic> The Q1 and Q2 line were previously described (as DEL3 and WT3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). The Q1 line donor is a 32-year-old male patient with a history of developmental and speech delay. He was clinically diagnosed with 22q11.2DS by FISH testing at age 4. His psychotic symptoms, started when he was 12 years old. The patient was hospitalized once at age 10 before he was formally diagnosed with schizophrenia. During that time, he also experienced one seizure. The patient also developed mood lability and has OCD-like symptoms although does not meet full criteria for DSM-IV/V OCD. Regarding his treatment history, it includes various first-line antipsychotics as well as metyrosine (started when he was 15). The Q2 line donor is the proband’s brother, who does not carry a 22q11.2 deletion and his psychiatric evaluation ruled out any history of psychiatric symptoms (Supplementary Table S1).

In brief, TAM (catalog#T5648, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in corn oil (catalog#C8267, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 20mg/ml by vortexing. To avoid toxicity, the following dosages were used for adult animals (8-10 weeks): mice at 17–21 g body weight were fed 5 mg/day; mice at 22–25g body weight were fed 6mg/day; mice at 26–29g body weight were fed 7mg/day; mice at 30–35g body weight were fed 8mg/day. Adult animals were fed for 5 consecutive days followed by 2 days of rest. Animals were then fed for 5 more consecutive days followed by one week of rest before RNA/protein or SM assays were performed. Corn oil was used as vehicle control treatment.</p>

<title>ASOs</title>
<p>Mouse <italic>Emc10</italic>-targeting ASOs used in these studies were 20 bases in length, chimeric 2’ –O-(2-methoxyethyl) (MOE)/DNA) oligonucleotides with phosphodiester and phosphorothioate linkages. The central gap of 10 deoxynucleotides is flanked on its 5’ and 3’ sides by five MOE modified nucleotides. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at Ionis Pharmaceuticals (Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>).

<title>In vitro screening of ASOs</title>
<p>4T1 cells were trypsinized, counted and diluted to 200,000 cells per ml in room temperature growth medium before adding 100 μL of the cell suspension to the wells of a 2 mm electroporation plate (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) which contained 11 μL of 10X ASO in water. Cells were pulsed once at 130V for 6 mS with the ECM 830 instrument (Harvard Apparatus). After electroporation, the cells were transferred to a Corning Primeria 96 well culture plate (catalog #353872, Corning, NY, USA) containing 50 μL of growth medium. The cells were then incubated at 37° C and 5% CO2. After 24 hours, the cells were washed 1 x with PBS before lysing for RNA isolation and analysis. For each treatment condition duplicate wells were tested. ASO1081815 (TTGTTCCTACAGATCTAGGG, referred to in the manuscript as Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup>) was used in behavioral and immunocytochemical assays.</p>

<title>In vivo screening of ASOs</title>
<p>Candidate <italic>Emc10</italic>-targeting ASOs (700ug) were stereotactically injected into the right lateral ventricle of C57Bl/6 mice (0.3 mm anterior, 1.0 mm dextrolateral, 3.0 mm ventral from bregma). Reduction of <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA in the retrosplenial cortex and thoracic spinal cord was evaluate by qRT-PCR at 2 weeks following a single bolus dose. Three ASOs were selected from the screen based on their pharmacological efficacy: 1466167, 1466171 and 1466182. Animals were injected with these ASOs in the right lateral ventricle as described above (n= 4) and euthanized 8 weeks post injection. Animals were evaluated with an observational functional battery test at 3 hours after dosing and then every two weeks until euthanasia. The retrosplenial cortex and thoracic spinal cord were harvested for qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>Emc10</italic>, <italic>Aif1</italic> (microglia marker), <italic>Cd68</italic> (phagocytic microglia marker) and <italic>Gfap</italic> (reactive astrocyte marker) mRNA.

Tissues were stained for H&amp;E and IBA1 (microglia marker), CD68 (phagocytic microglia marker) GFAP (reactive astrocyte marker) and Calbindin (Purkinje Cell marker). Bolus injections of all three candidate ASOs resulted in similar reductions of the <italic>Emc10</italic> mRNA at both 2 and 8 weeks. Of the three candidate ASOs, ASO1466182 (GCCATATCTTTATTAATTAC, referred to in the manuscript as Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup>) showed no signs of in life toxicity and the tolerability marker gene expression was similar between ASO– and vehicle-treated animals in the tissues evaluated. There was no positive IBA1 IHC staining in the CNS of any of the treated animals. Therefore, it was ranked as the best candidate for further behavioral analysis in mutant mice.</p>

<title>Stereotactic Intracerebroventricular (ICV) Injections of ASOs</title>
<p>The syringe was attached to a glass pipette with a long-tapered end made using a Sutter pipette puller model P-87. Anesthesia was delivered using Kent Scientific VetFlo Traditional Vaporizer VetFlo-1205S (Kent Scientific Corporation, Torrington, CT, USA). Mice were initially put in the isoflurane chamber using 3% isoflurane mixture for 5 minutes, which was lowered to 2-2.5% when fixed to the stereotactic station. We used KOPF Small Animal Stereotaxic Instruments (Model 940). Carprofen (5 mg/kg, Zoetis Inc., Kalamazoo, MI, USA), and Bupivacaine (2 mg/kg, Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, Il, USA) were delivered subcutaneously before the incision was made. Additionally, Dexamethasone (2 mg/kg, Bimeda-MTC Animal Healt Inc., Cambridge, ON, Canada) was delivered intramuscularly. The surgical site was shaved and sterilized with betadine and 70% ethanol three times. A small midline incision was made and a hole was drilled in the skull. Stereotactic bregma coordinates used for the right ventricle were – 0.5 mm posterior, –1.1 lateral, and –2.8 mm dorsoventral. Mice were injected with 4 ul of either the Ctrl<sup>ASO1/ASO2</sup> or <italic>Emc10<sup>ASO1IASO2</sup></italic> (Emc10<sup>ASO1</sup>: 292 ug, Emc10<sup>ASO2</sup>: 280 ug) at a rate of 0.5ul/minute. The needle was left in the injection site for 10 minutes to allow diffusion and avoid back flow of the ASO upon retraction of the glass pipette.</p>
<p>Mice were maintained at a temperature of 37°C for the duration of the surgery using a water regulated heating pad (T/Pump TP 700, Stryker Corporation, Kalamazoo, MI, USA). Mice were placed on heating pads for in cage recovery and Carprofen was administered subcutaneously for three days post-surgery. Mice were then subjected to behavioral experiments/immunohistochemistry three weeks post-surgery. qRT-PCR assays were performed one week post behavioral assays.</p>

This block was then glued to the vibratome stage (Leica Vibratome VT10005, Wetzlar, Germany) and sectioned at 40 um thickness. Sections were rinsed in 1xPBS for 5 minutes and then blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in 2% Normal Goat Serum (NGS) and 0.3%Triton X-100 in 1xPBS solution. Sections were then incubated with either anti-ASO and NeuN or anti-ASO and GFAP primary antibodies in blocking solution at 4°C and left on a shaker overnight. The following day, sections were washed three times with 1xPBS for 10 minutes and were then stained with Goat anti-rabbit along with either Goat anti-mouse or Goat anti-chicken secondary antibodies in 2% NGS and 0.4% Triton-X100 solution made in 1xPBS for two hours in the dark at room temperature (RT). Following two 10-minute washes with 1xPBS, sections were additionally stained with Hoechst nuclear stain diluted in 1xPBS for 15 minutes in the dark. Lastly, sections were washed three times with 1xPBS for 10 minutes. Sections from PBS solution were mounted on glass slides, air-dried and cover slipped in Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant (catalog#P36970, Life Technologies Corporation, Eugene, OR, USA).

<p>Raw reads were subjected to an in-house program, ACGT101-miR (LC Sciences, Houston, TX, USA) to remove adapter dimers, junk, low complexity, common RNA families (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and repeats. Subsequently, unique sequences with length in 18∼26 nucleotide were mapped to specific species precursors in miRBase (v22.0) by BLAST search to identify known miRNAs and novel 3p– and 5p-derived miRNAs. Length variation at both 3’ and 5’ ends and one mismatch inside of the sequence were allowed in the alignment. The unique sequences mapping to specific species mature miRNAs in hairpin arms were identified as known miRNAs. The unique sequences mapping to the other arm of known specific species precursor hairpin opposite to the annotated mature miRNA-containing arm were considered to be novel 5p-or 3p derived miRNA candidates. The remaining sequences were mapped to other selected species precursors (with the exclusion of specific species) in miRBase 22.0 by BLAST search, and the mapped pre-miRNAs were further BLASTed against the specific species genomes to determine their genomic locations. The above two mentioned mapped 5p and 3p sequences were defined as known miRNAs.

<title>Bulk RNAseq and bioinformatic analysis of NGN2-induced neurons at DIV21</title>
<p>We used poly-A pull-down to enrich mRNAs from total RNA samples, then proceed with library construction using Illumina TruSeq chemistry (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Libraries were then sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at Columbia Genome Center. We multiplexed samples in each lane, which yields targeted number of paired-end 100bp reads for each sample. We used RTA (Illumina) for base calling and bcl2fastq2 (version 2.19) for converting BCL to fastq format, coupled with adaptor trimming. We performed a pseudoalignment to a kallisto index created from transcriptomes (Ensembl v96, Human:GRCh38.p12) using kallisto (0.44.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>). We tested for differentially expressed genes using DESeq2 (adj. Pvalue&lt;0.05), R packages designed to test differential expression between two experimental groups from RNA-seq counts data. Intersection of DEGs were conducted by using the VIB / UGent Bioinformatics &amp; Evolutionary Genomics (Gent, Belgium) webtool “Venn” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/">https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/</ext-link>). GO-Term enrichment analysis was performed for the up– and downregulated DEGs Q5(Ctrl)/Q6(22q11.2) and normalized up– and downregulated DEGs in Q6/EMC10<sup>HET</sup> and Q6/EMC10<sup>HOM</sup> by using the standard setting (g:SCS threshold) of the gProfiler webtool <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost">https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>).

<title>Open Field assay</title>
<p>The open field activity assay was performed as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In brief, mouse activity was monitored in a clear illuminated acrylic chamber (25 cm x 25 cm) equipped with infrared sensors to automatically record horizontal and vertical activity (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA, USA). Each mouse was initially placed in the center of the chamber and its activity was recorded and collected in 1-min bins for 1 h using TruScan (v1.012-00) software (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA, USA). The floors and walls of the open field were cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials.</p>

<title>Sacial Memary assay</title>
<p>Assays were performed as described earlier in juvenile (postnatal day 22-24) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) mice. All experimental mice were single housed, transferred to the testing room one hour prior to testing and returned to their home cages after the completion of the experiment. Both male and female were tested in the juvenile SM assays, in the TAM/corn oil treatment assays as well as in the ASO1 assays. Only males were tested in the ASO2 assays. For the adult SM assays, stimulus mice (C57 BL/6J) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All stimulus mice were between the ages of 3-4 weeks. Test and stimulus mice were sex matched in the experimental trials. All trials were recorded using a video camera (Webcam Pro 9000, Logitech, Lausanne, Switzerland) and recorder software (Logitech video recording software). Stimulus mice were color marked on the tails to distinguish the stimulus mice from the test mice, during video analysis. The videos were manually scored for total interaction time over the course of the trials for interactions initiated by the test animal including anal sniffing, nose-to-nose touch and close following. For the novel/familiar paradigm, test and stimulus (novel) mice were placed together in a neutral cage and the interaction was recorded (trial 1). One hour after trial 1, the same stimulus (familiar) mouse was placed together with the test mouse and the interaction was recorded again (trial 2). A similar procedure was followed for the control novel/novel paradigm, except that we used different stimulus mice for trial 1 and trial 2 such that at trial 2 the stimulus mice were also novel for the experimental mice. Trials with experimental mice showing highly aggressive behavior towards the stimulus mice or mice that interacted for less than 24s in trial 1 were excluded from the analysis.</p>

<p>Contextual Fear Conditioning assays were performed as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) using a Coulbourn animal shocker (Model H13-15 110V, Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA, USA). Sound levels were checked with a Digital Sound Level Meter (Model: 407730, Extech Instruments, MA, USA) before beginning the trials. Using a cotton swab, pure lemon extract (McCormick &amp; Co, Hunt Valley, MD, USA) was introduced into the testing chamber adding 9 different but equal distributed spots on a napkin. Test mice were placed in the test chamber and received 2 pairs of a tone (30s, 82db) and a co-terminating shock (2s, 0.7mA). Mice were then carefully picked with forceps and returned to their home cage. After 24 hours, mice were placed in the FC box again with same environment and lemon scent for 6 minutes in the absence of tone and shock to test for contextual memory. The box and grid were cleaned with 70% EtOH before and between every test run on both days.

<title>Y-Maze assay</title>
<p>The Y-maze apparatus was made from white acrylic that consists of three equal-sized arms (38 cm long, 13 cm high, and 8 cm wide) of which each arm of the Y-maze was positioned at an equal angle and was purchased from SD Instruments (cat#7001-0419, San Diego, CA, USA). The Y-maze assay was performed as described previously in more detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>). In brief, adult male mice were tested on delayed alternations. Exploration in all three arms of the Y-maze was performed after a 1 h delay from an initial training phase of 10 min, where one arm of the maze was blocked (delayed alternation). Delayed alternation (%) was calculated as the number of entries in all three arms divided by the total number of entries in the first 5 min of the 10 min test phase whereas the number of entries per arm was used as a measurement of activity and locomotion. The movement of mice was recorded with a camera mounted above the apparatus and the number of arm entries was counted manually.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an important and very well-presented set of experiments following up on prior work from the lab investigating knock-down (KD) of EMC10 in the restoration of neuronal and cognitive deficits in 22q11.2 Del models, including now both human iPSCs and a mouse model in vivo now with ASOs.</p>
<p>The valuable progress in this current manuscript is the development of ASOs, and the proof of efficacy in vivo in mice of the ASO in knock-down of EMC10 and amelioration of in vivo behavioral phenotypes.</p>
<p>The experiments include iPSC studies demonstrating elevations of EMC10 in a solid collection of paired iPSC lines. These studies also provide evidence of manipulation of EMC10 by overexpression and inhibition of miRNAs that exist in the 22q11 interval. The iPSC studies also nicely demonstrate the rescue of impairments with KD of EMC10 in neuronal arborization as well as KCl-induced neuronal activity. The major in vivo contributions reflect an impressive demonstration of the efficacy of two ASOs in vivo on both KD of EMC10 in vivo and through improvement in behavioral abnormalities in the 22q11 mouse in a range of different behaviors, including social behavior and learning behaviors.</p>
<p>Overall, there are many strengths reflected in this study, including in particular the synergy between in vitro studies in human cell models and in vivo studies in the well-characterized mouse model. The experiments are generally rigorously performed, well-powered, and nicely presented. The claims with regard to the mechanisms of EMC10 elevations and the importance of restoration of EMC10 expression to neuronal morphology and behavior are well supported by the data. The work may be further supported in future studies, by investigation of rescue by ASOs of circuit dysfunction in vivo or ex vivo through electrophysiology in the mouse model. Also, in future studies, investigation of the mechanism by which EMC10, an ER protein involved in protein processing, may function in the observed neuronal abnormalities; however, these studies are clearly for future investigations.</p>
<p>The potential impact of the work is found in the potential value of the ASO approach to the treatment of 22q11, or the pre-clinical evidence that knock-down of this protein may lead to some amelioration of cognitive symptoms. Overall, a very convincing and complementary set of experiments to support EMC10 KD as a therapeutic strategy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Thakur et. al seeks to establish a novel ASO-based approach to treat 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Central to this thesis is that an ER membrane complex member called EMC10 is significantly increased in the disorder, which is largely attributed to the loss of miRNA-mediated repression. The authors generated three new iPSC cell lines for the disorder and showed that deletion of EMC10 rescues morphology and Ca-flux deficits. They go on to show that post-symptomatic deletion of Emc10 in mice using a conditional-off tamoxifen allele reverses social memory phenotypes. Finally, in collaboration with Ionis, they developed two new ASOs to knock down EMC10 and show that social and spatial memory phenotypes are rescued, even two months after injection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In general, this represents a substantial undertaking and an impressive body of work. The experiments follow a logical progression and in most cases are well-controlled. The isolation of EMC10 effects relative to the broader miRNA disruption is viewed as impactful. The use of both genetic and ASO approaches to validate the therapeutic strategy is also viewed as highly positive. The authors' contention that EMC10 can be targeted at post-symptomatic time points to reverse 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is supported by the data. Further, they have provided a therapeutic mechanism to do so. These findings are likely to be impactful and lead to further development efforts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The primary weaknesses of the manuscript lie in incomplete or inappropriate data analysis, as well as a failure to validate key experiments. For example, both genetic and ASO-mediated EMC10-mediated reductions are assessed at the level of mRNA, but only one experiment, in one brain region, is validated at the protein level. This brain region is the PFC, which is problematic when many of the phenotypes used have a strong hippocampal component. Likewise, the iPSC experiments make the case that excitatory neurons are central to the phenotype, but no effort is made to show that the ASOs are entering that type of neuron, or even any quantification of what percentage of cells in the target brain regions (HPC, PFC, etc.) are positive for the ASO. There is only a single image provided of staining with a phosphorothioate antibody and a claim of robust uptake, which cannot be assumed. The iPSC transcriptomics work would also benefit from a more comprehensive comparison between the EMC10 knockout lines and their parent 22q11 deletion lines. Further, there are other examples where the statistics used are either wrong (Figure 3 t-test vs ANOVA) or missing (Figure S2). These technical and analytical shortcomings make it challenging to fully interpret the data and detract from an otherwise exciting manuscript.</p>
