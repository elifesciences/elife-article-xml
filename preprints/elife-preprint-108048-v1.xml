<title>Abstract</title><p>Differences in immunity between males and females in living organisms are generally thought to be due to sex hormones and sex chromosomes, and it is often assumed that males have a weaker immune response. Here we report that in fish, males exhibit stronger antiviral immune responses, which are driven by the male-biased gene Cyp17a2 rather than by hormones or sex chromosomes. First, we observed that male zebrafish exhibit enhanced antiviral resistance compared to females, and notably, zebrafish lack sex chromosomes. Through transcriptomic screening, we found that <italic>cyp17a2</italic> was specifically highly expressed in male fish. <italic>Cyp17a2</italic> knockout males were equivalent to wild-type males in terms of sex organs and androgen secretion, but the ability to upregulate IFN as well as antiviral resistance was greatly reduced. Then, Cyp17a2 is identified as a positive IFN regulator which located at endoplasmic reticulum, and specifically interacts with and enhances STING mediated antiviral responses. Mechanistically, Cyp17a2 stabiles STING expression by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM11, which facilitates K33-linked polyubiquitination. The capacity of IFN induction of Cyp17a2 was abolished when STING is knockdown. Meanwhile, Cyp17a2 also attenuates viral infection directly to strengthen the antiviral capacity as an antiviral protein, Cyp17a2 degrades the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) P protein by utilizing USP8 to reduce its K33-linked polyubiquitination. These findings reveal a sex-based regulatory mechanism in teleost antiviral immunity, broadening our understanding of sexual dimorphism in immune responses beyond the conventional roles of sex chromosomes and hormones.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research has demonstrated that innate immune responses to viruses differ significantly between the sexes. Males exhibit heightened susceptibility to viral pathogens, correlating with their generally weaker innate immune activation compared to females<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]</sup>. This immunological dimorphism manifests clinically as elevated infection intensity (quantified by intra-host viral load) and prevalence (population-level infection rates) in males<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup>. Notably, sex-specific clinical outcomes are exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, where epidemiological data suggest males face twice the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and a 30% higher mortality rate compared to females<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]</sup>. Similar trends extend to other viral pathogens including Dengue virus, hantaviruses, and hepatitis B/C viruses, all exhibiting male-biased infection prevalence<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4a">4a,b,c</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Several factors have been identified as contributors to these sex-specific disparities in antiviral immunity, including hormonal variations and sex chromosomes. For instance, androgens such as testosterone exhibit broad immunosuppressive effects, including reduced NK cell cytotoxicity, impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, and attenuated macrophage proinflammatory cytokine production <italic>in vitro</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]</sup>. In addition, the Y chromosome harbors only two annotated miRNAs, while the X chromosome contains numerous immune-relevant miRNAs, and emerging evidence implicates X-escapee miRNAs as key modulators of sex-biased immune responses<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6a">6a,b</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>It is well known that the interferon (IFN) response is an important host immune response to viral infection, in both mammals and fish<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]</sup>. The signaling pathways that activate IFN expression, although slightly different in fish and mammals, are generally conserved in both<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]</sup>. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein stimulator of IFN genes (STING) is an important antiviral protein capable of resisting both DNA and RNA viruses by activating TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) during the induction of IFN production, which in turn phosphorylates IFN regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3) in the nucleus and activates the signaling of IFN transcription<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9a">9a,b</xref>]</sup>. For instance, STING deficiency has been shown to impair innate immune responses against multiple RNA viruses, such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10a">10a,b,c</xref>]</sup>. Notably, oncogenes of the DNA tumor viruses, including human papillomavirus E7 and adenovirus E1A, function as potent and specific inhibitors of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING signaling pathway<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Cyp17a is classified within the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) family. In mammals, there is only one form, cyp17a1, which possesses both hydroxylase and lyase functions. Mutations in the human <italic>cyp17a1</italic> gene are associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>. Comparative genomic analyses reveal that teleost fishes possess two distinct <italic>cyp17a</italic> isoforms, the evolutionarily conserved <italic>cyp17a1</italic> and a phylogenetically divergent <italic>cyp17a2</italic> paralog, with the latter representing a teleost-specific innovation absent in mammalian genomes<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup>. Current investigations of Cyp17a2 in teleost species have predominantly centered on its mechanistic roles governing sexual development and differentiation, for example, with knockout of zebrafish <italic>cyp17a2</italic> leads to significant impairment of sperm motility<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]</sup>. Although Cyp17a2 has been characterized in sexual development, its non-canonical physiological roles have yet to be fully elucidated.</p>
<p>In most vertebrates, the XY sex chromosomes exhibit significant physiological differences between males and females, as exemplified in humans. However, the sex determination mechanisms in fish are more complex. For instance, zebrafish lack sex chromosomes, which confers a natural advantage. This absence allows for the exclusion of sex chromosome-related differences in the study of immunological disparities between males and females. Consequently, we selected zebrafish as the model organism for this investigation. This enabled us to more precisely identify the genes that are differentially expressed in male and female autosomes, which is crucial for understanding the immunological differences between the sexes. This study elucidates the role of the teleost-specific gene <italic>cyp17a2</italic> in antiviral immunity, providing new insights into the evolutionary adaptation of immune systems and expanding our understanding beyond the traditional roles of sex chromosomes and hormones.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Male fish exhibit enhanced resistance to viral infection compared to female fish</title>
<p>To determine whether sex differences exist in the antiviral response capacity of fish, age-matched female and male zebrafish were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with SVCV. Male fish exhibited a significantly higher survival rate than female fish within seven days post-infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Concurrently, females demonstrated a markedly higher incidence of cutaneous hemorrhages relative to males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Consistent with the reduced mortality, male fish showed less tissue damage in the liver and spleen following viral infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). IF analysis revealed that the SVCV N protein, represented by green fluorescence, was barely detectable in male tissues but was prominently present in female tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). At the mRNA level, viral transcripts were quantified in these tissues, and the abundance of <italic>svcv-n</italic> gene was significantly lower in male tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). At the protein level, SVCV N and G proteins were less frequently detected in male tissues compared to female tissues in 7 samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Additionally, viral titers were significantly lower in the hearts of male fish compared to female fish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). These findings demonstrate a stronger antiviral response capacity in male fish compared to female fish.</p>

<label>2.</label><title>Male-biased gene cyp17a2 orchestrates antiviral immunity through RLR pathway</title>
<p>To explore the potential causes of the observed differences in virus resistance between male and female fish, transcriptome sequencing was performed on head-kidney tissues of healthy hermaphroditic adult zebrafish. A total of 1,709 differentially expressed genes were identified (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Among these, <italic>cyp17a2</italic> exhibits male-biased upregulation as a sex-related gene, and it was confirmed by subsequent qPCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Furthermore, we systematically quantified Cyp17a2 mRNA and protein expression in multiple tissues of male and female zebrafish, demonstrating a consistent male-biased expression pattern of Cyp17a2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Thus, Cyp17a2 was selected for further study. We first sought to understand whether it was associated with host antiviral immunity, and the significant upregulation of the Cyp17a2 at the mRNA and protein level in response to viral stimulation suggested its possible involvement in the antiviral process (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). Following generation of <italic>cyp17a2</italic> knockout zebrafish, previous study revealed that male <italic>cyp17a2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants displayed normal development of male-typical secondary sexual characteristics comparable to WT males. However, female <italic>cyp17a2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants exhibited significantly underdeveloped genital papillae compared to their WT counterparts. To eliminate potential confounding effects of androgen-mediated pathways on immune parameters, subsequent experiments were conducted exclusively using male specimens from both genotypes. The male <italic>cyp17a2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants exhibited a higher mortality rate than WT males after viral infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). Significant tissue damage and strong green fluorescence representing the SVCV N protein was observed in the <italic>cyp17a2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> tissues, virus titers assay also confirmed that viral proliferation was higher in <italic>cyp17a2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2L</xref>). Consistent with these observations, the replication of viral genes transcription and protein levels were increased in <italic>cyp17a2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> homozygote tissues, these data demonstrated that Cyp17a2 is crucial for host antiviral defense (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2N</xref>). To further understand their functional mechanisms, a transcriptomic analysis contains total of 3,114 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, there are 1,217 genes upregulated and 1,897 were downregulated in the liver of <italic>cyp17a2</italic> knockout male zebrafish compared to WT males after viral infection (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) signaling pathways were significantly affected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2O</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that RLRs were downregulated in <italic>cyp17a2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> group under SVCV infection, combining with numerous IFN-stimulated genes decreasing (ISGs) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2P</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). To validate the transcriptome data, <italic>ifnφ1</italic> levels were assessed and identified significantly downregulated in the <italic>cyp17a2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Q</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that viral proliferation was enhanced and IFN response were reduced in <italic>cyp17a2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> fish.</p>

<p>Given the critical role of the IFN response in host defense against viral infections, we investigated the impact of Cyp17a2 on IFN expression and viral infection <italic>in vitro</italic>. Overexpression of Cyp17a2 significantly upregulated the IFN promoter and ISRE activities in response to poly I:C or SVCV stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). An effective sh-<italic>cyp17a2</italic>#2 was generated and confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels, and knockdown of <italic>cyp17a2</italic> inhibited both the IFN promoter and ISRE activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>).

The induction or attenuation of IFN and ISGs upon Cyp17a2 overexpression or knockdown were confirmed by qPCR analysis, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). For antiviral capacity assays, Cyp17a2 from zebrafish and gibel carp both inhibited the proliferation of host-specific viruses, conversely, <italic>cyp17a2</italic> knockdown significantly enhanced viral proliferation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3K</xref>). Regarding viral mRNA and proteins, overexpression or knockdown Cyp17a2 also displayed the similar opposite findings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3M</xref>).

<p>Given the critical role of the RLR signaling pathway in fish IFN activation, the relationship between Cyp17a2 and RLR signaling adaptors was investigated. Co-transfection with Myc-Cyp17a2 and Flag-tagged RLR components (MAVS, TBK1, STING, IRF3, IRF7) followed by anti-Flag immunoprecipitation identified specific Cyp17a2-STING interaction via anti-Myc detection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Reciprocal Co-IP and semi-endogenous IP assays confirmed this interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Truncated STING mutants were generated to map binding domains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The transmembrane domain (TM)-deficient STING-ΔTM-HA failed to bind Cyp17a2, indicating TM domain dependence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Cyp17a2-GFP overlapped with ER markers in confocal microscopy and colocalized with STING but failed to colocalize with the ΔTM mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>).

<label>5.</label><title>Cyp17a2 enhances STING-mediated IFN expression and antiviral responses</title>
<p>Considering that Cyp17a2 targets STING, a positive regulator of IFN production, we investigated whether Cyp17a2 influences the IFN expression induced by STING. The IFNφ1pro activity induced by STING overexpression was significantly enhanced by Cyp17a2, with similar amplification observed for ISRE promoter activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Conversely, <italic>cyp17a2</italic> knockdown was shown to impair STING-mediated IFNφ1pro and ISRE activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). Corresponding increases in <italic>ifn</italic> and <italic>vig1</italic> transcripts were detected in Cyp17a2 overexpressing cells, while Cyp17a2 knockdown suppressed these responses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). The subsequent investigation focused on the potential modulatory effect of Cyp17a2 on the STING-induced cellular antiviral response. STING overexpression reduced CPE, with viral titers decreased 336-fold compared to the control group. This protection was augmented by Cyp17a2 co-expression, achieving an additional 20-fold reduction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). SVCV gene transcripts were suppressed by STING, with enhanced inhibition upon Cyp17a2 co-expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). IB and IF analysis confirmed that Cyp17a2 potentiated STING-mediated suppression of viral protein expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5K</xref>). STING dependency was validated using shRNA knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>). The antiviral capacity enhanced by Cyp17a2 was markedly attenuated in cells with <italic>sting</italic> knockdown, as evidenced by restored viral titers, gene and protein expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5Q</xref>).

<label>6.</label><title>Cyp17a2 stabilizes STING through TRIM11-mediated K33-linked polyubiquitination</title>
<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which Cyp17a2 augments STING stabilization, proteasomal and lysosomal degradation were pharmacologically inhibited using MG132 and CQ, respectively. Accelerated STING degradation caused by <italic>cyp17a2</italic> knockdown was rescued by MG132 but not CQ, suggesting knockdown of <italic>cyp17a2</italic> promoted STING degradation via the proteasome pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Then, enhanced polyubiquitination of STING was detected upon Cyp17a2 co-expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Ubiquitin linkage analysis revealed selective enhancement of K33-linked chains, with <italic>cyp17a2</italic> knockdown shown to reduce both WT and K33-specific ubiquitination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Subsequently, candidate E3 ligases were screened, revealing TRIM11 and SOCS3a as STING interactors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). TRIM11 was specifically identified as a Cyp17a2 binding partner through reciprocal Co-IP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>). Then the subcellular localization of TRIM11 was monitored, TRIM11-GFP signal overlapped with the red signals of the ER marker, indicating that TRIM11 colocalizes with the ER (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Since the results identify that both STING and Cyp17a2 are localized to the ER, TRIM11 was examined for cellular localization with both STING and Cyp17a2, and the anticipated colocalization pattern was confirmed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). Cyp17a2 was found to strengthen TRIM11-STING interaction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). Functional assays demonstrated that TRIM11 augmented of Cyp17a2-mediated IFNφ1pro activity and <italic>vig1</italic> mRNA induction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6L</xref>). TRIM11 potentiated the Cyp17a2-dependent stabilization of STING in both endogenous and exogenous systems (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6M</xref>). Two shRNAs target TRIM11 were designed and generated, and after validating the knockdown efficiencies for both endogenous and exogenous targets, sh-<italic>trim11</italic>#2 was selected for the subsequent assay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6N</xref>). The knockdown of TRIM11 impaired Cyp17a2-enhanced STING activity, as shown by reduced IFNφ1pro response and <italic>vig1</italic> transcripts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6O</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6P</xref>). Additionally, <italic>trim11</italic> knockdown abolished Cyp17a2-mediated STING upregulation in endogenous and overexpression system (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6Q</xref>).

Among generated lysine-to-arginine mutants (K203R, K221R), STING stabilization by Cyp17a2 was abolished specifically in K203R mutant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>).

<p>To determine whether Cyp17a2 directly engage in antiviral activity beyond regulating host immune responses, Co-IP assays were performed. Transient transfection experiments revealed specific interaction between Cyp17a2 and SVCV P protein, which was confirmed reciprocally (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>). This interaction was further observed in SVCV-infected cells using P protein-specific antibody (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). In our antiviral trials, overexpression of Cyp17a2 led to a reduction in P protein levels during SVCV infection. Consequently, the investigation focused on whether Cyp17a2 could directly target the SVCV P protein for degradation. As anticipated, the co-expression of Cyp17a2 resulted in a decrease in the level of SVCV P protein Overexpression of Cyp17a2 reduced P protein levels during SVCV infection (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy confirmed diminished red fluorescent signals corresponding to SVCV P protein in Cyp17a2-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). Confocal microscopy analysis of SVCV P protein subcellular distribution revealed that the fluorescent signals from P-mCherry fusion constructs (red) showed partial co-localization with Cyp17a2 (green) in cytoplasmic compartments (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). To investigate degradation mechanisms, inhibitors targeting distinct pathways were tested. Cyp17a2-mediated P protein degradation was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, but not by autophagy inhibitors (3-MA, Baf-A1, CQ) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>). Ubiquitination assays demonstrated that Cyp17a2 significantly reduced P protein polyubiquitination (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H</xref>). Mutation analysis using ubiquitin variants revealed that Cyp17a2 selectively decreased K33-linked polyubiquitination, as K33R mutants exhibited no significant changes, while K33-specific ubiquitination was markedly reduced (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8I</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8J</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of <italic>cyp17a2</italic> exhibited minimal impact on both WT-Ub and K33-linked polyubiquitination levels of the P protein (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8K</xref>). These findings demonstrate that Cyp17a2 promotes proteasomal degradation of the SVCV P protein by selectively attenuating K33-linked polyubiquitination, defining its role as an antiviral protein.</p>

<label>9.</label><title>The K12 site of P protein is essential for Cyp17a2-mediated degradation</title>
<p>To investigate the specific molecular mechanism underlying ubiquitination-mediated degradation of the P protein, mass spectrometry analysis revealed ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) and USP8 as candidate deubiquitinating enzymes (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). Both USP7 and USP8 were found to associate with the P protein, however, only USP8 interacted with Cyp17a2. Therefore, USP8 became the focus of subsequent study (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). The validity of these interactions was further confirmed through reciprocal experiments (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>).

Mass spectrometry identified K12 as a critical lysine modification site (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9L</xref>).

USP8 failed to enhance Cyp17a2-mediated deubiquitination in K12R mutants (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9O</xref>). Truncation analysis demonstrated that USP8 residues 1-301 aa or 734-1067 aa were essential for interactions with P protein and Cyp17a2 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9P</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9Q</xref>). USP8 mutants only residues 1-301 aa or 302-733 aa lost the ability to support Cyp17a2-mediated P protein deubiquitination (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9R</xref>). These data establish that Cyp17a2 requires USP8 and the P protein K12 site to mediate deubiquitination-dependent degradation, with USP8 residues 734-1067 aa being indispensable for this process.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The influence of biological sex on antiviral immunity presents striking evolutionary parallels and divergences across various species. While mammalian systems have been shown to establish the canonical paradigm of higher female immune competence through sex chromosome complement and hormonal regulation, our findings in fish reveal an intriguing inversion of this trend. Contrary to the well-documented XX/XY-based sexual dimorphism in mammalian immunity, our study demonstrates that male zebrafish exhibit enhanced antiviral responses through an autosomal gene-mediated mechanism that challenges conventional understanding of sex-specific immunity and underscores the extraordinary evolutionary plasticity of teleost immune systems.</p>
<p>This sexual dichotomy in immune competence emerges against the backdrop of teleost’s unparalleled diversity in sexual determination mechanisms. Unlike the chromosomal rigidity of mammalian systems, fish have evolved a spectrum of sex determination strategies ranging from conserved XX/XY systems in Japanese medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) and Nile tilapia (<italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>) to the tripartite X1Y1Y2 system of tiger characin (<italic>Hoplias malabaricus</italic>) and the ZZ/ZW system of half-smooth tongue sole (<italic>Cynoglossus semilaevis</italic>)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15a">15a,b,c,d</xref>]</sup>. Notably, this genomic plasticity extends beyond canonical sex chromosomes through the presence of naturally occurring polyploidy and accessory B chromosomes which observed in Lake Victoria cichlids (<italic>Lithochromis rubripinnis</italic>), as well as the 3–4 supernumerary microchromosomes of gibel carp, which mimic sex chromosome functionality through their tandem repeat-enriched, transposon-derived elements<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16a">16a,b</xref>]</sup>. In addition, environmental factors can override genetically programmed sex determination in select fish species without chromosomal modifications, as exemplified by thermal stress-induced masculinization in XX Japanese medaka and Nile tilapia through androgen-driven developmental reprogramming<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17a">17a,b</xref>]</sup>. This phenotypic plasticity coupled with extraordinary genomic diversity in sex determination systems, establishes teleost as unparalleled models for investigating the evolutionary continuum between genetic and environmental influences on sexual differentiation. It is evident that this complexity exceeds the capabilities of the mammalian mechanism, thereby necessitating meticulous mechanical analysis.</p>
<p>In this study, our mechanistic dissection reveals that enhanced male antiviral competence in zebrafish from elevated expression of the autosomal <italic>cyp17a2</italic> gene, operating through dual antiviral pathways. First, Cyp17a2 stabilizes the STING protein via TRIM11-mediated K33-linked polyubiquitination at Lys203, amplifying IFN production. Second, it recruits USP8 to remove K33-linked ubiquitination at Lys12 of SVCV P protein, promoting its proteasomal degradation (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). This dual functionality establishes Cyp17a2 as a central node in sex-specific antiviral regulation, functioning independently of canonical sex chromosome pathways. Particularly noteworthy is the demonstration that sexual dimorphism in immunity can arise through differential regulation of autosomal genes rather than direct sex chromosome effects - a mechanism distinct from mammalian X-linked immune gene dosage effects or estrogen-mediated immunomodulation. These discoveries in zebrafish, a species naturally lacking sex chromosomes, highlight one of the mechanisms underlying sex-specific antiviral immunity in teleost, demonstrating a system distinct from mammalian.</p>

<p>Upon virus infection, male-biased autosomal gene <italic>cyp17a2</italic> enhances antiviral responses in males. Mechanistically, Cyp17a2, an ER-localized protein, stabilizes STING expression through recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM11, promoting K33-linked polyubiquitination. Furthermore, Cyp17a2 facilitates proteasomal degradation of the SVCV P protein by engaging USP8 to reduce its K33-linked polyubiquitination, thereby amplifying antiviral IFN responses.</p></caption>

<p>Sexual dimorphism in viral susceptibility represents a conserved yet mechanistically complex phenomenon across vertebrates. While males generally exhibit increased vulnerability to numerous viral pathogens such as dengue virus and influenza A virus, notable exceptions exist where females demonstrate higher susceptibility, including infections by herpes simplex virus and measles virus<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup>. These divergent patterns underscore a dual dependency of sex-biased infection outcomes on both host immunological determinants and viral evolutionary strategies<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]</sup>. For instance, the male predominance observed in severe dengue virus cases may be explained by both gender-specific occupational exposure risks and sexual dimorphism in Ab-dependent enhancement mechanisms, potentially linked to androgen-mediated modulation of antiviral immune responses<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</sup>. Whereas female susceptibility to herpes simplex virus could be related to ovarian sex hormones, including estradiol and progesterone<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]</sup>. Critically, sex differences in antiviral immunity are not static but evolve across the lifespan and are tightly linked to age and reproductive status<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]</sup>. For example, sex disparities in hantavirus infection outcomes emerge post-puberty, coinciding with hormonal maturation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup>. Similarly, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Japan, morbidity rates exhibited a triphasic sex bias: males&lt;20 and &gt;80 years old showed higher susceptibility than females, whereas females of reproductive age (20-49 years) faced elevated risks<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]</sup>. This pattern aligns with the hypothesis that estrogen peaks during reproductive years enhance antiviral defenses in females, while age-related declines in gonadal hormones may diminish this protective effect in postmenopausal populations<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]</sup>. Our study extends these principles to teleost species, revealing novel sex-specific resistance patterns in fish-virus interactions. Male zebrafish demonstrated heightened resistance to SVCV, while male crucian carp exhibited reduced susceptibility to CyHV-2<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]</sup>. These findings suggest that male-biased resistance may represent an evolutionarily conserved strategy in certain fish-virus system. However, whether this trend generalizes across all piscine viruses—or whether females conversely dominate resistance in specific viral contexts—remains unresolved.</p>
<p>STING was originally identified as a critical adaptor molecule mediating antiviral signaling cascades<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]</sup>. Subsequential studies have established its indispensable role in orchestrating innate immune responses against both DNA and RNA viral pathogens. Current mechanistic understanding reveals that upon detection of cytoplasmic pathogen-derived DNA, STING operates through two distinct molecular pathways: serving as a downstream effector of essential single-stranded/double-stranded DNA sensors or functioning as a direct receptor for microbial cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). Following activation, this TM protein recruits and activates TBK1, which subsequently phosphorylates IRF3 to facilitate its nuclear translocation and initiate IFN production. Notably, the protein demonstrates functional pleiotropy in RNA viral infections through selective interaction with RIG-I rather than melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), thereby activating parallel IRF3-dependent antiviral signaling pathways. Numerous studies indicate remarkable conservation of STING-mediated IFN induction mechanisms across teleost species<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26a">26a,b,c</xref>]</sup>. Mechanism studies further reveal that fish STING maintains dual antiviral functionality against both nucleic acid virus types, while simultaneously being subjected to targeted manipulation by various viral pathogens as an immune evasion strategy.</p>
<p>The CYP450 enzyme superfamily exhibits multifaceted roles across species, encompassing physiological processes and immune regulation. In human immune cells, pharmacological inhibition of CYP1A has been demonstrated to upregulate the expression of stem cell factor receptor and interleukin 22, directly linking CYP1-dependent metabolism of environmental small molecules to immune modulation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]</sup>. Evolutionary conservation of this regulatory mechanism is evident in teleost, where grass carp (<italic>Ctenopharyngodon idella</italic>) CYP1A demonstrates dynamic expression during grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection, implicating its role in antiviral immunity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup>. Our study further identifies Cyp17a2 as a sexually dimorphic regulator of IFN signaling in fish. This finding expands the recognized roles of the CYP450 superfamily in immune regulation, revealing a novel mechanism underlying sex-specific immunity in lower vertebrates.</p>
<p>In conclusion, zebrafish model with its lack of conserved sex chromosomes and environmental sex determination plasticity, provides unique insights into the evolutionary continuum of sexual dimorphism. Our results suggest that the relationship between sexual differentiation and immune competence may be more fluid in teleost than in mammals, potentially reflecting adaptive responses to aquatic pathogens and variable mating systems. Future investigations should explore whether this autosomal-centered mechanism represents a teleost specific adaptation or an ancestral feature subsequently modified in terrestrial vertebrates, while also examining potential interactions between environmental sex determinants and immune gene regulation.</p>

<p>This manuscript describes a <bold>useful</bold> study describing an interesting infection phenotype that differs between adult male and female zebrafish. The authors argue that male-biased expression of Cyp17a2 is implicated in mediating infection levels through STING and USP8 activity regulation. Thus, this study highlights an unexpected factor involved in antiviral immunity that could open new avenues of investigation for infection, metabolism, and other contexts. Although the manuscript presents some evidence supporting its main claims, the evidence for the main argument made in the study on sex dimorphism remains <bold>incomplete</bold> at this stage.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Lu &amp; Cui et al. observe that adult male zebrafish are more resistant to infection and disease following exposure to Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCV) than female fish. The authors then attempt to identify some of the molecular underpinnings of this apparent sexual dimorphism and focus their investigations on a gene called cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 2 (cyp17a2) because it was among the genes that they found to be more highly expressed in kidney tissue from males than in females. Their investigations lead them to propose a direct connection between cyp17a2 and modulation of interferon signaling as the key underlying driver of the difference between male and female susceptibility to SVCV.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strengths of this study include the interesting observation of a substantial difference between adult male and female zebrafish in their susceptibility to SVCV, and also the breadth of experiments that were performed linking cyp17a2 to infection phenotypes and molecularly to the stability of host and virus proteins in cell lines. The authors place the infection phenotype in an interesting and complex context of many other sexual dimorphisms in infection phenotypes in vertebrates. This study succeeds in highlighting an unexpected factor involved in antiviral immunity that will be an important subject for future investigations of infection, metabolism, and other contexts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Weaknesses of this study include an indirect connection between the majority of experiments and the proposed mechanism underlying the sexual dimorphism phenotype, widespread reliance on over-expression when investigating protein-protein interaction and localization, and an insufficient amount of description of the data presented in the figures. Specific examples of areas for clarification or improvement include:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 10 outlines a mechanistic link between cyp17a2 and the sexual dimorphism the authors report for SVCV infection outcomes. The data presented on increased susceptibility of cyp17a2-/- mutant male zebrafish support this diagram, but this conclusion is fairly weak without additional experimentation in both males and females. The authors justify their decision to focus on males by stating that they wanted to avoid potential androgen-mediated phenotypes in the cpy17a2 mutant background (lines 152-156), but this appears to be speculation. It also doesn't preclude the possibility of testing the effects of increased cyp17a2 expression on viral infection in both males and females. This is of critical importance if the authors intend to focus the study on sexual dimorphism, which is how the introduction and discussion are currently structured.</p>
<p>(2) The authors present data indicating an unexpected link between cyp17a2 and ubiquitination pathways. It is unclear how a CYP450 family member would carry out such activities, and this warrants much more attention. One brief paragraph in the discussion (starting at line 448) mentions previous implications of CYP450 proteins in antiviral immunity, but given that most of the data presented in the paper attempt to characterize cyp17a2 as a direct interactor of ubiquitination factors, more discussion in the text should be devoted to this topic. For example, are there any known domains in this protein that make sense in this context? Discussion of this interface is more relevant to the study than the general overview of sexual dimorphism that is currently highlighted in the discussion and throughout the text.</p>
<p>(3) Figures 2-9 contain information that could be streamlined to highlight the main points the authors hope to make through a combination of editing, removal, and movement to supplemental materials. There is a consistent lack of clarity in these figures that could be improved by supplementing them with more text to accompany the supplemental figures. Using Figure 2 and an example, panel (A) could be removed as unnecessary, panel (B) could be exchanged for a volcano plot with examples highlighting why cyp17a2 was selected for further study and also the full dataset could be shared in a supplemental table, panel (C) could be modified to indicate why that particular subset was chosen for plotting along with an explanation of the scaling, panel (D) could be moved to supplemental because the point is redundant with panels (A) and (C), panel (E) could be presented as a heatmap, in panels (G) and (H) data from EPC cells could be moved to supplemental because it is not central to the phenotype under investigation, panels (J) to (L) and (N) to (P) could be moved to supplemental because they are redundant with the main points made in panels (M) and (Q). Similar considerations could be made with Figures 3-9</p>
<p>(4) The data in Figure 3 (A)-(C) do not seem to match the description in the text. That is, the authors state that cyp17a2 overexpression increases interferon signaling activity in cells, but the figure shows higher increases in vector controls. Additionally, the data in panel (H) are not described. What genes were selected and why, and where are the data on the rest of the genes from this analysis? This should be shared in a supplemental table.</p>
<p>(5) Some of the reagents described in the methods do not have cited support for the applications used in the study. For example, the antibody for TRIM11 (line 624, data in Figures 6 &amp; 7) was generated for targeting the human protein. Validation for use of this reagent in zebrafish should be presented or cited. Furthermore, the accepted zebrafish nomenclature for this gene would be preferred throughout the text, which is bloodthirsty-related gene family, member 32.</p>

<p>The manuscript identified Cyp17a2 as a master regulator of male-biased antiviral immunity in a sex chromosome-free model (zebrafish) challenging established immunological paradigms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The bifunctional role of Cyp17a2 (host-directed STING stabilization and virus-directed P degradation) represents a significant conceptual advance.</p>
<p>(2) First demonstration of K33 chains as a critical regulatory switch for both host defense proteins and viral substrates.</p>
<p>(3) Comprehensive validation across biological scales: organismal (survival, histopathology), cellular (transcriptomics, Co-IPs), and molecular (ubiquitination assays, site-directed mutagenesis).</p>
<p>(4) Functional conservation in cyprinids (zebrafish and gibel carp) strengthens biological significance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Colocalization analyses (Figures 4G, 6I, 9D) require quantitative metrics (e.g., Pearson's coefficients) rather than representative images alone.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 1 survival curves need annotated statistical tests (e.g., &quot;Log-rank test, p=X.XX&quot;)</p>
<p>(3) Figure 2P GSEA should report exact FDR-adjusted *p*-values (not just &quot;*p*&lt;0.05&quot;).</p>
<p>(4) Section 2 overextends on teleost sex-determination diversity, condensing to emphasize relevance to immune dimorphism would strengthen narrative cohesion.</p>
<p>(5) Limited discussion on whether this mechanism extends beyond Cyprinidae and its implications for teleost adaptation.</p>
