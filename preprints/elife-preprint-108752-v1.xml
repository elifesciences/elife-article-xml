<abstract><p><italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play a pivotal role in brain development and synaptic function. Previous studies have focused on GluN1-N2 (2A-2D) and GluN1- N3 (3A and 3B) di-heteromeric (di-) NMDARs, leaving the activation mechanism and stoichiometry of GluN1-N2-N3 tri-heteromeric (tri-) NMDARs largely unexplored.

<title>Main</title>
<p>NMDARs function as coincidence detectors in neural signaling, typically requiring both membrane depolarization (to relieve Mg<sup>2+</sup> block) and the binding of co-agonists glycine and glutamate for the opening of ion channel gate. Upon activation, they permit the influx of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, playing a critical role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. In mammals, NMDARs are encoded by seven genes, comprising glycine- bound GluN1 and GluN3 (3A and 3B) subunits, and glutamate-bound GluN2 (from N2A to N2D) subunits. Synaptic NMDARs typically assemble as di- or tri-heterotetramers, consisting of two obligatory GluN1 subunits and two alternative subunits selectively chosen from GluN2 (2A-2D) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and/or GluN3 (3A-3B) subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Different receptor subtypes exhibit distinct biophysical and pharmacological properties, which are primarily determined by subtle structural variations in their individual domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. For instance, the activation of GluN1-N2 di-NMDARs requires the presence of both glycine and glutamate agonists, while GluN1-N3 di-NMDARs only necessitate glycine. Furthermore, the GluN1-N2 subtypes demonstrate greater Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, and enhanced Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in contrast to GluN1-N3 subtypes. Additionally, classic GluN1-N2 di-NMDARs pore blocker like ketamine, memantine, showed only small effect to GluN1-N3 di-NMDARs.</p>
<p>Differing from the conventional GluN1-N2 receptors, GluN3A-containing NMDARs exhibit unique characteristics in their expression profiles, structural arrangement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> physiological and pathological functions. In mice, the GluN3A subunit displays a distinct temporal and spatial expression pattern, showing widespread brain expression during early development that peaks between postnatal days 7-14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, followed by a decline after adolescence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, it maintain relatively high expression levels in specific adult brain regions, including the neocortex S1 region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, visual cortex layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, basolateral amygdala (BLA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>,and media habenula (MHb)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. During brain development, GluN3A is suggested serve a dominant negative role by suppressing neuronal over- development tendency through decreasing synaptic stability and promoting the pruning of superfluous spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Additionally, it regulates multiple synaptic events including the synaptic trafficking of GluN2A-containing NMDARs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, pre-synaptic release of neurotransmitter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and NMDAR-induced transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Through modulation of astrocyte-neuron crosstalk, neocortical circuits, and synaptic plasticity, GluN3A- containing NMDARs influence visual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and learning processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, as well as emotional and social behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Notably, abnormalities in GluN3A expression and function have been associated with various neurological brain disorders including addiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, ischemia brain stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, Huntington’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, addiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, autoimmune encephalitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Prior studies using recombinant expression systems have demonstrated that GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs exhibit lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, less sensitive to Mg<sup>2+</sup> blockage, and faster desensitization kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, compared to the conventional GluN1-N2 di- NMDARs. Moreover, the activation mechanisms of GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs differ fundamentally from that of GluN1-N2 di-NMDARs. Specifically, glycine binding to high- affinity GluN3A sites activates the ion channel, while binding to low-affinity GluN1 sites results in channel to desensitize or pre-desensitize of the channel. When glycine simultaneously binds to both GluN1 and GluN3A subunits, it triggers a rapid conformational change termed as the “apo-open-desensitization” transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Therefore, blocking glycine binding to GluN1 with competitive antagonists (CGP-78608<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> / L- 689,560<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> / MDL-29951<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>) or introducing mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> enhances current amplitude and slows desensitization in GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs. This approach enables reliable recordings of native GluN1-N3A di-NMDAR currents in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Other studies have also proposed the existence of tri-NMDARs, consisting of two different GluN2 subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> or one copy of GluN2 and one copy of GluN3 subunit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In recombinant system expressing GluN1 and GluN2A subunits, GluN3A overexpression has been shown to reduce single-channel conductance and Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, findings further confirmed in hippocampal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Notably, the presence of GluN1-N2B-N3A tri-NMDARs has been implicated in the expression of cocaine-evoked plasticity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, as well as neocortical synaptic transmission and plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Additionally, GluN3A subunit has been found to co-localized with GluN2A in the postsynaptic regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and to co-immunoprecipitated with GluN2A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, GluN2B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, and GluN2C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> subunits. However, distinguishing GluN1-N2-N3A tri- NMDARs from GluN1-N2A and GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs remains challenging due to the lack of specific pharmacological and definitive biochemical markers. Consequently, direct evidence for native assembly of GluN3A with GluN2 subunits into GluN1-N2-N3A tri-NMDARs complexes remain elusive. Over the past decades, substantial progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of agonist recognition and gating mechanisms of GluN1-N2 di- and tri- NMDARs. These receptors assemble as tetrameric complexes with a bouquet-like architecture, comprising the clamshell-shaped extracellular domains of amino-terminal domain (NTD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD), the hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD), and the flexible intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD). Upon binding glutamate and glycine, the LBD clamshell undergoes closure, extending the LBD-TMD linker, which, in turn, imitate gate opening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.Notably, GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs showed distinct activate cycle. Glycine binds to GluN3A with high-affinity and this binding activates the ion channel, while glycine binds to GluN1 with low-affinity and this binding leads to desensitization of the channel. The NTD of GluN3A subunit showed highly flexible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and the LBD domain of GluN3A adopts a similar yet denser conformation in the presence of agonist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Fundamental questions regarding the subunit stoichiometry, structural arrangement and gating property of GluN1-N2-N3A tri-NMDARs remain unresolved.</p>
<p>In this study, we employed a two-step affinity-tagged chromatography purification strategy to determine the cryo-EM structure of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs, revealing an asymmetric tetrameric assembly with a “N1-N2A-N1-N3A” subunit arrangement. Subsequently, we reconstituted the protein into liposomes and conducted single- channel recordings. Our results demonstrated that GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs can be activated by the co-application of glycine and glutamate, neither glycine nor glutamate alone. Moreover, the incorporation of the GluN2A subunit appears to play a dominant role in gating, as GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs did not exhibit the pronounced glycine- induced desensitization observed in GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs, instead displaying activation properties more akin to GluN1-N2A receptors.</p>
<p>Using genetic code expansion, we introduced a clickable unnatural amino acid AzF (<italic>p</italic>-azido-l-phenylalanine) into the NTD of tri-NMDARs and confirmed GluN2 and GluN3A subunits can be crosslinked in close proximity in the recombinant expression system. Moreover, this click-chemistry strategy enabled us to probe the existence and architecture of these tri-NMDARs in cultured hippocampal neurons and brain tissue. Our findings provide direct evidence that GluN3A can assemble with GluN2 subunits to form functional tri-NMDARs. This work established a framework for structurally and functionally probing multimeric protein complex in native tissues.</p>

<p>We conducted co-expression probability analysis, revealing distinct yet overlapping expression patterns among subunits in GluN3A-highly expressing cell types from cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). GluN3A exhibited a tendency to co-express with GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B subunits instead of co-expressed only with GluN1 subunit. The co-expression probabilities of the GluN3A with GluN2A or GluN2B were more than 24% in two types of inhibitory neurons (24% and 26% in SST neurons of cortex and 27% and 62% in PLI of cerebellum). While in the excitatory hippocampus CA1 neurons, the co-expression probabilities were more than 21% (21% and 23% for GluN2A and GluN2B, respectively). Notably, these co- expression probabilities reached 71% and 85% in excitatory Ex1 neuron of BLA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b-c</xref>), where the GluN3A containing NMDARs have been reported to participate in the fear memory.</p>
<p>To determine if GluN3A can associate with GluN2 subunits at the protein level, we conducted a co-immunoprecipitation experiment with native brain tissue. A laboratory- generated monoclonal antibody (clone no. 1G4) specifically recognizing the GluN3A subunit (Extended Data Fig. 3) was used to enrich GluN3A-containing NMDARs from the cortex and hippocampus of mouse brains. Our results showed that GluN3A could be precipitated with GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), confirming that potential existence of native GluN1-N2A-N3A and GluN1-N2B-N3A tri-NMDARs, consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. However, under our experimental conditions, we were unable to immunoprecipitated GluN2C and GluN2D with GluN3A subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) likely due to the low abundance of these assemblies.</p>

<title>Isolation strategy and architecture of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs</title>
<p>Given the above results indicate the presence of GluN1-N2-N3A tri-NMDARs in the brain, we next sought to determine the structure of the GluN1-N2A-N3A receptors. We added a 6 x His tag and a Strep tag to the C-terminal domain (CTD) truncated GluN2A and GluN3A subunits, respectively, and co-expressed them with CTD-truncated GluN1 subunit. Then, we employed a two-step affinity-tagged chromatograph to isolate the GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-b</xref>) as we previously reported for purification of GluN1-N2A-N2C receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.

<p>To label the different subunits for cryo-EM classification and reconstruction, we developed two monoclonal antibodies: one bound to the N-terminal domain of GluN1 subunit (clone no. 4F11, referred to as N1-Fab<sub>4F11</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and another bound to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of GluN2A subunit (clone no. 2-8c, referred to as N2A-Fab<sub>28C</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig.3). We further employed fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) to verify the presence of specific subunits in the assembled NMDAR complexes. GluN1-N2A and GluN1-N2A-N3A receptors were preincubated with N1-Fab<sub>4F11</sub>, N2A-Fab<sub>28C</sub>, or both, while GluN1-N3A receptors were preincubated with N1-Fab<sub>4F11</sub> alone. Upon Fab binding, the molecular weight of the receptor complex increases, resulting in an earlier elution during size-exclusion chromatography- manifested as a rightward shift in the FSEC profile. For GluN1-N2A-N3A, distinct right shifts were observed upon incubation with both N1-Fab<sub>4F11</sub> and N2A-Fab<sub>28C</sub>, confirming the incorporation of both GluN1 and GluN2A subunits into the receptor complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequently, we elucidated the structure of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs with N1- Fab<sub>4F11</sub> and N2A-Fab<sub>28C</sub> in the presence of agonists glycine and glutamate (Extended Data Fig. 4). In the 2D class averages, we observed the density of N2A-Fab<sub>28C</sub> protruding from the GluN2A-LBD, along with two N1-Fab<sub>4F11</sub> densities protruding from the two diagonally opposedGluN1-NTDs (Extended Data Fig. 4b). During 3D classification, we found all four structures contained densities for N2A-Fab<sub>28C</sub>. Two of these structures (accounting for 30.7% of all particles) were better defined and contained two N1-Fab<sub>4F11</sub> densities. The remaining two less well-defined 3D structures also included a N2A-Fab<sub>28C</sub> and two N1-Fab<sub>4F11</sub> at high contour levels. In all structures, only one subunit, the GluN3A subunit, remained Fab free state, with its NTD and LBD domains being less well-defined. Combining the well-defined subclasses, we finally reconstructed the glycine and glutamate-bound form of the GluN1-N2A-N3A tri- NMDARs at an overall resolution of 7.7 Å (Extended Data Fig. 4).</p>

<title>Subunit arrangement of asymmetric GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs</title>
<p>Overall, GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs adopt a bouquet-like architecture, similar to conventional GluN1-N2 di-NMDARs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The structure resembles an asymmetric dimer- of-dimer organization, where GluN1-N2A and GluN1-N3A heterodimers combine to form a tetrameric assembly. GluN1 subunits occupy positions A and C, while GluN2A and GluN3A subunits occupy positions B and D, respectively. The receptors are organized into three layers: NTD, LBD, and TMD. In the presence of Fabs and agonists, the secondary structural densities for the NTD and LBD remain continuous and defined, enabling rigid-body fitting of R1 and R2 lobes of the NTDs and D1 and D2 lobes of the LBDs into these density features (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, 2f).</p>
<p>In the top-down view, extensive subunit-subunit interactions occur within the NTD, primarily between GluN1-N2A and GluN1-N3A heterodimers, with two GluN1 NTDs positioned at the periphery of the tetrameric assembly. The NTDs of the GluN1 subunit contract with their adjacent GluN2A and GluN3A subunits at the R1 lobes, forming a compressed GluN1-N2A interface and a loose GluN1-N3A interface. The NTD center of mass (COM) distance between GluN1 (protomer A) and the GluN2A subunit is 4.0 Å shorter than that between the GluN1 (protomer C) and the GluN3A subunit, resulting in a COM angle of the GluN1-N2A dimer that is 8.3° smaller than that of the GluN1-N3A dimer. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain further insight into the structural asymmetry and subunit-specific interactions within GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs, we conduct measurements of the COM distance and vector angle at the NTD and LBD interfaces. At the NTD R1-R1 interface, we observed that the COM distance between α2 of GluN1(A) and α1 of GluN2A is 1.1 Å shorter than that between α2 of GluN1(C) and α1 of GluN3A. Additionally, the vector angle shows 6.3° larger twisting of GluN1 (A) relative to GluN2A compared to GluN1 (C) relative to GluN3A. Notably, this vector angle in the GluN1-N2A -di NMDARs (PDB 6MMP) is 6.8° larger than that in GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs.</p>
<p>Importantly, the LBD COM distance between GluN1(C) and GluN2A is 10.2 Å shorter than that between GluN1(A) and GluN3A, with the vector angle exhibiting 14.1° more twisting between GluN1(C)- GluN2A and GluN1(A)-GluN3A.Specifically, the tri-receptor domain shows a 121° anti-clockwise twisting of the whole domain around the pseudo- symmetric axis of the receptor center, which contrasts with the structure of 2RC7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>, 2h).</p>
<p>We compared two GluN1 subunits in the GluN1-N2A heterodimer and GluN1-N3A heterodimer of the GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs by measuring the COM distances of NTD-LBD, R1-R2, R2-D1, and D1-D2. Except for the D1-D2 distance, which was significantly longer in GluN1(C) compared to GluN1(A), the remaining length measurements and the vector angles between NTD and LBD were consistent between the two GluN1 subunits. We then extended the comparison to the GluN2A and GluN3A subunit in GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-receptors. The lengths of R1-R2 and R2-D1 in GluN3A were greater than those in GluN2A. We speculate that this loose domain arrangement contributes to the high instability of the GluN3A LBD. Additionally, the D1-D2 distance in the LBD of GluN3A was much shorter than that in GluN2A. These factors collectively result in a significantly larger vector angle between the NTD and LBD in the GluN3A subunit compared to GluN2A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>).</p>

<title>Activation mechanism of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs</title>
<p>Previous electrophysiological studies of GluN1-N2-N3A tri-NMDARs have relied on either co-expressing GluN1, GluN2, and GluN3A subunits in recombinant systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> or recordings from native brain tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. However, in these experiments, GluN1-N2A- N3A tri-NMDARs may coexist with various other types of NMDARs, and the absence of selective pharmacological tools has hindered the biophysical characteristics of pure GluN1-N2-N3A tri-NMDARs. To address this limitation, we reconstituted purified GluN1- N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs into liposomes and performed single-channel recordings on these proteoliposomes.</p>
<p>To confirm that NMDARs form functional ion channels in liposomes, we initially reconstituted and recorded GluN1-N2A di-NMDARs with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. These GluN1-N2A di-NMDARs exhibited a super-cluster model of opening pattern, with an open probability of 0.46 ± 0.02, a mean dwell time of 17.07 ± 1.6 ms, and a unitary amplitude of 6.16 ± 0.12 pA (table 1). These parameters closely matched those biophysical properties recorded from HEK293 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>We next recorded GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs with the glycine concentrations ranged from 0.1 μM to 100 μM (Extended Fig. 6, Extended table.1). Consistent with prior two-electrode voltage clamp recording<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, we found that the open probability (0.052 ± 0.007) and dwell time (6.60 ± 1.54 ms) of GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs increased with glycine concentration, peaking at 3 μM. Beyond 10 μM glycine, the open probability declined, indicating that the reconstituted receptors retained the rapid desensitization characteristic of GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs.</p>
<p>To gain insight into the single-channel properties of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs and make comparisons with these of GluN1-N2A and GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs, we conducted recordings on reconstituted tri-NMDARs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We first examined whether the application of either glycine or glutamate alone could activate GluN1-N2A- N3A tri-NMDARs. No detectable currents were observed when either glycine or glutamate was applied individually (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting that the activation of GluN1- N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs requires the binding of both glycine and glutamate.</p>

<p>Subsequently, we recorded the receptors under two glycine conditions 3 μM and 100 μM, in the present with fixed glutamate (100 μM). Unlike GluN1-N3A di- NMDARs, which desensitize at glycine concentration above 10 μM, GluN1-N2-N3A exhibited a higher open probability at high glycine (0.17 ± 0.01) compared to low glycine (0.05 ± 0.01), suggesting reduced glycine-induced desensitization. Also, unlike GluN1- N2A and GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs, which displayed only a simple unitary amplitude, the GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs exhibited two distinct subconductance states in both glycine conditions. Specifically, under saturating co-agonist concentrations (100 μM glutamate and 100 μM glycine),, the GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs showed two sublevels for the unitary currents (5.93 ± 0.04 pA and 3.54 ± 0.11 pA) with corresponding dwell times (10.52 ± 3.56 ms and 1.45 ± 0.79 ms). The open probability of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs (0.17 ± 0.01) was over 3-fold higher than that of GluN1- N3A activated by low glycine (0.05 ± 0.01), but significantly lower than that of GluN1- N2A (0.46 ± 0.02) receptors under the same saturating conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>, Table 1).</p>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that the gate activation in GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs requires the binding of both glycine and glutamate. However, the lack of rapid desensitization under high glycine concentrations suggests that the GluN3A’s role in GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDAR gating differs from its role in GluN1-N3A di-NMDAR gating. In summary, these results reveal that the tri-NMDARs exhibit unique biophysical properties distinct from GluN1-N2A and GluN1-N3A di-NMDAR subtypes, highlighting their specialized functional characteristics.</p>

<title>Mapping the subunit arrangement of GluN1-N2-N3A using click chemistry</title>
<p>To further validate the subunit arrangement of GluN1-N2-N3A tri-NMDARs and explore their presence in the brain, we employed click chemistry to site-specifically incorporate the photo-cross linker <italic>p</italic>-azido phenylalanine (AzF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> into NMDARs subunits via genetic code expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. The azido group of AzF serves as the chemical handle for engineering photo-cross linking between proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, This approach offers several advantages for exploring protein-protein interactions. First, it requires only a single mutation for crosslinking, as AzF can form a convent band with any other nature amino acid. Second, UV-mediated crosslinking via the azido group occurs within a few angstroms. Last, the incorporation is biorthogonal with single-residue precision.</p>
<p>To implement the AzF system in our study, we first introduced AzF to the NTD of GluN2A subunit in the GluN1-N2A di-NMDAR, whose high-resolution structures have already been elucidated (PDB code: 7EOS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. We selected K220, located in the α6 helix of the GluN2A NTD R1 lobe, as the site for AzF incorporation. Utilizing an established genetic code expansion system in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> and HEK 293T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, we co-transfected plasmids encoding GluN1, GluN2A<sup>K220AzF</sup>, orthogonal suppressor tRNA (Yam), and AzF-tRNA synthetase (AzFRs+Yam), we confirmed the expression of GluN2A<sup>K220AzF</sup> via fluorescence and western blot (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b</xref>, Extended Data. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>, 7b). Notably, mRuby fused with GluN2A exhibited a typical membranal protein-like distribution, suggesting that AzF incorporation did not disrupt the trafficking and membrane insertion of GluN1-N2A receptors.</p>

</fig>
<p>Subsequently, we aimed to investigate whether the AzF-incorporated NMDARs could conduct current. In the presence of AzF, currents were recorded in nearly half of the injected oocytes (38 out of 78) after a 72-hour incubation with AzF. In contrast, no response was recorded in oocytes incubated without AzF, except in one oocyte with current over 100 nA (Extended Data. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). Additionally, we examined whether UV illumination influenced NMDAR function. UV stimulation during agonist application increased the receptor current, indicating that a photo-switching effect mediated by AzF. To investigate whether this effect depended on photo-crosslinking, we conducted western blot analysis. After UV irradiation, a distinct band with a molecular weight exceeding 300 kDa, presumably corresponding to the crossed GluN2A-N2A dimer was resolved, confirming the UV-dependent GluN2A-N2A dimer formation (Extended Data. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b-e</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we co-expressed GluN2A<sup>K220AzF</sup> with GluN1 and GluN2B to test whether AzF- incorporated GluN2A crosslink with another subunit. Western blot results showed a dimer with a molecular weight (over 300 kDa) detectable by both GluN2A and GluN2B specific antibodies, suggesting the formation of a UV-dependent GluN2A-N2B dimer. In summary, these results demonstrate that the incorporation of AzF into NMDARs and UV-induced capture of covalently crosslinked hetero-dimers (Extended Data. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on our cryo-EM structure of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs, we selected four sites (A213, V217, K220, K221) on GluN2A for AzF incorporation. These resides are located on the α5 helix of GluN2A-NTD, and their side chains likely face GluN3A-NTD . As a negative control, we chose L260, a buried residue within GluN2A-NTD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p>
<p>When cells were irradiated with UV light, high-molecular-weight crosslinked bands were detected using antibodies against GluN2A and GluN3A, at these four α5 mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, 4c).For the GluN1 subunit, only single monomer bands were shown up. This result suggests that GluN2A directly crosslinks with GluN3A at these sites. It is noteworthy that the anti-GluN2A antibody detected more than two high-molecular-weight bands, which may indicate the formation of crosslinked GluN2A homo-dimers. In contrast, cells expressing the negative L260 mutant and wildtype showed no detectable crosslinking bands.</p>
<p>Additionally, based on our GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs structure, we constructed a homologous model of the GluN1-N2B-N3A tri-NMDARs. Using this model, we incorporated the AzF to five individual residue sites (S214, Q217, N218, K221, K222) located on the α5-helix of GluN2B-NTD, as well as a negative control site (L261) buried inside GluN2B-NTD. Consistent with the GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs, crosslinking bands were detected by antibodies against GluN2B and GluN3A, but not GluN1 subunit (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), indicating that GluN2B and GluN3A are in a proximal position in the tetrameric NTD formation of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs. These results collectively validate our structural discovery that the NTD layer of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs adopt a GluN1- N2A-N1-N3A arrangement, with opposing GluN1 subunits and diagonally positioned GluN2A and GluN3A. To note, UV irradiation induced crosslinking in a small fraction of the dimers, demonstrating that only a subset of GluN1-N2-N3A tri-NMDARs meet the short spatial requirements for AzF crosslinking. This observation likely reflects the structural heterogeneity of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs observed in our structural analysis.</p>

<title>Photo-crosslinking endogenous GluN3A subunit in cultured cortical neuron</title>
<p>To validate the presence of endogenous GluN3A and lay the foundation for subsequent biochemical experiments, we first performed immunofluorescence staining.

Building upon this encouraging validation of endogenous GluN3A expression, we proceeded to exploit the potential for crosslinking between GluN3A and AzF-incorporated GluN2 subunits.

One encoded AzFRs/Yam, with AzFRs being accompanied by a red fluorescence protein and a flag tag, connected via a 2A oligopeptide sequence (AzFRs+Yam). The other cistron encoded GluN2A<sup>K220AzF</sup>, fused with green fluorescence protein and a strep tag.

<p>Verification of AzF incorporation included the detection of AzF-incorporated GluN2 by antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain (NTD) of GluN2, along with the associated strep tags, resulting in a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa. Notably, anti-GluN2A (NTD) antibodies exhibited reactivity toward both endogenous GluN2A (above 180 kDa) and exogenous AzF-incorporated GluN2A. The anti-Flag antibody effectively detected the Flag-fused AzFRs in all transfected groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
<p>After UV stimulation, AzF-incorporated GluN2A was isolated through strep-tag purification and subjected to western blot analysis. Antibodies directed against both GluN2A and GluN3A detected crosslinked bands exceeding 300 kDa following UV irradiation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). These results affirm that AzF-incorporated GluN2A was instrumental in crosslinking with the endogenous GluN3A subunit. Using a comparable approach with K221AzF incorporated into GluN2B, we detected crosslinked GluN2B- N3A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, 5g).</p>
<p>Taken together, the AzF incorporated GluN2A or GluN2B can covalently crosslinked with native GluN3A in cultured neuron, suggested that GluN1-N2-N3A tri- NMDARs assembled and may share a similar subunit establishment as the recombinant expressed receptors.</p>

<p>The red fluorescence signal identified the location of electroporated neurons within the cortex region, where the GluN3A subunit has been reported highly expressed. In the with AzF groups, green fluorescence was observed within the red fluorescence-positive cells, confirming the incorporation of AzF into GluN2A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). To further validate AzF incorporation, cortices from AzF animals were isolated, solubilized, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody targeting GluN2A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6c</xref>). Western blot results revealed that, in addition to the endogenous GluN2A (&gt;180 kDa), a band with a molecular weight approximately 150 kDa was detected in the with AzF groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>), confirming that the expression of AzF incorporated GluN2A.</p>
<p>To assess whether incorporated GluN2A could crosslink with other NMDAR subunits, brains from electroporated animals were homogenized and subjected to UV irradiation.

<p>Under UV stimulation, bands with high molecular weight were detected in the AzF-treated group, suggesting the formation of GluN2A<sup>K220AzF</sup> complexes with other proteins. These bands were also detected by anti-GluN3A antibodies, providing evidence for the presence of GluN1-N2A-N3A complexes in the brain. Consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, the existence of GluN1-N2A-N2B complexes was inferred, as high molecular weight bands were detectable with anti-GluN2B antibodies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).

<title>Integrative summary of structural, electrophysiological, and in vivo findings on GluN1-N2A-N3A NMDARs</title>
<p>Together, our structural, electrophysiological, and in vivo experiments collectively establish GluN1-N2A-N3A as a distinct tri-NMDAR with unique subunit composition and functional properties. Structurally, the receptor adopts an asymmetric configuration at both the NTD and LBD layers, characterized by the presence of two GluN1 subunits, one GluN2A, and one GluN3A. Notably, the GluN3A subunit exhibits a highly flexible and loosely organized domain arrangement. This specific configuration at the NTD layer underlies its functional requirement for co-agonists glycine and glutamate, distinguishing it from the glycine-only activated GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs, and imparting unique single-channel characteristics that are not observed in GluN1-N2A or GluN1- N3A di-NMDARs.</p>
<p>Given the recent structural resolutions of multiple NMDARs, especially the native GluN1-N2A-N2B tri-NMDARs, we performed a comparative structural analysis focused on the alternative subunits. We examined conformational parameters such as domain clamshell angles and NTD-LBD bending. The GluN2A NTD of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs adopt a more closed conformation (R1-R2 clamshell angle: 44.3°) compared to its counterparts in GluN1-N2A-N2B (64.2°) and GluN1-N2A-N2C (58.7°), potentially due to steric effects from N2A-Fab<sub>28C</sub> binding. The GluN3A displays a significantly more open and flexible conformation, with a larger R1-R2 angle (77.9°) and an exceptionally expanded NTD-LBD bending angle (159.7°), greater than that observed in di-NMDAR assemblies (115.9°, 125.3°)(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>).</p>
<p>We then compared GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs LBD layer with other NMDA receptors. Unlike other NMDARs, where domain-swapping in the NTD-LBD transduction results in the formation of two compact LBD heterodimers (A-D and B-C dimers), in GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs, this transduction leads to only one compact heterodimer GluN1-N2A (A-D dimer) and one loose heterodimer GluN1-N3A (B-C dimer). The COM angle of the LBD between the A-D dimer is 17.5° larger than that between the B-C dimer, resulting in 10.2 Å shorter COM distance in the former compared to the latter (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). Notably, this asymmetry dimer-of-dimer LBD arrangement is not prominent in either endogenous GluN1-N2A-N2B tri-NMDARs (PDB 8XLK) or recombinant GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs (PDB 8USW, 8USX), as their COM length differences are less than 0.2 Å. Consequently, the LBD of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri- NMDARs is the most loosely organized, evidenced by the significantly larger total COM distances between the four subunits (&gt; 13.8 Å), compared to the conventional GluN1-N2 di-NMDARs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we provide direct evidence on the existence of GluN1-N2-N3A tri- NMDARs in the brain and reveal structural and biophysical properties of these receptors. By using scRNA-seq and immunoprecipitation, we found GluN3A subunits co-expressed and assembled with GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in various brain regions. By applying cryo-EM, we elucidated that GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs possess an “GluN1-N2-N1-N3A” geometry and further validated the stoichiometry and <italic>in vivo</italic> existence of GluN1-N2A-N3A and GluN1-N2B-N3A tri-NMDARs by using click chemistry. Furthermore, we revealed biophysical properties of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri- NMDARs via proteoliposomes single channel recording. Our study enriched the understanding of sophisticated NMDAR subunits assembly and channel properties.</p>
<p>NMDA receptor family is composed of di-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> and tri<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>-subunit tetramers and with the tri-subunit tetramers are the dominant in the native brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Several GluN1-N2A di- NMDARs as well as tri-NMDARs, including GluN1-N2A-N2B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, GluN1-N2A- N2C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>, and GluN1-N2B-N2D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>, have been previously reported in the brain. These tri-NMDARs respond to a range of agonists, antagonists, and modulators specific to both their di-NMDARs counterparts. For example, GluN1-N2A-N2B tri-NMDARs can be modulated by the GluN1-N2A-specific positive allosteric modulator Zn<sup>2+</sup>[Ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>], as well as the GluN1-N2B-specific negative allosteric modulator ifenprodil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> and Ro 25-6981<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, these tri-NMDARs exhibit distinct structural, pharmacological, and functional characteristics when compared to their di-NMDRs counterparts. Typically, tri-NMDARs display intermediate open probabilities and amplitude. The EC<sub>50</sub> values for glutamate in GluN1-N2B-N2D, GluN1-N2B, and GluN1-N2D receptors are approximately 0.5 μM, 0.27 μM, and 1.1 μM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, respectively. The main single-channel open amplitude for GluN1-N2A-N2C, GluN1-N2A, and GluN1-N2C are approximately 4.5 pA, 6.5 pA, and 3.5 pA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. In this study, we discovered that the gating of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs necessitates the presence of both glycine and glutamate, suggesting the independent role of GluN2A subunit and GluN1/GluN3A subunits in gating. Additionally, the incorporation of GluN2A renders GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs less sensitivity to glycine compared to the GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b-g</xref>, Table 1, Extended Data Fig. 6, Extended Data Table 1).</p>
<p>GluN3A subunit, although discovered later<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>, have garnered increasing attention in recent years. Functional studies have demonstrated enhanced currents in GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs following preincubation with CGP-78608<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> or L-689,560<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, and further behavior evidence suggesting their significance in emotional control and locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. However, the potential association of GluN3A subunits with GluN2 subunits to form functional GluN1-N2-N3A tri-NMDARs in the brain has remained elusive. A recent study showed no significant differences between wild-type and GluN2A knock-out animal when application of glycine followed CGP-78608. Based on these findings, the authors suggested a limited presence of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri- NMDARs in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, it’s essential to emphasize that the impact of the GluN2A subunit on the activation of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs remains unexplored. Consequently, excluding the existence of GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs without glutamate application may be premature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In this study, we establish that GluN3A tends to co-express with GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, forming functional GluN1-N2A-N3A and GluN1-N2B-N3A tri-NMDARs within the brain.</p>
<p>Moreover, our structural data unveiled that GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs adopt a layered dimer-of-dimers arrangement, with GluN1 in A and C positions and GluN2A and GluN3A in B and D positions. This asymmetric NTD layer adopting a “super splayed open” conformation, with GluN3A’s NTD protrudes the furthest from the hypothetical center axis than the other subunits (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>), which in consistence with the found that GluN3A is in a high flexibility in GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> .The most different of GluN1- N2-N3A tri-NMDARs to the conventional GluN1-N2A di-NMDARs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, GluN1-N2A-N2B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, or GluN1-N2A-N2C tri-NMDARs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> is the asymmetry conformation that characterized by the top-down view of NTD and LBD. Because the GluN1-N2A in GluN1-N2A-N3A remains relatively identical to GluN1-N2A NMDARs, we attribute this asymmetrical conformation from the incorporation of the GluN3A subunit. Unfortunately, our structure lacks sufficient TMD density and includes only glycine and glutamate-bound stage structures, precluding conclusions regarding LBD-TMD transitions and gating mechanisms.</p>
<p>To isolate GluN1-N2-N3A tri-NMDARs currents in a recombinant system is inherently challenging, given the co-expression of three subunits, resulting in a mixture of different receptor types. Furthermore, pharmacological tools to distinguish GluN1-N2- N3A tri-NMDARs from GluN1-N2 and GluN1-N3A di-NMDARs remain lacking. While the use of ectopic retention signals offers a delicate method for controlling subunit composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, it may necessitate a systematic sequence for signal insertion, with improper insertion potentially yielding false results. To circumvent these challenges, we employed proteoliposomes-based single-channel recordings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> and detected GluN1- N2A-N3A currents in the presence of both glycine and glutamate. These results may service as an explanation for why GluN1-N2-N3A current is undetectable by preincubation of CGP-78608 following glycine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our study also introduced click chemistry as a powerful tool to validate the geometry and <italic>in vivo</italic> existence of GluN1-N2A-N3A and GluN1-N2B-N3A tri-NMDARs. This was achieved by employing genetic code expansion to introduce the photo- crosslinker AzF (<italic>p</italic>-azido phenylalanine). The incorporation of AzF offers several advantages, including high consistency and specificity, as only a single mutation is required for comparison, and the crosslinking mediated by the azido group occurs within a few Å during UV stimulation. While prior studies have utilized photo-clickable unnatural amino acids (UAAs) for super-resolution imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> and ion channel manipulation in neurobiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, our work represents the first application of photo- clickable UAAs to investigate direct hetero protein-protein interactions within the brain and underscores the potential of photo-clickable UAAs in neurobiology research.</p>
<p>In summary, our study provides compelling evidence for the existence of GluN1- N2A-N3A and GluN1-N2B-N3A tri-NMDARs through a combination of scRNA-seq, cryo- EM, single-channel recording, and photo-click chemistry. By addressing the long- standing controversy surrounding the existence of GluN1-N2-N3 tri-NMDARs in native systems, our research opens exciting avenues for further investigations into the structure and function of these receptors.</p>

In brief, we used CTD-truncated human GluN1- N2A receptors (GluN1 residues 1-847, GenBank: NP_015566; GluN2A residues 1-841, GenBank: NP_000824) to raise N1<sub>4F11</sub> and N2A<sub>28C</sub> monoclonal antibodies and employed rat GluN1-N3A receptors (GluN1 residues 1–847, GenBank: NP_058706.1; GluN3A residues 1–965, GenBank: NP_612555.1) to raise the N3A<sub>1G4</sub> antibody. These receptors were expressed in HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells (ATCC CRL-3022) through baculovirus transduction and purified using affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in TBS buffer (containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0), supplemented with 1% L-MNG, 2 mM Cholesteryl Hemisuccinate (CHS), 1 mM glutamate, and 1 mM glycine. Subsequently, these receptors were reconstituted into lipid-A-containing liposomes for immunization. The candidate antibodies were screened using immunocytochemistry and FSEC with GluN1-N2A, GluN1-N2B, GluN1-N2C, GluN1- N2D, GluN1-N3A, and GluN1-N3B receptors. The N1<sub>4F11</sub>, N2A<sub>28C</sub>, and N3A<sub>1G4</sub> hybridoma cell lines produced antibodies that bound to GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN3A, respectively. To isolate the fabs, purified antibodies were cleaved by papain (Merck, 1495005) at a 1:30 w/w ratio in the presence of 5 mM cysteine and 1 mM EDTA for 2.5 hours at 37°C, followed by the addition of 30 mM iodoacetamide and incubation on ice for another 20 minutes in the dark. After removing the Fc fragment using protein-A agarose (Smart-life science), the free Fabs were further purified and concentrated by SEC in TBS buffer.</p>

<p>For cryo-EM studies, we used wild-type (WT) rat GluN1-1a (residues 1–847, GenBank: NP_058706.1), rat GluN2A (residues 1–847, GenBank: NP_036705.3), and rat GluN3A (residues 1–965, GenBank: NP_612555.1) constructs. To express and purify GluN1-N2A-N3A, the sequences encoding GluN1 and GluN2A were cloned into the pEG-BacMam Vector with a T2A ribosome skip sequence. The sequence encoding GluN3A was cloned into the pEG-BacMam vector. Both sequences contained an HRV 3C protease cut site, a four-alanine flexible linker, and an EGFP tag on the C-terminus, with a 6 X His-tag on GluN2A and a Strep-tag II on GluN3A, following EGFP. To improve expression levels and thermostability, a peptide fragment of the GluA2(Y837- K847) AMPA receptor was inserted after the M4 helix in GluN2A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>.

The AzFRs sequence and Yam were promoted by CMV and U6, respectively. To improve AzF incorporation efficiency, we cloned AzFRs and four copies of Yam into the pEG-BacMam vectors with a poly(A) signal (AzFRs+Yam). For AzF crosslinking experiments in cultured neurons, we used the human GluN2A with the K220AzF mutation or GluN2B with K221AzF and AzFRs+Yam cloned into the bicistronic pEG-BacMam vector.

We cloned the AzFRs+Yam sequence fused with the T2A ribosome skip sequence, followed by an mRuby tag into the CAGGS vector. For TEVC recording, full-length human GluN1-1a, human GluN2A, and AzFRs+Yam were cloned into pcDNA3-based vectors.

Suspended HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells at ∼3.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml were infected with P2 or P3 virus at a 1:1 molar ratio. Twelve hours after infection, 10 μM MK801 was added to prevent NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity, and 10 mM sodium butyrate was added to boost expression. Cells were then incubated in a 30°C incubator for an additional 48-60 hours before harvesting. The following steps were performed at 4°C or on ice. Cells were resuspended in TBS with a protease inhibitor cocktail (1 mM PMSF, 0.8 mM aprotinin, 2 mM pepstatin, and 2 mg/mL leupeptin) and homogenized in a blender, followed by mild sonication for further disruption. An equal volume of lysis buffer (TBS with 2% L-MNG, 2 mM CHS) was added to the homogenate, and the samples were solubilized for 1.5 hours at 4°C. After ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1.5 hours, the supernatant was collected and incubated with Strep-tactin beads for 1.5 hours.

<title>Image processing and model building</title>
<p>The movie alignment and particle picking were done using the program Relion 3.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. Beam-induced motion and drift correction were performed using MotionCor2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>.Defocus values were estimated using Gctf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. A total of ∼2000 particles were manually picked and subjected to an initial reference-free 2D classification. The 2D classifications with clear NMDAR features were used as templates for auto picking as implemented in the Relion. The auto-picked particles were subjected to rounds of 2D classification to clean up. The remaining were subjected to <italic>ab-initio</italic> 3D map generation, following rounds of 3D classification without imposing symmetry. After excluding the classes with incomplete density, the remaining classes were subjected to round 3D refinement and polishing.</p>

<title>Reconstitution of target proteins in Liposome</title>
<p>Reconstitution of the purified proteins into liposomes was conducted as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Briefly, the Asolectin (Sigma-Aldrich, 11145-50G) was dissolved in chloroform and dried under a stream of N<sub>2</sub> in a glass test tube while the tube was rotated to make a homogeneous lipid film. After drying, a 5 μl of pure water was added to the bottom (pre-hydration) followed by 1 ml of 0.4 M sucrose. The solution was incubated for 3 hours at 50°C until the lipid was resuspended. After the solution cooled to room temperature, the purified proteins were shaken gently for an additional 3 hours at 4°C, then the samples were used for the patch-clamp experiments and observation under the confocal microscope.</p>

<title>Patch-clamp and TEVC recording</title>
<p>The liposome patch-clamp recording was performed as previously reported protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. The pipette buffer was as follows (in mM, pH 7.2): 140 CsCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and the bath buffer contained as follows (in mM, pH 7.3) 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES and 0.01 BAPTA. The glass pipettes (BF150-86-10, Sutter Instrument) used for recording were pulled using P-97 puller (Sutter Instrument) with resistance in the range of 3-6 MΩ.</p>
<p>The pipette formed a tight seal with the liposome membrane with a resistance over a Gigaohm seal (&gt;1GΩ). The membrane was then pathed at -60 mV, the agonists were added to the pipette solution to a certain concentration and the channel opening was recorded. For the GluN1-N2A, we used 100 μM Glu and 100 μM Gly, for the GluN1-N3A, we used 3 μM Gly, and for the GluN1-N2A-N3A, we used 100μM Glu and 100μM Gly. All experiments were performed at room temperature, and all the recording data were collected with EPC-10 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA Electronic, Lambrecht, Germany) with a 0.5-kHz low-pass filter and 50-Hz notch filter. Independent recordings of 10 s duration were used for data analysis.</p>
<p><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes were prepared and injected as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. The constructs in pcDNA3-based vectors were nuclear injected into <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes with 36 nl of a mixture of cDNAs as follows, GluN1 (50 ng/μl), GluN2A<sup>k220AzF</sup>(50 ng/μl), AzFRs+Yam (10 ng/μl) and after about 12 hr of incubation at 18°C in the Barth solution supplemented with gentamicin sulfate (50 ng/ml) and D-APV (50 μM). AzF was dissolved with sonication in Barth solution (stock solution at 10 mM) and diluted (2 mM) for oocyte incubation. Currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage clamp at a holding voltage of -60 mV. The stand external solution was (in mM pH 7.3): 100 NaCl, 5 HEPES, 2.5 KOH. NMDAR-mediated currents were induced by the simultaneous application of Glu and Gly at the concentration of 100 μM each. The heavy-metal chelator diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA, 10 µM) was supplemented to all bath solutions.</p>
<p>The single-channel conductance was obtained through the linear fitting of the current-voltage plots. For quantitative analysis, the Pulse files were converted into PCLAMP format using the ABF file Utility. Current trace analyses and fits were done with Clampfit software. The oocyte data was collected and analyzed using pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices). The Statistical Program for Social Science (SPSS) and Graph Pad Prism 7 was used for statistical analysis and graph generation. The <italic>t</italic>-test and one-way ANOVA were used to assess statistical significance. The data are shown as the mean value ± s.e.m.</p>

<title>Hippocampal neuron culture and electroporation</title>
<p>The hippocampal neurons were cultured as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup> with a small adjustment. In brief, the hippocampus was obtained from the 16-18-day-old Sprague- Dawley rat embryos. After removal of blood vessels, pia mater, and cortex, the freshly dissected hippocampus was sectioned into small fragments and digested with 0.25% trypsin for 15-30 min at 37 °C, and then terminated by the addition of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Then the treated tissue was dispersed mechanically. Dissociated neurons were transfected by electroporation using the Amaxa Necleofector device. Then and cells were plated at a density of 5 x 10<sup>5</sup>cells/ml on poly-L-lysine-coated dishes in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed to neurobasal containing 2% B27 supplement the next day supplied with or without AzF. Then culture medium was changed twice a week. The 14–21-day-old neurons were used.

Briefly, the pregnant mouse was anesthesia in the induction chamber with air flow at 1 l/min and isoflurane at 5% until the animal is sedated and continue treated with air flow at 1 l/min and isoflurane at 2%. Then the uterine horn was exposed, and the plasmids were injected into the lateral ventricle. The electroporation was performed by ECM830 Electroporator with 45V voltage, 2 pulses, 50 ms pulse duration, and 500 ms interval. After electroporated, the uterine horn was put back in the abdomen. For the AzF group, the AzF-containing drink was provided. The newborn mice were used on 14- day post birth. The brain section for the imaging was prepared as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>. Mice were anesthetized and transcranial perfused with 0.9% saline solution followed by a 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The brains were removed and cryoprotected using a graded sucrose series (20%, 30%) until they sank. A freezing microtome was used to cut 30-60 μm sections for imaging. Brain slices were washed and then imaged by the VS120 microscope at excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 519 nm (mNeonGreen) and 591 and 618 nm (mRuby). The brains for immunoprecipitation and western blotting were obtained by transcranial perfused mice with 0.9% saline solution. Only the cortex and hippocampus were used for analysis.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting</title>
<p>The immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. The brain tissue was homogenized in a blender for 2-3 min and further disrupted by sonication at 4°C in TBS containing protease inhibitors. The homogenate was next subjected to solubilized and centrifuging. The supernatant was mixed with antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, proteins were incubated with antibodies at 4°C for 2 hours. Then incubated the protein-antibody complex substances with 100 μl protein G Sepharose CL-4B beads at 4°C for another 2 hours. Beads were then washed and eluted for western blotting. For the western blot, an equal volume of samples from each group was electrophoresed on 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membranes. After being blocked by 10% milk in TBST at room temperature for 2 hours, the membrane was incubated with anti-Strep, anti-Flag, anti- GluN1, anti-GluN2A, anti-GluN2B, or anti-GluN3A at 4°C overnight. After washing in TBST, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG for 1 hour at room temperature. Then peroxidase activity was visualized by AI600.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The previous evidence for NMDARs containing N1, N2, and N3 subunits (t-NMDARs) was weak. All previous results could be explained by mixtures of di-heteromeric receptors. The authors here set out to identify t-NMDARs both in vitro and in the brain.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The single-channel recording is quite convincing because the authors could reproduce previous results in their system, but could also then add new observations. It is quite hard (if not impossible) to obtain the N1-N2A-N3A result at 100 µM Glu/Gly from a mixture, because the N1-N2A diheteromer has such a high open probability. Therefore, any idea that this might be, in fact, two receptors (GluN1-N2A and GluN1-N3A) is trivially falsified. The authors might prefer to make this argument based on the reduction of open probability, which cannot be achieved from a mixture masquerading as a single channel.</p>
<p>With regard to crosslinker usage in brain tissue, these are very impressive attempts, which I applaud. The fluorescence images of the brain sections look convincing. But the bands corresponding to N2-N3 crosslinked subunits from neurons or the brain are faint. I would want more information to be convinced that these faint bands come from GluN2-N3 dimers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the first part of the paper, where the CryoEM structure is determined, it's not really clear to me the extent to which Fab binding might bias the position of the ATDs (and even then the arrangement of each subunit within the whole complex). Then, much later at the end of the results, there is a structural analysis that claims to be integrative (Figure 7) but does not obviously rely on any other data than the structures, but does mention this point about the Fabs. The results could be rearranged to make these points clearer.</p>
<p>I have my biggest doubts about the crosslinking of native receptors. For the biochemistry from neurons or brain tissue, this is a very ambitious idea that has been hard to execute over the past 15-20 years. The authors use AzF for the obvious reason that this was done before in NMDARs. The constructs that have been assembled are neat. But AzF is a really bad crosslinker. The authors attribute the weak bands to subunit mobility, but the minor abundance is more likely due to the strong constraints on AzF crosslinking and its unsuitable photochemistry in general (very easily activated with room light, for example).</p>
<p>There is no information at all given about the wavelength, intensity, duration of UV exposure, and how, for example, the right exposure was determined. How were the samples protected in between?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors purified and solved by cryo-EM a structure of tri-heteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN3A NMDA receptors, whose existence has long been contentious. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology on GluN1/GluN2/GluN3A NMDARs reconstituted into liposomes, they characterized the function of this NMDAR subtype. Finally, thanks to site-targeted crosslinking using unnatural amino acid incorporation, they show that the GluN2A subunit can crosslink with the GluN3A subunit in a cellular context, both in recombinant systems (HEK cells) and neuronal cultures and in vivo.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The NMDAR GluN3 subunit is a glycine-binding subunit that was long thought to assemble into GluN1/GluN2/GluN3 tri-heteromeric receptors during development, acting as a brake for synaptic development. However, several studies based on single subunit counting (Ulbrich et al., PNAS 2008) and ex vivo/in vivo electrophysiology have challenged the existence of these tri-heteromers (see Bossi, Pizzamiglio et al., Trends Neurosci. 2023). A large part of the controversy stems from the difficulty in isolating the tri-heteromeric population from their di-heteromeric counterparts, which led to a lack of knowledge on the biophysical and pharmacological properties of putative GluN1/GluN2/GluN3 receptors. To counteract this problem, the authors used a two-step purification method - first with a strep-tag attached to the GluN3 subunit, then with a His tag attached to the GluN2 subunit - to isolate GluN1/GluN2/GluN3 tri-heteromers from GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN3 di-heteromers, and they did observe these entities in Western blot and FSEC. They solved a cryo-EM structure of this NMDAR subtype using specific FAbs to identify the GluN1 and GluN2A subunits, showing an asymmetrical, splayed architecture. Then, they reconstituted the purified receptors in lipid vesicles to perform single-channel electrophysiological recordings. Finally, in order to validate the tri-heteromeric arrangement in a cellular system, they performed photocrosslinking experiments between the GluN2A and GluN3 subunits. For this purpose, a photoactivatable unnatural amino acid (AzF) was incorporated at the bottom of GluN2A NTD, a region embedded within the receptor complex that is predicted to be in close proximity to the GluN3 subunit. This is an elegant approach to validate the existence of GluN1/GluN2/GluN3 tri-hets, since at the chosen AzF incorporation position, crosslinking between GluN2A and GluN3 is more likely to reflect interaction of subunits within the same receptor complex than between two receptors. They show crosslinking between GluN2A and GluN3 in the presence of AzF and UV light, but not if UV light or AzF were not provided, suggesting that GluN2A and GluN3 can indeed be incorporated in the same complex. In a further attempt to demonstrate the physiological relevance of these tri-heteromers, they performed the same crosslinking experiments in cultured neurons and even native brain samples. While unnatural amino acid incorporation is now a well-established technique in vitro, such an approach is very difficult to implement in vivo. The technical effort put into the validation of the presence of these tri-heteromers in vivo should thus be commended.</p>
<p>Overall, all the strategies used by this paper to prove the existence of GluN1/GluN2/GluN3 tri-heteromers, and investigate their structure and function, are well-thought-out and very elegant. But the current data do not fully support the conclusions of the paper.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>All the experiments aiming at proving the existence of GluN1/GluN2/GluN3 tri-heteromers rely on the purification of these receptors from whole cell extracts. There is therefore no proof that these receptors are expressed at the membrane and are functional. This is a limitation that has been overlooked and should be discussed in the manuscript. In addition, in the current manuscript state, each demonstration suffers from caveats that do not allow for a firm conclusion about the existence and the properties of this receptor subtype.</p>
<p>(1) In Cryo-EM images of GluN1/GluN2A/GluN3A receptors, the GluN3 subunit is identified as the subunit having no Fab bound to it. How can the authors be sure that this is indeed the GluN3A subunit and not a GluN2A subunit that has not bound the Fab? Does the GluN3A subunit carry features that would allow distinguishing it independently of Fab binding? In addition, it is surprising that the authors did not incubate the tri-heteromers with a Fab against GluN3A, since Extended Figure 3 shows that such a Fab is available.</p>
<p>(2) Whether the single-channel recordings reflect the activity of GluN1/GluN2/GluN3 tri-heteromers is not convincing. Indeed, currents from liposomes containing these tri-heteromers have two conductance levels that correspond to the conductances of the corresponding di-heteromers. There is therefore a need for additional proof that the measured currents do not reflect a mixture of currents from N1/2A di-heteromers on one side, and N1/3A di-heteromers on the other side. What is the purity of the N1/3A sample? Indeed, given the high open probability and high conductance of N1/2A tri-heteromers, even a small fraction of them could significantly contribute to the single-channel currents. Additionally, although the authors show no current induced by 3uM glycine alone on proteoliposomes with the N1/2A/3A prep (no stats provided, though), given the sharp dependence of N1/3A currents on glycine concentration, this control alone cannot rule out the presence of contaminant N1/3A dihets in the preparation.</p>
<p>Finally, pharmacological characterization of these tri-heteromers is lacking. In vivo, the presence of tri-heteromeric GluN1/GluN2/GluN3 tri-heteromers was inferred from recordings of NMDARs activated by glutamate but with low magnesium sensitivity. What is the effect of magnesium on N1/2A/3A currents? Does APV, the classical NMDAR antagonist acting at the glutamate site, inhibit the tri-heteromers? What is the effect of CGP-78608, which inhibits GluN1/GluN2 NMDARs but potentiates GluN1/GluN3 NMDARs? Such pharmacological characterization is critical to validate that the measured currents are indeed carried by a tri-heteromeric population, and would also be very important to identify such tri-heteromers in native tissues.</p>
<p>(3) Validation of GluN1/GluN2/GluN3 tri-heteromer expression by photocrosslinking: The mixture of constructions used (full-length or CTD-truncated constructs, with or without tags) is confusing, and it is difficult to track the correct molecular weight of the different constructs. In Figure 6, the band corresponding to a putative GluN3/GluN2A dimer is very weak. In addition, given the differences in molecular weights between the GluN2 subunits and GluN3, we would expect the band corresponding to a GluN2A/GluN2B to migrate differently from the GluN2A/GluN3 dimer, but all high molecular weight bands seem to be a the same level in the blot. Finally, in the source data, the blots display additional bands that were not dismissed by the authors without justification. In short, better clarification of the constructs and more careful interpretation of the blots are necessary to support the conclusions claimed by the authors.</p>
