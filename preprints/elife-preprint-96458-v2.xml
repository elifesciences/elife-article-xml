<title>Abstract</title><p>Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious lesions experienced by our genome. Yet, DSBs are intentionally induced during gamete formation to promote the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. While the conserved topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11 catalyzes DSBs, additional regulatory proteins— referred to as “Spo11 accessory factors”— regulate the number, timing, and placement of DSBs during meiotic prophase ensuring that SPO11 does not wreak havoc on the genome. Despite the importance of the accessory factors, they are poorly conserved at the sequence level suggesting that these factors may adopt unique functions in different species. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the genetic and physical interactions between the DSB factors in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> providing new insights into conserved and novel functions of these proteins. This work shows that HIM-5 is the determinant of X-chromosome-specific crossovers and that its retention in the nucleus is dependent on DSB-1, the sole accessory factor that interacts with SPO-11. We further provide evidence that HIM-5 mediates interactions with the different accessory factors sub-groups, providing insights into how components on the DNA loops may interact with the chromosome axis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the seminal events during meiosis is the formation of crossovers (CO) during the first meiotic division. While COs create new combinations of alleles through the exchange of genetic material between homologs, they also establish physical connections that ensure their proper alignment on the meiotic spindle and their subsequent segregation to opposite ends of the spindle. In the absence of COs, homologs segregate randomly, leading to gametes with altered chromosome numbers and subsequent fetal aneuploidies. In humans, aneuploidy is observed in 1 of 160 live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dungan, 2002</xref>) and in &gt;50% of miscarriages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hassold et al., 2007</xref>) underscoring the importance of proper CO formation.</p>
<p>A necessary early step in CO formation is the creation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the widely conserved Spo11 enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>). Although Spo11 is essential for DSB formation, it does not function alone: additional proteins regulate the timing, placement, and number of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cole et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hinman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Keeney, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vrielynck et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, where DSB formation has been best characterized, at least nine other proteins interact with Spo11 to regulate its recruitment and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lam &amp; Keeney, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Martini et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> physical interaction studies have revealed that these proteins form several subcomplexes. Briefly, the RMM complex (Rec114, Mer2, and Mei4) is loaded on chromosomes early in prophase and is required for Spo11 binding to sites of DNA cleavage (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sasanuma et al., 2007</xref>). Activation of Mer2 requires phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Henderson et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that Mer2 links DSB formation to the progression of the meiotic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arora et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Henderson et al., 2006</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Maleki et al., 2007</xref>). Rec102 and Rec104 form another subcomplex that facilitates Spo11 dimerization and its association with DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arora et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kee &amp; Keeney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Prieler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sasanuma et al., 2007</xref>). Ski8 binds Spo11 and is important for Spo11 nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arora et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, the Mre11–Rad50–Xrs2 (MRX) complex is also required for DSB formation but requires all the other DSB proteins to associate with DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bouuaert et al., 2021</xref>). Despite their importance, most of these proteins are poorly conserved at the amino acid level although homologs have been identified for several of these in organisms ranging from plants to worms to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cole et al., 2010</xref>; Kumar et al., 2010b). Importantly, a recent study of plants has presented a similar model for DSB induction as in yeast, yet the specific players and details differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vrielynck et al., 2021</xref>) highlighting the value of comparative studies to understand the evolutionary history of the DSB machinery in metazoans.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> biochemical studies have shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic> SPO-11 is monomeric but that even when it is able to bind dsDNA, it does not exhibit DNA cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>). This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that cofactors are needed for DSB induction. DSB-1 and DSB-2, are homologs of the conserved Rec114 protein (Tesse et al, 2017), and DSB-3, a homolog of Mei4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hinman et al., 2021</xref>). These factors localize to chromosomes during early meiotic prophase and promote the activity of the SPO-11 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stamper et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hinman et al, 2021</xref>), functioning analogously to their counterparts in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kumar et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Maleki et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>him-17</italic>, <italic>mre-11</italic>, and <italic>rad-50</italic> are also essential for the introduction of breaks in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chin &amp; Villeneuve, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hinman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Reddy &amp; Villeneuve, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Other genes, including <italic>xnd-1</italic>, <italic>him-5, rec-1, cep-1,</italic> and <italic>parg-1</italic> have more limited roles in break induction. <italic>him-5</italic> is fascinating in that it is required to ensure the complement of DSBs on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Janisiw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Meneely et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>). In the region of the germ line where DSBs are made, the X chromosome is transcriptionally quiescent and packaged in a heterochromatin-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kelly et al., 2002</xref>). By contrast, the autosomes are transcriptionally active and replete with histone modifications associated with open chromatin. It is thought that the heterochromatic-like state of the X presents a barrier to DSB formation necessitating the evolution of proteins to overcomes this obstacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>xnd-1</italic> transcriptionally regulates <italic>him-5</italic> to promote breaks on the X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McClendon et al., 2016</xref>), but it also restricts histone acetylation, a function that ensures the proper timing of DSB induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wagner et al, 2010</xref>). In the absence of <italic>xnd-1</italic>, there is precocious formation of DSBs as monitored by the accumulation of the HR strand-exchange protein RAD-51 in transition zone nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McClendon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>CO positioning is altered in all situations where DSB levels are affected, but the <italic>rec-1</italic> mutation has a profound effect on the distribution of meiotic COs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rose &amp; Baillie, 1979</xref>) with only a minor reduction in total DSB numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). Prior analysis of <italic>rec-1</italic> and <italic>him-5</italic> found these genes to be paralogs that function cooperatively to ensure wild-type DSB levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, while loss of <italic>rec-1</italic> preferentially affects CO distribution, loss of <italic>him-5</italic> reduces DSB numbers nearly in half, severely delays DSB induction (until mid-late pachytene), and changes CO distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Meneely et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>him-5</italic> has redundant functions with <italic>cep-1</italic> for both break formation and inhibition of NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mateo et al., 2016</xref>), revealing roles for <italic>him-5</italic> in coordinating DSB induction with downstream repair.</p>
<p>In this study, we expand the analysis of the genetic interactions between the SPO-11 accessory factors in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and provide the first protein-protein interaction studies of these factors using co-immunoprecipitation and yeast-two hybrid (Y2H). We use these interaction data to propose how the DSB formation is initiated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and compare and contrast this to models proposed in yeast and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bouuaert et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vrielynck et al., 2021</xref>). Our results allow us to begin to elucidate the regulatory events that control the localization, timing, and placement of meiotic DSBs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<title>HIM-5 is the essential factor for meiotic breaks in the X-chromosome</title>
<p>Three of the DSB proteins appear to have a biased effect on X chromosome CO formation: null alleles of <italic>xnd-1</italic> and <italic>him-5</italic> predominantly show a loss of CO intermediates on the X, increases in univalent X chromosomes at diakinesis in half or almost all nuclei, respectively, and an increase in XO male offspring resulting from nondisjunction of the X chromosome during the meiotic division; the hypomorphic <italic>him-17(e2806)</italic> mutation shows increased incidence of one unattached homolog pair in diakinesis and an increase in male production consistent with an X-specific defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Reddy &amp; Villeneuve, 2004</xref>). To determine if these genes function through a common underlying mechanism, we first performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assessing interactions with both high and low stringency. We observed a strong Y2H interaction between XND-1 and HIM-17, and a weak one between HIM-17 and HIM-5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). To validate these interactions, we also performed immunoprecipitations (IPs) of HIM-17::GFP followed by mass spectrometry (MS, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). This identified XND-1, as well as 16 additional strong interactors of HIM-17::GFP (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Moreover, endogenous XND-1 was identified in western blots of IPs performed independently using 3xHA-tagged HIM-17 epitopes, indicating a robust interaction between these proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and S1C). In contrast, HIM-5 was not detected in either the HIM-17::GFP co-IPs or IP/MS, suggesting that the interaction observed by Y2H either exists very transiently or was bridged by a protein expressed in yeast.</p>

<p>Prior studies from our group indicate that <italic>xnd-1</italic> regulates HIM-5 transcriptionally since ectopic expression of <italic>him-5::GFP</italic> using the <italic>pie-1</italic> germline promoter, but not expression using the endogenous <italic>him-5</italic> promoter, rescues the X chromosome nondisjunction defects conferred by the <italic>xnd-1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Meneely et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McClendon et al., 2016</xref>). Since RNA-Seq studies showed that <italic>him-17</italic> regulates many germline genes including <italic>him-5</italic> (Carelli et al., 2022), we set out to determine if ectopic expression of <italic>him-5</italic> could also rescue <italic>him-17</italic> null mutants. Similar to what we observed with <italic>xnd-1</italic> mutants, <italic>Ppie-1::him-5 —</italic> but not <italic>Phim-5::him-5 —</italic> rescued the X chromosome defects seen by the increase of XO male offspring from XX hermaphrodites (known as the high incidence of males or “Him” phenotype) (35% of males in <italic>him-17(ok424)</italic> vs. 7.02% in <italic>Ppie1::him-5;him-17(ok424)</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with the lack of rescue, there was no statistically significant change in univalent formation in <italic>Phim-5::him-5;him- 17(ok424)</italic> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). These results cannot be explained by HIM-5 protein levels which are lower in <italic>Ppie-1::him-5</italic> than in <italic>Phim-5::him-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McClendon et al., 2016</xref>). The lack of rescue from <italic>Phim-5::him-5</italic> supports the conclusion that HIM-17 directly regulates <italic>him-5</italic> expression. Since the <italic>pie-1</italic> promoter appears to be independent of HIM-17, the <italic>Ppie- 1::him-5</italic> construct can—at least partially—bypass this regulation and suppress the <italic>him- 17</italic> mutant phenotype. These findings suggest that both XND-1 and HIM-17 both promote X chromosome DSB and CO formation by regulating <italic>him-5</italic> expression. Moreover, <italic>xnd-1</italic> and <italic>him-17</italic> have distinct roles in DSB/CO formation since only null alleles of <italic>him-17</italic>, but not <italic>xnd-1</italic> or <italic>him-5</italic>, confer a severe loss of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Meneely et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Reddy &amp; Villeneuve, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>), while only <italic>xnd-1</italic> mutations influence the timing of DSB induction/repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McClendon et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>We note that ectopic HIM-5 expression strongly rescued the embryonic lethality conferred by the <italic>him-17</italic> null allele (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). While a small fraction of the lethality is attributed to X chromosome nondisjunction, most of the lethality is a consequence of autosomal missegregation. Thus, even though <italic>him-5</italic> null mutant animals exhibit a profound loss of DSBs/COs on the X chromosomes with rare CO defects on autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Meneely et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>him-5</italic> expression can restore CO formation to both autosomes and X chromosomes. This strongly supports a general role for HIM-5 in CO formation and further indicates that HIM-5 is sufficient to restore COs on the X chromosome.</p>
<p>To further characterize the interaction between XND-1 and HIM-17, we also sought to determine whether they colocalize on meiotic chromosomes using confocal microscopy. Prior studies have shown that HIM-17 associates with meiotic chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Reddy &amp; Villeneuve, 2004</xref>). Co-staining the HIM-17::HA transgenic line with anti-HA and anti-XND-1 antibodies showed that HIM-17, like XND-1, is enriched on autosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>). Both proteins showed no overlap with the chromosome axes (marked with HTP-3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) or DAPI (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>), although we cannot rule out that a small fraction of the population, either below the level of detection or transiently, localizes to the axes. These immunolocalization studies also show a strong juxtaposition of HIM-17 and XND-1, with no detectable overlap between their staining patterns in germ lines from the mitotic region through late pachytene, when XND-1 disappears from the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). Structural modeling of the XND-1 and HIM-17 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Comeau et al, 2004</xref>) provides a potential explanation for this observation: HIM-17 is a very large protein, and the HA-tag positioned at its amino terminus is predicted to be located at least 180 Å away from the protein:protein interaction interface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>DSB-1 mediates interactions with SPO-11 and promotes HIM-5 nuclear localization</title>
<p>Since HIM-5 appears to be central to DSB/CO formation on the X chromosome and the presence of DSB-1 and DSB-2 are required for all meiotic breaks, we next sought to determine whether HIM-5 interacts with DSB-1, its paralog DSB-2, or DSB-3.

<p>We next wanted to understand the functional relevance of the interaction between DSB-1 and HIM-5. To this end, we examined the localization of HIM-5 proteins in the <italic>dsb-1</italic> mutant background. Co-staining of the chromosome axis (anti-HTP-3) and either HIM-5::GFP transgene (anti-GFP) or endogenously-tagged HIM-5::3xHA (anti-HA) revealed that HIM-5 nuclear localization begins just prior to the transition zone in both wild type and <italic>dsb-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>, arrows). However, whereas in wild type, HIM-5 protein remains nuclear throughout early-mid pachytene and become further enriched on meiotic chromatin; in <italic>dsb-1</italic> mutants, HIM-5 nuclear localization is lost (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). From this change in HIM-5 protein distribution, we infer that DSB-1 (and/or its DSB-promoting function) is required to retain HIM-5 in meiotic nuclei.</p>
<p>Since HIM-5 levels could also be affected by <italic>dsb-1</italic> and/or <italic>dsb-2</italic>, we next asked whether ectopic expression of HIM-5 could suppress defects in bivalent formation due to the loss of <italic>dsb-1</italic> or <italic>dsb-2</italic>. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, ectopic HIM-5 reduced the number of univalents in both mutant backgrounds. Since a small fraction of <italic>dsb-2; Ppie-1::him-5</italic> animals exhibited 6 or 7 DAPI bodies, we assayed whether the transgene could improve hatching rates and reduce male production in <italic>dsb-2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Whereas the <italic>Ppie-1::him-5</italic> transgene has no impact of hatching and male frequencies, the more highly expressed <italic>Phim-5::him-5</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McClendon et al., 2016</xref>) conferred a mild suppression of the embryonic lethality. This ability to suppress hatching-but not male production-further supports a role for HIM-5 in regulating total DSB numbers.</p>

<title>Genetic interactions define four functional groups that contribute to DSB/CO formation</title>
<p>Having established interactions between subsets of the SPO-11 accessory factors in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we next wanted to perform more extensive genetic analyses between the known DSB factors. To this end, we created double mutant combinations of alleles with partial DSB defects. These included either weak loss-of-function alleles of essential DSB genes (<italic>him-17, mre-11</italic>) or null alleles of genes that partially reduce DSBs (<italic>cep-1</italic>, <italic>dsb-2</italic>, <italic>rec-1</italic>, <italic>him-5</italic>, and <italic>parg-1</italic>). Diakinesis oocytes were analyzed in the single and double mutants by whole-mount fixation and DAPI staining followed by confocal microscopy and 3D visualization. The chromosomes are highly condensed at diakinesis, and six bivalents can be detected in wild-type worms. Univalents, fusions, and DNA fragments can be seen in mutants with defects in DSB formation or their repair into a CO, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chin &amp; Villeneuve, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that double mutant strains carrying mutations in genes that function in different aspects of DSB induction would show more severe defects and have an increase in univalent formation compared to single mutants. On the other hand, genes that function together or at the same step of break induction should exhibit no or only mild enhancement of the DSB defects.</p>
<p>Double mutant analysis was precluded with <italic>dsb-1</italic> and <italic>dsb-3</italic> since the single mutants already show a complete absence of breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hinman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutant nuclei manifest an age-dependent loss in DSB capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>) allowing us to analyze interactions between <italic>dsb-2</italic> and <italic>cep-1, parg-1, him-17,</italic> and <italic>rec-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A-D</xref>). As 1-day-old adults, <italic>dsb-2</italic> single mutants had ∼50% of diakinesis nuclei that contained 6 bivalents, ∼30% with 7 DAPI-stained bodies (5 bivalents and 2 univalents), and ∼20% with 8 or more DAPI-stained bodies. Single mutants of <italic>cep-1</italic>, <italic>parg-1,</italic> and <italic>rec-1</italic> each had &gt;90% of diakinesis nuclei with 6 bivalents, consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Janisiw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mateo et al., 2016</xref>). In animals carrying <italic>him-17(e2806)</italic> mutation, a weak allele of the otherwise essential locus for DSB formation, only ∼50% of mutant nuclei had 6 bivalents; the other 50% had 7 DAPI-stained bodies, reflecting the requirement for this gene in CO formation on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Reddy &amp; Villeneuve, 2004</xref>). When <italic>dsb-2</italic> was combined with each of these mutations, an increased number of DAPI-stained bodies and a concomitant decrease in the number of chiasmata were observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). These results strongly suggest that <italic>dsb-2</italic> functions cooperatively with all four loci for the regulation of meiotic CO formation.</p>

</fig>
<p>Given that <italic>rec-1, parg-1,</italic> and <italic>cep-1</italic> fall in a separate functional group from <italic>dsb-2</italic>, we next addressed whether these three genes function together or independently. All double mutant permutations of <italic>rec-1, parg-1,</italic> and <italic>cep-1</italic> were analyzed, and in each case, the single and double mutants were nearly indistinguishable from the single mutants, i.e., 6 bivalents (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5L-M</xref>). Therefore, we infer that these genes likely function to control the same step in DSB/CO induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, when <italic>rec-1, parg-1,</italic> or <italic>cep-1</italic> were combined with other DSB gene mutations, including <italic>him-17</italic>, they had similar effects, and the numbers of univalents were increased (Figures S54A, C, D for Group 1; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E-G</xref> for Group 3; and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5J</xref>, K for Group 4). Similar results have previously been reported from our laboratories for double mutants with <italic>him-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Janisiw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mateo et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>mre-11</italic> functions in both DSB formation and subsequent DNA end resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chin &amp; Villeneuve, 2001</xref>), the latter as part of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1/Xrs2 (MRN/X) resection complex, the other proteins of which are encoded by the worm <italic>rad-50</italic> and <italic>nbs-1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Girard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>). Null mutations in <italic>mre-11</italic> and <italic>rad-50</italic> completely abrogate DSB induction. However, we were able to take advantage of a separation-of-function allele, <italic>mre-11(iow1),</italic> that cannot perform its end-resection functions but can induce DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yin &amp; Smolikove, 2013</xref>). The <italic>iow1</italic> mutation causes chromosome fusions to appear in diakinesis oocytes resulting from the aggregation of unprocessed DNA ends. While this allele makes enough DSBs to cause aggregation of all chromosomes, we hypothesized that it might have a minor impairment in DSB induction that would be revealed when combined with other DSB mutations. If this were the case, the double mutants would make fewer breaks, leading to fewer chromosome fusions and an increase in the number of DAPI-stained bodies/univalents. Consistent with this hypothesis, <italic>mre- 11(iow1)</italic> double mutants with each of the other DSB mutations led to fewer fusions and more DAPI-stained bodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5H-K</xref>). Thus, we propose that <italic>mre-11,</italic> and by extension <italic>rad-50</italic>, function in their own branch of the DSB/CO pathway.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, a unique phenotype was observed in a subset of the <italic>cep-1; mre-11</italic> double mutants. Our prior studies showed that <italic>cep-1</italic> functions redundantly with <italic>him-5</italic> to both ensure DSB formation and promote downstream homologous recombination (HR) repair by preventing non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mateo et al., 2016</xref>). In that study, we reported that <italic>cep-1(lg12501)</italic> is a separation-of-function allele that is defective in DSB formation. In the <italic>cep-1(lg12501); mre-11(iow-1)</italic> double mutants, we observed mixed phenotypes: some nuclei had 12 DAPI-stained bodies, while others exhibited an exacerbation of the fusion defect (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). We infer that the univalents indicate a synergistic effect between <italic>mre-11</italic> and <italic>cep-1</italic> for DSB formation; the increase in fusions, on the other hand, may suggest that <italic>cep-1(lg12501)</italic> is not fully wild-type for the DNA repair functions of CEP-1.</p>
<p>While each of the genes that we analyzed has reported roles in DSB formation, we wanted to confirm that the observed increases in univalents in the double mutants were in fact due to impairment in DSB induction and not to deficits in later steps of CO formation. Therefore, we relied on an established assay to distinguish between these possibilities: we asked whether the addition of exogenous breaks from gamma irradiation (IR) could suppress the univalent phenotype by serving as a surrogate for SPO-11-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>). Recent work has shown that 10Gy IR is able to produce up to ∼20 DSBs per meiotic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lascarez-Lagunas et al., 2023</xref>), which is sufficient to ensure a CO on each chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mets &amp; Meyer, 2009</xref>). We analyzed the number of DAPI bodies with and without IR in a subset of the double mutants where we observed synergistic effects (<italic>dsb-2; parg-1</italic>, <italic>dsb-2; rec-1</italic>, and <italic>rec-1; him-17</italic>). When each of these double mutant strains was exposed to IR, the wild-type phenotype of 6 bivalents was largely restored (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>), supporting the conclusion that the CO deficiency observed is triggered by defects in DSB formation.</p>

<title>Protein-protein interactions between the DSB regulatory factors</title>
<p>The genetic analyses described above defined four functional groups that contribute to break formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Using Y2H, we next set out to determine whether interactions between and within groups could explain how the different complexes come together to regulate DSB induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). CEP-1 showed auto-activation in both vectors and therefore was removed from further analysis. DSB-1, HIM-17, and REC-1 also showed self-activation in the binding domain vector, therefore, only the activation domain fusions were analyzed. Pairwise interactions between all remaining combinations were then analyzed. HIM-5 displayed the most promiscuous Y2H interactions, with strong interactions seen with MRE-11 and weak interactions as already discussed with HIM-17 and DSB-1. XND-1 apart from interacting with HIM-17, also showed strong Y2H interactions with REC-1. A recent study provided Y2H evidence supporting the idea that SPO-11 interacts with DSB-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hinman et al., 2021</xref>). Critically, our work supports and extends this observation to show that DSB-1 is the only known accessory factor that interacts with SPO-11 in Y2H assays, cementing its role as a key determinant for DSB induction and explaining its role in feedback controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hinman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Guo et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>To analyze more in-depth the Y2H interactions between DSB-1 and DSB-2, DSB-3, and SPO-11, we looked for protein domains in DSB-1 that could be involved in these interactions. Interestingly, DSB-1 has 5 “sticky” helices (helices 2-6 in <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>) that have the potential to be implicated in protein-protein interactions. We first deleted all of these helices together by introducing a deletion after L114 (DSB-1(1-114) in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref>, F). We found that this truncated version of DSB-1 loses the ability to interact with DSB-2 and DSB-3 but is still able to associate with SPO-11. Moreover, when we only deleted the helices 3-6 but kept the helix 2 (DSB-1(1-145)), we obtained the same results, suggesting that the Y2H interactions between DSB-1 and DSB-2/DSB-3 is mediated by the C-terminal helices 3-6 and not helix 2. To prove this, we created a truncated DSB-1 protein that only contains amino acids from P145 to the stop codon (DSB-1(145-Ct)). Consistent with the deletion analysis, we observed that the C-terminal domain is sufficient to promote associations with DSB-2 and DSB-3. This domain was also not sufficient to promote the DSB-1/SPO-11 interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). These experiments complement the results published by Villeneuve lab where they observed that the DSB-1 N-terminus is the domain necessary for the DSB-1/SPO-11 (but not for the DSB-1/2/3) interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hinman et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>We next used AlphaFold and structural modeling to investigate whether the <italic>C. elegans</italic> REC114/MEI4 homolog could assemble in the same fashion as their distant orthologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Claeys Bouuaert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Daccache et al., 2023</xref>) in which two helices of REC114 dimer surround a MEI4 helix. DSB-1 is predicted to form a stable homodimer that can assemble into a highly stable trimeric complex with DSB-3 threaded through the middle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-I</xref>) analogous to what is predicted for Rec114-Mei4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Daccache et al., 2023</xref>). By contrast, DSB-2 cannot form homodimers, although it can replace one of the DSB-1 monomers to form the DSB-1:DSB-2:DSB-3 ternary complex. Free energy calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Champ and Camacho, 2007</xref>) show that the DSB-1:DSB-2:DSB-3 complex is less stable (−3.8 kcal/mol) than a DSB-1:DSB-1:DSB-3 complex consistent with the more limited role for DSB-2 in break formation, at least in young worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>)).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Across species, accessory factors collaborate with SPO-11 to regulate various aspects of DSB formation, including the timing, placement, number, and persistence of DSB induction, as well as the chromatin architecture at and around the break site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arora et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cole et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hinman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kumar &amp; de Massy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sasanuma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sommermeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vrielynck et al., 2021</xref>). Here we present genetic, biochemical, and cytological studies to develop a working interaction model for DSB regulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> DSB complex appears to be comprised of four sub-groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) interconnected by their association with HIM-5. Our results suggest two important roles for HIM-5: first as the linchpin between the whole DSB complex, thereby ensuring the coordination of the timing, placement, and number of DSBs (described in more detail below); and second, as the determinant in X chromosome COs.</p>

<caption><title>Speculative model of the DSB formation complex in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>Synthesizing prior work and data herein, we propose a model to explain the known interactions and localization patterns of the DSB regulatory factors in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. DSB-1/-2/-3 and HIM-17-XND-1 subcomplexes are initially found on DNA loops. The phosphorylation of REC-1 by CDK activates DSB formation, allowing HIM-5 through its association with MRE-11 and PARG-1 (which both associate with HTP-3) to efficiently bring the DSB-1/-2/-3 complex with SPO-11 to the chromosome axis. This recruitment to the axes by HIM-5, facilitates the coupling of DSBs to downstream repair by the MRN complex and others. In the absence of HIM-5, DSBs/COs on autosomes do not occur efficiently and crossover sites are shifted to the gene-rich third of each chromosome, presumably because DSB-1/-2/-3/SPO-11 cannot be as efficiently recruited to the proper sites partially defined by HIM-17 and XND-1. We assume that recruitment to the chromosome axes in the absence of HIM-5 is likely stochastic or mediated by as yet unknown protein interactions. On the X chromosome, the absence of HIM-5 prevents the formation of most DSBs.</p></caption>

<p>DSB-1 and DSB-2 are both orthologs of the budding yeast Rec114 protein but DSB-1 has a more central role in DSB induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>) which we posit can be explained by the increased stability of the DSB-1:DSB-1:DSB-3 trimer compared to a DSB-1:DSB-2:DSB-3 trimer. The direct association between SPO-11 and DSB-1 but none of the other worm accessory factors points to DSB-1/REC114 as the hub for the integration of break inducing signals in this organism. In yeast and <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> accessory proteins are associated indirectly with Spo11/SPO11 through interactions with the TopVI/MTOPVIB subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arora et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kee &amp; Keeney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Maleki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Robert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vrielynck et al., 2021</xref>). These differences between species underscore how conserved DSB proteins have been co-opted to regulate different aspects of break induction.</p>
<p>While DSB-1/-2/-3 are critical for CO formation, they predominantly localize on DNA loops with little to no overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hinman et al., 2021</xref>). Instead, a small fraction of these three proteins appear to associate with the DNA axis, a localization that is consistent with the “tethered loop model” for break induction in yeast and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Maleki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sommermeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>). Two accessory factors, MRE-11 and PARG-1 are known interactors of the axis protein HTP-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Janisiw et al., 2020</xref>). Both proteins interact either directly or indirectly with HIM-5, which physically associates with DSB-1, thereby providing a mechanism to bring the loop-associated proteins to the axis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>MRE-11 and PARG-1 also have roles in both break formation and DNA repair. For PARG-1, we show here that it functions together with REC-1 and CEP-1 based on the following data: synthetic CO defects were seen in <italic>cep-1;him-5</italic>, <italic>rec-1;him-5</italic>, and <italic>parg-1;him-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mateo et al., 2016</xref> and this paper), but not in <italic>rec-1;cep-1, rec-1;parg-1</italic>, and <italic>cep-1;parg-1</italic> double mutants; <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutant phenotypes are exacerbated by the loss of <italic>rec-1</italic>, <italic>cep-1</italic> (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>), and <italic>parg-</italic>1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Janisiw et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, both CEP-1 and PARG-1 have additional roles in promoting homologous recombination-mediated repair and/or preventing alternative repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Janisiw, et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mateo et al., 2016</xref>). We envision that CEP-1, REC-1, and PARG-1 function together to promote DSBs and their repair into COs at the chromosome axis. Since we also showed that the DSB defects in <italic>mre-11</italic> mutant animals were enhanced by loss of <italic>parg-1</italic> or <italic>rec-1</italic> (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>), we favor a model in which MRE-11 and PARG-1 independently interact with the chromosome axis to ensure robust DSB formation and/or repair. It is possible that MRE-11, which is essential for COs, facilitates the tethering of chromosome loops to the axis, but further structural studies of these complexes are required.</p>
<p>The defects observed in <italic>cep-1;him-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mateo et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>rec-1;him-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2015</xref>) are both exacerbated by maternal age, similar to <italic>dsb-2</italic>. We envision that inputs from both HIM-5 and DSB-2 converge on DSB-1 to ensure robust DSB formation across the lifespan. This would also explain the synthetic defects in DSB formation between <italic>dsb-2</italic> and each of the components in the <italic>him-5</italic> interaction network. DSB-1 is required for chromatin association of DSB-2 but not vice versa, although DSB-1 levels are reduced in older <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>). We show here that DSB-1 is also required for nuclear retention of HIM-5. While the functional significance of this interaction awaits isolation of separation-of-function mutations that abrogate their interaction, it is tempting to speculate the signals that initiate meiotic induction regulate this interaction.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>TIMING of BREAKS</title>
<p>Studies from multiple systems have elucidated mechanisms to coordinate the timing of DSBs with the completion of meiosis, e.g. by CDK and Ddf4 phosphorylation in yeast (Murakami &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Keeney, 2008</xref>; Carelli et al., 2022). In worms, REC-1 was previously shown to be a target of CDK and therefore it was hypothesized that such a phosphorylation event would be critical to ensure that break induction occurs after the completion of S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). REC-1 and HIM-5 evolved from a gene duplication event in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> lineage; whereas the ancestral gene in related nematodes has features of both proteins-although it shares greater homology with HIM-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that the single ancestral REC-1/HIM-5 protein would be subject to CDK phosphorylation, which would then promote the assembly of the complexes at the chromosome axis to promote break formation.</p>
<p>Timing also appears to be critical for CO outcomes. Studies in yeast show different outcomes for early and late breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>) and recent studies in worms indicate that later breaks are needed for CO formation (Hicks et al., 2022) . We previously showed that <italic>xnd-1</italic> mutants have altered DSB kinetics, showing elevated levels of DSB formation in leptotene/zygotene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McClendon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>). This function of XND-1 is mediated, at least in part, by its effect on chromatin architecture. One possibility is that the physical interaction that we show here between XND-1 and REC-1 couples the completion of S phase to the activation of breaks within the correct chromatin environment, thus ensuring their timely formation. In the absence of XND-1, increases in global histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>) might allow SPO-11 easier access to the DNA. Another possibility is that upon phosphorylation of REC-1 by CDK-1, REC-1 through PARG-1 transiently brings XND-1 (the timer) to the axis, an event that restrains DSB formation.</p>

<title>Chromatin and Meiotic Gene Transcription</title>
<p>We provide strong evidence for direct interactions between XND-1 and HIM-17, both by Y2H and co-IP. HIM-17 appears to have a role in transcriptional regulation of DSB factors. Here we show that ectopic expression of HIM-5 from the <italic>pie-1</italic> promoter, but not overexpression from the endogenous <italic>him-5</italic> promoter, suppressed <italic>him-17</italic> phenotypes. This is similar to the rescue we saw of <italic>xnd-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McClendon et al., 2016</xref>) and suggests that both proteins contribute to the expression of <italic>him-5</italic>. This supports findings that <italic>him-17</italic> regulates the expression of ∼300 germline-enriched genes, including <italic>him-5, rec-1</italic>, and <italic>dsb-2</italic>, (Carelli et al., 2022) whose concomitant loss would be expected to abrogate break induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2015</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). While its only role may be in transcriptional regulation, a growing literature and data presented herein suggest a more direct role for HIM-17 in meiosis. We presented Y2H data for a weak interaction between HIM-17 and HIM-5. Although these interactions were not confirmed by IP, it remains possible that these complexes are transient associations, are unstable during IP, and/or are not abundant. Together with observed changes in chromatin structure and both DSB and CO distribution in <italic>him-17</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nadarajan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Reddy &amp; Villeneuve, 2004</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that together with XND-1, HIM-17 helps to create an environment permissive for SPO-11 binding and/or break formation. XND-1 and HIM-17 may function together in this role or redundantly, perhaps through XND-1 interacting with REC-1 and HIM-17 interacting with HIM-5, or in related species through interactions with the single REC-1/HIM-5 paralog.</p>

<title>X/Autosome differences in DSB formation</title>
<p>One of the conundrums arising from our data is in the function of the HIM-5 protein. <italic>him-</italic>5 was identified based on its preferential impact on CO formation on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Broverman &amp; Meneely, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hodgkin et al., 1979</xref>). The X-specific phenotypes conferred by <italic>him-5</italic> mutation could suggest that the X chromosome is simply more sensitive to a reduction in the number of active SPO-11 complexes; the fact that mutations in <italic>dsb-2</italic> also reduce DSBs but without an X chromosome bias argues against this interpretation. We show herein that HIM-5 is the sufficient to ensure that COs occur on the X chromosome. Ectopic expression of <italic>him-5</italic> can substantially rescue both the autosomal and X chromosomal defects of <italic>him-17</italic> null mutations -- despite expression levels lower than endogenous <italic>him-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McClendon et al., 2016</xref>). The X chromosome-specific defects of <italic>him-5</italic> mutations might arise due to defects in recruitment of DSB-1-2-3/SPO-11 to specific sites on the X or to an impaired ability to coordinate the assembly of the DSB machinery on the— late-replicating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jaramillo-Lambert et al, 2007</xref>)— axis of the X chromosome, although other models can be envisioned.</p>
<p>Our data and a growing literature insinuate a more general and central role for HIM-5 in DSB formation and downstream CO repair: 1) <italic>rec-1;him-5</italic> double mutants give an age-dependent severe loss of DSBs (like <italic>dsb-2</italic> mutants) suggesting that the ancestral function of the protein may have a more profound effect on break formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al 2015</xref>); 2) total DSBs are reduced to nearly 50% of wild type and are severely delayed in formation in <italic>him-5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Meneely et al., 2012</xref>); 3) a recent study reports role for <italic>him-5</italic> in CO formation in males where the X chromosome does not engage in CO exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Engebrecht et al., 2025</xref>); 4) HIM-5 is required for the normal distribution of COs on the autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Meneely et al., 2012</xref>); and 5) redundantly with CEP-1, HIM-5 promotes DSB formation and HR-mediate repair and inhibits NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mateo et al, 2016</xref>), 5) Our data herein show that HIM-5 interacts not only with DSB-1, but also components of the other functional groups that regulate DSB induction. Together, we believe this data supports a role for HIM-5 in bridging the accessory factors with SPO-11 to ensure the proper timing, placement and number of breaks.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation and Mass spectrometry analysis of HIM-17::GFP</title>
<p>IPs were performed on stock AV280: unc-119(e2498) III; him-17(ok424) V; meIs5[him-17::GFP +unc-119(+)]. Preparation and freezing of synchronized worms were carried out as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cheeseman et al., (2004)</xref> except that worms were grown on 8P plates seeded with the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain NA22 at room temperature. Worm lysis was carried out by grinding worm pellets in liquid nitrogen and subsequent sonication (Diagenode) was performed with the following settings: 3x 5 cycles on high with 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off. Lysate was centrifuged for 45 minutes at 15000 rpm at 4°C. To avoid unspecific protein binding the worm lysate was pre-cleared by incubation to uncoupled agarose beads (Chromotek, bab-20) for 1 hour at 4°C. Pre-cleared worm lysate was incubated with GFP-trap (Chromotek, gta-20) for 3 hours at 4°C. Beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitors (Roche) and 7 times with lysis buffer without proteinase inhibitors. Proteins were eluted by adding 40 μl 2xLSB and boiling for 5 min at 95°C. Protein precipitation was carried out using ProteoExtract Protein Precipitation Kit (EMD Millipore, 539180-1KIT) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and submitted for MS analysis to the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Perez-Riverol et al., 2022</xref>) with the dataset identifier PXD057629 and 10.6019/PXD057629.</p>
<p>GFP pulldowns of HIM-17::GFP for IP/MS was performed in duplicate and corrected against unspecific binding of proteins bound to GFP trap beads. Specifically, potential false positive hits, defined as such because they were also detected in wild type (N2), AIR-2::GFP and AIR-2KD::GFP pulldowns, were removed from this list. Then, only the remaining hits detected on both independent biological repeats, and for which 2 or more peptides were detected in each experiment, made it to this final table. The only exception is KU-80 which made it to the list after subtraction of the unspecific/false positive hits, but for which only 1 peptide was detected in the December pulldown (14 peptides were detected in the Feb 2014 pulldown). Given that we found KU-70 both times and the coverage/depth was better for the Feb 2014 pulldown we decided to keep KU-80 on the final table. Supplemental Table 2 shows all the hits that remained after subtraction of the unspecific binding proteins.</p>

<title>Structure analysis of protein-protein interaction</title>
<p>Prediction of protein-protein interactions is based on available protein structures or AlphaFold2 (AF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) models. Most relevant proteins DSB-1, DSB-2 and DSB-3 in <italic>C. Elegans</italic> do not have crystal structures. Hence, we rely on AF2 homology models that predicts core domains with confidence factors better than 90, well within the range of applicability to scan for possible protein-protein interactions. Docked poses among these proteins will be predicted using ClusPro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Comeau et al., 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kozakov et al., 2017</xref>) and free energy complementarity will further analyze with FastContact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Camacho &amp;Zhang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Champ and Camacho, 2007</xref>), both well-known structural modeling tools developed by one of us.</p>

<title>Peptide design</title>
<p>Peptides were designed using MD simulations in AMBER18 on the GPU-accelerated code with the AMBER ff14SB force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Salomon-Ferrer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Maier et al., 2015</xref>). The tLeap binary was used to solve structures in an octahedral TIP3P water box with a 15 Å distance from the peptide surface to the box edges and a closeness parameter of 0.75 Å. The system was neutralized and solvated in 150 mM NaCl. The nonbonded interaction cutoff was set to 8 Å. Hydrogen bonds were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm and an integration time step of 2 fs. Simulations were carried out by equilibrating the system for 5 ns at NPT, using a Berendsen thermostat to maintain a constant pressure of 1 atm followed by 300 ns NVT production at 300 K.</p>

<title>Structural Modeling of Full-Length DSB-1, DSB-2, and DSB-3 Interactions</title>
<p>To model the interaction between the full-length DSB-1, DSB-2, and DSB-3 proteins, we used the Mol* Viewer (Molstar), an interactive web-based molecular visualization platform. Predicted structures were imported into the viewer to evaluate their relative orientation, potential interaction surfaces, and spatial compatibility. Full-length models were analyzed using chain-specific coloring and representation tools to facilitate comparative visualization and interpretation of possible interaction interfaces.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Meiotic recombination initiates with the formation of DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation, catalyzed by the conserved topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11. Spo11 requires accessory factors that are poorly conserved across eukaryotes. Previous genetic studies have identified several proteins required for DSB formation in C. elegans to varying degrees; however, how these proteins interact with each other to recruit the DSB-forming machinery to chromosome axes remains unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, Raices et al. characterized the biochemical and genetic interactions among proteins that are known to promote DSB formation during C. elegans meiosis. The authors examined pairwise interactions using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and co-immunoprecipitation and revealed an interaction between a chromatin-associated protein HIM-17 and a transcription factor XND-1. They further confirmed the previously known interaction between DSB-1 and SPO-11 and showed that DSB-1 also interacts with a nematode-specific HIM-5, which is essential for DSB formation on the X chromosome. They also assessed genetic interactions among these proteins, categorizing them into four epistasis groups by comparing phenotypes in double vs. single mutants. Combining these results, the authors proposed a model of how these proteins interact with chromatin loops and are recruited to chromosome axes, offering insights into the process in C. elegans compared to other organisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This work relies heavily on Y2H, which is notorious for having high rates of false positives and false negatives. Although the interactions between HIM-17 and XND-1 and between DSB-1 and HIM-5 were validated by co-IP, the significance of these interactions was not tested in vivo. Cataloging Y2H and genetic interactions does not yield much more insight. The model proposed in Figure 4 is also highly speculative.</p>

<p>The goal of this work is to understand the regulation of double-strand break formation during meiosis in C. elegans. The authors have analyzed physical and genetic interactions among a subset of factors that have been previously implicated in DSB formation or the number of timing of DSBs: CEP-1, DSB-1, DSB-2, DSB-3, HIM-5, HIM-17, MRE-11, REC-1, PARG-1, and XND-1.</p>
<p>The 10 proteins that are analyzed here include a diverse set of factors with different functions, based on prior analyses in many published studies. The term &quot;Spo11 accessory factors&quot; has been used in the meiosis literature to describe proteins that directly promote Spo11 cleavage activity, rather than factors that are important for the expression of meiotic proteins or that influence the genome-wide distribution or timing of DSBs. Based on this definition, the known SPO-11 accessory factors in C. elegans include DSB-1, DSB-2, DSB-3, and the MRN complex (at least MRE-11 and RAD-50). These are all homologs of proteins that have been studied biochemically and structurally in other organisms. DSB-1 &amp; DSB-2 are homologs of Rec114, while DSB-3 is a homolog of Mei4. Biochemical and structural studies have shown that Rec114 and Mei4 directly modulate Spo11 activity by recruiting Spo11 to chromatin and promoting its dimerization, which is essential for cleavage. The other factors analyzed in this study affect the timing, distribution, or number of RAD-51 foci, but they likely do so indirectly. As elaborated below, XND-1 and HIM-17 are transcription factors that modulate the expression of other meiotic genes, and their role in DSB formation is parsimoniously explained by this regulatory activity. The roles of HIM-5 and REC-1 remain unclear; the reported localization of HIM-5 to autosomes is consistent with a role in transcription (the autosomes are transcriptionally active in the germline, while the X chromosome is largely silent), but its loss-of-function phenotypes are much more limited than those of HIM-17 and XND-1, so it may play a more direct role in DSB formation. The roles of CEP-1 (a Rad53 homolog) and PARG-1 are also ambiguous, but their homologs in other organisms contribute to DNA repair rather than DSB formation.</p>
<p>An additional significant limitation of the study, as stated in my initial review, is that much of the analysis here relies on cytological visualization of RAD-51 foci as a proxy for DSBs. RAD-51 associates transiently with DSB sites as they undergo repair and is thus limited in its ability to reveal details about the timing or abundance of DSBs since its loading and removal involve additional steps that may be influenced by the factors being analyzed.</p>
<p>The paper focuses extensively on HIM-5, which was previously shown through genetic and cytological analysis to be important for breaks on the X chromosome. The revised manuscript still claims that &quot;HIM-5 mediates interactions with the different accessory factors sub-groups, providing insights into how components on the DNA loops may interact with the chromosome axis.&quot; The weak interactions between HIM-5 and DSB-1/2 detected in the Y2H assay do not convincingly support such a role. The idea that HIM-5 directly promotes break formation is also inconsistent with genetic data showing that him-5 mutants lack breaks on the X chromosomes, while HIM-5 has been shown to be is enriched on autosomes. Additionally, as noted in my comment to the authors, the localization data for HIM-5 shown in this paper are discordant with prior studies; this discrepancy should be addressed experimentally.</p>
<p>This paper describes REC-1 and HIM-5 as paralogs, based on prior analysis in a paper that included some of the same authors (Chung et al., 2015; DOI 10.1101/gad.266056.115). In my initial review I mentioned that this earlier conclusion was likely incorrect and should not be propagated uncritically here. Since the authors have rebutted this comment rather than amending it, I feel it is important to explain my concerns about the conclusions of previous study. Chung et al. found a small region of potential homology between the C. elegans rec-1 and him-5 genes and also reported that him-5; rec-1 double mutants have more severe defects than either single mutant, indicative of a stronger reduction in DSBs. Based on these observations and an additional argument based on microsynteny, they concluded that these two genes arose through recent duplication and divergence. However, as they noted, genes resembling rec-1 are absent from all other Caenorhabditis species, even those most closely related to C. elegans. The hypothesis that two genes are paralogs that arose through duplication and divergence is thus based on their presence in a single species, in the absence of extensive homology or evidence for conserved molecular function. Further, the hypothesis that gene duplication and divergence has given rise to two paralogs that share no evident structural similarity or common interaction partners in the few million years since C. elegans diverged from its closest known relatives is implausible. In contrast, DSB-1 and DSB-2 are both homologs of Rec114 that clearly arose through duplication and divergence within the Caenorhabditis lineage, but much earlier than the proposed split between REC-1 and HIM-5. Two genes that can be unambiguously identified as dsb-1 and dsb-2 are present in genomes throughout the Elegans supergroup and absent in the Angaria supergroup, placing the duplication event at around 18-30 MYA, yet DSB-1 and DSB-2 share much greater similarity in their amino acid sequence, predicted structure, and function than HIM-5 and REC-1. Further, Raices place HIM-5 and REC-1 in different functional complexes (Figure 3B).</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that HIM-17 is a transcription factor that regulates many meiotic genes. Like HIM-17, XND-1 is cytologically enriched along the autosomes in germline nuclei, suggestive of a role in transcription. The Reinke lab performed ChIP-seq in a strain expressing an XND-1::GFP fusion protein and showed that it binds to promoter regions, many of which overlap with the HIM-17-regulated promoters characterized by the Ahringer lab (doi: 10.1126/sciadv.abo4082). Work from the Yanowitz lab has shown that XND-1 influences the transcription of many other genes involved in meiosis (doi: 10.1534/g3.116.035725) and work from the Colaiacovo lab has shown that XND-1 regulates the expression of CRA-1 (doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005029). Additionally, loss of HIM-17 or XND-1 causes pleiotropic phenotypes, consistent with a broad role in gene regulation. Collectively, these data indicate that XND-1 and HIM-17 are transcription factors that are important for the proper expression of many germline-expressed genes. Thus, as stated above, the roles of HIM-17 and XND-1 in DSB formation, as well as their effects on histone modification, are parsimoniously explained by their regulation of the expression of factors that contribute more directly to DSB formation and chromatin modification. I feel strongly that transcription factors should not be described as &quot;SPO-11 accessory factors.&quot;</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Meiotic recombination initiates with the formation of DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation, catalyzed by the conserved topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11. Spo11 requires accessory factors that are poorly conserved across eukaryotes. Previous genetic studies have identified several proteins required for DSB formation in C. elegans to varying degrees; however, how these proteins interact with each other to recruit the DSB-forming machinery to chromosome axes remains unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, Raices et al. characterized the biochemical and genetic interactions among proteins that are known to promote DSB formation during C. elegans meiosis. The authors examined pairwise interactions using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and co-immunoprecipitation and revealed an interaction between a chromatin-associated protein HIM-17 and a transcription factor XND-1. They further confirmed the previously known interaction between DSB-1 and SPO-11 and showed that DSB-1 also interacts with a nematodespecific HIM-5, which is essential for DSB formation on the X chromosome. They also assessed genetic interactions among these proteins, categorizing them into four epistasis groups by comparing phenotypes in double vs. single mutants. Combining these results, the authors proposed a model of how these proteins interact with chromatin loops and are recruited to chromosome axes, offering insights into the process in C. elegans compared to other organisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This work relies heavily on Y2H, which is notorious for having high rates of false positives and false negatives. Although the interactions between HIM-17 and XND-1 and between DSB-1 and HIM-5 were validated by co-IP, the significance of these interactions was not tested, and cataloging Y2H interactions does not yield much more insight.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate that the reviewer recognized the value of our IP data, but we beg to differ that we rely too heavily on the Y2H. We also provide genetic analysis on bivalent formation to support the physical interaction data. We do acknowledge that there are caveats with Y2H, however, including that a subset of the interactions can only be examined with proteins in one orientation due to auto-activation. While we acknowledge that it would be nice to have IP data for all of the proteins using CRISPR-tagged, functional alleles, these strains are not all feasible (e.g. no functional rec-1 tag has been made) and are beyond the scope of the current work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, most experiments lack rigor, which raises serious concerns about whether the data convincingly supports the conclusions of this paper. For instance, the XND-1 antibody appears to detect a band in the control IP; however, there was no mention of the specificity of this antibody.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We previously showed the specificity of this antibody in its original publication showing lack of staining in the xnd-1 mutant by IF (Wagner et al., 2010). To further address this, however, we have now included a new supplementary figure (Figure S1) demonstrating the specificity of the XND-1 antibody by Western blot. The antibody detects a distinct band in extracts from wild-type (N2) worms, but this band is absent in two independent xnd-1 mutant strains. This confirms that the antibody specifically recognizes XND-1, supporting the validity of the IP results shown in the main figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, epistasis analysis of various genetic mutants is based on the quantification of DAPI bodies in diakinesis oocytes, but the comparisons were made without statistical analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added statistical analysis to all datasets where quantification was possible, strengthening the rigor and interpretation of our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For cytological data, a single representative nucleus was shown without quantification and rigorous analysis. The rationale for some experiments is also questionable (e.g. the rescue by dsb-2 mutants by him-5 transgenes in Figure 2), making the interpretation of the data unclear. Overall, while this paper claims to present &quot;the first comprehensive model of DSB regulation in a metazoan&quot;, cataloging Y2H and genetic interactions did not yield any new insights into DSB formation without rigorous testing of their significance in vivo. The model proposed in Figure 4 is also highly speculative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the cytology, we provide new images and quantification of HIM-17 and XND-1 overlap with the DNA axes. We also added full germ line images showing HIM-5 localization in wild type and dsb-1 mutants, to provide a more complete and representative view of the observed phenotype. To further support our findings, we’ve also included images demonstrating that this phenotype is consistently observed with both in live worm with the the him-5::GFP transgene and in fixed worms with an endogenously tagged version of HIM-5.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>During meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms, double-strand breaks are induced by a topoisomerase-related enzyme, Spo11, which is essential for homologous recombination, which in turn is required for accurate chromosome segregation. Additional factors control the number and genome-wide distribution of breaks, but the mechanisms that determine both the frequency and preferred location of meiotic DSBs remain only partially understood in any organism.</p>
<p>The manuscript presents a variety of different analyses that include variable subsets of putative DSB factors. It would be much easier to follow if the analyses had been more systematically applied. It is perplexing that several factors known to be essential for DSB formation (e.g., cohesins, HORMA proteins) are excluded from this analysis, while it includes several others that probably do not directly contribute to DSB formation (XND-1, HIM-17, CEP-1, and PARG-1).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s statement regarding the selection of factors included in our analysis. In this work, our focus was specifically on SPO-11 accessory factors — proteins that directly interact with or regulate SPO-11 activity during doublestrand break formation. Cohesins and chromosome axis proteins (such as the HORMA domain proteins) are essential for establishing the correct chromosome architecture that supports DSB formation, but there is no evidence that they are direct accessory factors of SPO-11. Therefore, they were intentionally excluded from this study to maintain a clear and focused scope on proteins that more directly modulate SPO-11 function.</p>
<p>Conversely, XND-1, HIM-17, CEP-1, and PARG-1 have all been implicated in regulating aspects of SPO-11-mediated DSB formation or its immediate environment. Although their contributions mayinvolve broader chromatin or DNA damage response regulation, prior literature supports their inclusion as relevant modulators of SPO-11 activity, justifying their analysis within the context of this work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The strongest claims seem to be that &quot;HIM-5 is the determinant of X-chromosome-specific crossovers&quot; and &quot;HIM-5 coordinates the actions of the different accessory factors subgroups.&quot; Prior work had already shown that mutations in him-5 preferentially reduce meiotic DSBs on the X chromosome. While it is possible that HIM-5 plays a direct role in DSB induction on the X chromosome, the evidence presented here does not strongly support this conclusion. It is also difficult to reconcile this idea with evidence from prior studies that him-5 mutations predominantly prevent DSB formation on the sex chromosomes, while the protein localizes to autosomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>HIM-5 is not the only protein that is autosomally enriched but preferentially affects the X chromosome: MES-4 and MRG-1 are both autosomally-enriched but influence silencing of the X chromosome. While HIM-5 appears autosomally-enriched, it does not appear to be autosomal-exclusive. While we would ideally perform ChIP to determine its localization on chromatin, this method for assaying DSB sites is likely insufficient to identify DSB sites which differ in each nucleus and for which there are no known hotspots in the worm.</p>
<p>him-5 mutants confer an ~50% reduction in total number of breaks and a very profound change in break dynamics (seen by RAD-51 foci (Meneely et al., 2012)). Since the autosomes receives sufficient breaks in this context to attain a crossover in &gt;98% of nuclei, this indicates that the autosomes are much less profoundly impacted by loss of DSB functions than is the X chromosome. Indeed, prior data from co-author, Monica Colaiacovo, showed that fewer breaks occur on the X (Gao, 2015) likely resulting from differences in the chromatin composition of the X and autosome resulting from X chromosome silencing.</p>
<p>The conclusion that HIM-5 must be required for breaks on the X comes from the examination of DSB levels and their localization in different mutants that impair but do not completely abrogate breaks. In any situation where HIM-5 protein expression is affected (xnd-1, him-17, and him-5 null alleles), breaks on the X are reduced/ eliminated. By contrast, in dsb-2 mutants, where HIM-5 expression is unaffected, both X and autosomal breaks are impacted equally. As discussed above, in the absence of HIM-5 function, there are ~15 breaks/ nucleus. The Ppie1::him-5 transgene is expressed to lower levels than Phim-5::him-5, but in the best case, the ectopic expression of this protein should give a maximum of ~15 breaks (the total # of breaks is thought to be ~30/nucleus). By these estimates, Ppie-1::him-5; him-17 and him-5 null mutants have the same number of breaks. Yet, in the former case, breaks occur on the X; whereas in the latter they do not. The best explanation for this discrepancy is that HIM-5 is sufficient to recruits the DSB machinery to the X chromosome.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The one experiment that seems to elicit the conclusion that HIM-5 expression is sufficient for breaks on the X chromosome is flawed (see below). The conclusion that HIM-5 &quot;coordinates the activities of the different accessory sub-groups&quot; is not supported by data presented here or elsewhere.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have reorganized the discussion to more directly address the reviewers’ concerns. We raise the possibility that HIM-5 has an important role in bringing together the SPO-11 and its interacting components (DSB-1/2/3) with the other DSB inducing factors, including those factors that regulating DSB timing (XND-1), coordination with the cell cycle (REC-1), association with the chromosome axis (PARG-1, MRE-11), and coupling to downstream resection and repair (MRE-11, CEP-1).</p>
<p>This raises a natural question: if HIM-5 has such a central role, why are the phenotypes of HIM-5 so mild? We propose that while the loss of DSBs on the X appears mild, more profound effects are seen in the total number, timing, and placement of the DSBs across the genome- all of which are diminished or altered in the absence of HIM-5. The phenotypes of him-5 loss reminiscent of those observed in Prdm9-/- in mice where breaks are relocated to transcriptional start sites and show significant delay in formation. As with PRDM9, the comparatively subtle phenotypes of HIM-5 loss do not diminish its critical role in promoting proper DSB formation in most mammals.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Like most other studies that have examined DSB formation in C. elegans, this work relies on indirect assays, here limited to the cytological appearance of RAD-51 foci and bivalent chromosomes, as evidence of break formation or lack thereof. Unfortunately, neither of these assays has the power to reveal the genome-wide distribution or number of breaks. These assays have additional caveats, due to the fact that RAD-51 association with recombination intermediates and successful crossover formation both require multiple steps downstream of DSB induction, some of which are likely impaired in some of the mutants analyzed here. This severely limits the conclusions that can be drawn. Given that the goal of the work is to understand the effects of individual factors on DSB induction, direct physical assays for DSBs should be applied; many such assays have been developed and used successfully in other organisms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful comments. We agree that RAD-51 foci are an indirect readout of DSB formation and that their dynamics can be influenced by defects in downstream repair processes. However, in C. elegans, the available methods for directly detecting DSBs are limited. Unlike other organisms, C. elegans lacks γH2AX, eliminating the possibility of using γH2AX as a DSB marker. TUNEL assays, while conceptually appealing, have proven unreliable and poorly reproducible in the germline context. Similarly, RPA foci do not consistently correlate with the number of DSBs and are influenced by additional processing steps.</p>
<p>Given these limitations, RAD-51 foci remain the most widely accepted surrogate for monitoring DSB formation in C. elegans. While we fully acknowledge the caveats associated with this approach — particularly the potential effects of downstream repair defects — RAD-51 analysis continues to provide valuable insight into DSB dynamics and regulation, especially when interpreted in combination with other phenotypic assessments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Throughout the manuscript, the writing conflates the roles played by different factors that affect DSB formation in very different ways. XND-1 and HIM-17 have previously been shown to be transcription factors that promote the expression of many germline genes, including genes encoding proteins that directly promote DSBs. Mutations in either xnd-1 or him-17 result in dysregulation of germline gene expression and pleiotropic defects in meiosis and fertility, including changes in chromatin structure, dysregulation of meiotic progression, and (for xnd-1) progressive loss of germline immortality. It is thus misleading to refer to HIM-17 and XND-1 as DSB &quot;accessory factors&quot; or to lump their activities with those of other proteins that are likely to play more direct roles in DSB induction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is clear that we will not reach agreement about the direct vs indirect roles here of chromatin remodelers/transcription factors in break formation. In yeast, there is a precedent for SPP1 and in mouse for Prdm9, both of which could be described as transcription factors as well, as having roles in break formation by creating an open chromatin environment for the break machinery. We envision that these proteins function in the same fashion. The changes in histone acetylation in the xnd-1 mutants supports such a claim.</p>
<p>We do not know what the reviewer is referring to in statement that “XND-1 and HIM-17 have previously been shown to be transcription factors that promote the expression of many germline genes.” While the Carelli et al paper indeed shows a role for HIM-17 in expression of many germline genes, there is only one reference to XND-1 in this manuscript (Figure S3A) which shows that half of XND-1 binding sites overlap with the co-opted germline promoters. There is no transcriptional data at all on xnd-1 mutants, save our studies (referenced herein) that XND-1 regulates him-5 expression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For example, statements such as the following sentence in the Introduction should be omitted or explained more clearly: &quot;xnd-1 is also unique among the accessory factors in influencing the timing of DSBs; in the absence of xnd-1, there is precocious and rapid accumulation of DSBs as monitored by the accumulation of the HR strand-exchange protein RAD-51.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not sure what is confusing here. The distribution of RAD-51 foci is significantly altered in xnd-1 mutants and peak levels of breaks are achieved as nuclei leave the transition zone (Wagner et al., 2010; McClendon et al., 2016). There is no other mutation that causes this type of change in RAD-51 distribution.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;The evidence that HIM-17 promotes the expression of him-5 presented here corroborates data from other publications, notably the recent work of Carelli et al. (2022), but this conclusion should not be presented as novel here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified this in the text. We note that this paper showed alterations in him-5 levels by RNA-Seq but they did not validate these results with quantitative RT-PCR. Thus, our studies do provide an important validation of their prior results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The other factors also fall into several different functional classes, some of which are relatively well understood, based largely on studies in other organisms. The roles of RAD50 and MRE-11 in DSB induction have been investigated in yeast and other organisms as well as in several prior studies in C. elegans. DSB-1, DSB-2, and DSB-3 are homologs of relatively well-studied meiotic proteins in other organisms (Rec114 and Mei4) that directly promote the activity of Spo11, although the mechanism by which they do so is still unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Whilst we agree that we understand some of the functions of the homologs, there are clearly examples in other processes of conserved proteins adopting unique regulatory function. We should not presume evolutionary conservation until proven. Indeed the comparison between the Mer2 proteins becomes particularly relevant here. For example, the RMM complex in plants does not contain PRD3, although this protein is thought to have function in DSB formation and repair (Lambing et al, 2022; Vrielynck et al., 2021; Thangavel et al., 2023). In Sordaria, as well, the Mer2 homolog has distinct functions (Tesse et al., 2017).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Mutations in PARG-1 (a Poly-ADP ribose glycohydrolase) likely affect the regulation of polyADP-ribose addition and removal at sites of DSBs, which in turn are thought to regulate chromatin structure and recruitment of repair factors; however, there is no convincing evidence that PARG-1 directly affects break formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our prior collaborative studies on PARG-1 showed that is has a non-catalytic function that promote DSBs that is independent of accumulation of PAR (Janisiw et al., 2020; Trivedi et al., 2022)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>CEP-1 is a homolog of p53 and is involved in the DNA damage response in the germline, but again is unlikely to directly contribute to DSB induction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s statement. While CEP-1 is indeed a homolog of p53 and plays a major role in the DNA damage response, prior work from Brent Derry’s lab and from our group (Mateo et al., 2016) demonstrated that specific cep-1 separationof-function alleles affect DSB induction and/or repair pathway choice independently of canonical DNA damage checkpoint activation. In particular, defects in DSB formation observed in certain cep-1 mutants can be rescued by exogenous irradiation, supporting a direct or closely linked role in promoting DSB formation rather than merely responding to damage. Thus, based on these functional data, we considered CEP-1 a relevant factor to include in our analysis. We have now clarified this rationale in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>HIM-5 and REC-1 do not have apparent homologs in other organisms and play poorly understood roles in promoting DSB induction. A mechanistic understanding of their functions would be of value to the field, but the current work does not shed light on this. A previous paper (Chung et al. G&amp;D 2015) concluded that HIM-5 and REC-1 are paralogs arising from a recent gene duplication, based on genetic evidence for a partially overlapping role in DSB induction, as well as an argument based on the genomic location of these genes in different species; however, these proteins lack any detectable sequence homology and their predicted structures are also dissimilar (both are largely unstructured but REC-1 contains a predicted helical bundle lacking in HIM-5). Moreover, the data presented here do not reveal overlapping sets of genetic or physical interactions for the two genes/proteins. Thus, this earlier conclusion was likely incorrect, and this idea should not be restated uncritically here or used as a basis to interpret phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Actually, there is quite good bioinformatic analysis that the rec-1 and him-5 loci evolved from a gene duplication and that each share features of the ancestral protein (Chung et al., 2015). We are sorry if the reviewer casts aspersions on the prior literature and analyses. The homology between these genes with the ancestral protein is near the same degree as dsb-1, dsb-2, or dsb-3 to their ancestral homologs (&lt;17%).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>DSB-1 was previously reported to be strictly required for all DSB and CO formation in C. elegans. Here the authors test whether the expression of HIM-5 from the pie-1 promoter can rescue DSB formation in dsb-1 mutants, and claim to see some rescue, based on an increase in the number of nuclei with one apparent bivalent (Figure 2C). This result seems to be the basis for the claim that HIM-5 coordinates the activities of other DSB proteins. However, this assay is not informative, and the conclusion is almost certainly incorrect. Notably, a substantial number of nuclei in the dsb-1 mutant (without Ppie-1::him-5) are reported as displaying a single bivalent (11 DAPI staining bodies) despite prior evidence that DSBs are absent in dsb-1 mutants; this suggests that the way the assay was performed resulted in false positives (bivalents that are not actually bivalents), likely due to inclusion of nuclei in which univalents could not be unambiguously resolved in the microscope. A slightly higher level of nuclei with a single unresolved pair of chromosomes in the dsb-1; Ppie-1::him-5 strain is thus not convincing evidence for rescue of DSBs/CO formation, and no evidence is presented that these putative COs are X-specific. The authors should provide additional experimental evidence - e.g., detection of RAD-51 and/or COSA-1 foci or genetic evidence of recombination - or remove this claim. The evidence that expression of Ppie-1::him-5 may partially rescue DSB abundance in dsb-2 mutants is hard to interpret since it is currently unknown why C. elegans expresses 2 paralogs of Rec114 (DSB-1 and DSB-2), and the age-dependent reduction of DSBs in dsb-2 mutants is not understood.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have removed this claim in part because we have been unable to create the triple mutants strains to analyze COSA-1 foci.</p>
<p>To the point about 11 vs 12 DAPI bodies: the literature is actually replete with examples of 11 DAPI bodies vs 12 in mutants with no breaks:</p>
<p>Hinman al., 2021: null allele of dsb-3 has an average of 11.6 +/- 0.6 breaks;</p>
<p>Stamper et al, 2013, show just over 60% of dsb-1 nuclei with 12 DAPI bodies and 5-10% with 10 DAPI bodies. (Figure 1);</p>
<p>In addition, we also previously showed (Machovina et al., 2016) that a subset of meiotic nuclei have a single RAD-51 focus and can achieve a crossover. RAD-51 foci in spo-11 were also reported in Colaiacovo et al., 2003.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Several of the factors analyzed here, including XND-1, HIM-17, HIM-5, DSB-1, DSB-2, and DSB-3, have been shown to localize broadly to chromatin in meiotic cells. Coimmunoprecipitation of pairs of these factors, even following benzonase digestion, is not strong evidence to support a direct physical interaction between proteins.</p>
<p>Similarly, the super-resolution analysis of XND-1 and HIM-17 (Figure 1EF) does not reveal whether these proteins physically interact with each other, and does not add to our understanding of these proteins functions, since they are already known to bind to many of the same promoters. Promoters are also likely to be located in chromatin loops away from the chromosome axis, so in this respect, the localization data are also confirmatory rather than novel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the binding to promoters would be expected to be on DNA loops, that has not been definitively shown in the worm germ line. The supplemental data of the Carelli paper suggests that there are ~250 binding sites for each protein at these coopted promoters. This could not account for crossover map seen in C. elegans.</p>
<p>The reviewer states correct that we do not reveal that these proteins interact, but we have shown that the two proteins co-IP and have a Y2H interaction. This interaction is supporedt by a recent publication (Blazickova et al., 2025) corroborating this conclusion and identifies XND-1 in HIM-17 co-IPs also in the presence of benzonase. We do now show, however, by immuno-localization that the two proteins appear to be adjacent, but nonoverlapping. As now described in the text, AlphaFold 3 modeling and structural analysis suggests that the two proteins do interact directly and that the tagged 5’ end of HIM-17 used in our studies is likely to be at least 200nm from the putative XND-1 binding interface, a distance that is consistent with our confocal images showing frequent juxtaposition of the two proteins.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The phenotypic analysis of double mutant combinations does not seem informative. A major problem is that these different strains were only assayed for bivalent formation, which (as mentioned above) requires several steps downstream of DSB induction. Additionally, the basis for many of the single mutant phenotypes is not well understood, making it particularly challenging to interpret the effects of double mutants. Further, some of the interactions described as &quot;synergistic&quot; appear to be additive, not synergistic. While additive effects can be used as evidence that two genes work in different pathways, this can also be very misleading, especially when the function of individual proteins is unknown. I find that the classification of genes into &quot;epistastasis groups&quot; based on this analysis does not shed light on their functions and indeed seems in some cases to contradict what is known about their functions. ‘</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described above, each of the proteins analyzed is thought to have a direct role in regulating meiotic DSB formation and single mutant phenotypes are consistent with this interpretation. In almost all-if not all- of these cases, IR induced breaks suppress univalent phenotypes (or uncover a downstream repair defect (e.g. in mre-11)) supporting this conclusion. We have changed the terminology from “epistasis groups” since this is not strict epistasis, but rather, “functional groups”.</p>

<p>The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) data are only presented as a single colony. While it is understandable to use a 'representative' colony, it is ideal to include a dilution series for the various interactions, which is how Y2H data are typically shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Y2H data are presented as spots on a plate and are from three to four individual transformants per interaction tested, and are not individual colonies. The experiment was repeated in triplicate from different transformations. We have now made this clearer in the materials and methods section. This approach has been successfully used to examine protein interactions in our prior manuscripts of yeast and human proteins [Gaines et al (2015) Nat.

<p>Additional (relatively minor) concerns about these data:</p>
<p>(1) Several interactions reported here seem to be detected in only one direction - e.g., MRE-11-AD/HIM-5-BD, REC-1-AD/XND-1-BD, and XND-1-AD/HIM-17-BD - while no interactions are seen with the reciprocal pairs of fusion proteins. I'm not sure if some of this is due to pasting &quot;positive&quot; colony images into the wrong position in the grid, but this should be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The asymmetry in the interactions observed is due to the well-known phenomenon in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays where certain plasmids exhibit self-activation when fused in one orientation, making interpretation of reciprocal interactions challenging. In our experiment, some of the plasmids indeed showed self-activation in one direction, which likely accounts for the lack of interaction seen with the reciprocal pairs of fusion proteins. We have clarified this point in the Methods.</p>

<p>I have a general issue with the use of the term epistasis - this is used to order gene function based on different mutant phenotypes, usually with null alleles. While I think the authors have valid points with how they group the different SPO-11 accessory proteins, I do not think they should use the word epistasis, but rather genetic interactions.</p>

<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1B- The signal for XND-1 seems to appear both in the control and him-17::HA IP. Do the authors have tested the specificity of the XND-1 antibody?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We included a supplementary figure demonstrating the specificity of the XND-1 antibody by Western blot. This was also previously published (Wagner et al., 2010)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 1D - can the authors provide an explanation why the him-5p::him-5 transgene that drives a higher expression than pie-1p::him-5 fails to suppress the Him phenotype seen in him-17? What are the HIM-5 levels like in these two strains compared to N2 and him-17 null mutants? Can this information provide explanation for the differential effect of the him-5 transgenes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We previously reported that him-5p::him-5 drives higher expression than pie-1p::him-5 (McClendon et al, 2016).</p>
<p>The reason that him-5p::him-5 does not rescue, despite higher wild type expression is that HIM-17 directly regulates expression of him-5. Since HIM-17 does not regulate the pie-1 promoter, the pie-1p::him-5 construct can at least partially suppress the him-17 mutation.</p>
<p>We have (hopefully) explained this better in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 102- the subheading &quot;HIM-5 is the essential factor for meiotic breaks in the Xchromosome&quot; may not be appropriate for this section. This is what has previously been known. However, the results in Figure 1 demonstrate that a him-5 transgene can partially rescue the him-17 and ¬xnd-1 phenotype, but not that it is essential for meiotic DSB formation on X chromosomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think some of the concern here is sematic and have changed the phraseology to say that HIM-5 is SUFFICIENT for DSBs on the X… which had not previously been shown.</p>
<p>Vis-à-vis the X chromosome, in all genetic backgrounds examined, the absence of HIM-5 consistently results in a complete lack of DSBs on the X. For instance, in dsb-2 mutants— where HIM-5 is still expressed—DSBs are reduced genome-wide, but the X chromosome occasionally retains breaks. In contrast, even a weak allele of him-17 results specifically in the loss of X chromosome breaks, underscoring a unique requirement for HIM-5 in promoting DSBs on the X. While Figure 1 shows that a him-5 transgene can partially rescue him-17 and xnd-1 phenotypes, the consistent observation that X breaks are absent without HIM-5 supports its classification as sufficient for DSB formation on the X chromosome.</p>

<p>(5) Line 162 - This is the first mention of DSB-1, DSB-2, and DSB-3 in the paper. DSB-1 and DSB-2 are Rec114 homologs in C. elegans (Tesse et al., 2017), while DSB-3 is a homolog of Mei4 (Hinman et al., 2021). These proteins should be properly introduced in the introduction with appropriate citations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Done. We appreciate the reviewer pointing out that this was the first reference to these genes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Line 169 - the rationale for this experiment is unclear. Why did the Y2H interaction between HIM-5 and DSB-1 prompt the authors to test the rescue of dsb-1 or dsb-2 phenotypes by the ectopic expression of him-5? Do the authors have evidence that HIM-5 level is reduced in dsb-1 or dsb-2 mutants?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have reorganized this section to better explain the motivation for looking at these interactions. We did see a difference in the localization in HIM-5 in the dsb-1 mutant animals and we did have a sense that HIM-5 was critical for breaks on the X. We reasoned that it could have independent functions in promoting breaks that were not yet appreciated so wanted to do this experiment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Line 172 - &quot;very slightly reduced&quot;. This claim requires statistical analysis.</p>

<p>We added statistical analysis, but we also removed this claim.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Figures 2C and 2D - Can the authors provide an explanation why the pie-1p::him-5 transgene fails to suppress the phenotypes in dsb-1, while the him-5p::him-5 trasgene can? Again, the rationale for these experiments is unclear. Because of this, the interpretation is also unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The difference in rescue between the pie-1p::him-5 and him-5p::him-5 transgenes likely reflects differences in expression levels. As previously shown (McClendon et al., 2016), the him-5p::him-5 construct results in significantly higher expression of HIM-5 protein compared to pie-1p::him-5. This elevated expression likely explains its ability to partially rescue the dsb-1 phenotype. In contrast, the lower expression driven by the pie-1 promoter is insufficient to compensate for the absence of dsb-1 function. We have clarified the rationale and interpretation of these experiments in the revised manuscript to better reflect this point.</p>

<p>(9) Lines 184-185 - the data for endogenously tagged HIM-5::3xHA are not shown anywhere in the paper. This must be shown.</p>

<p>(10) Figure 2D and 2E - what does the localization of pie-1p::him-5::GFP (eaIs15) and him5p::him-5::GFP (eaIs4) look like in wild-type and dsb-1 mutants? Are the cytoplasmic aggregates caused by increased levels of HIM-5 expression? Can the differential behavior of him-5 transgenes provide explanation for differential rescues?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now show both live and fixed images of Phim-5::him-5::gfp transgenes, as well as the localization of the endogenously HA-tagged HIM-5 locus (Figure 2 and S3). In all cases, the protein is initially nuclear and then absent from meiotic nuclei with similar timing. The Ppie1::him-5 transgene was very difficult to image due to low expression (even in wild type) so it not shown here. We presume it is the slightly elevated level of expression of the Phim5::him-5::gfp that can explain the differential rescue.</p>

<p>This is an excellent suggestion and not one we have not yet pursued. Given the lack of strong phenotypes in all combination of double mutants, we prioritized other experiments .

<p>(14) Line 298 - I suggest the authors take a look at the Alphafold prediction of DSB-1/DSB-2/DSB-3 and the comparison to human and budding yeast Rec114/Mei4 complex in Guo et al., 2022 eLife, which could provide insights into the Y2H results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and have indeed used these interactions and predicted homologies to zero in a region of interaction between these proteins that resembles what is seen in humans and yeast with a dimer of REC114 like proteins wraps stabilizing a central Mei4 helix . This is now shown in Figure 3H, I. Satisfyingly, this modeling predicts that a trimer comprised of 2 DSB-1 proteins with DSB-3 is more stable than a DSB1-DSB-2-DSB-3 trimer. This might explain why DSB-2 is not required in young adults and only becomes essential as DSB-1 levels drop in older animals (Rosu et al., 2013)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(15) Can the authors introduce mutations within the DSB-1 interfaces that disrupt the interaction to either SPO-11 or DSB-2?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have begun to address this question by introducing targeted mutations within DSB-1. As shown in Figure 3E and 3F, mutations in the C-terminal region of DSB-1—which includes a core of four α-helices—disrupt its interaction with DSB-2 and DSB-3, but not with SPO-11. These findings suggest that the C-terminus mediates interactions specifically with DSB2 and DSB-3</p>

<p>(16) Line 323 - The him-5 phenotypes are too weak to support the idea that it serves as the linchpin for the whole DSB complex. Do the authors have an explanation for why him-5 mutants exhibit X-chromosome-specific DSB defects?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to the reviewer, above, and in the text, we have included a more detailed explanation of why we think HIM-5 has a key role in coordinating meiotic break formation. Although, identified for its role on the X, the phenotypes associated with DSB formation in the mutant are really quite pleiotropic and severe.</p>

<p>ND does mean not determined. We have removed the statement about “minor suppression”. We only tested the overall population dynamics in the Phim-5::him-5;him17(ok424) and the DAPI body counts.

The X is heterochromatic and chromatin marks associated with active transcription, including H3K4me3 and HTZ-1 (a variant H2A), preferentially localize to autosomes, effectively anti-marking the X chromosome. As shown in the new Figure 1E, a single chromosome has very little XND-1 and HIM-17 associated proteins. This is the X chromosome.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>In my view, the most interesting mechanistic finding in the paper is the evidence that HIM-5 may not bind to chromatin in the absence of DSB-1. If validated, this would suggest that HIM-5 is likely to be directly involved in a process that promotes break formation, in contrast to factors such as HIM-17 and XND-1. It does not, however, support the idea that HIM-5 is at the top of a hierarchy of DSB factors, as it is interpreted here. More importantly, the data supporting this claim are unconvincing; only a single image of an unfixed gonad from an animal expressing HIM-5::GFP is shown. Immunofluorescence should be performed and the results must be quantified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have provided additional images of the HIM-5 relocalization to show that we observed this in both fixed and live worms with two different tagged strains. The exclusion from the nucleus is seen in all scenarios. Whether the protein now accumulates exclusively in the cytoplasm/ is destabilized is challenging to address with the fixed images due to the arbitrariness of defining “background” staining.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>More generally, this type of analysis, looking at the interdependence of different factors for their association with chromosomes, is much more informative than the genetic interaction data presented in the paper, which does not seem to provide any mechanistic insights into the functions of the factors analyzed. The paper could potentially be greatly improved through a more extensive, systematic analysis of the interdependence of DSBpromoting factors for their localization to chromosomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have at least added this for XND-1 and HIM-17 and show they are not interdependent for chromosome association. We also provide for the first time data on the localization of HIM-5 in the dsb-1 mutant. Many of the other interactions have already been shown in the literature and/or were not warranted base on the lack of genetic interaction we present here.</p>

<p>The authors claim that the expression of HIM-5 from a different promoter (Ppie-1::him-5) but not its endogenous promoter (Phim-5::him-5) can partially rescue the DSB defect in him-17 mutants.

<p>The basis of the following statement is unclear: &quot;Furthermore, rec-1;him-5 double mutants give an age-dependent severe loss of DSBs (like dsb-2 mutants) suggesting that the ancestral function of the protein may have a more profound effect on break formation.&quot; The manuscript does not seem to include data regarding age-dependent loss of DSBs and no other publication is cited to support this claim. The interpretation is also perplexing; I think that it may be predicated on the idea that REC-1 and HIM-5 are paralogs, but as stated above, this claim is not well supported and is likely specious.</p>
