<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries. There is growing evidence that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and disruption of microbiota-host interactions contribute to the pathology of NAFLD. We previously demonstrated that gut microbiota derived tryptophan metabolite indole-3-acetate (I3A) was decreased in both cecum and liver of high-fat diet-fed mice and attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and TNF-a and fatty acid induced inflammatory responses in an aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) dependent manner in hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the effect of orally administered I3A in a mouse model of diet induced NAFLD. Western diet (WD)-fed mice given sugar water (SW) with I3A showed dramatically decreased serum ALT, hepatic TG, liver steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation, and hepatic production of inflammatory cytokines, compared to WD-fed mice given only SW. Metagenomic analysis show that I3A administration did not significantly modify the intestinal microbiome, suggesting that I3A’s beneficial effects likely reflect the metabolite’s direct actions on the liver. Administration of I3A partially reversed WD induced alterations of liver metabolome and proteome, notably, decreasing expression of several enzymes in hepatic lipogenesis and β- oxidation. Mechanistically, we also show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of I3A in macrophages. The potency of I3A in alleviating liver steatosis and inflammation clearly demonstrates its potential as a therapeutic modality for preventing the progression of steatosis to NASH.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries, with a prevalence rate of 21-25% in North American and Europe <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. It is a multi-stage disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> that can progress from liver steatosis (characterized by macrovesicular fat deposition), which is benign and reversible <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, to more severe forms of the disease such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. Approximately 25% of individuals having liver steatosis develop NASH, which is characterized by liver inflammation, dysregulated lipid metabolism, and cell damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. A subset of NASH patients develops cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of NAFLD, factors leading to the progression from steatosis to NASH remain poorly understood, and there are currently no pharmacological treatments available for NASH.</p>
<p>There is growing evidence that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and disruption of microbiota-host interactions contribute to the pathology of NASH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Certain shifts in the intestinal microbiota community composition, e.g., expansion of the phyla <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> and <italic>Proteobacteria,</italic> correlate with NASH in both human and animal studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. One potential mechanism linking intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and NASH is compromised intestinal barrier integrity, which promotes the translocation of bacterial products from the lumen to circulation. This can contribute directly and indirectly (through intestinal inflammation) to liver inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Additionally, microbial dysbiosis alters the balance of bioactive metabolites produced by gut bacteria such as bile acids, short chain fatty acids and aromatic amino acid derivatives, which have been shown to impact liver metabolism and inflammation in NAFLD through host receptor mediated pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In our previous study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, we demonstrated that gut microbiota derived tryptophan metabolites indole-3-acetate (I3A) and tryptamine (TA) were decreased in both cecum and liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice compared to low-fat diet (LFD)-fed control mice. <italic>In vitro</italic>, both I3A and TA attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines (<italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il-1β</italic> and <italic>Mcp-1</italic>) in macrophages exposed to palmitate and LPS. In hepatocytes, I3A significantly attenuated TNF-α and fatty acid induced inflammatory responses in an aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) dependent manner. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that I3A could protect against NAFLD progression <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that supplementation of I3A in drinking water alleviates liver steatosis and inflammation even when mice are continued on the NAFLD inducing diet, and that these effects correlate with a decrease in both lipogenesis and β-oxidation in the liver. We also demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory effects of I3A in macrophages can be mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).</p>

<title>Oral administration of I3A alleviates diet induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation</title>
<p>We utilized a mouse model of diet-induced fatty liver disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> to investigate the effect of I3A administration through drinking water (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>) on liver steatosis and inflammation. Similar to our previous finding in HFD fed mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, the levels of I3A were significantly reduced in fecal material (50% and 64% decrease at week 8 and 16, respectively) and the liver (70% decrease at week 16) of Western diet (WD) fed mice compared to control mice (CN) fed a low-fat diet (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>,<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). Mice that were given WD and sugar water (SW) containing I3A showed increased I3A levels in fecal material, the liver and serum compared to mice given the same WD and SW without I3A (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>,<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Next, we sought to determine if the I3A administration impacted WD induced features of NAFLD. Compared to CN, WD fed mice had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, indicating liver injury. Treatment of WD fed mice with the high dose of I3A (WD-100) significantly reduced serum ALT levels two weeks after beginning the I3A treatment (week 10, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) and beyond. Additionally, I3A treatment reduced liver TG in a dose-dependent manner at week 16 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Scoring of H&amp;E- stained liver sections indicated that the I3A treatment improved liver steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and lobular inflammation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Treatment with I3A didn’t alter weight increase nor food intake compared to WD fed mice (Fig. S1D).</p>

<p>We also investigated whether I3A treatment modulated the levels of inflammatory cytokines in WD-fed mice. All pro-inflammatory cytokines in the panel (e.g., <italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il-6, Mcp-1</italic>) were significantly elevated in livers of WD mice compared to CN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). Treatment with I3A reduced the expression of these cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, WD upregulated IL-10, considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and I3A treatment downregulated this cytokine (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that I3A, provided via drinking water, attenuates diet-induced hepatic steatosis, cellular injury, and inflammation in mice.</p>

<title>I3A reverses diet induced alterations in liver bile acids and free fatty acids</title>
<p>Studies in mice and humans showed that NAFLD is associated with alterations in liver bile acids. Previously, we found that the ratio of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to cholic acid (CD) greatly decreased when HepG12 and AML12 cells were treated with I3A, indicating that I3A can directly alter host cell bile acid metabolism <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In the present study, mice in the WD group showed reduced liver total bile acids and CDCA-derived bile acids compared to CN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Treatment with I3A led to a further decrease in the CDCA-derived bile acids, consistent with our previous observation of I3A’s effect on hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also measured the concentrations of nine major free fatty acids (FFAs, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). In the liver, WD significantly increased the total concentration of these FFAs by 2.7-fold compared to CN (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). Treatment with I3A had no significant effect, although the total FFA concentration trended lower in the WD-100 group (36% reduction, <italic>p</italic> = 0.11, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). The total FFA concentrations in serum were similar across all four groups (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>I3A administration does not significantly alter the fecal microbial community as well as fecal metabolome</title>
<p>Next, we investigated whether the hepatoprotective effects of I3A were due to a modification of the gut microbiome. The fecal microbial communities at week 8 of WD (prior to I3A treatment) and week 16 (at termination) were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal microbiome of WD fed mice showed reduced α-diversity compared to CN, which was not further altered upon I3A treatment (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). Similarity analysis using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric showed that the microbiome compositions of CN and WD-fed mice were significantly different (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). The fecal microbiome compositions of WD-fed mice did not change significantly upon I3A treatment (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). Analysis of fecal microbiota taxonomic profiles at the phylum and genus level (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3D</xref>) showed major shifts in bacterial abundance of fecal microbiota from WD-fed mice relative to CN. At week 16, the relative abundance of phylum <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> increased, whereas <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> decreased. LEfSe detected 18 taxa showing significant differences in relative abundance between the WD group and CN, including an expansion of the genus <italic>Akkermansia</italic> and reduction of family <italic>Muribaculaceae</italic>. In contrast, only 3 genera showed significant shifts in WD fed mice upon I3A treatment (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E</xref>).</p>
<p>We also investigated whether administration of I3A altered the metabolic profile of the gut microbiota. Principal component analysis (PCA) of untargeted LC-MS data showed that the fecal metabolome of WD fed mice was significantly different from CN, whereas the metabolomes of WD-100 and WD groups largely overlapped (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). Although permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) suggested a modest difference in the variance of metabolite levels between WD-50 and WD groups, Hotelling’s T<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> test found that the means (centroids) were not significantly different. Clustering analysis using the k-means showed that fecal metabolites could be assigned into 4 groups (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>). We did not observe any clusters that showed a reversal of WD induced changes in fecal metabolome by I3A treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that treatment with I3A had minimal effects on the fecal microbiota composition and metabolome of WD fed mice.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>High-dose I3A administration partially reverses diet induced metabolome alterations in the liver</title>
<p>We next investigated the impact of I3A treatment on the liver metabolome using untargeted LC-MS. Projections of all annotated features onto latent variables from PLS-DA showed that the liver metabolome of WD-fed mice was significantly different from CN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The low dose I3A (WD-50) group completely overlapped with the WD group, whereas the high dose (WD-100) group was significantly different from both WD and CN groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). To further determine if the high dose of I3A was able to reverse the diet-induced alterations in liver metabolome, we performed a clustering analysis on all 30 annotated features that were significantly (FDR&lt;0.1) different in WD mice compared to CN. This analysis placed the significant features into 4 groups. Group 1 comprised metabolites that were further increased or depleted by the high dose of I3A, whereas groups 3 and 4 comprised metabolites having WD-induced changes that were reversed by I3A treatment (except for vigabatrin) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Enrichment analysis based on KEGG pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) showed that nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis were significantly altered by WD (CN vs WD), which were reversed by the high dose I3A treatment (WD vs WD-100).</p>

</fig>
<p>Because nicotinamide and nicotinate are products of tryptophan metabolism, we manually integrated the peak areas for all features we identified as tryptophan metabolites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). This added formylkynurenine, kynurenic acid and xanthurenic acid to the list of annotated metabolites comprising the kynurenine branch of tryptophan metabolism. The high dose of I3A restored WD-induced depletion of metabolites in the upper kynurenine branch, and ameliorated WD induced increases in niacin and nicotinamide in the lower branch. These effects were dose dependent, as they were not present in the WD-50 group.</p>
<p>Acyl-carnitines comprise another class of metabolites having abundances that were returned to CN levels in WD-fed mice by the high dose of I3A (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Compared to CN, mice in the WD group showed elevated levels of long-chain 3-hydroxylacyl-carnitines. These acyl-carnitines are closely linked to 3-hydroxylacyl-CoAs, which are intermediates of beta-oxidation, and their accumulations suggest incomplete beta-oxidation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Treatment with the high dose of I3A significantly reversed these accumulations. As was the case for tryptophan metabolites, the effect of I3A on acyl-carnitines was dose-dependent.</p>

The PLS-DA projections for WD-100 were closer to CN than WD, but still significantly different from CN.

<p>Clustering and silhouette analysis on significant (differentially abundant) proteins with VIP scores &gt; 1.2 in the PLS-DA projections identified three clusters of proteins based on their abundance profiles. Proteins in cluster 1 had lower abundance in the WD group compared to CN. This trend was reversed in the WD-100 group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Proteins in cluster 2 had lower abundance in the WD group compared to CN, but this trend was not reversed in the WD-100 group. Proteins in cluster 3 had higher abundance in the WD group compared to CN. These proteins had similar abundance in the WD-100 group and CN. The protein abundance profiles were similar between WD-50 and WD groups in all three clusters. These results suggest that the I3A treatment partially reversed the diet-induced alterations in the liver proteome in a dose dependent manner, similar to the trend observed for the liver metabolome.</p>
<p>We performed an enrichment analysis to identify liver biochemical pathways significantly altered by diet and I3A treatment. In total, 454 quantified proteins were associated with 276 KEGG pathways. Of these, 22 proteins were differentially abundant in WD mice compared to CN. These proteins were associated with 6 significantly enriched pathways (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). A comparison of the WD-100 and WD groups identified 52 differentially abundant proteins that were associated with 5 significantly enriched pathways. One metabolic pathway, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, was common to both sets of enriched pathways.</p>
<p>We used targeted proteomics to quantify fatty acid metabolism enzymes identified in the untargeted proteomics data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Platelet glycoprotein 4 (CD36), a major fatty acid uptake protein, was elevated in the WD group compared to CN. The abundance of CD36 was decreased, but not significantly, in the WD-100 group compared to WD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The abundance of fatty acid synthase (Fasn) was not significantly different between the WD group and CN but was decreased in the WD-100 group compared to the WD group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase-2 (Acab), which regulates mitochondrial β-oxidation, was decreased in the WD group compared to CN, but was not significantly different between the WD-100 group compared to WD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Enzymes catalyzing mitochondrial β-oxidation, including long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadl), medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadm), short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acads) and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Hadh) trended higher in the WD group compared to CN, although only Hadh showed a statistically significant difference (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). All four enzymes were significantly decreased in the WD-100 group compared to WD. A similar trend was observed for peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1) and peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolases (Acaa1a and Acaa1b, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). These results suggest that WD feeding led to increased cellular uptake, transport into mitochondria, and β-oxidation of fatty acids, while administration of I3A reduced fatty acid synthesis and β-oxidation. As β- oxidation generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), we also performed a targeted analysis of two antioxidant enzymes detected by the untargeted proteomics experiments, catalase (CatB) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1), and administration of I3A reduced the levels of both enzymes compared to WD (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>). Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in hepatocytes have shown that AhR activation upregulates hepcidin (Hamp) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, a secreted liver protein that regulates iron absorption. Mice fed the WD showed significantly reduced Hamp abundance in the liver, which was dose-dependently increased by I3A treatment (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>). Another iron carrier protein, serotransferrin, showed an opposite trend; its abundance significantly increased in the WD group compared to CN, and dose-dependently decreased by I3A treatment (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>).</p>

<title>I3A suppresses macrophage inflammation in an AMPK but not AhR dependent manner</title>
<p>Since our previous study found that the metabolic effects of I3A in hepatocytes depend on the AhR, we tested if this was also the case in macrophages. The expression of AhR in RAW 264.7 macrophages is very low compared to murine AML12 hepatocytes (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>). Treatment with AhR inhibitor CH223191 did not alter I3A’s effect on reducing palmitate and LPS induced <italic>Tnfα</italic> and <italic>Il-β</italic> expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7C</xref>), indicating that the anti inflammatory effect of I3A in macrophages likely does not require AhR activity.</p>
<p>Given that AMPK is a well-known signaling mediator in lipid metabolism and inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and has been shown to play a role in the progression of NAFLD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we investigated if the levels of AMPK and p-AMPK were altered in the different treatment groups. Both p-AMPK and AMPK were significantly downregulated in livers of the WD group compared to CN (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).

<p>We tested the role of AMPK in RAW 264.7 macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>. Palmitate and LPS treatment significantly reduced p-AMPK levels by 50% compared to vehicle control but did not affect total AMPK (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Treatment with I3A upregulated p-AMPK to baseline levels without altering total AMPK (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Palmitate and LPS also led to an increase in <italic>Tnfα</italic> and <italic>Il-1β</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), while activation of AMPK with AICAR attenuated the palmitate and LPS stimulated increase in <italic>Tnfα</italic> and <italic>Il-1β</italic> expression by 30% and 80%, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). These results suggest that upregulation of p-AMPK modulates the expression of <italic>Tnfα</italic> and <italic>Il-1β</italic> in RAW 264.7 macrophages.</p>
<p>We next investigated if the anti-inflammatory effect of I3A in RAW macrophages that we previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> depends on AMPK activation. We used siRNA to knock down prkaa1, the gene encoding AMPKα1, the main form of AMPKα in murine macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and measured its effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. The knockdown efficiency was ∼50% for mRNA (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A</xref>), ∼ 40-50% for AMPK protein, and ∼50 – 60% for p-AMPK (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figs. S8B</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">qS8C</xref>), and the knockdown was stable for up to 96 h at both mRNA and protein levels. In cells transfected with the non-targeted control siRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> left panel), palmitate and LPS increased tnfα and il-1β expression by ∼10- and 250-fold, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), and I3A significantly downregulated this by ∼30% and 50% for <italic>Tnfα</italic> and <italic>Il-1β</italic>, respectively, relative to the DMF control. In contrast, I3A did not significantly modulate <italic>Tnfα</italic> expression in prkaa1 siRNA transfected cells stimulated with palmitate and LPS, and only reduced <italic>Il-1β</italic> expression by ∼20 % (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>) relative to the DMF control. These results suggest that I3A’s anti-inflammatory effect in RAW 264.7 macrophages depend on AMPK activation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on our previous finding that I3A modulates inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages and fatty acid metabolism in hepatocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that I3A could mitigate liver steatosis and other NAFLD features <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using a mouse model of WD-induced NAFLD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, we show that oral administration of I3A protects against liver injury in a dose dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), attenuates liver TG accumulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), and reduces steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and lobular inflammation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>), suggesting that administration of I3A altered both metabolic and inflammation pathways in the liver. As expected, WD induced significant additional weight gain. Treatment with I3A had negligible impact on the weight gain and did not reduce food intake.</p>
<p>Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, MCP-1 and IL-6 by resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) signals recruitment and infiltration of monocytes into the liver. These cytokines also promote the differentiation of monocytes into pro-inflammatory macrophages, which in turn exacerbates dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Consistent with the lobular inflammation score, there was a significant increase in the expression of inflammatory cytokines in livers of the WD group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Remarkably, treatment of WD fed mice with I3A dose-dependently reduced the expression of every cytokine in the 13-member panel, including IL-10. The downregulation of IL-10 in I3A treated mice could be a result of reduced hepatic inflammation (i.e., feedback regulation of IL-10 production). Whether the decrease in inflammatory cytokine production is due to I3A’s anti-inflammatory effects in liver immune cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> or due to modulation of lipid metabolism in hepatocytes warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that the alteration of bile acid metabolism could be a biomarker for NAFLD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Mice in the WD group had a lower total concentration of liver bile acids and higher proportion of primary bile acids compared to CN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The latter trend is consistent with previous studies comparing bile acid profiles between NASH patients and healthy controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Compared to our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> results, the effect of I3A treatment on liver bile acids was modest, possibly due to regulatory mechanisms present <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, CDCA is metabolized into muricholic acids in mice which are absent in humans and have different affinities for bile acid receptors compared to CDCA and lithocholic acid, a CDCA-derived secondary bile acid. Knockout mouse models that lack the bile acid metabolizing enzymes Cyp2c70/Cyp2a12 have bile acid pools closer to humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Future studies utilizing these models could help elucidate the physiological impact of I3A on liver bile acids and their role in fatty liver disease.</p>
<p>The observation that the fecal microbial community composition was not significantly altered by I3A administration suggests that the hepatoprotective effects of I3A are likely due to the metabolite’s direct action on the host, rather than the gut microbiota composition. One caveat to this interpretation is the shallow resolution of 16S rRNA sequencing. It is possible that I3A administration altered the microbiota composition at the species level. It is also possible that I3A could affect the metabolism of the microbiota without altering its composition. A recent study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> showed that a diet containing high levels of methionine and cysteine protected mice against chronic kidney disease by reducing uremic toxins through post-translational modification of gut bacterial enzymes. To test the possibility that I3A administration altered the intestinal metabolome, we performed untargeted metabolomics experiments on fecal samples. The results showed no significant impact of I3A on the fecal metabolomes of WD mice. While further studies are warranted to fully elucidate the impact of I3A administration on the microbiome and microbial gene expression in the intestine, these results suggest that the partial reversal of WD induced changes in liver metabolome and proteome by I3A treatment is due to the metabolite’s direct action on the liver.</p>
<p>Analysis of enzymes in lipid transport, synthesis, and mobilization showed that WD and I3A impacted different facets of lipid metabolism. Targeted proteomics detected a 6 fold increase in fatty acid translocase CD36 in the WD group compared to CN, suggesting that the elevation of liver FFAs in the WD group (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>) could be due to increased uptake. I3A did not affect CD36 abundance, but significantly decreased Fasn by 86%, the rate limiting enzyme in <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis. This suggests that the significant decrease in liver TG in the WD-100 group could reflect a downregulation of <italic>de novo</italic> lipid synthesis in the liver.</p>
<p>Liver fatty acid oxidation (FAO) enzymes also showed different responses to WD and I3A. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (Acab) is a mitochondrial regulatory enzyme that produces malonyl CoA, which inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Downregulation of Acab in the WD group compared to CN suggests increased CPT1 activity and hence elevated long-chain FA (LCFA) transport into the mitochondria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. This interpretation is also supported by the observation that long-chain 3-hydoxy-acyl carnitines were elevated in the WD group compared to CN, which is consistent with a recent study reporting elevated serum C14 hydroxy acylcarnitine in NAFLD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Other mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) enzymes also showed a trend towards upregulation in the WD group compared to CN. Upregulation of FAO by WD was significant in the peroxisomes, the initial site of very long-chain FA oxidation. The literature is conflicted on FAO in human subjects with NAFLD or NASH. Depending on the study, enhanced <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, unchanged <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> or decreased <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> FAO has been reported. The different results may reflect varying severity of the disease (degree of steatosis or steatosis vs. NASH) and variations in FAO capacity across individual subjects. One study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> showed that the expression of genes in peroxisomal and mitochondria β-oxidation was higher in patients with more severe steatosis compared to patients with less sever steatosis or healthy control. Administration of I3A significantly reduced the abundance of both mitochondrial and peroxisomal FAO enzymes. Increased FAO and concomitant ROS generation can overwhelm cellular antioxidant defenses, inducing oxidative stress. Although there is a lack of consensus regarding FAO, studies consistently report elevated markers of oxidative stress in human subjects with steatosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. In this regard, I3A may protect from oxidative stress by reducing FAO. This is consistent with our observations that I3A administration reversed the WD-induced accumulation of long-chain 3-hydroxy-acylcarnitines and that the changes in abundance of FAO enzymes were upstream of 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoAs. Oxidative stress induced enzymes CAT and GPx were upregulated in the WD group compared to CN and downregulated in the WD-100 group compared to the WD group. It should be noted that all the biochemical parameters related to lipid metabolism were assessed at termination of the mouse experiments. It is possible that the downregulation of FAO enzymes in I3A treated mice reflects a response to reduced lipid accumulation. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the (likely) dynamic effects of I3A on the liver lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that tryptophan derived gut bacterial metabolites, including I3A, are AhR agonists in intestinal epithelial cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> hepatocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and immune cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In our previous study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, we observed that I3A decreased the expression of Fasn and its transcriptional regulator SREBP-1c in hepatocytes in an AhR dependent manner. In the current study, we again found that Fasn was downregulated by I3A treatment. Additionally, we observed a dose dependent upregulation of hepcidin in mice treated with I3A. Previously, tryptophan derived metabolites indoxyl sulfate and kynurenine have been shown to induce hepcidin expression in HepG2 cells in an AhR-dependent manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Hamp is a master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis that binds to ferroportin and inhibits the absorption of dietary iron and efflux of iron from liver resident macrophages. Iron overload is common among NAFLD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, and the excess iron along with inflammation can induce hepcidin in these patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. However, hepcidin gene expression decreases when NAFLD progresses to NASH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, suggesting that disease progression is linked to impaired regulation of iron metabolism. Hepcidin knockout in a mouse model of NAFLD ameliorated steatosis while exacerbating fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. In contrast, hepcidin overexpression decreased choline-deficient diet induced steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Whether I3A induction of hepcidin ameliorates iron overload and how this could contribute to I3A’s protective role needs to be investigated.</p>
<p>Another set of WD-induced metabolic alterations that were reversed by I3A treatment and likely mediated through the AhR are restorations of tryptophan metabolite levels. Studies in hepatocytes have shown that AhR knockdown down-regulates tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, and kynureninase, enzymes that direct flux into the kynurenine branch of tryptophan metabolism. Another study reported that kynurenine activation of the AhR upregulated expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 in dendritic cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. In the present study, I3A treatment of WD-fed mice directed flux of tryptophan into kynurenic, anthranilic, and xanthurenic acids, reducing flux towards niacin and nicotinamide. Given that kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, and xanthurenic acid are all AhR agonists, this could have further enhanced AhR activation by I3A treatment.</p>
<p>In macrophages, however, I3A’s effects were independent of AhR activity, as addition of the AhR inhibitor did not alter the effects (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). Studies in HFD-fed mice showed dysregulation of liver AMPK activity and its association with increased lipid accumulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, LPS activated macrophage showed upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an AMPK regulated protein, upon I3A exposure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Based on these reports, we investigated if AMPK was involved in mediating the response to I3A. We show that both liver AMPK expression and phosphorylation were reduced in WD-fed mice relative to CN, and that administration of I3A rescued both AMPK expression and phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> model, we demonstrate a similar AMPK dependence of I3A’s anti-inflammatory effect in murine macrophages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Whether AMPK signaling plays a role in mediating I3A’s effects in hepatocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> and whether this is important relative to I3A’s activation of the AhR warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>In summary, we have shown that oral administration of a microbiota derived tryptophan metabolite, I3A, in WD-fed mice alleviates diet-induced liver steatosis and inflammation, even when the mice were continued on WD. These hepatoprotective effects occurred without significant alterations in the gut microbiome composition and metabolome profiles, suggesting that I3A acted directly on host cells. Untargeted LC-MS experiments showed activation of several AhR-regulated pathways, suggesting that I3A’s effects are partially mediated through this nuclear receptor. Additionally, <italic>in vivo</italic> results show a correlation between AMPK phosphorylation and the efficacy of I3A, while our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with RAW macrophages show that AMPK mediates I3A’s attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. While our results do not rule out the involvement of additional signaling pathways in both hepatocytes and macrophages, or interactions between the liver and other tissues (e.g., adipose tissue), the data nevertheless strongly point to I3A directly modulating lipid metabolism and inflammatory cytokine production in the liver.</p>
<p>Recently, several other studies reported on the protective effects of I3A in various mouse models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. However, there are significant differences between the other studies and our work. The prior studies modeled steatosis using short-term (less than 4 weeks) HFD exposure, whereas we modeled the later stages of NAFLD (i.e., with steatosis and inflammation) utilizing long-term (16 weeks) exposure to WD and sugar water. Moreover, in contrast to the other studies, I3A was administered concurrently with WD and sugar water for the last eight weeks of the study. Despite the differences in the study design, the common conclusion from the above studies and our work is that I3A administration decreases hepatic TG. In addition, our study shows that administration of I3A significantly decreases hepatic inflammation and lipid metabolism with minimal modulation of the gut microbiome composition and metabolic function. Mechanistically, we also show that I3A’s anti-inflammatory effects in RAW 264.7 macrophages are mediated through activation of AMPK, whereas its effects in hepatocytes are mediated through the AhR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, demonstrating that I3A elicits protective effects in NAFLD through two signaling pathways in different cell types is a novel and significant finding from our study.</p>
<p>Based on our data, we propose a model describing I3A’s effects in the liver (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>). While additional studies are warranted to investigate the above-mentioned possibilities, the remarkable potency of I3A in alleviating steatosis and inflammation in a therapeutic model clearly demonstrates the potential for developing I3A as an inherently safe treatment option for NAFLD. To this end, preclinical studies should be conducted to evaluate delivery options such as botanical extracts and probiotics, while human subject studies should be performed to determine safety, tolerability, and side effects of I3A. Prospectively, other tryptophan derived microbiota metabolites as well as diets that result in enhanced production of these metabolites in the GI tract could also be investigated for protection against WD-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>The overall objective of the study was to investigate if I3A can alleviate diet induced liver steatosis and inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. We induced these NAFLD features in mice by feeding the animals a WD and SW for 8 weeks. The drinking water for these mice was then supplemented with low and high doses of I3A, while continuing the WD for another 8 weeks. The phenotypic changes were assessed by measuring body weight gain, serum ALT, hepatic inflammatory cytokines, and histopathological examination of liver tissue. To investigate potential mechanisms of action, we performed a series of omics analyses on fecal material (metagenomics and metabolomics) and liver tissue (metabolomics and proteomics). To determine cell-type specific signaling mediating I3A effects in macrophages, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture model. The histopathological scoring of liver sections was blinded; all other analyses were not blinded. Sample processing and statistical analysis were performed concurrently on treatment and control groups using identical methods. Numbers of replicates and outcomes of statistical tests are indicated in the figure legends.</p>

Three of the four groups were fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> a Western diet (WD) with 40% Kcal from fat and containing 0.15% cholesterol (D12079B, Research Diets) and a sugar water (SW) solution (23.1g/L d-fructose + 18.9g/L d-glucose) as previously described (DIAMOND model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>). After 8 weeks, the three groups of WD-fed mice were randomly selected for treatment with vehicle (WD group) or low (WD-50 group) or high dose (WD-100 group) of I3A. The WD group was fed WD and drank sugar water. The WD-50 and WD-100 groups were fed WD and drank sugar water containing, respectively, 50 or 100 mg I3A per kg body weight (corresponding to 0.5mg/ml or 1mg/ml, respectively). The treatments were continued for another 8 weeks. Water bottles containing SW and I3A or only SW were changed every other day. A fourth group of mice was fed a low-fat control diet (D12450B, Research Diets) and normal water for 16 weeks (CN group) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>).

<title>Material and methods Free fatty acid analysis</title>
<p>Free fatty acids (FFAs) in the liver and serum were quantified using product ion scan experiments (TripleTOF 5600+, AB Sciex, Framingham, MA). Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C18 column (Gemini 5 µm C18 110 Å, LC Column 250 x 2 mm, 5μm, Phenomenex) using the solvent gradient described in <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>. Solvent A was acetonitrile/water (3/2, v/v) containing 10 mM ammonium acetate. Solvent B was acetonitrile/isopropanol (1/1, v/v). The injection volume was 5 μL, and the oven temperature was set to 55℃. The flow rate was held at 1 mL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in negative electrospray ionization (ESI-) mode with MS<sup>2</sup> scan. The experimental parameters are described in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>. “Light” experiments with low collision energy were used for quantification. “Heavy” experiments with high collision energy were used to confirm peak identity. The sample AUCs were converted into absolute concentrations using calibration curves from chemical standards. The FFA concentrations were then normalized by the corresponding sample DNA concentration.</p>

<title>Untargeted proteomics</title>
<p>Proteins extracted from homogenized liver tissue samples were reduced at 37 °C for 30 min using a 50 mM dithiothreitol solution in 50 mM Tris-HCl containing 8 M urea. The reduced proteins were alkylated by incubating the sample in the dark for 15 min with 45.5 mM iodoacetamide. The reduced and alkylated proteins were digested using trypsin. After incubating the sample overnight at 37°C, formic acid was added to lower the pH to 2 and terminate the digest. The sample solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000ξg and desalted using spin columns (Pierce, Thermo Fisher). The desalting procedure followed the manufacturer’s instruction except that 0.1% (v/v) formic acid was used instead of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid.</p>
<p>Chromatographic separation was achieved on a reverse phase (RP) column (Ascentis Express C18, 2.7 µm 100Å 15cm x 2.1 mm, Sigma) using a gradient method (<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Table S6</xref>). Solvent A was a 0.1% formic acid solution in water, and solvent B was a 0.1% formic acid solution in acetonitrile. The mobile phase flow rate was held constant at 200 µL/min. The IDA method comprised a TOF MS (survey) scan and (triggered) high-resolution MS/MS (product ion) scans monitoring up to 25 candidate ions per cycle. The dependent scans were triggered whenever the survey scan detected a precursor ion matching the following criteria: mass range of 300-1250 m/z, charge state within +2 to +5, mass tolerance of 50 mDa, ion peak is not an isotope within 6 Da, and ion count exceeds 100 cps. Previously fragmented target ions were excluded for 15 sec to improve the variety of fragmented ions. Collision energy was set to 10 eV.</p>
<p>Ions detected in the IDA experiment were annotated using ProteinPilot (v.5.0, AB Sciex) against mouse proteins in the SwissProt database (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>, Step A). Here, an ion refers to a charged peptide comprising a sequence of amino acids with or without modifications. Ions annotated as the same peptide were collected into one record (Step B). For each record, the average chromatographic retention time (RT), RT variation (relative to average), median peptide confidence score was calculated from the associated ion data. The peptides collected into records were filtered using an automated procedure implemented as a script in MATLAB (R2019b, MathWorks, Natick, MA) based on the following criteria (Step C). For each peptide, average RT and accurate mass in the record were compared with the ions of every other peptide having a different predicted sequence and modification. If a match with another peptide ion was found within 0.1 m/z and 0.5 min, the peptide was excluded from quantification since the overlap decreases confidence in quantitation. All comparisons were performed with ions instead of records because the average RT of a record can be unreliable due to multiple elution of peptides belonging to the same record. The data were analyzed to ensure that a peptide belongs to only one protein, is detected more than once, i.e., at least two ions are included in one record, the median confidence score of a record is greater than 95%, and the maximal difference between RTs of peptide ions within a single record is less than 0.5 min.</p>
<p>Peptides meeting the above criteria were analyzed in MultiQuant (v2.0, AB Sciex) to quantify the areas-under-the curve (AUCs) of corresponding extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) (Step D). The peptide AUCs were then normalized by the corresponding sample’s sum of all peptide AUCs to control for sample- to-sample variability in total protein loaded onto the HPLC column (Step E). An additional filter was applied to exclude peptides that did not have AUCs above blank in at least 80% of the samples (Step F). Peptides with RTs that deviate more than 0.5 min among the samples were also excluded from further analysis. To select a representative peptide for protein quantification, peptides having post-translational modification sites were excluded, since the modified peptides can at most represent a fraction of the protein (Step G). If peptides having the same sequence and different charge states were identified for a protein, then the representative peptide was selected from this pool. Otherwise, the representative peptide was selected from all peptides belonging to the protein. In either case, the peptide with the largest average normalized AUC across all samples was selected to represent the corresponding protein’s relative abundance.</p>

<caption><title>Proposed model for the effects of I3A on hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation.</title>
<p>When mice are fed with a WD (top panel), TG and FFAs accumulate in the liver due to increased uptake of fatty acids. This also leads to increased β-oxidation in the mitochondria and peroxisomes. In liver macrophages, the increase in FFAs, possibly in conjunction with circulating endotoxins (e.g., LPS) stimulate production of inflammatory cytokines. When mice fed the WD are treated with I3A (bottom panel), both TG and FFAs decrease in the liver. Rather than impact fatty acid uptake, I3A treatment reduces <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis through a downregulation of Fasn, while also reducing both mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation.

<p>The study by Ding et al demonstrated that microbial metabolite I3A reduced western diet induced steatosis and inflammation in mice. They showed that I3A mediates its anti-inflammatory activities through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner in macrophages. Translationally, they proposed that I3A could be a potential therapeutic molecule in preventing the progression of steatosis to NASH.</p>
<p>Major strengths</p>
<p>
• Authors clearly demonstrated that the Western Diet (WD)-induced steatosis and I3A treatment reduced steatosis and inflammation in pre-clinical models. Data clearly supports these statements.</p>
<p>
• I3A treatment rescued WD-altered bile acids as well as partially rescued the metabolome, proteome in the liver.</p>
<p>
• I3A treatment reduced the levels of enzymes in fatty acid transport, de novo lipogenesis and β-oxidation</p>
<p>
• I3A mediates its anti-inflammatory activities through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner in macrophages.</p>
<p>Minor</p>
<p>
I agree with the authors that investigating known other AhR ligands in comparison may be beyond the scope of this study.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>1. Utilization of known AhR ligands as controls will strengthen the interpretation of the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that AhR ligands could be used as controls for delineating structure-activity relationships and cell context-specific effects. However, such studies are beyond the scope of the current manuscript. The AhR has many endogenous ligands, including several tryptophan derived metabolites, that have been shown to elicit different responses depending on the dose and cell type.  Our unpublished data show that the expression of AhR target genes such as Cyp1a1, Cyyp2e1, and Tiparp were not modulated by I3A in RAW cells, which suggests that the observed effects may occur independent of the AhR.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>1. The title is misleading &quot;Microbially-derived indole-3-actate&quot; suggests that this article is about the production of I3A by the gut microbiota, in fact this is a dietary supplementation article. The title needs to reflect this fact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our title reflects the natural source of I3A in mice. We used oral supplementation to study the effects of this metabolite. Per suggestion by the reviewer, we changed the title as follows:</p>
<p>
“Oral supplementation of gut microbial metabolite indole-3-acetate alleviates diet-induced steatosis and inflammation in mice”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>2). The description of the amount of I3A in the drinking water is not properly described. The actual concentration in the drinking water should be given.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The concentration of I3A in drinking water was as follows: WD50 = 0.5mg/ml and WD100 = 1mg/ml. We added this information in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The serum concentration data of I3A is critical data and should be moved in Figure 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included serum levels of I3A as part of Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors should have determined the actual concentration of indole-3-actetate in serum by running a standard curve of I3A during the LC-MS analysis. Also, recovery and matrix effects should be determined. Without this information their data will be difficult to compare to other studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that quantification of I3A in serum would be useful. However, we are unable to do so due to limited sample available as well as concerns with sample integrity after long-term storage.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In the data in Figure S1C, there appears to be only 2-3 mice out of nine that exhibit a difference in serum indole-3-acetate levels between the WD-50 and WD-100. Do the authors have an explanation for this small difference compared to the other endpoints assessed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The serum I3A measurements at week 16 are a snapshot that may not reflect tissue levels due to differences in water intake, I3A metabolism in the body, and/or elimination of I3A. The other phenotypic assays are physiological measurements that reflect the result of sustained administration of I3A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Since the Ah receptor may play a role in the results obtained CYP1A1 mRNA levels in the liver and intestinal tract should have been measured.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We measured alterations in Cyp1a1 mRNA in the liver and no significant change was observed in the WD50 and WD100 groups relative to controls. Also, see response to reviewer 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The main mechanistic experiment performed is shown in Figure 6 and the figure legend states that they are examining macrophages, but these are cell lines, they are macrophages models, and this should be clearly stated. The first two panels are liver data, so the title of the figure legend needs to reflect that fact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have changed the title of Figure 6 to “I3A modulates AMPK phosphorylation and suppresses RAW 264.7 macrophage cell inflammation in an AMPK dependent manner”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Figure 6, 1 mM I3A is added to the cells, how is this very high concentration relevant to the concentrations observed in vivo? Does adding 1 mM acetate to the cell culture media lower the pH of the media and could this influence the results obtained? Would acetic acid yield the same results? Could treatment with an acid even explain in vivo results?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is difficult to match the concentration of I3A in the in vitro experiments to liver tissue concentrations. Addition of 1 mM I3A did not lower the pH of cell culture media or reduce the viability of cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. As I3A is not known to degrade into acetic acid and indole, we do not expect acetic acid to recapitulate the effects elicited by I3A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>My primary concern with the manuscript is the organization and interpretation of the data. It appears that little effort was given by the authors on interpreting the data and digesting it for the reader into a coherent package. Rather, the authors have collected a vast amount of data and organized it without much thought about what the reader would take away from it. Furthermore, it seems the authors have taken this as an opportunity to overload this manuscript with data that are superfluous to the conclusions the authors draw at the end. Based on this, I think the authors need to invest more time into distilled their complex biological data into a unifying scientific interpretation for the readers that advances our understanding of I3A. My suggestions for the authors are described below.</p>
<p>1. The data lack a rationale behind how they are organized within the manuscript. For example, the authors will combine disparate biological pathways and lump data together without logic as in Figure 2. Why are inflammatory pathways and bile acid synthesis combined in a figure? What was the rationale?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree that the data are presented without rationale. Both inflammation and bile acid dysregulation are commonly observed with NAFLD and thus are presented in two separate panels of Figure 2 (A, inflammatory cytokines, and B bile acids).</p>

<p>1. The authors give very little effort to performing integrative omics analysis even though multi-omics is provided. Example given, the authors provide proteomic data on the fatty acid metabolism pathway, however, no mention of this pathway within the metabolomic dataset. Vice versa, the authors provide in depth investigation in the metabolic changes within the tryptophan pathway, however, no investigation into the proteomic changes that may underlie this phenomenon. It would be recommended that the authors invest more energy into performing more in-depth analysis of their multi-omics data presented.</p>

<p>We attempted to co-analyze the proteomic and metabolomic data, but this analysis was not informative.  Protein and metabolite abundances do not necessarily correlate, and the two types of omics data carry different observation biases. For example, label-free, untargeted proteomics data favor abundant proteins, whereas untargeted metabolomics data are influenced by concentration and ionization efficiency, among other factors. Therefore, we opted to analyze the two datasets independently, and then linked the findings from the two analyses using biological pathways as guides. For example, we describe changes in acyl-carnitine and discuss how this observation is consistent with changes in abundance of fatty acid metabolism enzymes.</p>

<p>1. Figures 1&amp;2 shows that low dose treatment reduces inflammation but does not alter hepatic TG levels. This is in direct disagreement with the graphical model provided by the authors (Supp. Fig 9). In the author's model, I3A is directing hepatic lipid metabolism through modulation of macrophage inflammation. This interpretation is erroneous and needs to be reevaluated by the authors. Furthermore, the tryptophan pathway and bile acid pathways are not even represented in the model, which begs the question of why that data are included in the manuscript to begin with.</p>

<p>We would like to respectfully point out that Figure 1D does show a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference in liver TG between the WD and WD100 groups. Supp. Figure S9 is meant to be a summary of the main biochemical changes elicited by I3A that we have shown in the current study (e.g., the involvement of AMPK) rather an atlas of all the changes detected in the metabolomics and proteomic data. Specifically, we have not included the tryptophan or bile acid pathways as we do not have mechanistic information on how these changes are mediated by I3A.</p>

<p>1. The authors switch from hepatocytes to macrophages without giving any rationale, The authors need to invest more time into describing a logical flow of thought when assembling the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We mention the rationale for investigating the effect of I3A on macrophages in the introduction (last paragraph of the section): “In vitro, both I3A and TA attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines (Tnfα, Il-1β and Mcp-1) in macrophages exposed to palmitate and LPS.”. We also explain why we used an in vitro model, RAW cells, at the beginning of the corresponding Results section: “Since our previous study found that the metabolic effects of I3A in hepatocytes depend on the AhR, we tested if this was also the case in macrophages.” Moreover, the strong effects of I3A on liver inflammatory cytokines also motivates the macrophage experiments.</p>
