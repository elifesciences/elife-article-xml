<abstract>
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 evolves within individual hosts to escape adaptive immune responses while maintaining its capacity for replication. Coevolution between HIV-1 and the immune system generates extraordinary viral genetic diversity. In some individuals, this process also results in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that can neutralize many viral variants, a key focus of HIV-1 vaccine design. However, a general understanding of the forces that shape virus-immune coevolution within and across hosts remains incomplete. Here we performed a quantitative study of HIV-1 evolution in humans and rhesus macaques, including individuals who developed bnAbs. We observed strong selection early in infection for mutations affecting HIV-1 envelope glycosylation and escape from autologous strain-specific antibodies, followed by weaker selection for bnAb resistance. The inferred fitness effects of HIV-1 mutations in humans and macaques were remarkably similar. Moreover, we observed a striking pattern of rapid HIV-1 fitness gains that precedes the development of bnAbs. Our work highlights strong parallels between infection in rhesus macaques and humans, and it reveals a quantitative evolutionary signature of bnAb development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) rapidly mutates and proliferates in infected individuals. The immune system is a major driver of HIV-1 evolution, as the virus accumulates mutations to escape from host T cells and antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Due to the chronic nature of HIV-1 infection, coupled with high rates of mutation and replication, HIV-1 genetic diversity within and between infected individuals is incredibly high. Genetic diversity challenges vaccine development, as vaccine-elicited antibodies must be able to neutralize many strains of the virus to protect against infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, there exist rare antibodies that are capable of neutralizing a broad range of HIV-1 viruses. These broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have therefore been the subject of intense research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Eliciting bnAbs through vaccination remains a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine design. However, the development of exceptionally broad antibody responses is rare, and such antibodies typically develop only after several years of infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent years have yielded important insights into the coevolutionary process between HIV-1 and antibodies that sometimes leads to the development of bnAbs. Clinical studies have collected serial samples of HIV-1 sequences from a few individuals who developed bnAbs and characterized the resulting antibodies, their developmental stages, and binding sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The contributions of HIV-1 and its coevolution to bnAb development are complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. High viral loads and viral diversity have been positively associated with bnAb development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, superinfection, which can vastly increase HIV-1 diversity, is not always associated with bnAb development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and it does not appear to broaden antibody responses in the absence of other factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we sought to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 that accompany the development of bnAbs in clinical data. In particular, we inferred the landscape of selective pressures that shape the evolution of HIV-1 within hosts, reflecting the effects of the immune environment. We first analyzed data from two individuals who developed bnAbs within a few years after HIV-1 infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In both individuals, HIV-1 mutations inferred to be the most beneficial were observed early in infection. In general, mutations that provided resistance to autologous strain-specific antibodies were inferred to be more strongly selected than ones that escaped from bnAbs. We also observed clusters of beneficial mutations along the HIV-1 genome, which were associated with envelope protein (Env) structure.</p>
<p>To confirm the generality of these patterns in a broader sample, we studied recent data from rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV) that incorporated HIV-1 Env proteins derived from the two individuals above <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This study also compared patterns of Env evolution in HIV-1 and SHIV in response to host immunity. We observed striking parallels between the inferred fitness effects of Env mutations in RMs and humans, suggesting highly similar selective pressures on the virus despite different host species and differences in individual immune responses. Furthermore, we found that RMs that developed broad, potent antibody responses could clearly be distinguished from those with narrowly focused responses using the evolutionary dynamics of the virus. Specifically, the virus population in individuals who developed greater breadth was distinguished by larger and more rapid gains in fitness than in other individuals. Collectively, these results show high similarity between SHIV evolutionary dynamics in RMs and HIV-1 in humans, and that viral fitness gain is associated with antibody breadth.</p>

<title>Quantifying HIV-1 evolutionary dynamics</title>
<p>We studied HIV-1 evolution accompanying the development of bnAbs in two donors, CH505 and CH848, enrolled in the Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology 001 acute infection cohort <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. CH505 developed the CD4 binding sitetargeting bnAb CH103, which was first detectable 14 weeks after HIV-1 infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. CH103 maturation was found to be associated with viral escape from another antibody lineage, CH235, that ultimately developed significant breadth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. CH848 developed a bnAb, DH270, targeting a glycosylated site near the third variable loop (V3) of Env <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Similar to the bnAb development process in CH505, escape from “cooperating” DH272 and DH475 lineage antibodies was observed to contribute to the maturation of DH270 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>To quantify HIV-1 evolutionary dynamics, we sought to infer a fitness model that best explained the changes in the genetic composition of the viral population observed in each individual over time. In recent years, a wide variety of approaches have been developed to infer the fitness effects of mutations from temporal genetic data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The vast majority of these methods focus on a single locus at a time, ignoring correlations between genetic variants at different loci. While the recombination rate of HIV-1 is high <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, the virus also evolves under strong selection, which can lead to interference between clones with different beneficial mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Thus, we applied MPL, an inference method that systematically accounts for genetic correlations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, to estimate the fitness effects of HIV-1 mutations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Model overview</title>
<p>Here, we provide a brief overview of the key steps in the MPL approach to inferring selection. Further details are available in Methods and in prior work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. First, we assume that the effect on viral fitness of each individual mutation <italic>a</italic> at each site <italic>i</italic> is quantified by a selection coefficient <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>a</italic>), with positive coefficients <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>a</italic>) <italic>&gt;</italic> 0 denoting mutations that are beneficial for the virus and <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>a</italic>) <italic>&lt;</italic> 0 denoting deleterious ones. We further assume that the cumulative fitness effects of mutations are additive, such that the overall fitness <italic>F</italic><sup><italic>α</italic></sup> of a viral sequence <italic>α</italic> is given by the sum of the selection coefficients for all the mutations that it bears. That is,
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="603090v4_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603090v4_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> represents the viral sequence, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603090v4_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> qual to one if genotype <italic>α</italic> has allele <italic>a</italic> at site <italic>I</italic> and zero otherwise. <italic>L</italic> is the length of the genetic sequence, and <italic>q</italic> represents the number of genetic states (i.e., <italic>q</italic> = 5 for nucleotide sequences and 21 for amino acids, including gaps/deletions).</p>
<p>We assume that viral replication is stochastic, where viruses with higher fitness are more likely to spread infection to new cells than ones with lower fitness. Let us write the number of viruses of each genotype in the population at time <italic>t</italic> as <italic>n</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = (<italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>), <italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>t</italic>), …, <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> (<italic>t</italic>)), where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603090v4_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the total number of possible genotypes. In our model, the probability of obtaining a new distribution of genotypes <italic>n</italic>(<italic>t</italic> + 1) in the next generation is multinomial,
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="603090v4_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
with <italic>N</italic> = ∑<sub><italic>α</italic></sub><italic>n</italic><sub><italic>α</italic></sub> the total population size. The probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>α</italic></sub>(<italic>n</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)) are influenced by fitness, as well as mutation, recombination, and the current frequency of each genotype (see Methods). Essentially, viruses that are fitter than the current population average are more likely to increase in frequency, while ones that are less fit are likely to decline. Mutations and recombination introduce genetic variation into the population. The population size <italic>N</italic> determines the relative stochasticity of the dynamics, with smaller populations having more random fluctuations than larger ones.</p>
<p>Following this model, we can then quantify the probability of any evolutionary history of the viral population (i.e., the distribution of viral genotypes over time) as a function of the selection coefficients (Methods). Assuming that the population size <italic>N</italic> is large and the selection coefficients are small (such that |<italic>s</italic>| <italic>≪</italic> 1), we can write an analytical expression for the selection coefficients that best fit the viral dynamics observed in data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="603090v4_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Here <italic>C</italic><sub>int</sub> is the covariance matrix of allele frequencies (i.e., the linkage disequilibrium matrix) integrated over time, and <italic>γ</italic> is a regularization parameter. The terms Δ<italic>x</italic><sub>int</sub> and Δ<italic>u</italic><sub>int</sub> represent the net change in allele frequency and the total expected change in allele frequency due to spontaneous mutations alone, respectively (see Methods for details). Intuitively, this expression says that net allele frequency changes that cannot be explained by mutations are likely due to selection, either on that specific allele or the associated genetic background, which is quantified by <italic>C</italic><sub>int</sub>. Alleles that have large, rapid changes in frequency are more likely to be under strong selection than those with smaller, slower frequency changes. Beyond HIV-1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>), this approach has been successfully applied to study the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>) and experimental evolution in bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Broad patterns of HIV-1 selection</title>
<p>As described above, we used MPL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> to infer the selection coefficients that best fit the viral dynamics observed in data from CH505 and CH848. While the great majority of HIV-1 mutations were inferred to be neutral (<italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>a</italic>)<italic>∼</italic> 0), a few mutations substantially increase viral fitness (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Strongly beneficial mutations occurred in clusters along the genome and preferentially appeared in specific regions of Env (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To quantify patterns of selection in Env, we examined the top 2% of mutations inferred to be the most beneficial in CH505 and CH848. The fractions of nonsynonymous mutations within these subsets were 97% and 92% for CH505 and CH848, respectively. These fractions are significantly higher than chance expectations (<italic>p</italic> = 6.7 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−3</sup> and 5.6 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−4</sup>, Fisher’s exact test; Methods), supporting the model’s ability to accurately infer fitness effects in this data. For CH505, we found 10.9-fold more strongly beneficial mutations in the first variable loop (V1) than expected by chance (<italic>p</italic> = 2.5 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−3</sup>). This is consistent with the presence of V1 mutations conferring resistance to autologous strain-specific antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Mutations in V4, a region targeted by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, were also 10.0-fold enriched in this subset (<italic>p</italic> = 9.0 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−5</sup>). For CH848, mutations in V1, V3, and V5 were enriched by factors of 14.2, 6.3, and 19.1 among the top 2% most beneficial mutations (<italic>p</italic> = 5.9 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−10</sup>, 6.6 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−3</sup>, and 4.8 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−6</sup>). Mutations in these regions were shown to play a role in resistance to DH270 and DH475 lineage antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. To test whether our results might be biased by overall sequence variability, we examined the relationship between our inferred selection coefficients and entropy, a common measure of sequence variability. Overall, we found only a modest correlation between selection and entropy, suggesting that the signs of selection that we observe are not due to increased sequence variability alone (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Reversions and mutations affecting N-linked glycosylation motifs were also likely to be beneficial. We define reversions as mutations where the transmitted/founder (TF) amino acid changes to match the subtype consensus sequence at the same site. Among the top 2% most beneficial mutations, reversions were enriched by factors of 19.9 and 17.8 for CH505 and CH848 viruses, respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 2.1 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−8</sup> and 8.5 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−13</sup>), consistent with past work finding strong selection for reversions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>.

<title>Selection for antibody escape</title>
<p>To quantify levels of selection for antibody escape, we computed selection coefficients for mutations that were observed to contribute to resistance to bnAbs as well as bnAb precursors and autologous strain-specific antibodies (<xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Tables 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">3</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. We mapped the inferred selection coefficients to the Env protein structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, highlighting the binding sites for bnAbs and resistance mutations for strain-specific antibodies, as well as important parts of Env (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). We also analyzed when these resistance mutations were first observed in each individual.</p>
<p>Overall, we observed stronger selection for escape from autologous strain-specific antibodies and/or changes in glycosylation during the first six months of infection (<xref rid="tblS4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Tables 4</xref>-<xref rid="tblS5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). This was then followed by more modest selection for escape from bnAb lineages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). For CH505, mutations that conferred resistance to the intermediate-breadth CH235 lineage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> were less beneficial than top mutations escaping from strain-specific antibodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In turn, resistance mutations for the broader CH103 lineage were less beneficial than CH235 resistance mutations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). CH848 is similar, with some highly beneficial mutations affecting glycosylation observed early in infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). While a few mutations affecting DH270 appear strongly selected, these mutations appeared long before the DH270 lineage was detected (around 3.5 years after infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>). Thus, these mutations may have initially been selected for other reasons.</p>

<title>Consistent patterns of selection in SHIV evolution</title>
<p>Simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) have numerous applications in HIV/AIDS research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Recently, Roark and collaborators studied SHIV-antibody coevolution in rhesus macaques (RMs), which they compared with patterns of HIV-1 evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Two of the SHIV constructs in this study included envelope sequences derived from CH505 and CH848 transmitted/founder (TF) viruses. There, it was found that 2 out of 10 RMs inoculated with SHIV.CH505 and 2 out of 6 RMs inoculated with SHIV.CH848 developed antibodies with substantial breadth.</p>
<p>To understand whether the patterns of HIV-1 selection observed in CH505 and CH848 are repeatable, and to search for viral factors that distinguish between individuals who develop bnAbs and those who do not, we analyzed SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848 evolution in RMs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. To prevent spurious inferences, we first omitted data from RMs with &lt;3 sampling times or &lt;4 sequences in total (Methods). After processing, we examined evolutionary data from 7 RMs inoculated with SHIV.CH505 and 6 RMs inoculated with SHIV.CH848 (<xref rid="tblS6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Tables 6</xref>-<xref rid="tblS7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). We then computed selection coefficients for SHIV mutations within each RM. Reasoning that selective pressures across SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848 viruses are likely to be similar, we also inferred two sets of joint selection coefficients that best describe SHIV evolution in SHIV.CH505- and SHIV.CH848-inoculated RMs, respectively (Methods).</p>
<p>As before, we examined the top 2% of SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848 mutations that we inferred to be the most beneficial for the virus. Overall, we found consistent selection for reversions (17.9- and 14.2-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 4.3 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−11</sup> and 1.2 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−11</sup> for SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848, respectively), with slightly attenuated enrichment in mutations that affect N-linked glycosylation (2.7- and 4.2-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 5.4 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−2</sup> and 3.4 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−6</sup>). However, there is a small subset of mutations that <italic>shift</italic> glycosylation sites by simultaneously disrupting one N-linked glycosylation motif and completing another, where highly beneficial mutations occur far more often than expected by chance (158.3- and 191.1-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 1.7 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−4</sup> and 7.9 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−11</sup> for CH505 and SHIV.CH505, respectively; 118.7-fold and 90.4-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 2.0 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−4</sup> and 2.3 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−7</sup> for CH848 and SHIV.CH848).</p>
<p>Intuitively, one may expect that strongly beneficial SHIV mutations are more likely to be observed in samples from multiple RMs. However, we found that the number of RMs in which a mutation is observed is only weakly associated with the fitness effect of the mutation (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p>While substantially deleterious SHIV mutations are rarely observed across multiple RMs, neutral and nearly neutral mutations are common. Thus, in this data set, it is not generally true that SHIV mutations observed in multiple hosts must significantly increase viral fitness.</p>
<p>We observed some differences between HIV-1 and SHIV in the precise locations of the most beneficial Env mutations. For example, mutations in V4 are highly enriched in CH505 due to a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitope in this region, but not in SHIV.CH505 (2.7-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 0.13). For SHIV.CH848, beneficial mutations are modestly enriched in V1 and V5 (4.7- and 4.2-fold, <italic>p</italic> = 4.0 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−3</sup> and 6.7 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−2</sup>), as in CH848, but not for V3 (0.9-fold enrichment, <italic>p</italic> = 0.22).</p>
<p>Despite some differences in the top mutations, patterns of selection over time in SHIV were very similar to those found for HIV-1. As before, highly beneficial mutations, including ones affecting glycosylation, tended to appear earlier in infection. This was followed by modestly beneficial mutations at later times, including ones involved in resistance to bnAbs in the RMs who developed antibodies with significant breadth (examples in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Detection of SHIV mutations that increase viral load</title>
<p>A major goal of nonhuman primate studies with SHIV is to faithfully recover important aspects of HIV-1 infection in humans. However, due to the divergence of simian immun-odeficiency viruses and HIV-1, SHIVs are not always well-adapted to replication in RMs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. To combat this problem, a recent study identified six SHIV.CH505 mutations that increase viral load (VL) in RMs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. These mutations result in viral kinetics that better mimic HIV-1 infection in humans.</p>
<p>Our analysis readily identifies the SHIV.CH505 mutations shown to increase VL. Five out of the top six SHIV.CH505 mutations with the largest average selection coefficients are associated with increased VL (<xref rid="tblS8" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). The final mutation identified by Bauer et al., N130D, is ranked tenth. We also find highly beneficial mutations in SHIV.CH848 that are distinct from those in SHIV.CH505 (<xref rid="tblS9" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Highly-ranked mutations identified here may be good experimental targets for future studies aimed at increasing SHIV.CH848 replication <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Fitness agreement between HIV-1 and SHIV</title>
<p>Next, we explored the similarity in the overall viral fitness landscapes inferred for HIV-1 and SHIV, beyond just the top mutations. First, we computed the fitness of each SHIV sequence using the joint SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848 selection coefficients inferred from RM data. Then, we computed fitness values for SHIV sequences using selection coefficients inferred from HIV-1 evolution in CH505 and CH848.</p>
<p>We observed a remarkable agreement between SHIV fitness values computed from these two sources (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). For both SHIV.CH505 and SHIV.CH848, the correlation between viral fitness estimated using data from humans (i.e., CH505 and CH848) and RMs is strongly and linearly correlated (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.96 and 0.95, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 10<sup>−20</sup>). This implies that evolutionary pressures on the envelope protein SHIV-infected RMs are highly similar to those on HIV-1 in humans with the same TF Env. In fact, this relationship holds even beyond the SHIV sequences observed during infection. Fitness estimates for sequences with randomly shuffled sets of mutations are also strongly correlated (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). In contrast, the inferred fitness landscapes of CH505 and CH848, which share few mutations in common, are poorly correlated (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). This suggests that the similarities between viral fitness values in humans and RMs are not artifacts of the model, but rather stem from similarities in underlying evolutionary drivers.</p>

<title>Evolutionary dynamics forecast antibody breadth</title>
<p>Given the similarity of HIV-1 and SHIV evolution, we sought to identify evolutionary features that distinguish between hosts who develop broad antibody responses and those who do not. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows that SHIV sequences from hosts with bnAbs often reach higher fitness values than those in hosts with only narrow-spectrum antibodies. We hypothesized that stronger selective pressures on the virus might drive viral diversification, stimulating the development of antibody breadth. Past studies have associated higher viral loads with bnAb development and observed viral diversification around the time of bnAb emergence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Computational studies and experiments have also shown that sequential exposure to diverse antigens can induce cross-reactive antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To further quantify SHIV evolutionary dynamics, we computed the average fitness gain of viral populations in each RM over time. We observed a striking difference in SHIV fitness gains between RMs that developed broad antibody responses and those that did not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In particular, SHIV fitness increased rapidly before the development of antibody breadth. SHIV fitness gains in RM5695, which developed exceptionally broad and potent antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, were especially rapid and dramatic. These fitness differences were not attributable to bnAb resistance mutations, which were only moderately selected and generally appeared after bnAbs developed.</p>

<caption><title>Rapid SHIV fitness gains precede the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies.</title>
<p>For both SHIV.CH505 (<bold>A</bold>) and SHIV.CH848 (<bold>B</bold>), viral fitness gains over time display distinct patterns in RM hosts that developed bnAbs versus those that did not. Notably, the differences in SHIV fitness gains between hosts with and without broad antibody responses appear <italic>before</italic> the development of antibody breadth, and cannot be attributed to selection for bnAb resistance mutations. RM6072 is an unusual case, exhibiting antibody development that was highly similar to CH505. Although RM6072 developed tier 2 nAbs, they lacked key mutations critical for breadth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.

<graphic xlink:href="603090v4_fig6.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>One outlier in this pattern is RM6072, infected with SHIV.CH505. Antibody development in RM6072 followed a path that was remarkably similar to CH505, including a lineage of antibodies, DH650, directed toward the CD4 binding site of Env <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, resistance to the DH650 lineage is conferred by a strongly selected mutation that adds a glycan at site 234 (T234N, with an inferred selection coefficient of 4.5%). Broadly neutralizing antibodies similar to DH650 are able to accommodate this glycan due to shorter and/or more flexible light chains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, but DH650 cannot. Antibody evolution in RM6072 thus proceeded along a clear pathway toward bnAb development, but lacked critical mutations to achieve breadth.</p>
<p>Next, we quantified how different types of SHIV mutations contributed to viral fitness gains over time. We examined contributions from VL-enhancing mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, antibody escape mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, other mutations affecting Env glycosylation, and reversions to subtype consensus. We found increased fitness gains across all types of mutations in RMs that developed broad antibody responses, compared to those that did not (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). VL-enhancing mutations, known antibody resistance mutations, and reversions typically made the largest contributions to viral fitness.</p>

<title>Robustness of inferred selection to changes in the fitness model and finite sampling</title>
<p>In the analysis above, we used a simple model where the net fitness effect of multiple mutations is simply equal to the sum of their individual effects. Recently, methods have also been developed that can infer epistatic fitness effects from data, which include pairwise interactions between mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We reanalyzed these data to examine how inferred fitness changes when epistasis is included in the model, using the approach of Shimagaki and Barton <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> (Methods). Overall, the inferred epistatic interactions were modest (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). In CH505, we found that the CD4 binding site, V1 (especially sites 136–146 in HXB2 numbering) and V5 regions were modestly but significantly enriched in the most beneficial (top 1%) of epistatic interactions (2.5-, 1.2- and 1.8-fold enrichment with <italic>p</italic> = 1.0 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−21</sup>, 6.3 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−6</sup> and 6.3 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−5</sup>, respectively). Epistatic interactions between N280S/V281A and E275K/V281G, which confer resistance to CH235 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>), ranked in the top 6.5% and 13.0% of interactions. In CH848, we found 1.3-, 1.5-, and 2.3-fold enrichment in strong beneficial epistatic interactions in the CD4 binding site, V4, and V5 regions, respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 4.0 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−6</sup>, <italic>p</italic> = 2.5 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−14</sup> and 3.2 <italic>×</italic> 10<sup>−19</sup>).</p>
<p>To compare the typical fitness effects of individual mutations in the model with epistasis to those in the additive model, we computed effective selection coefficients for the epistatic model. For each mutant allele <italic>a</italic> at each site <italic>i</italic>, we computed the average difference in fitness between sequences in the data set with the mutation and hypothetical sequences that are the same as those in the data, except with the mutant allele <italic>a</italic> reverted to the TF one. In this way, the effective selection coefficient measures the typical effect of each mutation in the data set, while also accounting for epistatic interactions with the sequence background. We found that the effective selection coefficients were highly correlated with the selection coefficients from the additive model (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). We also found strong agreement between the additive and epistatic model fitness values for each sequence in both HIV-1 and SHIV data (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).</p>
<p>Finite sampling of sequence data could also affect our analyses. To further test the robustness of our results, we inferred selection coefficients using bootstrap resampling, where we resample sequences from the original ensemble, maintaining the same number of sequences for each time point and subject. The selection coefficients from the bootstrap samples are consistent with the original data (see <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref> for a typical example), with Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> values of around 0.85 for HIV-1 data sets and 0.95 for SHIV data sets, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HIV-1 evolves under complex selective pressures within individual hosts, balancing replicative efficiency with immune evasion. Here, we quantitatively studied the evolution of HIV-1 and SHIV (featuring HIV-1-derived Env sequences) across multiple hosts, including some who developed broad antibody responses against the virus. Our study highlighted how different classes of mutations (e.g., mutations affecting T cell escape or Env glycosylation) affect fitness <italic>in vivo</italic>. In both HIV-1 and SHIV, we found strong selection for reversions to subtype consensus and some mutations that affected N-linked glycosylation motifs or resistance to autologous strain-specific antibodies. Few CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes were identified in this data set, but the T cell escape mutations that we did observe were highly beneficial for the virus. Consistent with past work studying VRC26 escape in CAP256, we observed more modest selection for bnAb resistance mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, we found striking similarities between Env evolution in humans and RMs. Importantly, these parallels extend beyond the observation of repetitive mutations: the number of hosts in which a mutation was observed was only weakly associated with the mutation’s fitness effect (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Our inferred Env fitness values in humans and RMs were highly correlated, indicating that the functional and immune constraints shaping Env evolution in HIV-1 and SHIV infection are very similar. Our findings therefore reinforce SHIV as a model system that closely mirrors HIV-1 infection.</p>
<p>We discovered that the speed of SHIV fitness gains was clearly higher in RMs that developed broad antibody responses than in those with narrow-spectrum antibodies. Fitness gains in the viral population preceded the development of bnAbs, and they were not driven by bnAb resistance mutations. This suggests that rapid changes in the viral population are a cause rather than a consequence of antibody breadth. While our sample is limited to 13 RMs and two founder Env sequences, we find a clear separation between RMs that did or did not develop antibody breadth. Thus, the dynamics of viral fitness may serve as a quantitative signal associated with bnAb development.</p>
<p>The induction of bnAbs is a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine design <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Both computational <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> and experimental <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> studies, as well as observations from individuals who developed bnAbs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, suggest that the co-evolution of antibodies and HIV-1 is important to stimulate broad antibody responses. Our results could thus inform HIV-1 vaccine research. While precise immune responses and viral escape pathways can differ across individuals, the quantitative similarity in viral evolutionary constraints across humans and RMs suggests that SHIV data can provide a valuable source of information about Env variants that contribute to bnAb development, especially when detailed longitudinal data from humans does not exist. While the concept of sequential immunization is well-established <sup>10,63,64,71,72</sup>, our findings also suggest a possible new design principle. Immunogens could be engineered to reproduce the dynamics of viral population change that are associated with rapid fitness gains, which we found to precede the emergence of bnAbs. This emphasis on broader, population-level dynamics could complement investigations of the molecular details of virus and antibody coevolution.</p>
<p>As noted above, Roark and collaborators also performed a detailed comparison of HIV-1 and SHIV evolution with the same TF Env sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. One of their main conclusions was that most Env mutations were selected for escape from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or antibodies. We found that many antibody resistance mutations identified by Roark et al. are also positively selected in our analysis. Mutations at sites 166 and 169 were shown to confer resistance to a V2 apex bnAb, RHA1, isolated in RM5695 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>). We inferred moderately positive selection coefficients of 0.49% and 0.43% for R166K and R169K, respectively. The same mutations were found in RM6070, which also developed V2 apex bnAbs, with a selective advantage of 1.7% (<xref rid="tblS10" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). Mutations conferring resistance to autologous strain-specific nAbs were identified at multiple sites by Roark and colleagues: 130, 234, 279, 281, 302, 330, and 334 in RM6072, which developed antibody responses targeting the CD4 binding site (DH650) and V3 (DH647 and DH648) regions. Mutations Y330H and N334S, which confer resistance to V3 autologous nAbs, were detected in all RMs infected with SHIV.CH505, with selective advantages of 3.0% and 4.6% in RM6072, and 1.7% and 3.2% on average across RMs, respectively. Overall, we found that mutations conferring resistance to autologous strain-specific antibodies were common and more strongly selected than bnAb resistance mutations (<xref rid="tblS10" ref-type="table">Supplementary Tables 10</xref>-<xref rid="tblS11" ref-type="table">11</xref>).</p>
<p>We note that our conclusions about the phenotypic effects of HIV-1 mutations under selection are constrained by the available data. While we observed strong selection for strain-specific antibody resistance mutations, these results could also be affected by the effects of these mutations on viral replication independent of immune escape. In particular, many ssAb resistance mutations are also reversions to the subtype consensus sequence, which have often been observed to improve viral fitness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. For example, N334S, K302N, and T234N are all reversions. These are among the most beneficial mutations inferred for SHIV.CH505 (<xref rid="tblS8" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). In future work, it would be interesting to attempt to fully separate the fitness effects of mutations due to anti-body escape and intrinsic replication (cf. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>). Although we have systematically compiled information about mutations known to affect antibody resistance and glycosylation, this data is necessarily incomplete. Some of the strongly beneficial mutations with unknown functional effects that we observe could therefore reflect escape from unmapped immune responses.</p>
<p>There are additional methodological and technical limitations that should be considered in the interpretation of our results. Most notably, we assume that the viral fitness landscape is static in time. While we do not expect selection for effective replication (“intrinsic” fitness) to change substantially over time, pressure for immune escape could vary along with the immune responses that drive them. In prior work, we have found that constant selection coefficients typically reflect the average fitness effect of a mutation when its true contribution to fitness is time-varying <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. This may not adequately description mutational effects that undergo large or rapid shifts in time. Future work should also examine temporal patterns in selection for individual mutations.</p>
<p>While we found a strong relationship between viral fitness dynamics and the emergence of bnAbs, it may not be true that the former stimulates the latter. For example, bnAbs may have been present within each host before they were experimentally detected. Rapid viral fitness gains within hosts that developed broad antibody responses could then have been driven by undetected bnAb lineages. However, we did not find strong selection for known bnAb resistance mutations, and in at least one case (RM5695), rapid fitness gains (roughly 2 weeks after infection) substantially preceded bnAb detection (16 weeks). Still, given the limited size of the data set that we studied, it is unclear the extent to which our results will transfer to larger and broader data sets.</p>
<p>Among other analyses, Roark et al. used LASSIE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> to identify putative sites under selection (<xref rid="tblS12" ref-type="table">Supplementary Tables 12</xref>-<xref rid="tblS13" ref-type="table">13</xref>). This method works by identifying sites where non-TF alleles reach high frequencies. We found modest overlap between the sites under selection as identified by LASSIE and the mutations that we inferred to be the most strongly selected. For SHIV.CH505, the E640D mutation at site 640 identified by LASSIE is ranked second among 664 mutations in our analysis, and mutations at the remaining 5 sites identified by LASSIE are all within the top 20% of mutations that we infer to be the most beneficial. For SHIV.CH848, the R363Q mutation that is ranked first in our analysis appears at one of the 17 sites identified by LASSIE. Some mutations at the majority of these 17 sites fall within the top 20% most beneficial mutations in our analysis, but some are outliers. In particular, we infer both S291A/P to be somewhat deleterious, with S291P ranked 810th out of 863 mutations.</p>
<p>Beyond the specific context of HIV-1 and bnAb development, our study also provides insight into viral evolution across hosts and related host species. Parallels between the HIV-1 and SHIV fitness landscapes that we infer suggest that there are strong constraints on viral protein function, with few paths to significantly higher fitness. This is consistent with the ideas of methods that use sequence statistics across multiple individuals and hosts to predict the fitness effects of mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. However, the relationship between the number of individuals in which a mutation was observed and its inferred fitness effect was fairly weak. This suggests that mutational biases and/or sequence space accessibility may play significant roles in short-term viral evolution, even for highly mutable viruses such as HIV-1 and SHIV. As described above, high frequency mutations were also not necessarily highly beneficial. While the recombination rate of HIV-1 is high, correlations between mutations persist, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret frequency changes as signs of selection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our results also point to strong similarities in the immune environment across closely related host species, including preferential targeting of specific parts of viral surface proteins by antibodies. This is supported by the enrichment of beneficial mutations within variable loop regions and at sites that affect the glycosylation of Env. However, despite these constraints, there may still exist a large number of neutral or nearly-neutral mutational paths that remain unexplored.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings support the potential predictability of viral evolution, at least over short time scales. While there are contingencies in evolution – for example, disparate host immune responses or strong epistatic constraints between mutations – these are not so pervasive that they completely change the effective viral fitness landscape or paths of evolution across hosts, given the same founder virus sequence. Similar observations of parallel evolution in HIV-1 have been reported in monozygotic twins infected by the same founder virus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>, common patterns of immune escape across hosts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> and drug resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>, and long-term experimental evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Our results thus contribute to a growing body of research identifying predictable features in viral evolution. Understanding such features could ultimately inform practical applications such as anticipating the emergence of drug resistance or designing vaccines to limit likely pathways of escape.</p>

                <title>Evolutionary model</title>
                <p>We model viral evolution with the Wright-Fisher (WF) model, a fundamental model in population genetics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. In this model, a population of <italic>N</italic> individuals (viruses or infected cells, in our case) undergo discrete rounds of selection, mutation, and replication. Each genotype <italic>α</italic> is represented by a sequence <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603090v4_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="603090v4_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is equal to one if genotype <italic>α</italic> has allele <italic>a</italic> at locus <italic>i</italic> and zero otherwise. Here <italic>L</italic> and <italic>q</italic> represent the length of the genetic sequence (number of loci) and the number of statues at each locus (i.e., number of nucleotides or amino acids), respectively. We use <italic>q</italic> = 5 and <italic>q</italic> = 21 for DNA and amino acid sequences, respectively, in real HIV-1 and SHIV data.</p>

By convention, we set the selection coefficient for TF alleles to zero. Individuals with higher fitness values are more likely to replicate than those with lower fitness.</p>
                <p>Mutations introduce new genotypes and drive the evolution of the population. Let us define <italic>µ</italic><sup><italic>αβ</italic></sup> as the probability of mutation from genotype <italic>α</italic> to genotype <italic>β</italic> per replication cycle.

<p>In this <bold>important</bold> quantitative study of HIV-1 evolution in humans and rhesus macaques, selection coefficients are inferred at scale over the HIV genome. Selection coefficients are similar in humans and macaques, providing <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that these coefficients are representative of the fitness landscapes of these viruses within hosts. This work will be of interest to the community working on quantitative evolution and fitness landscape inference, and the finding that rapid fitness gains in the HIV population predict bNAb emergence has significant implications for HIV vaccine design.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present work studies the coevolution of HIV-1 and the immune response in clinical patient data. Using the Marginal Path Likelihood (MPL) framework, they infer selection coefficients for HIV mutations from time-series data of virus sequences as they evolve in a given patient.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors analyze data from two human patients, consisting of HIV population sequence samples at various points in time during the infection. They inferred selection coefficients from the observed changes in sequence abundance using MPL. Most beneficial mutations appear in viral envelop proteins. The authors also analyze SHIV samples in rhesus macaques, and find selection coefficients that are compatible with those found in the corresponding human samples.</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and organized.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>In their revised version the authors have addressed most of these points satisfactorily.</p>

<p>This paper combines a biological topic of interest with the demonstration of important theoretical/methodological advances. Fitness inference is the foundation of the quantitative analysis of adapting systems. It is a hard and important problem and this paper highlights a compelling approach (MPL) first presented in (1) and refined in (2), roughly summarized in equation 3.</p>
<p>The authors find that positive selection shapes the variable regions of env in shared patterns across two patient donors. The patterns of positive selection are interesting in and of themselves, they confirm the intuition that hyper-variation in env is the result of immune evasion rather than a broadly neutral landscape (flatness). They show that the immune evasion patterns due to CD8 T and naive B-cell selection are shared across patients. Furthermore, they suggest that a particular evolutionary history (larger flux to high fitness states) is associated with bNAb emergence. Mimicking this evolutionary pattern in vaccine design may help us elicit bNAbs in patients in the future.</p>
<p>The fitness landscape of env in multiple hosts is immensely valuable especially because of how often SHIV has used as proxy for HIV. The strength of reversion-to-consensus selection is a known pattern of HIV post-infection populations but they are nicely quantified here. Agreement between SHIV and HIV evolution is shown. They find selection is larger for autologous antibodies than the bNAbs themselves (perhaps bNAbs are just too small a component of the host response to drive the bulk of selection?), and that big fitness increases precede antibody breadth in rhesus-macaques, suggesting that this fitness increase is the immune challenge required to draw forth a bNAb. All of high interest to HIV researchers.</p>

<p>(2) Shimagaki, K. &amp; Barton, J. P. Bézier interpolation improves the inference of dynamical models from data. Physical Review E 107, 024116 (2023).</p>
<p>Strength of evidence:</p>
<p>Equation 3 is a beautiful and intuitive tool that accounts for linkage and can be solved precisely even in the presence of detailed mutational and selection models. They have addressed my earlier concerns the effects of incomplete observations of the frequency bias fitness inference on rare sites.</p>
<p>Whether the fact that fitness increases occured before or after the presence of the bnab remains incompletely known. bNAb detection is different from bNAb presence and the possibility that fitness increases occurred after the bNAbs appeared remains. Still, their conclusion is plausible and fits in with the other observations which form a coherent and compelling picture.</p>
<p>Overall this is a convincing paper. It is a valuable introduction to a practical method of fitness inference at the scale of the entire env gene and how this information can be leveraged to learn some interesting biology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Shimagaki et al. investigate the virus-antibody coevolutionary processes that drive the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). The study's primary goal is to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 within hosts that accompany the emergence of bnAbs, with a particular focus on inferring the landscape of selective pressures shaping viral evolution. To assess the generality of these evolutionary patterns, the study extends its analysis to rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV) incorporating HIV-1 Env proteins derived from two human individuals.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength of the study is its rigorous assessment of the similarity in evolutionary trajectories between humans and macaques. This cross-species comparison is particularly compelling, as it quantitatively establishes a shared pattern of viral evolution using a sophisticated inference method. The finding that similar selective pressures operate in both species adds robustness to the study's conclusions and suggests broader biological relevance. In the revised version, the Authors included a simple but clear explanation of the statistical method for inferring the model's parameters in the main text. Moreover, I find the potential implications of the methodology absent in the original submission very interesting.</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>Overall, the study presents a compelling analysis of HIV-1 evolution and its parallels in SHIV-infected macaques.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present work studies the coevolution of HIV-1 and the immune response in clinical patient data. Using the Marginal Path Likelihood (MPL) framework, they infer selection coefficients for HIV mutations from time-series data of virus sequences as they evolve in a given patient.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors analyze data from two human patients, consisting of HIV population sequence samples at various points in time during the infection. They infer selection coefficients from the observed changes in sequence abundance using MPL. Most beneficial mutations appear in viral envelop proteins. The authors also analyze SHIV samples in rhesus macaques, and find selection coefficients that are compatible with those found in the corresponding human samples.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The MPL method used by the authors considers only additive effects of mutations, thus ignoring epistasis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we have now addressed this limitation by inferring epistatic fitness landscapes for CH505, CH848, SHIV.CH505, and SHIV.CH848. Indeed, the computational burden of the epistasis inference procedure was one constraint that motivated us to consider only additive fitness in the previous version of our paper. The original approach developed by Sohail et al. (2022) tested only sequences with &lt;50 sites due to this limitation, far smaller than the ones we consider. Beyond this computational constraint, we also believed that 1) an additive fitness model may suffice to capture local fitness landscapes, and practically, 2) epistatic interactions are more challenging to validate than the effects of individual mutations, making the interpretation of the model more complex.</p>
<p>However, after performing the analyses described in this paper, we developed a new approach for identifying epistatic interactions that can scale to much longer sequences (Shimagaki et al., Genetics, in press). We therefore applied this method to infer an epistatic fitness landscape for the HIV and SHIV data sets that we studied. As in that work, we focused on short-range (&lt;50 bp) interactions which we could more confidently estimate from data. We have added a section in the SI describing the epistatic fitness model and our analysis.</p>
<p>Overall, we found substantial agreement between the epistatic and purely additive models in terms of the estimated fitness effects of individual mutations (new Supplementary Fig. 8) and overall fitness (Supplementary Fig. 9). Consistent with our prior work, we did not find substantial evidence for very strong epistatic interactions (Supplementary Fig. 10). This does not necessarily mean that strong epistatic interactions do not exist; rather, this shows that strong interactions don’t substantially improve the fit of the model to data, and thus many are regularized toward zero. While the biological validation of epistatic interactions is challenging, we found that the largest epistatic interactions, which we defined as the top 1% of all shortrange interactions, were modestly but significantly enriched in the CD4 binding site, V1 and V5 regions for CH505 and in the CD4 binding site, V4, and V5 for CH848. In addition, mutation pairs N280S/V281A and E275K/V281G, which confer resistance to CH235, ranked in the top 15% of all epistatic interactions in CH505.</p>
<p>We have now included an additional section in the Results, “Robustness of inferred selection to changes in the fitness model and finite sampling”, which discusses our epistatic analyses (page 6, lines 415-464), along with the above Supplementary Figures and a technical section in the SI summarizing the epistasis inference approach.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although the evolution of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a motivating question in the introduction and discussion sections (and the title), the relevance of the analysis and results to better understanding how bnAbs arise is not clear. The only result presented in direct connection to bnAbs is Figure 6.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is true that, while bnAb development is a major motivator of our study, our analysis focuses on HIV-1 and does not directly consider antibody evolution. We have now brought attention to this point as a limitation directly in the Discussion. Following the suggestion below in the “Recommendations for the authors,” we have edited our manuscript to place more emphasis on viral fitness and somewhat reduce the emphasis on bnAbs, though this remains an important motivating factor. Specifically, the Abstract now begins</p>
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 evolves within individual hosts to escape adaptive immune responses while maintaining its capacity for replication. Coevolution between the HIV-1 and the immune system generates extraordinary viral genetic diversity. In some individuals, this process also results in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that can neutralize many viral variants, a key focus of HIV-1 vaccine design. However, a general understanding of the forces that shape virusimmune coevolution within and across hosts remains incomplete. Here we performed a quantitative study of HIV-1 evolution in humans and rhesus macaques, including individuals who developed bnAbs.</p>
<p>We have similarly modified the Discussion to focus first on viral fitness. In response to comments from Reviewer 3, we have also more clearly articulated how our work might contribute to the understanding of bnAb development in the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Questions or suggestions for further discussion:</p>
<p>I list here a number of points for which I believe the paper would benefit if additional discussion/results were included.</p>
<p>The MPL method used by the authors considers only additive effects of mutations, thus ignoring epistasis. In Sohail et al (2022) MBE 39(10), p. msac199  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac199">https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac199</ext-link>) an extension of MPL is developed allowing one to infer epistasis. Can the authors comment on why this was not attempted here?</p>
<p>I presume one possible reason is that epistasis inference requires considerably more computational effort (and more data). However, since the authors find most beneficial mutations occurring in Env, perhaps restricting the analysis to Env genes only (e.g. the trimer shown in Figure 2) can lead to tractable inference of epistasis within this segment (instead of the full genome).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described above, we have now addressed this comment by inferring epistatic fitness landscapes for the data sets that we consider. Our overall results using the epistatic fitness model are consistent with the ones that we previously obtained with an additive model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do the authors find correlations in the inferred selection coefficients of the two samples CH505 and CH848? I could not find any discussion of this in the manuscript. Only correlations between Humans and RM are discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this question, we compared the fitness values and individual selection coefficients across CH505 and CH848 data sets. We found little correlation between CH505 and CH848 fitness values (shown in a new Supplementary Fig. 6) or selection coefficients. We found only 199 common mutations between HIV-1 amino acid sequences from CH505 and CH848 out of 868 and 1,406 total mutations, respectively. Thus, we were not surprised to find no strong relationship between fitness estimates from CH505 and CH848 data sets.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper combines a biological topic of interest with the demonstration of important theoretical/methodological advances. Fitness inference is the foundation of the quantitative analysis of adapting systems. It is a hard and important problem and this paper highlights a compelling approach (MPL) first presented in (1) and refined in (2), roughly summarized in equation 12.</p>

<p>The authors find that positive selection shapes the variable regions of env in shared patterns across two patient donors. The patterns of positive selection are interesting in and of themselves, they confirm the intuition that hyper-variation in env is the result of immune evasion rather than a broadly neutral landscape (flatness). They show that the immune evasion patterns due to CD8 T and naive B-cell selection are shared across patients. Furthermore, they suggest that a particular evolutionary history (larger flux to high fitness states) is associated with bNAb emergence. Mimicking this evolutionary pattern in vaccine design may help us elicit bNAbs in patients in the future.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information to be found in the full fitness landscape of env. The enormous strength of reversion-to-consensus in the patterns is a known pattern of HIV post-infection populations but they are nicely quantified here. Agreement between SHIV and HIV evolution is shown. They find selection is larger for autologous antibodies than the bNAbs themselves (perhaps bNAbs are just too small a component of the host response to drive the bulk of selection?), and that big fitness increases precede antibody breadth in rhesus macaques, suggesting that this fitness increase is the immune challenge required to draw forth a bNAb. This is all of high interest to HIV researchers.</p>
<p>Strength of evidence:</p>
<p>One limitation is, of course, that the fitness model is constant in time when the immune challenge is variable and changing. This simplification may complicate some interpretations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this is a limitation of our current approach. In prior work, we have found that the constant fitness effects of mutations that we infer typically reflect the time-averaged fitness effect when the selection changes over time (Gao and Barton, PNAS 2025; Lee et al., Nat Commun 2025). It could be difficult, however, to capture changes in selection that fluctuate rapidly with underlying immune responses. We have added a new paragraph in the Discussion that more clearly sets out some of the limitations of our analysis, including our assumption of constant selection coefficients.</p>
<p>There are additional methodological and technical limitations that should be considered in the interpretation of our results. Most notably, we assume that the viral fitness landscape is static in time. While we do not expect selection for effective replication (“intrinsic” fitness) to change substantially over time, pressure for immune escape could vary along with the immune responses that drive them. In prior work, we have found that constant selection coefficients typically reflect the average fitness effect of a mutation when its true contribution to fitness is time-varying [42,43]. This may not adequately description mutational effects that undergo large or rapid shifts in time. Future work should also examine temporal patterns in selection for individual mutations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Equation 12 in the methods is really a beautiful tool because it is so simple, but accounts for linkage and can be solved precisely even in the presence of detailed mutational and selection models. However, the reliance on incomplete observations of the frequency leads to complications that must be carefully (re)addressed here.</p>
<p>For instance, the consistent finding of strong selection in hypervariable regions is biologically intuitive but so striking, that I worry that it might be the result of a bias for selection in high entropy regions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree that it is important to carefully interrogate these results. To assess the effects of general sequence variability on inferred selection, we first computed a position-specific entropy measure, H<sub>i</sub>, for each site i. We first defined the time-dependent entropy H<sub>i</sub>(t) = - ∑<sub>a</sub> x<sub>i</sub> (a, t) log x<sub>i</sub> (a, t)), where x<sub>i</sub> (a, t) represents the frequency of amino acid/nucleotide a at position i and time t, at each sample time. We then computed H<sub>i</sub> as the average of H<sub>i</sub>(t) across all sample times. A new Supplementary Fig. 1 plots the entropy against the inferred selection coefficients. Although some sequence variation must be observed in order for us to infer that a mutation is beneficial, we did not find a systematic bias toward larger (more beneficial) selection coefficients at more variable sites. Overall, we found only a modest correlation between inferred selection coefficients and entropy (Pearson’s r = 0.33 and 0.29 for CH505 and CH848, respectively), which appears to be partly driven by the tendency for mutations inferred to be significantly deleterious to occur at sites with low entropy. In addition to the new Supplementary Figure, we have added a reference to this analysis in the main text:</p>
<p>To test whether our results might be biased by overall sequence variability, we examined the relationship between our inferred selection coefficients and entropy, a common measure of sequence variability. Overall, we found only a modest correlation between selection and entropy, suggesting that the signs of selection that we observe are not due to increased sequence variability alone (Supplementary Fig. 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Mutational and covariance terms in equation 12 might be underestimated, due to finite sampling effect in highly diverse populations. Sampling effects lead to zeros in x(t) when actual frequency zeros might be rare at the population sizes of HIV viral loads and mutation rates. Both mutational flux and C underestimation will bias selection upward in eq. 12.</p>
<p>The prior papers (1) and (2) seem to show robustness to finite sampling effects, but, again, more care needs to be shown that this robustness transfers to the amino acid inference under these conditions. That synonymous sites are rarely selected for in the nucleotide level is a good sign, and it may be a matter of simply fully explaining the amino-acid level model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As above, we agree that these tests are important. To assess the robustness of our results to finite sampling, we performed bootstrap sampling on the viral sequences and inferred selection coefficients using the resampled sequences. Specifically, we resampled the same number of sequences as in the original data at each time point and repeated this for all time points across all HIV-1 and SHIV data sets. A new Supplementary Fig. 11 shows a typical comparison of the original selection coefficients vs. those obtained through bootstrap resampling. Overall, we observe a high degree of consistency between the selection coefficients in each case, which is surely aided by the long time series in these data sets. As pointed out by the reviewer, uncertainty in low-frequency mutations is a particular concern, though the effects on inferred selection are mitigated by regularization.</p>
<p>We have added a section in the Results, “Robustness of inferred selection to changes in the fitness model and finite sampling”, which includes this analysis:</p>
<p>Finite sampling of sequence data could also affect our analyses. To further test the robustness of our results, we inferred selection coefficients using bootstrap resampling, where we resample sequences from the original ensemble, maintaining the same number of sequences for each time point and subject. The selection coefficients from the bootstrap samples are consistent with the original data (see Supplementary Fig. 11), with Pearson’s r values of around 0.85 for HIV-1 data sets and 0.95 for SHIV data sets, respectively.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Uncertainty propagates to the later parts of the paper, eg. HIV and SIV shared patterns might be the result of shared biases in the method application. However, this worry does not extend to the apples-to-apples comparison of fitness trajectories across individuals (Figures 5 and 6) which I think are robust (for these sample sizes).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One way to address this uncertainty is to compare the fitness values and individual selection coefficients across CH505 and CH848 data sets, which was also requested by Reviewer 1. Overall, we found little correlation between CH505 and CH848 fitness values (shown in a new Supplementary Fig. 6) or selection coefficients. This suggests that similarities between HIV-1 and SHIV landscapes are not solely determined by potential biases in the inference approach. We have now added a reference to this point in the main text:</p>
<p>In contrast, the inferred fitness landscapes of CH505 and CH848, which share few mutations in common, are poorly correlated (Supplementary Fig. 6). This suggests that the similarities between viral fitness values in humans and RMs are not artifacts of the model, but rather stem from similarities in underlying evolutionary drivers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The timing evidence is slightly weakened by the fact that bNAb detection is different from bNAb presence and the possibility that fitness increases occurred after the bNAbs appeared remains. Still, their conclusion is plausible and fits in with the other observations which form a coherent and compelling picture.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we agree that this is a limitation of our analysis — bNAbs may have been present at low levels before they were detected, and we cannot definitively reject selection by bNAbs. Nonetheless, in at least one case (RM5695), rapid fitness gains were substantially separated in time from bNAb detection (roughly 2 weeks after infection vs. 16 weeks, respectively). We have now added this point in a new paragraph in the Discussion:</p>
<p>While we found a strong relationship between viral fitness dynamics and the emergence of bnAbs, it may not be true that the former stimulates the latter. For example, bnAbs may have been present within each host before they were experimentally detected. Rapid viral fitness gains within hosts that developed broad antibody responses could then have been driven by undetected bnAb lineages. However, we did not find strong selection for known bnAb resistance mutations, and in at least one case (RM5695), rapid fitness gains (roughly 2 weeks after infection) substantially preceded bnAb detection (16 weeks). Still, given the limited size of the data set that we studied, it is unclear the extent to which our results will transfer to larger and broader data sets.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Shimagaki et al. investigate the virus-antibody coevolutionary processes that drive the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). The study's primary goal is to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 within hosts that accompany the emergence of bnAbs, with a particular focus on inferring the landscape of selective pressures shaping viral evolution.

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the study has some limitations. The most significant weakness is that the authors do not sufficiently discuss the implications of the observed similarities.

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now clarified the potential implications of our work in several areas. While speculative, one possible application is in vaccine design: it may be beneficial to design sequential immunogens to mimic the patterns of viral evolution associated with rapid fitness gains. This “population-based” design principle is different from typical approaches, which have focused on molecular details of virus surface proteins.</p>
<p>We have extended our discussion of our results in the context of viral evolution within and across hosts and related host species. Overall, our work suggests that there may be relatively few paths to significantly higher viral fitness in vivo. Evolutionary “contingencies” such as shifting immune pressure or epistatic interactions could influence the direction of evolution, but not so dramatically that the dynamics that we see in different hosts are not comparable. We have also connected our work more broadly to the literature in evolutionary parallelism in HIV-1 in different contexts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A secondary, albeit less critical, limitation is the placement of methodological details in the Supplementary Information. While it is understandable that the authors focus on results in the main text - especially since the methodology is not novel and has been previously described in earlier publications - some readers might benefit from a more thorough presentation of the method within the main paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now modified the main text to add a new section, “Model overview,” that lays out the key steps of our approach. While we reserve technical details for the Methods, we believe that this new section provides more intuition about how our results were obtained (including a discussion of the important Eq. 12, now Eq. 3 in the main text) and our underlying assumptions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>Overall, the study presents a compelling analysis of HIV-1 evolution and its parallels in SHIV-infected macaques. While the quantitative comparison between species is a notable contribution, a deeper discussion of its broader implications would strengthen the paper's impact.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>I suggest de-emphasizing bnAbs and focusing on selection landscape inference, which seems to be the actual focus of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we do not directly study antibody development in this work, bnAb development is certainly an important motivating factor. As described in the responses above, we have now modified the Abstract and Discussion to place relatively more emphasis on fitness comparisons and to relatively less focus on bnAb development.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Please make sure that the MPL method is defined in this paper and its limitations are at least partially repeated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted in responses above, we have now included more methodological details in the main text of the paper, which we hope will make the intuition and assumptions involved in our analysis clearer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I'd like the code to better show or describe the model, I could not figure out the model details by looking at the code. It seems mostly just to be csv exporting for use with preexisting MPL code. A longer code readme would be helpful.</p>

<p>We have now updated the README on GitHub to include a conceptual overview of our inference approach, which references how each step is implemented in the code.</p>

<p>Figures 3 and 4 are somewhat 'messy'. Although I do not have a constructive suggestion here, I feel that with a little more effort maybe the authors could come up with something more clean.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is true that the mutation frequency dynamics are somewhat “choppy” and difficult to follow intuitively. To attempt to make these figures easier to parse visually, we have increased the transparency on the lines and added exponential smoothing to the mutation frequencies, resulting in smoother trajectories. The trajectories without smoothing are retained in Supplementary Fig. 3. Here we also note that this smoothing is for visual purposes only; we use the original frequency trajectories for inference, rather than the smoothed ones.</p>
