<title>Abstract</title><p>Cancer cells undergo widespread changes in epigenetic patterns that mediate cancer compromised gene expression programs during cancer progression. However, the alterations in higher-order genome organization in which these changes occur and their functional implications are less well understood. To explore how chromatin structure and epigenetic parameters of genome architecture changes during cancer progression at a fine scale and genome-wide, we generated high-resolution Micro-C contact maps in non-malignant, pre-cancerous, and metastatic MCF10 breast cancer epithelial cells. We profiled progression-associated reorganization of chromatin compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs), and chromatin loops, and also identified invariable chromatin features. We find large-scale compartmental shifts occur predominantly in early stages of cancer development, with more fine-scale structural changes in TADs and looping accumulating during the later transition to metastasis. We related these structural features to changes in gene expression, histone marks, and potential enhancers and found a large portion of differentially expressed genes physically connected to distal regulatory elements. While changes in chromatin loops were relatively rare during progression, differential loops were enriched for progression-associated genes, including those involved in proliferation, angiogenesis, and differentiation. Changes in either enhancer-promoter contacts or distal enhancer activity were accompanied by differential gene regulation, suggesting that changes in chromatin contacts are not necessary but can be sufficient for gene regulation. Together, our results demonstrate a functionally relevant connection between gene regulation and genome remodeling at many key genes during cancer progression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The eukaryotic genome is highly organized in the cell nucleus. Amongst the most prominent structural features are kilobase-sized chromatin loops, medium-scale topologically associating domains (TADs) and higher-order compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). How chromatin organization contributes to epigenetic control of gene regulation, including in physiological and pathological settings, such as cancer, remains only partially understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>A prominent mechanism to generate higher order chromatin structures is loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). During this process, the multi-component cohesin complex is loaded onto chromatin and, using its intrinsic molecular motor activity, extrudes chromatin bidirectionally along the genome to form a loop or a domain until it encounters the major chromatin architectural protein CTCF bound to convergently oriented binding sites. The encounter of cohesin with bound CTCF stalls the extrusion process and generates a chromatin loop or TAD. While loop extrusion has universally been implicated in formation of chromatin loops and domains, formation of chromatin features by other mechanisms have also been observed, especially at a smaller scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>A common property of higher order chromatin folding is that the resulting loops, domains and compartments, bring distal genome elements into spatial proximity and into proximity of regulatory elements to their target genes has been implicated in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). For example, it has been suggested that one function of TADs is to facilitate the interaction of regulatory elements, particularly gene enhancers, with their target genes located within the same TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Similarly, long-range interactions via chromatin loops are thought to be essential at some loci to bring gene enhancers into proximity to their target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). However, regulation of many gene loci also appears independent of chromatin organization, and enhancer-promoter proximity often does not correlate with gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). In fact, acute depletion of cohesin revealed genome-wide disruption of chromatin organization but surprisingly limited impact on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). A possible explanation for these divergent findings is that chromatin organization may be functionally more relevant to bring about changes in gene activity rather than maintenance of gene expression as suggested by several cohesin depletion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>Genome organization is likely relevant for cancer and its progression. Mutations in loop extrusion machinery, such as cohesin and the cohesin processivity factor NIPBL or at CTCF binding sites have been reported in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). In addition, many structural variants (SVs) such as deletions, duplications, and translocations, have been documented in various cancer subtypes where SVs and the ensuing reorganization around them can lead to aberrant gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these observations, the full extent of genome reorganization during cancer progression, and its functional consequences, remains largely unknown. Several studies primarily focused on large scale reorganizations have found changes in higher-order chromatin organization such as chromosome clustering and dynamic compartments, some of which correlated with changes in differentially expressed oncogenes and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Analysis of TADs in various cancers have found mixed results, with some studies pointing to increased TADs and gained boundaries and others observing more stable TAD organization or weakened boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Furthermore, cancer-associated structural variants, such as chromosomal translocations, have been related to altered gene expression, for example via enhancer-hijacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). However, how local chromatin loops and TADs are restructured during oncogenic reprogramming and how these changes relate to cancer-associated gene expression has not been well documented.</p>
<p>We address the question of how local and global chromatin organization changes during cancer progression, and how they related to cancer gene expression programs, by generating high-resolution Micro-C maps in the well-established MCF10 breast cancer progression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). This cancer model consists of three epithelial cell lines that were all originally derived from the same non-cancerous patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). MCF10A is an adherent epithelial pre-malignant cell line that spontaneously immortalized from the initial patient sample. Pre-malignant MCF10AT1 cells were derived from MCF10A cells by overexpressing a mutant Ha-Ras oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). When xenografted into immunocompromised mice, these cells form precancerous lesions. Metastatic MCF10CA1a cells are derived from metastatic tumors generated from xenografted MCF10AT1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). The MCF10 progression series represents a spectrum of cells that share a similar genetic background but are increasingly more cancerous and they have been widely used to study the genetic and epigenetic changes that occur during cancer progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, comparing fine-scale chromatin organization and other epigenetic features in the MCF10 cancer progression model has allowed us to identify stage-specific differences in genome reorganization and relate them to changes in gene expression, including of cancer progression-associated genes. Our results provide novel insights into the principles of chromatin-mediated gene regulation and into the dynamic structure-function relationship potentially contributing to genome regulation in cancer.</p>

<p>We identified features of chromatin organization at several levels, including large-scale reorganizations of compartments, medium-scale changes in topologically associating domains (TADs), and fine-scale changes in chromatin loops (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We assigned A and B compartments using CALDER at a resolution of 10kb, TADs using SpectralTAD combined with FAN-C boundary insulation score calculations at 10kb, and loops using SIP at 5- and 10kb resolution (see Methods for details). Each cell type had similar percentages of the genome assigned to the active A (47.1-50.2%) or inactive B (49.7-52.9%) compartment, with the two cancer cell types MCF10AT1 and MCF10CA1a having a slightly higher proportion of A compartment designations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Similarly, we detected a similar number of TADs (between 7,459-7,825) and chromatin loops (between 15,713-17,332) in each cell line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-E</xref>). Although the three cell lines are karyotypically similar due to their shared genetic background, they contain large-scale chromosomal duplications and translocations which were identified by SKY karyotyping analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. 1B</xref>), and numerical chromosome aberrations based on SKY and Micro-C sequencing depth analysis were included in the analysis of all chromatin features (see Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. 1C</xref>). After this correction, chromatin loop counts showed a high degree of reproducibility between technical and biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. 1D</xref>). We used this deep dataset to characterize structural features that are reshaped during cancer progression.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cancer progression reorganizes compartments, TADs, and chromatin loops</title>
<p>Comparative analysis across the three cell types identified significant changes in all major chromatin features during cancer progression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2A-B</xref>, Supp. Table 2-4).</p>
<p>At a large-scale, we detected changes in compartmentalization. We observe a general shift towards the more active A compartment in early cancer progression, with a larger portion of genomic regions becoming more A-like (31.0%) compared to more B-like (26.0%) in the transition from MCF10A to MCF10AT1, while these changes are more balanced in the later transition from MCF10AT1 to MCF10CA1a (30.0% and 30.6%, respectively). Interactions within the most A-like and B-like compartments were predominant in the pre-cancerous MCF10A cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). However, in MCF10AT1 and MCF10CA1a, stronger interactions appear between more intermediate regions, suggesting a greater degree of intermixing that is consistent with increased compartmental heterogeneity which appears to occur early during cancer progression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>).</p>
<p>TAD boundaries represent genomic regions where upstream and downstream sequences are partially insulated from one another, with fewer contacts between them than within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). We detected a total of 13,231 TADs across all three cell types, with 17,097 unique boundaries. TADs detected range in size from 190kb to as large as 3.8 Mb, with a mean of 663kb and a median of 460kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2C</xref>). Assessing changes in insulation score (IS) at TAD boundaries revealed 3,392 (19.8%) boundaries where the degree of insulation changed significantly over the course of cancer progression. Because individual boundaries may be simultaneously used by multiple TADs, the total number of TADs which changed during progression is 5,084 (38.5%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). There are nearly three times as many boundary changes between later stages in cancer progression (1,693 differential boundaries between MCF10AT1 and MCF10CA1a) than early stages (567 between MCF10A and MCF10AT1). Interestingly, TAD boundaries that gained or lost insulation during progression showed a significant enrichment for weakened boundaries (71.2%) with far fewer boundaries exhibiting increased insulation strength as cancer progressed (28.8%; permutation test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2D</xref>). This late-stage weakening of boundaries may reflect a more heterogeneous cell population as cancer progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>).</p>
<p>Chromatin loops are formed by two distal genomic regions that are in more frequent contact than their surrounding or intervening sequences, indicated by higher contact frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). We found 29,205 chromatin loops across all three cell lines, ranging in size from 50 Kb to 2 Mb, with a mean of 402kb and median of 270 Kb in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2C</xref>). 77.6% of loop anchors coincided with CTCF peaks, representing 95.0% of loops with at least one anchor bound by CTCF, and CTCF-bound loops were stronger and longer than non-CTCF loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2E-F</xref>). Loop boundaries often overlapped with TAD boundaries with 52.4% of TADs consisting of loop domains across all cell lines. However, a majority (73.0%) of chromatin loops did not include TADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2G</xref>). TADs without loop interactions at their boundaries tended to be larger, while loops without TADs can be found at all sizes but are enriched for shorter loops (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. 2H</xref>).</p>

<p>To identify loops that changed significantly during cancer progression, we assessed changes in contact frequency among every loop in each cell type, correcting for karyotypic differences that result in differences in coverage between cell lines (see Methods). We identified 1,469 chromatin loops that change significantly over the course of cancer progression, including both weakened and strengthened contacts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), representing 5.0% of all identified loops. Unlike TADs there was a more balanced number of changes between early (1,004 differential loops between MCF10A and MCF10AT1) and late (1,204 between MCF10AT1 and MCF10CA1a) progression stages, as well as between strengthened (679 loops, 46.2% of all differential loops) and weakened loops (790 loops, 53.8% of all differential loops). Interestingly, only a small portion (19.0%) of differential loops were accompanied by changes in CTCF binding (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. 2I</xref>). Motif analysis of differential loop anchors revealed only weak motifs of various transcription factors enriched at the boundaries of gained and lost loops, although occupancy did not appear high enough to explain most of the changes we observe (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. 2J</xref>). Weakened loops were often associated with a decrease in H3K27ac, a mark of active enhancers, consistent with the notion that active enhancers can help recruit loop extrusion machinery (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. 2K</xref>; see below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results demonstrate significant global changes in genome organization during cancer progression across multiple scales from chromatin compartments to loops.</p>

<title>Persistent chromatin loops connect cancer progression-regulated genes with distal regulatory features</title>
<p>To explore the functional role of chromatin loops, we related them to gene expression and potential regulatory regions. We identified 17,185 expressed genes across all three cell types using RNA-Seq (see Methods) and 52,953 potential enhancers as defined by overlapping histone H3K27ac ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq accessibility peaks, commonly used to identify enhancer regions (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>).</p>
<p>Approximately half of chromatin loops featured some combination of active gene promoters and enhancers within 10kb of loop anchors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We found that chromatin loops that connect two features (either enhancers or promoters; mean length 251-280 kb) are typically shorter than those that contain only one feature (mean length 338-372 kb) or none (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>; mean length 495 kb; T-test p-value for all comparisons &lt; 2.2e-16), with promoter-promoter loops being the smallest on average (mean length 251 kb). Interestingly, enhancer-promoter and enhancer-enhancer loops (mean counts 8.2, 8.2, respectively) were stronger than promoter-promoter loops (mean counts 7.3) despite being longer on average, suggesting that epigenetic signatures associated with active enhancers may support stronger contacts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>; T-test p-value for both comparisons &lt; 2.6e-7).</p>
<p>We then explored how differentially expressed genes relate to long-range chromatin interactions. We identified 8,840 differentially expressed genes across all pairwise comparisons in the MCF10 cancer progression (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. 3A-B</xref>). A similar number of genes changed in later stages of cancer development (4,968 between MCF10AT1 and MCF10CA1a) compared to early progression (4,773 between MCF10A and MCF10AT1). Reassuringly, as expected from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), genes associated with epithelial morphogenesis and cell adhesion were upregulated early during progression, whereas regulation of differentiation, tissue development, metabolism, and signal transduction genes was observed during later stages of progression (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. 4B</xref>). These changes are consistent with the development of an intermediate and diverse pre-cancerous state early on during progression, while late changes are known to facilitate metastasis and support the epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like transition observed phenotypically among the progression series (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. 3C-D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>).</p>

<p>To understand the regulatory modes of action of genes which were differentially expressed during cancer progression, we determined if they had gained or lost the activity-associated H3K27ac mark at their promoters or at distally looped enhancers. We found that while many genes only featured a corresponding change in H3K27ac at their promoter (53.9% of upregulated and 28.6% of downregulated genes), a large percentage also showed changes in distal enhancer activity (28.8% of upregulated and 17.4% of downregulated genes), suggesting that enhancer loops may be playing an important functional role in control of these genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, F</xref>). Comparing the direction of fold-change for genes and promoter H3K27ac, distal H3K27ac, or contact frequency with distal enhancers using Fisher’s Exact test revealed odds ratios significantly higher than 1 for all comparisons (9.4, 2.2, and 1.2, respectively for changes between MCF10A and MCF10CA1a), but that there was a stronger association with promoters than enhancers or loop strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. 3E-F</xref>). This trend was similar for genes that were differentially regulated both early and late, suggesting that the role of chromatin loops is consistent across all stages of cancer progression.</p>
<p>Comparing the changes in acetylation at all gene promoters and distal regulatory regions revealed that upregulated genes exhibit a significant increase in H3K27ac at distally looped enhancers, as well as a significant loss of repressive H3K27me3 marks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>; T-test p-value for both &lt; 2.2e-16). This trend is less clear for downregulated genes, which feature both gained and lost H3K27ac at both enhancers and promoters as well as both gained and lost H3K27me3 at distal regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). These results suggest that the static chromatin structures observed during the cancer progression process contribute to the control of differentially regulated genes, particularly among upregulated genes.</p>
<p>Given that only 5% of loops changed significantly during progression (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), it is not surprising that only a small percentage of differentially expressed genes exhibited significant changes in chromatin contacts with distal enhancers (2.1% of upregulated and 2.2% of downregulated genes; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, F</xref>). However, on average there is no significant change in contact frequency between gene promoters and distal enhancers. This trend was similar between both early- and late-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. 3G</xref>). Most differentially expressed genes are in regions where chromatin structure is essentially stable, reinforcing that persistent structural changes are not universally required for gene regulation. For example, the <italic>SPRY1</italic> gene, which regulates cell growth and differentiation and has been shown to be upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>), is upregulated between MCF10AT1 and MCF10CA1a, and is statically looped to distal enhancers that gain H3K27ac (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>SCNN1G</italic> gene, which encodes for a subunit of a sodium channel and is suppressed in head and neck squamous cell cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>), is downregulated between MCF10AT1 and MCF10CA1a, and is statically looped to distal enhancers that lose H3K27ac (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). In both cases, the contact frequency remains relatively constant despite changes in distal enhancer acetylation.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results show that changes in gene expression are not necessarily accompanied by structural changes, and they suggest that stable chromatin loops may facilitate cancer progression by providing a pre-existing structure through which differentially regulated distal enhancers can act on target genes.</p>

<title>Changes in enhancer acetylation and enhancer-promoter contact are associated with changes in gene expression</title>
<p>To begin to distinguish the effects of enhancer-promoter contact and chromatin looping from enhancer activity effects, we compared gene expression changes at looped and non-looped enhancer-promoter pairs. To do so, we used the activity-by-contact (ABC) model to predict functional enhancer-promoter pairs. ABC combines estimates of enhancer accessibility and activity from ATAC-Seq and H3K27ac ChIP-Seq with enhancer-promoter contact frequency from Micro-C data to generate an estimate of the likelihood of functional enhancer-gene interactions (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). This method allowed us to identify distal regulatory regions that are functionally linked to gene promoters without specifically requiring overlap with chromatin loops. For example, an enhancer and promoter may be in high contact as measured by Micro-C because they overlap with loop anchors, or because they are at close genomic distance.</p>
<p>Applying the ABC model to our data identified 150,056 potential enhancer-promoter pairs across all three cell types. Of these, 53.4% are also promoters of other genes, 23.7% are within the bodies of other genes, and 22.9% are intergenic, and range in distance from 750 to 5M base pairs away from target gene promoters (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig. 4A</xref>). To better understand the relationship between contact frequency, enhancer activity, and gene expression, we asked how changes in enhancer activity or contact relate to gene expression at target promoters.</p>
<p>Pairwise comparison of the MCF10 progression lines indicated that changes in both contact frequency and enhancer activity appear to drive changes in enhancer-promoter networks predicted by ABC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). For example, observing potential enhancers with changes in H3K27ac between MCF10CA1a and MCF10A reveals that these enhancers also exhibit a change in contact frequency and are associated with upregulation of target genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We also find that changes in contact frequency are associated with increases in H3K27ac and correlate with higher gene expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). These results show that not only changes in either contact frequency and enhancer activity correlate with increased gene expression, but they also correlate with each other, suggesting a potentially linked functional role during enhancer-promoter communication.</p>
<p>To then relate enhancer-promoter pairs to chromatin loops and to orthogonally assess whether chromatin loops are acting as a functional bridge for active enhancers, we compared looped and non-looped enhancer-promoter pairs. Enhancer-promoter pairs that have changes in distal H3K27ac and are supported by chromatin loops correlated with changes in gene regulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This effect was stronger than distance-matched non-looped enhancer-promoter pairs, but similar to contact-matched non-looped pairs, suggesting that increased contact frequency caused by loop extrusion may contribute to the stronger correlation with gene expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>). Contact-matched non-looped pairs were closer on average to the looped pairs of similar contact frequency, while distance-matched non-looped pairs were in less-frequent contact than looped pairs of similar genomic distance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparing the distributions of target gene fold-change for these various sets of enhancer-promoter pairs reveals several trends (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). First, pairs with significant changes in contact have a larger mean gene fold-change than pairs with significant changes in activity, suggesting that either can contribute to changes in enhancer-promoter functional pairing but that contact may have a particularly strong impact. Second, looped enhancer-promoter pairs have a comparable or larger mean gene fold-change to pairs with changes in activity or contact, suggesting again that chromatin loops may support functional enhancer-promoter pairs. Lastly, looped pairs have a similar mean gene fold-change as contact-matched pairs, which in turn have a higher mean gene fold-change than distance-matched pairs, suggesting that the increased contact frequency that chromatin loops provide to enhancer-promoter pairs may be a driving force for the functional connection. These trends hold true for all (tested) pairwise comparisons between cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Suppl Fig. 4B-C</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings demonstrate that not all gene regulatory changes are accompanied by chromatin reorganization, but when it occurs reorganization appears to facilitate functional changes.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Changes in chromatin looping are enriched for progression-associated differentially expressed genes</title>
<p>We next explored how changes in chromatin looping may functionally contribute to gene regulation during cancer progression. To do so, we compared changes in chromatin loop contacts to alterations in expression of progression-associated genes. Overall, while only a small subset of gene promoters overlaps with the anchors of differential chromatin loops (507 genes, 3.0% of expressed genes), those that do are significantly enriched for genes that are differentially expressed during cancer progression based on permutation analysis (331 differentially expressed genes, 65.3% of all differentially looped genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supp. Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>We asked whether there was a relationship between the formation or loss of loops and differential expression of these loop-associated genes. We indeed find that differential loops are more likely to change in the same direction as the gene (i.e. increased contact frequency with distal regions associated with increased gene expression) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). The fold-change of differential expressed genes which also showed differential loping were significantly higher than a random sampling of differentially expressed genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). For example, of 3,261 genes that were differentially upregulated between MCF10A and MCF10CA1a, loops were significantly strengthened at 98 of these genes and significantly weakened at 31. Similarly, of 3,088 downregulated genes, 65 genes overlap weakened loop anchors and 41 genes overlap strengthened loop anchors. In contrast, the number of expected genes at strengthened or weakened loops for a random sampling of genes this size is 38 and 32, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supp. Fig. 5B-C</xref>). We also find a subset of chromatin loops and genes changed in opposite directions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The genes whose changes in expression correlate with changes in looping are enriched for several cancer-relevant pathways, such as morphogenesis, differentiation, and proliferation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>).</p>
<p>In total, we identified 127 unique genes upregulated in areas that experience increased chromatin contacts, either at loop anchors or within existing structures. As an example, the promoter of the <italic>COL12A1</italic> gene, which encodes a collagen protein known to be associated with aggressive and mesenchymal phenotypes, overlaps a loop boundary that is very weak in MCF10A cells where <italic>COL12A1</italic> is not expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>). As <italic>COL12A1</italic> gene expression is upregulated during progression, contacts increase at a distal region 310 kb away, and H3K27ac and accessibility also increase at these likely distal regulatory regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, we observe 123 unique genes that are downregulated during oncogenic progression. One example is <italic>WNT5A</italic> which encodes for an important signaling protein and is downregulated in breast cancer and across MCF10A progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). Similar to <italic>COL12A1</italic>, the promoter of <italic>WNT5A</italic> is involved in many differential distal regulatory contacts, ranging in distance from 240 to 640 kb (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Unlike <italic>COL12A1</italic>, these contacts are strongest in MCF10A cells and severely weaken in MCF10AT1 and MCF10CA1a cells. Accompanying these changes in contact, the distal regulatory regions that appear to support <italic>WNT5A</italic> in MCF10A cells become deacetylated and decrease in accessibility.</p>

<title>Genome reorganization occurs at cancer-relevant genes and is accompanied by proximal and distal changes in histone marks</title>
<p>Finally, we aimed to comprehensively explore the genes that are differentially regulated in areas that also have strong changes in chromatin looping, to better understand the potential regulatory mechanisms at play.</p>
<p>A locus-by-locus view of gene and loop fold-change allows us to view the relationship between changes in expression and structure among each pairwise comparison of cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-C</xref>). While we see that a majority of genes have a corresponding change in looping (i.e. up-regulated genes overlapping strengthened loops), we observe that the percentage of corresponding changes increases in the later stages of cancer progression. For example, the percentage of differential loop-gene pairs where the gene overlaps at least one gained loop is 47.5% and 69.9% among genes up-regulated in MCF10A compared to MCF10AT1 and MCF10CA1a, respectively, 66.7% and 79.6% among genes up-regulated in MCF10AT1 compared to MCF10A and MCF10AT1, respectively, and 70.7% and 58.0% among genes up-regulated in MCF10CA1a compared to MCF10A and MCF10AT1, respectively. This may indicate that the regulatory impacts of changes in chromatin looping occur over longer timescales, or that genes impacted by changes in chromatin structure may be more common in metastatic cells. We do not, however, find any correlation between the magnitude of loop fold-change and gene fold-change.</p>

<p>To better understand how changes in looping are related to gene expression, we compared patterns of gene expression, promoter H3K27 acetylation, and distal enhancer H3K27 acetylation or trimethylation at looped genes that change in either the same or opposite direction as the loops they overlap (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supp. Fig. 5D-E</xref>). These two histone H3 modifications are mutually exclusive and have opposite effects on gene expression, marking enhancers and silencers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>). Both modifications are able to impact distal gene expression via chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>).</p>
<p>Up-regulated genes between MCF10A and MCF10CA1a show similar epigenetic signatures at both proximal and distal regions, regardless of whether the loop they overlap gets stronger or weaker (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Promoter regions gain H3K27ac, while distal regions gain H3K27ac and lose H3K27me3. There is however a significant difference in the extent of distal changes depending on the loop direction, with strengthened loops exhibiting a significantly higher increase in distal H3K27ac and a decrease in H3K37me3 marks. This behavior further supports the notion that these distally looped regulatory regions are important functional elements. Down-regulated genes show distinctly different signatures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Genes that overlap with weakened loop anchors show decreased promoter H3K27ac and distal H3K27ac and increased distal H3K27me3, consistent with signatures typically associated with reduced gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>). Interestingly, genes that overlap strengthened loop anchors show different patterns, with a gain in promoter H3K27ac and loss of distal H3K27me3 repressive marks. We conclude that expression of a subset of progression-associated genes is strongly correlated with loop formation. These trends are similar but weaker for genes that change between different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supp. Fig. 5D-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our genome-wide analysis of structural and regulatory changes during MCF10A cancer progression has highlighted hundreds of restructured regions where cancer-relevant genes are differentially regulated. These findings suggest that, while relatively rare, changes in chromatin looping may be associated with regulatory changes that drive expression of hundreds of oncogenes during cancer progression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Multiple levels of chromatin organization and integration with epigenetic parameters contribute to regulation of gene expression. We have identified dynamic chromatin organizational changes on multiple scales across breast cancer progression using the MCF10A model system. By comparing both a pre-malignant and metastatic cell line to non-cancerous epithelial cells we were able to detect both early- and late-stage changes as well as similarities in genome structure and relate them to gene expression changes, including many cancer-relevant genes.</p>
<p>We found that compartmental shifts occur more often in early stages of cancer development. This behavior is consistent with previous studies that have shown intermixing of chromatin A and B compartments in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). The general shift towards more active compartments during cancer progression may reflect a broader epigenetic landscape and the greater heterogeneity in gene expression within cancer cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>).</p>
<p>On a finer scale, structural changes in TADs occur more often during later stages of metastasis. We also find an abundance of weakened TAD boundaries in MCF10 breast cancer progression compared with boundaries that gain insulation. This finding is in line with previous studies which have shown TAD weakening in triple-negative breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), but is contrary to other observations which have suggested that prostate cancer is associated with the formation of many additional TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), or findings of minimal changes in TAD structure in colorectal or breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). The variety of observations on TAD structure in cancer may reflect the differences in the types of cancer samples analyzed or the analysis methods used. In the MCF10 model, we were able to detect subtle changes in insulation score at TAD boundaries, weakening of which could again support a more heterogeneous structure in more aggressive cancer stages.</p>
<p>Chromatin loops functionally connect gene promoters to distal regulatory elements. In the MCF10 model, many genes differentially regulated during cancer progression are associated with chromatin loops shared between all three cell lines, but show changes in distal enhancer H3K27ac and H3K27me3. These trends were stronger with up-regulated genes, suggesting that we may need to explore different epigenetic signatures to better understand how chromatin structure may influence repression. Activity-by-contact analysis showed that looped enhancer-promoter pairs also exhibit greater correlation between distal enhancer H3K27ac and gene expression than non-looped enhancers due to their increased contact frequency. These findings suggest that persistent chromatin loops that do not change during cancer progression nevertheless have functional relevance and that they do so by bridging enhancers to target gene promoters.</p>
<p>Activity-by-contact analysis also revealed that subtle changes in chromatin contact can contribute to the rewiring of enhancer-promoter regulatory connections. Enhancer-promoter pairs that exhibit changes in contact correlated with stronger changes in target gene expression than those with only changes in activity, in line with the concept that contact with distal regulatory elements is an important component of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>). We also found that changes in chromatin contact are associated with more modest changes in activity, and vice-versa. This correlation between enhancer activity and enhancer-promoter contact further points to a functional link between the two. Together, these results suggest that both contact frequency and activity contribute to enhancer-promoter connectivity.</p>
<p>Strong changes in contact at chromatin loops are relatively rare across cancer progression, but many clear examples do exist, and they are notably enriched for differentially expressed genes. Interestingly, only a small portion of differential loops can be explained by changes in CTCF binding at anchors, suggesting other forces may be influencing their contact frequency. Loss of H3K27ac can be seen at the anchors of lost loops, consistent with the idea that active enhancers can help recruit cohesin to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Therefore, some weakened loops might be explained by a loss of H3K27ac which leads to a loss of cohesin at that region.</p>
<p>We also found that genes at differential loops are more likely to be differentially regulated in the same direction as the change in loop strength. This supports the notion that a subset of genes may be regulated in a structure-dependent manner. This interpretation is in line with previous observations which have shown a subset of genes to be sensitive to cohesin or NIPBL depletion which disrupts chromatin loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>). Importantly, these findings suggest this subset of structure-sensitive genes may include many with direct relevance to breast cancer progression.</p>
<p>Epigenetic signatures at gene promoters and distal regions differed based on the direction of gene change. Up-regulated genes consistently showed a gain of active-associated H3K27ac marks at both promoters and distal regions, and a loss of distal repressive H3K27me3 marks. These changes were shared between static, strengthened, and weakened loops, although up-regulated genes at strengthened loops had stronger distal changes. These findings are consistent with the loops functionally supporting interactions with distal enhancers via increase contact. However, down-regulated genes showed more complex patterns. Fewer down-regulated genes could be explained by changes in H3K27ac or H3K27me3 at the promoter or distal regions, with over half of down-regulated genes having no clear epigenetic driver, compared to only 15% of up-regulated genes. This suggests that these histone marks are not sufficient to explain down-regulated genes as well as they can explain up-regulated genes. Down-regulated genes at differential loops also showed opposite patterns based on the direction of loop change; weakened loops showed loss of distal H3K27ac and gain of H3K27me3 consistent with an inactivated enhancer, while strengthened loops showed the opposite. Additional studies will be required to fully understand the repressive mechanisms in this system and how they relate to chromatin structure.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. Based on its largely correlative nature, we are unable to determine the causal relationships of chromatin structure changes at the loci of differentially expressed genes. Follow-up studies exploring any of the hundreds of gene loci identified here as possibly being contact-dependent could help elucidate these relationships. Additionally, as a population-level assay, Micro-C is only able to provide aggregate data across an entire population of cells. To address how cell-to-cell heterogeneity contributes to some of the functional relationships we observe, and whether that heterogeneity is occurring at a cellular or population level, we would need to apply single-cell sequencing or imaging-based approaches. These questions will be the subjects of future studies.</p>
<p>Taken together, using the powerful MCF10 breast cancer model, we have generated a rich genomic dataset of structural and functional changes in the genome during breast cancer progression. Our data uncovers new insights into the structure function relationship in gene regulation and into the role of genome organization during malignant breast cancer progression.</p>

<title>Micro-C library preparation</title>
<p>Cells were frozen and pellets of 1M cells were used for Micro-C library preparation. The Micro-C library was prepared using the Dovetail® Micro-C Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the chromatin was fixed with 0.3M disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) and 37% formaldehyde in the nucleus. The cross-linked chromatin was then digested in situ with micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Following digestion, cells were lysed with 20% SDS to extract the chromatin fragments and the chromatin fragments were bound to Chromatin Capture Beads. Next, the chromatin ends were repaired and ligated to a biotinylated bridge adapter followed by proximity ligation of adapter-containing ends. After proximity ligation, the crosslinks were reversed, the associated proteins were degraded, and the DNA was purified then converted into a sequencing library using Illumina-compatible adaptors. Biotin-containing fragments were isolated using streptavidin beads prior to PCR amplification. Each library was sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq platform to generate 240-340 million 2 x 150 bp read pairs (average depth of 280M reads). Mico-C libraries were prepared by Dovetail Genomics (Scotts Valley, CA).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript, Metz Reed and colleagues present an exceptionally thorough analysis of three-dimensional genome reorganization during breast cancer progression using the well-characterized MCF10 model system. The integration of high-resolution Micro-C contact maps with multi-omics profiling provides compelling insights into stage-specific dynamics of chromatin compartments, TAD boundaries, and looping events. The discovery that stable chromatin loops enable epigenetic reprogramming of cancer genes, while structural changes selectively drive metastasis-associated pathways, represents a significant conceptual advance. This work substantially deepens our understanding of genome topology in malignancy. To further enhance this impactful study, we offer the following constructive suggestions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work sets a benchmark for integrative 3D genomics in oncology. Its methodological sophistication and conceptual advances establish a new paradigm for studying nuclear architecture in disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major Issues</p>
<p>(1) Functional tests would strengthen the observed links between structure and gene changes. For example, the COL12A1 gene loop formation correlates with its increased expression. Disrupting this loop using CRISPR-dCas9 at chr6 position 75280 kb could prove whether the loop causes COL12A1 activation. Such experiments would turn strong correlations into clear mechanisms.</p>
<p>(2) The H3K27ac looping idea needs deeper validation. Data suggests H3K27ac loss weakens loops without affecting CTCF. Testing how cohesin proteins interact with H3K27ac-modified sites would clarify this process. Degron systems could rapidly remove H3K27ac to observe real-time effects. Also, the AP-1 motifs found at dynamic loop sites deserve functional tests. Knocking down AP-1 factors might show if they control loop formation.</p>
<p>(3) Connecting findings to patient data would boost clinical relevance. The MCF10 model is excellent for controlled studies. Checking if TAD boundary weakening occurs in actual patient metastases would show real-world importance. Comparing primary and metastatic tumor samples from the same patients could reveal new structural biomarkers. If tissue is scarce, testing cancer cells with added stroma cells might mimic tumor environment effects.</p>
<p>Minor Issues</p>
<p>Adding a clear definition for static loops would help readers. For example, state that static loops show less than 10 percent contact change across replicates. In the ABC model analysis, removing promoter regions from the enhancer list would focus results on true long-range interactions. Briefly noting why this study sees TAD weakening while other cancer types show different patterns would provide useful context.</p>

<p>Employing the MCF10 breast-cancer progression series, the authors integrate high-resolution Micro-C chromatin-conformation capture with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to delineate the sequential reorganization of compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs), and long-range loops across benign, pre-neoplastic, and metastatic states, and couple these 3D alterations to gene expression and enhancer activity. Four principal findings emerge: (i) largely static chromatin frameworks still gate differential gene output, with up-regulated loci most affected; (ii) enhancer-promoter contact strength covaries with transcriptional amplitude; (iii) 127 genes gain expression concomitant with increased chromatin contacts; and (iv) progression-associated genes acquire altered histone marks at distal enhancers that remain tethered by stable loops. While the conclusions are broadly supported, methodological and analytical refinements are required.</p>
<p>(1) Model representativeness.</p>
<p>
The long-term culture-adapted MCF10 genome harbours extensive aneuploidies and translocations. Validation of key COL12A1/WNT5A loop dynamics in an independent breast-cancer line (e.g., MDA-MB-231, T47D) or in patient-derived organoids/PDX models would strengthen generalizability.</p>
<p>(2) The study remains purely correlative; no perturbation experiments are conducted to demonstrate causal roles of chromatin loops on gene expression. CRISPR interference (CRISPR-Cas9-KRAB/HDAC) or enhancer deletion/inversion should be applied to 3-5 pivotal loops (e.g., COL12A1, WNT5A) to test their impact on target-gene expression and cellular phenotypes (e.g., proliferation, migration).</p>
<p>(3) The manuscript lacks integration with clinical datasets. Integrate TCGA-BRCA data to assess whether elevated COL12A1/WNT5A expression associates with overall survival (OS) or distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors tackle an important problem: defining the topological changes that occur during tumorigenesis. To study this, they use an established stepwise cell model of breast cancer. A strength of their study is a careful, robust differential analysis of topological features across each cell state, which is presented clearly and rigorously. They define changes in compartmentalization, TAD structure, and chromatin looping. Intriguingly, when the authors integrate differential gene expression with chromatin looping, they see that most differentially regulated genes are not involved in loop changes, suggesting that changes in promoter or enhancer chromatin marks may play a bigger role in regulating transcription than differential loops. The differential topology analysis and its integration with transcription is very well done- one of the best versions of this I have read in the 3D genome field! However, the paper is framed largely as a cancer biology study, and it teaches us much less about this. I am worried that some of the trends for each topologic feature are not going to be consistent across the pre-malignant-malignant-metastatic spectrum and would like the authors to soften some of their claims a bit regarding how this clarifies our understanding of cancer evolution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major Concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The integration of gene expression and chromatin loops is intriguing. The authors' differential analysis, however, omits consideration of genes that are on and simply further upregulated versus genes that transition on/off or off/on. It would be nice to see the authors break out looping patterns for these two different patterns of regulation, as it may be instructive regarding the rules for how EP loops govern transcription.</p>
<p>(2) Given the paucity of differential loops at the majority of genes whose expression changes, the authors should examine chromatin subcompartments, as these may associate more with differential transcription.</p>
<p>(3) The authors could push their TAD analysis further by integrating it with transcription. Can they look at genes and their enhancers that span these altered boundaries to see if these shifts impact transcription?</p>
<p>(4) The progression of cancer critically goes from a benign -&gt; pre-malignant -&gt; malignant -&gt; metastatic series of steps. The AT1 line is described as 'premalignant' and thus the authors' series omits a malignant line. While I think adding such a sample is an unreasonable request at this point (as it would have had to have been studied in 'batch' with these other samples), the authors should acknowledge that they omit this step and spend some time discussing the genetic, morphologic, and phenotypic features for their 3 conditions. The images in Figure 1S aren't particularly useful- they don't tell the reader that these cells are malignant/benign. The karyotypic data are intriguing but not fully analyzed, so it is hard to know what true phenotype these cells represent. For example, malignant means DCIS/invasive carcinoma - so then what does this pre-malignant cell model represent? The described alteration in the AT1 line is a Ras oncogene, so in some sense, the transition to this line really is just +/- Ras. The authors could spend some time thinking about the effects of Ras specifically on the 3D genome.</p>
