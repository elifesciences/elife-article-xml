<title>Summary</title><p>Endometriosis is a common and debilitating neuro-inflammatory disorder that is associated with chronic pain. Definitive diagnosis is based on the presence of endometrial-like tissue (lesions) in sites outside the uterus. Kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) is a mitochondrial enzyme of tryptophan metabolism that regulates inflammation and immunity. Here, we show that KMO is expressed in epithelial cells in human endometriosis tissue lesions and in corresponding lesions in a mouse model of endometriosis. In mice, oral treatment with the potent KMO inhibitor KNS898 induced a biochemical state of KMO blockade with accumulation of kynurenine, diversion to kynurenic acid and ablation of 3-hydroxykynurenine production. In the mouse model of endometriosis, KMO inhibition improved histological outcomes and endometriosis pain-like behaviours, even when KNS898 treatment commenced one week after initiation of lesions. Taken together, these results suggest that KMO blockade is a promising new non-hormonal therapeutic modality for endometriosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endometriosis is a life-altering condition that affects approximately 10% of females. It is an oestrogen-dependent neuroinflammatory disorder associated with debilitating pelvic pain, excessive fatigue, gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms, and infertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Worldwide, 200 million prevalent cases are forecast by 2026. Endometriosis is defined by the presence of endometrial-like tissue (‘lesions’) outside the uterus. Physiological hormonal fluctuations in women induce cyclical episodes of cell proliferation, inflammation, injury, and repair within lesions that favour fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. We and others have identified metabolic dysfunction in cells associated with development of endometriosis lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. At present, therapeutic options are largely limited to surgery (that often needs to be repeated) or medical therapies that target hormonal activity with resultant side effects (block conception, menopausal symptoms)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Patient surveys consistently show frustration with the lack of available treatments that can give long term relief from symptoms including pain, low mood and bloating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Analysis of recent clinical trials directed at endometriosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> has highlighted an unmet need for new, non-hormonal approaches to symptom relief. The studies in the current paper have addressed this need by focusing on an enzyme that is known to play a key role in inflammatory processes that are implicated in the aetiology of endometriosis, but which has not previously been investigated as a target.</p>
<p>Our proposed solution to this unmet medical need is by targeting the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO). KMO is a critical regulator of inflammation at multiple organ sites that acts by altering metabolic flux through the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. KMO is known to be expressed in non-pathological endometrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, but whether KMO is over-expressed in endometriosis lesions and linked to the severity of inflammation remains to be determined. KMO has been identified as a critical step in converting kynurenine to the cytotoxic metabolite, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK), that is an oxidative stressor, causes protein cross-linking, and regulates the immune-metabolic interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Although there is no specific information about a direct role of KMO in endometriosis, there is evidence of dysregulated tryptophan metabolism in a recent study using a preclinical non-human primate model of endometriosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and increased kynurenine pathway flux at the immune-metabolic interface between stromal cells and NK immune cells in endometriosis lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>At present, there is a scientific rationale for KMO inhibition in endometriosis, but it remains to be shown in preclinical experiments whether KMO inhibition is efficacious in decreasing lesion volume or behavioural symptoms which are used as a surrogate for pain responses in model systems. KNS898 is a highly specific small molecule KMO inhibitor with potential for use by women with endometriosis, based on favourable characteristics for oral development in terms of bioavailability and predicted half-life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. KNS898 is a competitive inhibitor of kynurenine substrate at the active site of KMO with a pIC50 of 8.8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. We propose that KMO inhibition is a novel therapeutic strategy for endometriosis and, if successful, we will make a significant positive impact for women with this painful, disabling condition. The aim of this project was to obtain proof-of-concept for KMO inhibition as a novel therapy for endometriosis. Specifically, we sought to explore the expression of KMO in biobanked human endometrial and endometriosis lesion tissues, confirm target inhibition of KMO by KNS898 in mice, and define the preclinical efficacy of KNS898 in improving clinical features of disease (specifically hyperalgesia and altered cage behaviour) and reducing endometriosis lesion volume in an experimental mouse model of endometriosis.</p>

<title>KMO is expressed in human eutopic endometrium and human endometriosis tissue lesions</title>
<p>To explore whether we could detect variations between expression of KMO in endometrium (eutopic) within the uterus and a variety of lesions obtained from patients, we conducted detailed immunohistochemistry with a primary antibody specific for KMO. On fixed tissue sections of normal human endometrium KMO expression was most striking in epithelial cells lining the glands (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, insert B) with lower levels in the luminal layer (insert C). Notably expression in the glands was not uniform (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). KMO was also strongly immunopositive in human peritoneal endometriosis lesions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>), and evidently mostly localised to the epithelial tissues surrounding the distended endometrial gland-like structures (DEGLS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). Expression in the stromal compartment appeared variable. In human ovarian endometriosis lesions, KMO was present at low expression levels in the mesothelial layers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>). Duplex immunohistochemistry with cell phenotype markers CD68 (macrophages) did not show KMO colocalising with these immune cells (data not shown)</p>

<title>Oral KNS898 inhibits KMO in mice</title>
<p>Next, we established that oral dosing of KNS898 by gavage in mice resulted in inhibition of KMO. Using n=3 mice per group, we administered KNS898 at 0.01 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 25 mg/kg twice daily (b.d.) in vehicle for seven days, as described. Plasma drug levels and metabolite concentrations are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. KNS898 dosed at 0.01 mg/kg b.d. resulted in a mean (± S.E.M.) plasma drug level of 0.18 ± 0.01 ng/mL, 5 mg/kg resulted in 88.8 ± 22.6 μg/mL, and 25 mg/kg gave 483.9 ± 84.0 μg/mL. The difference between groups was statistically significant by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test (P = 0.001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). KMO blockade with KNS898 was clearly measurable. A backlog in the KMO substrate KYN was evident: KNS898 dosed at 0.01 mg/kg b.d. resulted in a mean (± S.E.M.) plasma level of KYN of 339 ± 39 ng/mL, 5 mg/kg resulted in 4940 ± 483 ng/mL, and 25 mg/kg gave 3682 ± 634 ng/mL. The difference between groups was statistically significant by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test (P = 0.001). The increase in KYN at maximal inhibition was approximately 14-fold compared to the level seen after KNS898 0.01 mg/kg (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Excess KYN was metabolised to KA by kynurenine aminotransferase: KNS898 dosed at 0.01 mg/kg b.d. resulted in a mean (± S.E.M.) plasma level of KA of 629 ± 103 ng/mL, 5 mg/kg resulted in 14399 ± 3394 ng/mL, and 25 mg/kg gave 15965 ± 789 ng/mL. The difference between groups was statistically significant by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test (P = 0.001). The fold increase in KA at maximal inhibition was approximately 25-fold compared to the level seen after KNS898 0.01 mg/kg (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). KMO blockade resulted in a statistically-significant reduction of 3HK in plasma: KNS898 dosed at 0.01 mg/kg b.d. resulted in a mean (± S.E.M.) plasma level of 3HK of 27.7 ± 7.2 ng/mL, 5 mg/kg resulted in 4.2 ± 0.3 ng/mL, and 25 mg/kg gave 0.9 ± 0.4 ng/mL. The difference between groups was statistically significant by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test (P = 0.001). The fold decrease in 3HK at maximal inhibition was approximately 30-fold compared to the level seen after KNS898 0.01 mg/kg (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Overall, there was a clear dose response to KNS898 administration leading to maximal KMO blockade at 25 mg/kg b.d. This dose was therefore selected for efficacy experiments going forward. A diagrammatic representation of the kynurenine pathway is shown as <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref> for reference.</p>

<title>KMO blockade reduces endometrial gland-like lesion burden in experimental endometriosis in mice</title>
<p>The experimental design for the mouse model of endometriosis is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>. The pharmacological effect of KNS898 therapy showed appropriate levels of KNS898 detected in plasma (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>), with accumulation of kynurenine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), inhibition of 3HK production (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) and diverted metabolism of accumulated kynurenine to kynurenic acid (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). All recipient mice inoculated with donor tissue (groups G3, G4, and G5) developed distended endometrial gland-like structures (DEGLS). The incidence of DEGLS formation was enumerated at autopsy, and the axial length of each DEGLS was measured after excision from the surrounding tissue. In G3 (endometriosis + vehicle), 8 of 15 (53%) of the inoculated animals had developed DEGLS. In KNS898-treated group G4 (endometriosis + treatment from Day 19), DEGLS formed in 4 of 15 mice (26.7%) and in G5 (Endo + treatment start on Day 26) in 6 of 15 mice (40%). As expected, no DEGLS were formed in the non-inoculated control and sham groups. The total number of DEGLS per animal in each group was highest in G3 with an average of 4.0 per animal with DEGLS (total = 32 DEGLS in 8 mice in G3). Mice with endometriosis receiving KNS898 from the time of inoculation (G4) had an average of 2.0 DEGLS per animal with DEGLS (total = 8 DEGLS in 4 mice in G4) and those receiving KNS898 1 week after inoculation (G5) had an average of 1.8 DEGLS per animal (total = 11 DEGLS in 6 mice in G5) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3f</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). Statistical analysis by ANOVA showed a significant difference in endometriosis DEGLS burden between groups (P = 0.0295 for DEGLS per animal; P = 0.004 for DEGLS per group). DEGLS axial length and derived volume did not differ between groups (Supplementary Fig. 1a and b). All recipient mice inoculated with donor tissue lost body weight following inoculation which then gradually recovered. After recovery, body weight of all three inoculated groups was lower compared to the control groups for the duration of the study. Overall, there was no significant difference in body weight between G3 and the KNS898 treatment groups G4 and G5 (endometriosis + treatment from Day 26) (Suppl. Fig. 1c).</p>

<p>Histological examination of DEGLS identified them as containing cystic structures lined with epithelial layers identifiable as columnar epithelium, pseudostratified epithelium, squamous epithelium, and cuboidal epithelium, with goblet cells. These DEGLS were considered to represent endometriosis-like lesions derived from the implanted basal endometrial/myoepithelial layers of the donor mice uteri (Suppl. Fig 2). Immunohistochemistry using an antibody to KMO showed KMO protein expression localised mainly to the epithelial cells lining of the DEGLS, with a lesser degree of KMO positive staining in the closest surrounding connective tissue, in keeping with the previously observed KMO expression pattern in human endometriosis lesion tissue (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and Supplementary Fig S3).

<title>KMO inhibition rescues impaired cage exploration behaviour and mobility in mice with endometriosis</title>
<p>HCA peripheral moving speed, time at cage edge, and illness behaviour, including temperature, motility and cage exploration behaviour was quantified using Home Cage Analysis (HCA). Baseline HCA was recorded before inoculation and at the end of the experiment. Mice with endometriosis without treatment showed an overall reduction in activity in moving distance and moving speed relative to baseline, and compared to sham-operated control groups, indicating a negative effect on behaviour due to endometriosis. Importantly, mice with endometriosis treated with KNS898 showed marked improvement in motility and cage exploration behaviour compared to untreated endometriosis mice, and although this difference between groups was statistically significant by Welch’s one-way ANOVA, post hoc testing (Dunnet’s T3) was not significant between groups. This qualitative difference of time spent exploring the periphery of the cage being lower for mice with endometriosis treated with vehicle control was seen in both the day and night phases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5c</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). A similar improvement with KNS898 treatment compared to vehicle control mice with endometriosis was seen for total moving distance, total moving speed, and peripheral distance, but not for total moving or climbing time, for which no difference between groups was detected. Together, these data indicate that KMO inhibition with KNS898 results in an improvement in well-being evidenced by improved cage exploration behaviour in addition to improved objective histological measures of endometriosis disease burden.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we set out to investigate the potential for KMO inhibition as a non-hormonal therapy for endometriosis. First, we confirmed that KMO was expressed in human endometrium by immunohistochemistry, and then showed that KMO was clearly expressed in the epithelial cells in human endometriosis lesions. Next, we demonstrated that the highly specific KMO inhibitor KNS898 was orally bioavailable when given twice daily by gavage in mice, and clearly blocked KMO activity in a dose-dependent manner at a dose of 25mg/kg. We therefore used that dose to test the efficacy of KMO blockade with KNS898 in mice with experimentally-induced endometriosis. One important finding of this project is that KMO blockade resulted in a reduction in endometriosis severity compared to untreated mice with endometriosis, specifically in terms of reducing i) the number of mice that developed endometriosis tissue lesions, and ii) the number of lesions per mouse in those that did develop lesions. The histopathology of the experimental endometriosis lesions was sufficiently similar macroscopically to that seen in the examined human DEGLS, and KMO was evidently highly expressed in the same tissue distribution in model lesions compared to human disease. KMO blockade also decreased lesion KMO expression. Critically, and importantly from a translational perspective, therapeutic blockade of KMO improved visceral hyperalgesia measured by reduced mechanical allodynia and restored normal cage exploration behaviour and mobility in treated mice compared to untreated mice with endometriosis. Together, these data show that KMO is expressed in human and mouse endometriosis tissue lesions and that therapeutic KMO blockade reduces the number of endometriosis lesions and improves holistic metrics of disease behaviour in mice.</p>
<p>The model of endometriosis, using inoculation of endometrial tissue of ovariectomized donor mice, reliably induced the pathophysiological symptoms indicative of endometriosis in recipient mice. Test groups inoculated with endometrial tissue (G3-G5) showed significant growth of ectopic endometrial tissue. Groups treated with test article experienced significantly less DEGLS development (significantly fewer DEGLS were noted in treated groups when compared to vehicle treated groups). Disease burden in the treatment group that had treatment starting immediately after inoculation was lower than that of the vehicle-only treated group. It is not clear why mean cystic size and cystic volume in treated animals was not smaller in treated animals. We can only speculate that KMO blockade may potentiate rapid involution of cysts, but this cannot be proven mechanistically here.</p>
<p>Mice that received inoculated endometrial tissue showed a measurable and increased visceral hyperalgic pain response (lower mechanical threshold) as measured by bladder response to von Frey filament testing, and improvement in a surrogate marker of central sensitisation to pain measured by hind paw Von Frey filament testing when compared to control mice. The mechanical threshold of both treatment groups trended higher compared to the vehicle treated group. One interpretation of these data is that KMO inhibition reduced responses to pain caused by the presence of endometriosis, i.e. improving visceral hyperalgesia.</p>
<p>Home cage behaviour using HCA indicated a reduced overall activity in endo-inoculated mice when compared to control mice. It should also be noted that test article-treated animals in both groups showed more locomotor behaviour and a seemingly better quality of life within the home cage environment when the home-cage dynamics were monitored. This supports the notion that treated mice exhibit less propensity for behaviours that are, at times, typical of depressive and anxiety-like behaviour in home-cage, group housed conditions.</p>
<p>Under the experimental conditions imposed, treatment with KNS898 on two dosing schedules provided a significant reduction in DEGLS formation within the inoculated mice, as well as a seemingly higher pain threshold. This attenuation of pain response was coupled with increased activity levels in the home cage. Taken together, these data suggest a therapeutic effect to alleviation of certain salient symptoms of endometriosis, as well as a reduction in the number and size of DEGLS.</p>
<p>Non-pathological endometrium is a site of high KMO expression. Because endometriosis lesions in women are ‘endometrial-like’ tissue rather than normal endometrium, we tested, and demonstrated expression of KMO in the epithelial layers of endometriosis lesions sampled from women undergoing surgery for endometriosis. First-line medical treatment for endometriosis is the contraceptive pill or other ovarian steroid hormone suppressive drugs. Treatment failures are frequent, side effects are common, all approaches are contraceptive. Many women opt for invasive surgery to remove or ablate the endometriosis lesions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, KMO is expressed in human endometriosis tissue lesions and in a mouse model of endometriosis in the epithelial layers of distended endometrial gland-like structures. Oral KNS898 reliably induced a biochemical state of KMO blockade with accumulation of kynurenine, diversion to kynurenic acid and ablation of 3-hydroxykynurenine production. KMO blockade improved histological and symptomatic behavioural endometriosis disease features with an overall benefit, even when treatment commenced one week after establishment of the disease. KMO blockade is therefore a promising avenue for a new non-hormonal therapeutic modality for endometriosis.</p>

To prepare donor tissue that would best replicate menstrual-like tissue in women, ovariectomized (OVX) mice were primed with daily s.c. injections of 100 ng 17β-estradiol (E2) on days 7, 8 and 9.

Decidualization was induced in one uterine horn with an injection of 20 µl sesame oil 4 hours after the last E2 injection. On day 19 (4 days after induction of decidual response), donor mice were killed 4 hours after removal of the P4 pellet. Endometrial tissue was then scraped from the myometrial layer of the decidualized uterine horn, suspended in 500 μl PBS and injected via a XG needle sprayed into the lower abdominal cavity of the recipient mouse under general anaesthesia with monitoring and post-operative analgesia as described. The ratio of donor to recipient mouse was 1:1 (from one donor to one recipient).

Recipient mice were randomly housed using a Monte Carlo randomization. All animals had a micro-chip (BioMark, USA) inserted to the abdomen prior to being placed in the home-cage. This procedure does not cause undue discomfort or hamper, in any way, animal movement. Total moving distance, total moving time, moving speed, isolation/separation distance, isolated time, peripheral time, peripheral distance, in centre zones time, in centre zones distance, climbing time, and body temperature were tracked automatically by an ActualHCA™ Home Cage Analyzer (ActualAnalytics Ltd., Edinburgh, UK) and processed with proprietary machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms.</p>

<title>Endpoint tissue and plasma sampling</title>
<p>On experimental Day 40, all recipient mice were euthanized, and blood collected via cardiac puncture. Whole blood was collected into heparinised tubes, and plasma was separated by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 15 min) at 4°C. Separated plasma was collected in Eppendorf microtubes, frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. Photographs of the abdominal cavity were obtained. Lesions from the abdominal cavity were harvested. DEGLS were dissected from the surrounding abdominal tissue and measured for size and volume. DEGLS volume was measured using the following formula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>: Volume = long diameter × (short diameter/2)2 × π. DEGLS were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution and prepared for standard H&amp;E. If more than one DEGLS was present in an animal, DEGLS that were not used for H&amp;E were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80oC.</p>

<title>Endometriosis lesion histology</title>
<p>Endometriosis lesion tissue blocks were sectioned at a uniform thickness of 5 μm and were mounted onto a microscope slide. The slide then underwent deparaffination and hydration. Paraffin was removed from the slide using xylene, then hydration through graded ethanol and washing were performed. Slides were then stained with Harris haematoxylin and alcoholic eosin Y and mounted after dehydration and clearing with xylene. The H&amp;E-stained images were visualized using a Slide Scanner (Panoramic scan, 3D HISTECH).</p>

<sec id="s4m">
<title>Immunohistochemistry (mouse DEGLS)</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry to detect KMO in mouse DEGLS tissue was performed on a Leica Bond III automated immunostaining robot. 5 μm thick sections obtained from FFPE (formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded) samples mounted on superfrost plus slides were stained as follows. Heat induced epitope retrieval (HIER) was performed using Epitope Retrieval Solution 1 (Leica, ER1 pH 6.0 citrate based solution) for 20 minutes at 99<sup>0</sup>C. Tissue sections were then incubated for 10 minutes in hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous hydrogen peroxidase activity followed by 10 minute blocking with normal goat serum. The primary antibody against KMO (Proteintech 10698-1-AP @1:1000 Rabbit)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> was incubated for 1 hour, then incubated with a goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody for 30 minutes prior to visualisation with diaminobenzoate (DAB) using standard protocols.</p>

<sec id="s4n">
<title>Digital slide scanning</title>
<p>Whole sections were scanned using a Zeiss Axioscan Z1 whole slide scanner. The image files (.czi) were batch converted to Tif format for image analysis and quantification, acquisition and batch export used Carl Zeiss Zen v2.5 software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4o">
<title>Quantitative image analysis</title>
<p>Image analysis was carried out using QuPath v0.4.2. Analysis was standardised by using multiple regions of interest from individual slides and collating them into a training image. To improve stain contrast, overlapping DAB and haematoxylin staining was deconvoluted by manual optimisation of the stain vectors. Individual slide epithelia were annotated, with relative DAB optical densities and annotation shape measurements taken. Epithelial thickness and area were calculated to enable correlation with KMO intensity. To generate the heat map of cell KMO expression, a cell detection was carried out on haematoxylin staining using standard parameters, a 5-100um2 area range, cell expansion of 1um and a threshold of 0.14.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4p">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Power calculations were performed using G*Power (v3.1.9.4) software. Input parameters were used: 2-tailed, α-error probability = 0.05, and power (1-β error probability) = 0.80. Continuous variable data were tested for Normality of distribution with a one sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normally distributed data were analysed by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett’s T3 for multiple groups. Data comparing treatment group effects at multiple time-points were analysed by two-way ANOVA with multiple comparison testing by Dunnett’s method. Data comparing multiple groups with unequal variances were analyzed with Welch’s ANOVA. Data not following the Normal distribution were analysed with non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical and proportions data were analysed by Fisher’s exact test. Data were visualised with GraphPad Prism.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study holds importance within the focused scope of endometriosis treatment, providing initial evidence of a potential new therapeutic target. The strength of the evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, as the methods, data, and analyses support the authors' conclusions regarding the specific aims. The study provides promising preliminary evidence of KMO implication in endometriosis, but it falls short of establishing a strong rationale for proposing KNS898 as a treatment for endometriosis given the limitations in evidence and mechanistic insights.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study serves as a proof of concept for KMO inhibition as a new non-hormonal treatment for endometriosis. The authors investigated KMO expression in human endometrial and endometriosis lesion tissues, confirmed that KNS898 effectively inhibits KMO and alleviates manifestations of endometriosis in mice - reduced endometriosis lesions and improved hyperalgesia and cage behaviour.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Inhibition of KMO may present as a promising first-in-class non-hormonal therapeutic agent for patients suffering from endometriosis and the side-effects of hormonal treatments.</p>
<p>
(2) The expression of KMO in endometrial tissues was demonstrated in both human (multiple patients per AFS stage of disease) and mice tissues.</p>
<p>
(3) Measurement of multiple substrates/analytes of the KMO regulatory pathway was performed and demonstrated strong correlation to each other in response to KMO inhibition.</p>
<p>
(4) The aims of study (as proof-of-concept) were achieved in the study and the results support their conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>If any dysregulation in the KMO/tryptophan metabolic activity, expression and/or pathway in endometriosis can be shown, this will strengthen the rationale for the use of KMO inhibitor in the disease.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to address the clinical challenge of treating endometriosis, a debilitating condition with limited and often ineffective treatment options. They propose that inhibiting KMO could be a novel non-hormonal therapeutic approach. Their study focuses on:</p>
<p>
• Obtaining proof-of-concept for KMO inhibition as a novel therapy for endometriosis.</p>
<p>
• Characterising KMO expression in human and mouse endometriosis tissues.</p>
<p>
• Demonstrating the efficacy of KMO inhibition in improving histological and symptomatic features of endometriosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• Novelty and Relevance: The study addresses a significant clinical need for better endometriosis treatments and explores a novel therapeutic target.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• Limited Mechanistic Insight: The study lacks a comprehensive investigation of the mechanistic pathways through which KNS898 affects endometriosis. The dysregulation of KMO activity and the kynurenine pathway in endometriosis remains poorly characterized, both in the human condition and the experimental model. While the authors present preliminary evidence that kynurenine metabolites (KYN, 3HK, and KYNA) are not dysregulated in the experimental model of endometriosis, they show that KMO inhibition modulates these metabolite levels and leads to some improvement in disease features. However, these findings do not significantly close the existing knowledge gap or provide a strong rationale for targeting KMO as a therapeutic approach for endometriosis. Further mechanistic insights are necessary to justify the potential of KMO inhibition in this context.</p>
<p>Achievement of Aims:</p>
<p>• The authors demonstrated that KMO is expressed in endometriosis lesions and that KNS898 can induce KMO inhibition, leading to biochemical changes and improvements in few endometriosis features in a mouse model. Therefore, the authors addressed the proposed specific aims. However, fail to provide a clear rationale for proposing KMO inhibition as a novel therapy for endometriosis.</p>
<p>Support of Conclusions:</p>
<p>• The conclusions are somewhat overextended given the limitations in mechanistic insights to explain how KMO inhibition result in improvment of histological and symptomatic features of experimental endometriosis. The study provides promising initial evidence but requires further exploration to firmly establish the efficacy of KNS898 for endometriosis treatment.</p>
<p>Impact on the Field:</p>
<p>• The study introduces a novel therapeutic target to be explored for endometriosis, potentially leading to non-hormonal treatment options.</p>
<p>Utility of Methods and Data:</p>
<p>• The methods used provide a foundation for further research, although they require refinement. The data, while promising, need more rigorous investigation and deeper mechanistic exploration to be fully convincing and useful to the community.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study explores the therapeutic potential of KMO inhibition in endometriosis, a condition with limited treatment options.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>KNS898 is a novel specific KMO inhibitor and is orally bioavailable, providing a convenient and non-hormonal treatment option for endometriosis. The promising efficacy of KNS898 was demonstrated in a relevant preclinical mouse model of endometriosis with pathological and behavioural assessments performed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The expression of KMO in human normal endometrium and endometrial lesions was not quantified. Western blot or quantification of IHC images will provide valuable insight.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Given the differential expression of KMO in luminal epithelial cells lining the endometrial glands compared to the other parts of the endometrium, a general endometrial Western Blot prep is not going to be additionally helpful or accurate in addressing this question, without e.g. laser capture microdissection or single cell quantitative proteomics. Furthermore, KMO is a flavin-dependent monooxygenase and the activity, especially generating the oxidative stressor product 3-hydroxykynurenine is far more dependent on kynurenine substrate availability than it is on actual enzyme abundance - although it is important to show (as we have done), that KMO is present in the human endometrial glands and in human distended endometrial gland-like structures (DEGLS).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If KMO is not overexpressed in diseased tissues i.e. it may have homeostatic roles, and inhibition of KMO may have consequences on general human health and wellbeing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>KMO certainly does have important homeostatic roles, for example as key step in the repletion of NAD+ through <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. Although with good nutrition and sufficient NAD+ precursors in the diet e.g. niacin, that specific role may be partially redundant. KMO knockout mice exhibit normal fertility and fecundity and do not show a survival deficit compared to littermate wildtype controls (e.g. Mole et al <italic>Nature Medicine</italic> 2016). To further develop KNS898 towards clinical use, preclinical GLP safety and toxicology studies and human Phase 1 clinical trials will of course need to be completed, but that is standard for the development of any new drug</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, KMO expression in control mice was not shown or quantified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Control mice that were not inoculated intraperitoneally with endometrial fragments did not develop DEGLS and therefore there is nothing to show or quantify.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Images of KMO expression in endometriosis mice with treatments should be shown in Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included a representative KMO immunohistochemistry image from each endometriosis group and included all KMO immunohistochemistry images in Supplementary Information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The images showing quantification analysis (Figure 4A-F) can be moved to supplementary material.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This recommendation contradicts the emphasis placed by the same reviewer earlier regarding quantification, so we have elected to keep it where it is.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 1 only showed representative images from a few patients. A description of whether KMO expression varies between patients and whether it correlates with AFS stages/disease severity will be helpful. Images from additional patients can be provided in supplementary material.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added extra information to the Figure legend to clarify the disease stage of the superficial peritoneal lesions which were illustrated (Stage I/II) and to link them to the information in supplementary Table S1. In total we examined 11 peritoneal lesions and 5 ovarian lesions (stage III/IV) – in every sample examined immunopositive staining was most intense in epithelial cells lining gland-like structures. Sections illustrated were chosen to illustrate this key finding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) For Home Cage Analysis, different measurements were performed as stated in methods including total moving distance, total moving time, moving speed, isolation/separation distance, isolated time, peripheral time, peripheral distance, in centre zones time, in centre zones distance, climbing time, and body temperature. However, only the finding for peripheral distance was reported in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was indeed a large amount of output, which we rationalised for the benefit of a concise paper. The paper now includes a description of which parameters showed a difference with drug treatment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The rationale for choosing the different dose levels of KNS898 - 0.01-25mg/kg was not provided. What is the IC50 of a drug?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>KNS898 dosing has been extensively characterised by us in multiple species, and the pIC50 has already been published (e.g. Hayes et al Cell Reports 2023 and elsewhere). We now include the pIC50 in the present manuscript to save the reader from having to search through another reference.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Statistical significance:</p>
<p>(a) Were stats performed for Fig 3B-E?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Now included, thank you.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Line 141 - 'P = 0.004 for DEGLS per group'</p>
<p>However, statistics were not shown in the figure.</p>

<p>Thanks, now displayed on figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>(d) Line 170 - 'Two-way ANOVA, Group effect P = 0.003, time effect P &lt; 0.0001' The stats need to be annotated appropriately in Figure 5A as two separate symbols.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Arguably the far more important comparison in this figure is whether there is any effect of treatment, and to mark multiple statistical comparisons on the figure would make it difficult to understand. Instead, the figure legend and results text have been clarified on this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(e) Figure 5B - multiple comparisons of two-way ANOVA are needed. G4 does not look different to G3 at D42.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Multiple comparison testing (Dunnett’s T3) was done and the results have been clarified in the text and figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(f) Line 565 - 'non-significant improvement in KNS898 treated groups'. However, ** was annotated in Figure 5A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. This is an error that has been checked and corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Discussion is very light. No reference to previous publications was made in the discussion. Discussion on potential mechanistic pathways of KYR/KMO in the pathogenesis of endometriosis will be helpful, as the expression and function of KMO and/or other metabolites in endometrial-related conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The discussion is deliberately concise and focussed. The paper has 21 references to previous publications. A speculative discussion is generally not favoured by us.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The findings in this study generally support the conclusion although some key data which strengthen the conclusion eg quantification of KMO in normal and diseased tissue is lacking.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We differ from the reviewer here and do not think that those data would materially affect the likelihood of KMO inhibition being efficacious in human endometriosis in Phase 2/3 clinical trials.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Before KMO inhibitors can be used for endometriosis, the function of KMO in the context of endometriosis should be explored eg KMO knockout mice should be studied.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We take the view that before KMO inhibitors can be used for endometriosis in patients there are multiple other regulatory and clinical development steps that are required that would be a priority. While using a KMO knockout mouse might be an interesting scientific experiment, it would not impact on the critical path in a material way.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to address the clinical challenge of treating endometriosis, a debilitating condition with limited and often ineffective treatment options. They propose that inhibiting KMO could be a novel non-hormonal therapeutic approach. Their study focuses on:</p>
<p>• Characterising KMO expression in human and mouse endometriosis tissues.</p>
<p>• Investigating the effects of KMO inhibitor KNS898 on inflammation, lesion volume, and pain in a mouse model of endometriosis.</p>
<p>• Demonstrating the efficacy of KMO blockade in improving histological and symptomatic features of endometriosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• Novelty and Relevance: The study addresses a significant clinical need for better endometriosis treatments and explores a novel therapeutic target.</p>
<p>• Comprehensive Approach: The authors use both human biobanked tissues and a mouse model to study KMO expression and the effects of its inhibition.</p>
<p>• Clear Biochemical Outcomes: The administration of KNS898 reliably induced KMO blockade, leading to measurable biochemical changes (increased kynurenine, increased kynurenic acid, reduced 3-hydroxykynurenine).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• Limited Mechanistic Insight: The study does not thoroughly investigate the mechanistic pathways through which KNS898 affects endometriosis. Specifically, the local vs. systemic effects of KMO inhibition are not well differentiated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree that this is not a comprehensive mechanistic analysis, given that the ultimate therapy would be almost certainly a once daily oral dosing i.e. systemic administration, we do not consider differentiating local vs systemic effects of KMO inhibition to be critical to therapeutic development in this scenario.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Statistical Analysis Issues: The choice of statistical tests (e.g., two-way ANOVA instead of repeated measures ANOVA for behavioral data) may not be the most appropriate, potentially impacting the validity of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The selection of two-way ANOVA (time and group) is sufficient and correct for this experimental analysis and its use does not invalidate the results. We agree that repeated measures ANOVA could be a valid alternative.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Quantification and Comparisons: There is insufficient quantitative comparison of KMO expression levels between normal endometrium and endometriosis lesions,</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>Please see earlier responses. KNS898 has been thoroughly explored in multiple tissues, species and experimental models, but those data do not need rehearsed here.</p>

<p>As discussed above (response to Reviewer 1), KMO knockout mice exhibit normal fertility and fecundity and do not show a survival deficit compared to littermate wildtype controls (e.g. Mole et al <italic>Nature Medicine</italic> 2016). To further develop KNS898 towards clinical use, preclinical GLP safety and toxicology studies and human Phase 1 clinical trials will naturally need to be completed, but this is standard for the development of any new drug.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Achievement of Aims:</p>
<p>• The authors successfully demonstrated that KMO is expressed in endometriosis lesions and that KNS898 can induce KMO blockade, leading to biochemical changes and improvements in endometriosis symptoms in a mouse model.</p>
<p>Support of Conclusions:</p>
<p>• While the data supports the potential of KMO inhibition as a therapeutic strategy, the conclusions are somewhat overextended given the limitations in mechanistic insights and statistical analysis. The study provides promising initial evidence but requires further exploration to firmly establish the efficacy and safety of KNS898 for endometriosis treatment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not agree that the conclusions are overextended based on the data presented, as expanded in the reply to the eLife editorial assessment at the beginning of this response. It is clear that additional preclinical, regulatory and clinical development work, and human clinical trials will be required to firmly establish the efficacy and safety of KN898 for endometriosis treatment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Impact on the Field:</p>
<p>• The study introduces a novel therapeutic target for endometriosis, potentially leading to non-hormonal treatment options. If validated, KMO inhibition could significantly impact the management of endometriosis.</p>
<p>Utility of Methods and Data:</p>
<p>• The methods used provide a foundation for further research, although they require refinement. The data, while promising, need more rigorous statistical analysis and deeper mechanistic exploration to be fully convincing and useful to the community.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that the data are a) convincing, and b) useful to the community. To be advanced effectively towards patients, KNS898 needs to follow the critical development path outlined above.</p>

<p>Line 82 - 87: Clarify in the proposal aims what is being accessed and analysed in humans and/or in animal models (mice). Specifically state clearly the correlations with KMO expression. Were the correlations between KMO expression with features of inflammation performed only in mice or also in humans?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. The aims have been clarified in the Introduction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Section - KMO is expressed in human eutopic endometrium and human endometriosis tissue lesions:</p>
<p>Was any quantitative or semi-quantitative method used to quantify the KMO expression in human tissues? Although the authors claimed that &quot;KMO was strongly immunopositive in human peritoneal endometriosis lesions&quot; by the representative figures it is not clear if KMO expression is similar, higher or lower between normal endometrium and peritoneal endometriosis lesions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added extra information to the legend of Figure 1 to identify the PIN number of the superficial lesions illustrated. The key finding from the immunostaining with the antibody which had been previously validated as specific for KMO was that the most intense immunopositive response was in glandular epithelial cells and the samples illustrate this result.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Section - Oral KNS898 inhibits KMO in mice:</p>
<p>The authors clearly confirmed the target engagement of KNS898 in inhibiting KMO activity and, therefore, affecting upstream and downstream metabolites systemically in (peripheral fluid/ plasma) mice. Whether KNS898 effect is broad and targets systemic immune cells and whole body cells and tissue was not explored. It was also not explored if KNS898 is able to specifically inhibit KMO locally at the endometrium tissue by targeting epithelial and/or infiltrated immune cells, for example.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>That is correct.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be interesting to measure (or if it was measured to report in this section and also in Figure 2) the levels of KYN, KA and 3HK in naïve animals that did not receive KNS898. It would help to understand the net effect of KNS898 on the levels of kynurenine pathway metabolites and, therefore, justify the dose chosen.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These data are already presented in Fig 3B-E, control group.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Perhaps then the chosen dose could be lower considering the possible substantial changes in kynurenine pathway metabolites levels, which are reported to exert an effect in many cells, tissues and systems and could, therefore, precipitate side effects. Even more considering that the values for these metabolites are expressed as ng/ml, which hinders the comparison of the metabolite levels with the one reported for naïve animals in the literature. I would also suggest expressing the metabolite levels as nM/L.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is not a relevant method of determining dose-limiting toxicity or safety pharmacology/toxicology, either non-GLP or GLP. There are international guidelines on the proper conduct of those studies. This is also why it is important not to make claims about the safety or otherwise of an experimental compound in an in vivo setting that has not explicitly complied with those regulatory standards. With regard to the units recommendation, accepted units are ng/mL or nM, not usually nM/L.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you, a good point and has been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors demonstrated with an experimental approach that KMO blockade reduces a pathological measure of endometriosis i.e., endometrial gland-like lesion burden, in experimental endometriosis in mice when both administrated concomitant but also after the disease development. Although mechanistic insights about how reduced KMO activity can reduce the developed distended endometrial gland-like structures were not explored. Therefore, it remains to be investigated which (and how ) kynurenine pathway metabolites are directly linked to the beneficial effects of KMO blockade in the experimental model of endometriosis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although the beneficial effects on the pathological measures are evident, Figure 3 shows an exorbitant accumulation of KYN and KA and also a substantial reduction in 3HK after the treatment with KNS898, which then raises concerns about tolerability and side effects. Would this effective KNS898 dose be viable and translational as a therapeutic approach?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please refer to comments above at multiple junctures about safety pharmacology and the clinical development critical path.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Section - KMO is expressed in experimental endometriosis in mice:</p>
<p>By histological examination, the authors confirm that the treatment with KNS898 specifically reduced the KMO expression intensity in the DEGLS from mice. Therefore, the effect exerted by KNS898 locally on the KMO expression at the DEGLS could be, at least, partially responsible for the beneficial effects observed in Figure 3 i.e., the reduction of pathological measures. Although remains to be explored whether the effect of KNS898 in other cells or tissues could also be accountable for the beneficial effects exerted by KNS898 on the animal model of endometriosis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is correct.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>From a logical experimental point of view, I would suggest switching the order of the result subsection &quot;KMO blockade reduces endometrial gland-like lesion burden in experimental endometriosis in mice&quot; and &quot;KMO is expressed in experimental endometriosis in mice&quot; as well as the respective Figures 3 and 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not agree. Fig 3 (and section) is the macroscopic enumeration of DEGLS, Fig 4 (and section) is the microscopic and immunohistochemical evaluation of the lesions introduced in Fig 3. The sequence as originally presented is the more logical.</p>

<p>Sections - KMO inhibition reduces mechanical allodynia in experimental endometriosis - and - KMO inhibition reduces mechanical allodynia in experimental endometriosis:</p>
<p>The authors suggested that the KMO inhibition with KNS898 exerts beneficial effects on behavioural paradigms related to the experimental model of endometriosis. Based on the statistical analysis performed for the author, KMO inhibition with KNS898 reduces mechanical allodynia, as well as rescues, impaired cage exploration behaviour and mobility in mice with endometriosis. However, I believe that the most indicated statistical tests for Von Frey (allodynia behaviour) and Home cage (illness behaviour) analyses over time would be repeated measures ANOVA and paired t-test, respectively (and not two-way ANOVA as performed). Therefore for a more trustful analysis and interpretation of this data set, I would suggest the authors modify the statistical analysis and report the corresponding interpretation of these tests.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The selection of two-way ANOVA (time and group) is suitable for this experimental analysis and its use does not invalidate the results. We agree that repeated measures ANOVA could be a valid alternative.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, the authors present a solid and useful case for KMO inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for endometriosis. However, the study would benefit from more detailed mechanistic insights, appropriate statistical analyses, and an evaluation of potential side effects. With these improvements, the research could have a significant impact on the field and pave the way for new treatment modalities for endometriosis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments and we have responded to the criticisms above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Specific recommendations for improvement:</p>
<p>• Mechanistic Studies: Conduct detailed studies to understand the local vs. systemic effects of KMO inhibition and its specific impacts on different cell types and tissues. If not feasible here, the authors could include in the discussion section a detailed overview of the possible mechanisms implicated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree that this is not a comprehensive mechanistic analysis, given that the ultimate therapy would be almost certainly a once daily oral dosing i.e. systemic administration, we do not consider differentiating local vs systemic effects of KMO inhibition to be critical to therapeutic development in this scenario. We do not think speculation about possible mechanisms that is not supported by experimental data should be included. Furthermore, that notion (of statements not supported by data) has been given as a criticism by the reviewers, and therefore consistency on this point must be preferable.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Quantitative Analysis: Include more robust quantitative methods to compare KMO expression levels in different tissues and assess the correlation between KNO expression and pathological and behavioural changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed above, the pathophysiological importance of KMO is in its enzymatic activity, not in its abundance as a protein, and 3HK production is far more dependent on kynurenine substrate availability rather than KMO protein abundance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Appropriate Statistics: Use the most suitable statistical tests for behavioural and other repeated measures data to ensure accurate interpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed above</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Side Effect Evaluation: Investigate potential side effects of systemic KMO inhibition, particularly focusing on the long-term implications of altered kynurenine pathway metabolites. If not feasible here, the authors could include in the discussion section a detailed overview of the possible side effects associated as well as inform if KNS898 can cross the BBB and its implications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For a novel small molecule therapeutic compound in preclinical/clinical development, there are strictly regulated preclinical and clinical development standards that need to be met. It would not be responsible to publish or make claims about safety and potential adverse effect profiles without conducting the proper panel of tests within a suitable regulatory framework.</p>
