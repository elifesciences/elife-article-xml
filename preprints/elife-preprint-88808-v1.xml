<p>Maturation and fine-tuning of neural circuits frequently requires neuromodulatory signals that set the excitability threshold, neuronal connectivity and synaptic strength. Here we present a mechanistic study of how neuromodulator stimulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, through the store – operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Orai, regulate intrinsic neuronal properties by control of developmental gene expression in flight promoting central dopaminergic neurons (fpDANs). The fpDANs receive cholinergic inputs for release of dopamine at a central brain tripartite synapse that sustains flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sharma and Hasan, 2020</xref>). Cholinergic inputs act on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor to stimulate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localised inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor followed by ER-store depletion and Orai mediated store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE). Analysis of gene expression in fpDANs followed by genetic, cellular and molecular studies identified Orai-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry as a key regulator of excitability in fpDANs during circuit maturation. SOCE activates the transcription factor Trithorax-like (Trl) which in turn drives expression of a set of genes including <italic>Set2</italic>, that encodes a histone 3 Lysine 36 methyltransferase (H3K36me3). Set2 function establishes a positive feedback loop, essential for receiving neuromodulatory cholinergic inputs and sustaining SOCE. Chromatin modifying activity of Set2 changes the epigenetic status of fpDANs and drives expression of key ion channel and signaling genes thus setting the excitability threshold that determines dopamine release for maintenance of long flight.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neural circuitry underlying mature adult behaviours emerges from a combination of developmental gene expression programs and experience-dependent neuronal activity. Holometabolous insects such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, reconfigure their nervous system during metamorphosis to generate circuitry capable of supporting adult behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Levine, 1984</xref>). During pupal development, neurons undergo maturation of their electrical properties with a gradual increase in depolarizing responses and consequent synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hardie et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jarvilehto and Finell, 1983</xref>). Apart from voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and fast-acting neurotransmitters specific to ionotropic receptors, the developing nervous system also uses neuromodulators, that target metabotropic receptors, show slower response kinetics and are capable of affecting a larger subset of neurons by means of diffusion aided volumetric transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Taber and Hurley, 2014</xref>). Although neuromodulators alter intrinsic neuronal properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Marder, 2012</xref>) by changes in gene expression, the molecular mechanisms through which this is achieved and maintained over developmental timescales needs further understanding.</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals generated by neuronal activity can determine neurotransmitter specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Spitzer, 2012</xref>), synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">O’Hare et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Takechi et al., 1998</xref>), patterns of neurite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gu and Spitzer, 1995</xref>) and gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ciceri et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Rosenberg and Spitzer, 2011</xref>) over developmental timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">McKinney et al., 2022</xref>) where output specificity is defined by signal dynamics. Neuromodulators generate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by stimulation of cognate G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) linked to the inositol 1,4,5– trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling pathway. IP<sub>3</sub> transduces intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localised ligand-gated ion channel, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Streb et al., 1984</xref>), followed by store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) through the plasma membrane localised Orai channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Thillaiappan et al., 2019</xref>). Cellular and physiological consequences of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals generated through SOCE exhibit different time-scales and sub-cellular localisation from activity induced signals, suggesting that they alter neuronal properties through novel mechanisms.</p>
<p>Expression studies, genetics and physiological analysis support a role for IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and SOCE in neuronal development and the regulation of adult neuronal physiology across organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hasan and Sharma, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Mitra and Hasan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Somasundaram et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, neuromodulatory signals of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides stimulate cognate GPCRs on specific neurons to generate IP<sub>3</sub> followed by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agrawal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Megha and Hasan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Shakiryanova et al., 2011</xref>). Genetic and cellular studies identified neuromodulatory inputs and SOCE as an essential component for maturation of neural circuits for flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Venkiteswaran and Hasan, 2009</xref>). A focus of this flight deficit lies in a group of central dopaminergic neurons (or DANs) that include the PPL1 and PPM3 DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Liu et al. 2012</xref>) marked by <italic>THD’ GAL4,</italic> alternately referred to henceforth as flight promoting DANs (fpDANs). Among the fpDANs some PPL1 DANs project to the γ2α’1 lobe of the Mushroom Body (MB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mao and Davis 2009</xref>) a dense region of neuropil in the insect central brain, that forms a relay centre for flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sharma and Hasan, 2020</xref>). Axonal projections from Kenyon cells (KC) carry sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Yagi et al., 2016</xref>) and those from DANs carry internal state information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Riemensperger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Zolin et al., 2021</xref>) to functional compartments of the MB, where dopamine release modulates the KC and MB output neuron synapse (MBONs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aso et al. 2014</xref>). The KC-DAN-MBON tripartite synapse, carries a dynamically updating representation of the motivational and behavioural state of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aso and Rubin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Waddell, 2016</xref>). Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms that underlie the ability of neuromodulatory acetylcholine signals, acting through SOCE during circuit maturation, to determine fpDAN function required for <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight.</p>

<title>A spatio-temporal requirement for SOCE determines flight</title>
<p>To understand how neuromodulator stimulated SOCE alters neuronal properties over developmental time scales we began by refining further the existing spatio-temporal coordinates of SOCE requirement for flight. Flight promoting dopaminergic neurons (DANs) with a requirement for SOCE have been identified earlier by expression of a dominant negative <italic>Orai</italic> transgene, which renders the channel Ca<sup>2+</sup> impermeable, thus abrogating all SOCE (<italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pathak et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Yeromin et al. 2006</xref>). These include a smaller subset of <italic>THD’GAL4</italic> marked DANs, where acetylcholine promotes dopamine release through the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAchR) by stimulating IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sharma and Hasan, 2020</xref>). <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic>expression in a subset of 21-23 dopaminergic neurons marked by <italic>THD’ GAL4</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) led to complete loss of flight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) while overexpression of the wildtype <italic>Orai</italic> transgene had a relatively minor effect (Figure S1A).</p>

A schematic of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the IP<sub>3</sub>R and SOCE through STIM/Orai (upper panel) followed by representation of the wildtype (Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable) and mutant (Ca<sup>2+</sup> impermeable) Orai channels (lower panel). B. Anatomical location of <italic>THD’</italic> DANs in the fly central brain immunolabelled for mCD8GFP (upper panel) followed by a cartoon of central brain DAN clusters. Scale bar indicates 20 μm. PPL1 and PPM3 clusters are labelled in red and green respectively. C. Measurement of flight bout durations demonstrate a requirement for Orai-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in <italic>THD’</italic> DANs and in 2 pairs of PPL1 DANs marked by the MB296B driver. D. <italic>THD</italic>’ DANs require Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Orai at 72-96 hours APF and 0-2 days post eclosion to promote flight. In C and D flight bout durations in seconds (s) are represented as a swarm plot where each genotype is represented by a different color, and each fly as a single data point. The Δ Flight parameter shown below indicates the mean difference for comparisons against the shared Canton S control and is shown as a Cumming estimation plot. Mean differences are plotted as bootstrap sampling distributions. Each 95% confidence interval is indicated by the ends of the vertical error bars. The same letter beneath each distribution refers to statistically indistinguishable groups after performing a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a post hoc Mann-Whitney U-test (p&lt;0.005). At least 30 flies were tested for each genotype. E. <italic>THD’</italic> DANs were labelled with cytosolic eGFP (10 μm scale), isolated using FACS and validated for enrichment of <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA by qRT-pCR (lower panel). The qRT-pCR results are from 4 biological replicates with different letters representing statistically distinguishable groups after performing a two-tailed t test (p&lt;0.05). F.

The RNA-Seq data is represented in the form of a volcano plot of fold change vs FDR. Individual dots represent genes, coloured in red (upregulated) or blue (downregulated) by &gt;1 fold. G. Downregulated genes were identified by 3 different methods of DEG analysis, quantified and compared as a Venn diagram. H. Gene expression trajectories of SOCE-induced DEGs plotted as a function of developmental time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</xref>) and clustered into 3 groups using k-means analysis. I. The relative proportion of downregulated, upregulated genes, and a random set of genes found in the clusters described in (H) indicate that 75% of downregulated genes exhibit a pupal peak of expression.</p></caption>

<p><italic>THD’</italic> marks DANs in the PPL1, PPL2, and PPM3 clusters of the adult central brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) of which the PPL1 (10-12) and PPM3 (6-7) cell clusters constitute the fpDANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>). Among these 16-19 DANs, two pairs of PPL1 DANs projecting to the γ2α’1 lobes of the mushroom body (marked by the MB296B split GAL4 driver and schematised in Figure S1B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aso et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aso and Rubin 2016</xref>) were identified as contributing to the flight deficit to a significant extent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>; S1C). The MB296B DANs form part of a central flight relay centre identified earlier as requiring IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sharma and Hasan, 2020</xref>). That the <italic>THD’</italic> neurons are required for flight was further confirmed by inhibiting their function. Acute activation of either a temperature sensitive <italic>Dynamin</italic> mutant (<italic>Shibire<sup>ts</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kitamoto 2001</xref>), which blocks exocytosis at an elevated temperature, or acute expression of the tetanus toxin light chain fragment (<italic>TeTxLC</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Sweeney et al. 1995</xref>) which cleaves <italic>Synaptobrevin</italic>, an essential component of the synaptic release machinery in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons led to severe flight defects (Figure S1D).</p>
<p>Previous work has demonstrated that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the IP<sub>3</sub>R, that precedes SOCE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), is required during late pupal development in <italic>THD’</italic> marked DANs for flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sharma and Hasan, 2020</xref>). The precise temporal requirement for SOCE in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons was investigated by inducing <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> transgene expression for specific periods of pupal development and in adults with the <italic>tubulinGAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic> based temperature sensitive expression system, (TARGET-Temporal And Regional Gene Expression Targeting; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">McGuire et al., 2004</xref>). Approximately 100 hours of pupal development were binned into 24 hour windows, wherein SOCE was abrogated by <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic>expression, following which, normal development and growth was permitted. Flies were assayed for flight 5 days post eclosion. Abrogation of SOCE by expression of the <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> dominant negative transgene at 72 to 96 hrs after puparium formation (APF), resulted in complete loss of flight as compared to minor flight deficits observed upon expression of <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> during earlier developmental windows (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Abrogation of flight also occurred upon <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> expression during the first 2 days post-eclosion (see discussion) whereas abrogation of SOCE 5 days after eclosion as adults resulted in only modest flight deficits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that SOCE is required for maturation of <italic>THD’</italic> marked flight dopaminergic neurons. Earlier work has shown that loss of SOCE by expression of <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> does not alter the number of dopaminergic neurons or affect neurite projection patterns of PPL1 and PPM3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>). Of these two clusters, PPM3 DANs project to the ellipsoid body in the central complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kong et al., 2010</xref>), and PPL1 DANs project to the mushroom body and the lateral horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>) and aid in the maintenance of extended flight bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sharma and Hasan, 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Loss of SOCE in late pupae leads to a re-organisation of neuronal gene expression</title>
<p>The molecular consequences of loss of SOCE in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons were investigated next by undertaking a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis from fluorescence activated and sorted (FACS) <italic>THD’</italic> neurons with or without <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> expression and marked with eGFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; S1E). <italic>THD’</italic> neurons were obtained from pupae at 72 ± 6h APF (essential SOCE requirement for flight; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Expression analysis of RNAseq libraries generated from <italic>THD’</italic> neurons revealed a reorganisation of the transcriptome upon loss of SOCE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Expression of 822 genes was downregulated (with a fold change cut-off of &lt; –1) as assessed using 3 different methods of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) whereas 137 genes were upregulated (Figure S1F). To understand if loss of SOCE affects genes expressed in neurons from the pupal stage, we used the modEncode dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Celniker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</xref>) to reconstruct developmental trajectories of all genes expressed in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons (Figure S1G). Using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we classified genes expressed in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons into 3 clusters where ‘Cluster 0’ is low expression throughout development; ‘Cluster 1’ exhibits a larval peak in expression and ‘Cluster 2’ exhibits a pupal peak in expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). The majority of expressed genes (&gt;95%) classify as low expression throughout (Cluster 0) and were removed from further analysis. Genes belonging to either the downregulated gene set or the upregulated gene set in SOCE-deficient <italic>THD’</italic> neurons and a random set of genes were analysed further. A comparison of the proportion of DEGs classified in the larval and pupal clusters revealed that &gt;75% of downregulated genes belonged to the pupal peak (Cluster 2) whereas &lt;20% of either the upregulated genes or a random set of genes classified as belonging to the pupal peak (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Moreover, downregulated genes exhibit higher baseline expression in wildtype pupal <italic>THD’</italic> neurons (Figures S1H, I). These analyses suggest that SOCE induces expression of a set of genes in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons during the late pupal phase which are subsequently required for flight. These are henceforth referred to as SOCE-responsive genes.</p>

<title>SOCE regulates gene expression through a balance of Histone 3 Lysine 36 trimethylation and Histone 3 Lysine 27 trimethylation</title>
<p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis of SOCE-responsive genes revealed ‘Transcription’, ‘Ion transporters’, ‘Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent exocytosis’, ‘GPCRs’, ‘Synaptic components’, and ‘Kinases’ as top GO categories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Among these, ‘Transcription’ and ‘Ion transporters’ represented categories with the highest enrichment. Further analysis of genes that classified under ‘Transcription’ revealed SET domain containing genes that encode histone lysine methyltransferases implicated in chromatin regulation and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dillon et al., 2005</xref>) and among the SET domain containing genes, <italic>Set1</italic> and <italic>Set2</italic> showed distinct downregulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). One of these genes, the H3K36me3 methyltransferase <italic>Set2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), was identified in a previous RNAseq from larval neurons with loss of IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Mitra et al., 2020</xref>). RT-PCRs from sorted <italic>THD’</italic> neurons confirmed that <italic>Set2</italic> levels are indeed downregulated (by 76%) in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons expressing <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic>and to the same extent as seen upon expression of <italic>Set2<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (79% downregulation; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). <italic>Set1</italic> and <italic>Set2</italic> perform methyltransferase activity at H3K4 and H3K36 histone residues respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ardehali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Stabell et al., 2007</xref>). Both these markers are epigenetic signatures for transcriptional activation, where H3K4me3 is enriched at the 5’ end of the gene body and H3K36me3 is enriched in the gene bodies of actively transcribed genes; schematised in Figure S2A). In the adult CNS, <italic>Set2</italic>, is expressed at 4-fold higher levels compared to <italic>Set1</italic> (Figure S2B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Set2</italic> also shows a steep 5.5 fold increase in expression levels during the pupal to adult transition, compared to a 2 fold increase in <italic>Set1</italic> (Figure S2B). These observations coupled with the previous report of Set2 function downstream of IP<sub>3</sub>R/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in larval glutamatergic neurons(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Mitra et al., 2020</xref>), led us to pursue the role of Set2 in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons.</p>

<p><italic>Set2</italic> encodes the only <italic>Drosophila</italic> methyltransferase which is specific for H3K36 trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Stabell et al., 2007</xref>). To understand the functional significance, if any, of down-regulation of <italic>Set2</italic> in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons upon loss of SOCE, four independent <italic>Set2</italic> RNAi constructs were obtained. Knockdown of <italic>Set2</italic> in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons with all four RNAi lines tested resulted in significant flight defects (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; S2C). <italic>Set2</italic> function for flight was additionally verified in the PPL1 DANs projecting to the γ2α’1 lobe of the mushroom body (<italic>MB296BGAL4</italic>; Figure S2D). To test the hypothesis that <italic>Set2</italic> expression and function for flight is regulated by SOCE, we overexpressed <italic>Set2</italic> in the <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> background, using GAL4-UAS driven heterologous <italic>Set2<sup>WT</sup></italic>expression or CRISPR-dCas9::VPR driven overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>) from the endogenous locus, and measured flight (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> data in purple and brown). Flies expressing <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic>in the <italic>THD’</italic> neurons, which are flightless, exhibit significant rescue in flight bout durations upon <italic>Set2</italic> overexpression, through either method (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, compare red with purple and brown data), but not upon expression of a control transgene, <italic>GCamP6m</italic> (Figure S2E, compare data in green and red). Additionally, overexpression of a key SOCE component, the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor <italic>STIM</italic> in a <italic>Set2<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> background led to a rescue (Figure S2E, compare pink and grey data). Excess STIM presumably drives higher SOCE sufficient to rescue flight bout durations caused by deficient <italic>Set2</italic> levels. These two sets of data taken together with downregulation of <italic>Set2</italic> upon expression of <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) support the hypothesis that SOCE driven expression of <italic>Set2</italic> in fpDANs is required for flight. That Set2 function downstream of SOCE, occurs specifically through its methyltransferase activity was supported through experiments where knockdown of the demethylase <italic>Kdm4B</italic>, the primary histone demethylase expressed in these neurons (Figure S2F), rescued flight in <italic>THD’&gt;Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; data in pink). Knockdown of the lower expressed <italic>Drosophila</italic> H3K36 demethylase isoform, <italic>Kdm4A,</italic> did not show a similar rescue (Figure S2G; data in pink). Moreover, both <italic>Set2</italic> depletion and loss of SOCE (<italic>THD’&gt;Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic>) lead to a decrease in the normalised H3K36me3 signal in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand if deficient H3K36me3 is found in the SOCE-responsive genes, we quantified the enrichment of H3K36me3 at SOCE-responsive loci from an H3K36me3 ChIP-Seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</xref>) from wild-type adult heads (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). We observed an enrichment of the H3K36me3 signal over the gene bodies of the SOCE-responsive genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Additionally, genes that were more affected by loss of SOCE (greater extent of downregulation), had a correspondingly higher H3K36me3 signal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) as compared with a random set of genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>; data in grey), further indicating that one of the ways SOCE regulates gene expression is through Set2 mediated deposition of H3K36me3.</p>
<p>The gene <italic>E(z</italic>) that encodes a component of the PRC2 complex (<italic>EZH2</italic>), which deposits H3K27me3 is up-regulated upon loss of SOCE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) suggesting that SOCE could affect additional histone modifications. While H3K36me3 is a marker for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Krogan et al., 2003</xref>), H3K27me3 is a repressive signature which silences transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cai et al., 2021</xref>). These two marks are antagonistic as deduced from studies which have shown that deposition of H3K36me3 allosterically inhibits the Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC2), thereby preventing it from depositing the H3K27me3 signature at the same genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Finogenova et al., 2020</xref>). A comparison of H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 peaks over the 822 SOCE-responsive genes revealed a higher enrichment of H3K36me3 versus H3K27me3 in wild type fly heads (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that robust expression of these genes in adult neurons occurs through a SOCE-dependent mechanism initiated in late pupae (schematised in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we fed SOCE-deficient flies (<italic>THD’GAL4&gt;Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic>) GSK343, a pharmacological inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Verma et al., 2012</xref>) of the EZH2 component of PRC2 that is known to reduce H3K27me3 chromatin marks and performed flight assays. Feeding of GSK343 lead to partial rescue of flight in <italic>THD’&gt; Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> flies in a dose dependent manner with maximal flight bout durations of up to 400 sec (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>; S2H).</p>

<title>Normal cellular responses of PPL1 DANs require Orai mediated SOCE and H3K36 trimethylation</title>
<p>Next we investigated Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in SOCE and H3K36 trimethylation deficient <italic>THD’</italic> PPL1 DANs upon stimulation with a neuromodulatory signal for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR). It is known that <italic>THD’</italic> marked PPL1 DANs receive cholinergic inputs that stimulate store Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the IP<sub>3</sub>R, leading to SOCE through Orai (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ebihara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sharma and Hasan, 2020</xref>).

<p>An understanding of how Set2 might rescue cellular IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was obtained in an earlier study where it was demonstrated that <italic>Set2</italic> participates in a transcriptional feedback loop to control the expression of key upstream components such as the <italic>mAChR</italic> and the <italic>IP</italic><sub>3</sub><italic>R</italic> in a set of larval glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Mitra et al., 2020</xref>). To test whether <italic>Set2</italic> acts through a similar transcriptional feedback loop in the current context, <italic>THD’</italic> DANs were isolated using FACS from appropriate genetic backgrounds and tested for expression of key genes required for IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<italic>mAChR</italic> and <italic>itpr)</italic> and SOCE (<italic>Stim</italic> and <italic>Orai</italic>). Loss of SOCE upon expression of <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> lead to a significant decrease in the expression of <italic>itpr (72%</italic> downregulation; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), <italic>mAChR (56%</italic> downregulation; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), <italic>Stim (63%</italic> downregulation; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) in <italic>THD’</italic> DANs. As expected <italic>Orai</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) increased 2-fold presumably due to overexpression of the <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> transgene. Importantly, knockdown of <italic>Set2</italic> in <italic>THD’</italic> neurons also led to downregulation of <italic>itpr</italic> (43%), <italic>mAChR</italic> (78%) and <italic>Stim</italic> (61%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>Set2</italic> in the background of <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic>led to a rescue in the levels of <italic>itpr</italic> (69% increase), <italic>mAChR</italic> (43% increase), and <italic>Stim</italic> (40% increase) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).

These findings indicate that while SOCE regulates <italic>Set2</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), <italic>Set2</italic> in turn functions in a feedback loop to regulate expression of key components of IP<sub>3</sub>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and SOCE such as <italic>mAchR, IP</italic><sub>3</sub><italic>R, STIM</italic> and <italic>Orai</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, ectopic <italic>Set2</italic> overexpression in SOCE deficient <italic>THD’</italic> neurons, leads to increase in expression of key genes that facilitate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling and SOCE (schematised in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>

<title>Trithorax-like or Trl is an SOCE responsive transcription factor in <italic>THD’</italic> DANs</title>
<p>The data so far identify SOCE as a key developmental regulator of the neuronal transcriptome in <italic>THD’</italic> marked DANs, where it upregulates Set2 expression and thus enhances the activation mark of H3K36 trimethylation on specific chromatin regions. However, the mechanism by which SOCE regulates expression of <italic>Set2,</italic> and other relevant effector genes remained unresolved (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). In mammalian T cells, SOCE leads to de-phosphorylation of the NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells) family of transcription factors by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin sensitive phosphatase Calcineurin, followed by their nuclear translocation and ultimately transcription of relevant target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hogan et al., 2003</xref>). Unlike mammals, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes a single member of the NFAT gene family, which does not possess calcineurin binding sites, and is therefore insensitive to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Keyser et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to identify transcription factors (TFs) that regulate SOCE-mediated gene expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons, we examined the upstream regions (up to 10 kb) of SOCE-regulated genes using motif enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Zambelli et al., 2009</xref>) for TF binding sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This analysis helped identify several putative TFs with enriched binding sites in the regulatory regions of SOCE-regulated genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, S4A) which were then analyzed for developmental expression trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hu et al., 2017</xref>) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; lower panel). Among the top 10 identified TFs, the homeobox transcription factor Trl/GAF had the highest enrichment value, lowest p-value (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and was consistently expressed in the CNS through all developmental stages, with a distinct peak during pupal development (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; lower panel). To test the functional significance of Trl/GAF, we tested flight in flies with <italic>THD’</italic> specific knockdown of <italic>Trl</italic> using two independent RNAi lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) as well as in existing <italic>Trl</italic> mutant combinations that were viable as adults (Figure S4B). In all cases significant flight deficits were observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, S4B). Moreover, the flight deficits could be rescued by raising SOCE either directly through overexpression of <italic>STIM</italic> or indirectly by <italic>Set2</italic> overexpression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; data in brown and pink respectively).</p>

<p>To further test Trl function, as an effector of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and SOCE, we investigated genetic interactions of <italic>Trl<sup>13C</sup></italic>, a hypomorphic mutant <italic>Trl</italic> allele, with an existing deficiency for the ER-Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor STIM (<italic>STIM<sup>KO</sup></italic>), an essential activator of the Orai channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) as well as existing mutants for an intracellular ER-Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel, the IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Joshi et al., 2004</xref>). While <italic>STIM<sup>KO</sup>/+</italic> flies demonstrate normal flight bout durations, adding a single copy of the <italic>Trl<sup>13C</sup></italic> allele to the <italic>STIM<sup>KO</sup></italic> heterozygotes (i.e., <italic>STIM<sup>KO</sup>/Trl<sup>13C</sup></italic> trans-heterozygotes) resulted in significant flight deficits, which could be rescued by overexpression of <italic>STIM</italic> or <italic>Set2</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).

<p>To test if Trl drives cellular function in the fpDANs, we stimulated the mAChR with CCh and measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in fpDANs with knockdown of <italic>Trl</italic>.

<p>The results obtained so far indicate that Trl could function as an intermediary transcription factor between SOCE and its downstream effector gene <italic>Set2</italic>.

<p>Next we investigated the extent to which the identified SOCE-Trl-Set2 mechanism impacts fpDAN function. ‘Ion transport’ is among the top GO terms identified in SOCE-responsive genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, multiple classes of ion channel genes including several Na<sup>+,</sup> K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are downregulated in fpDANs upon expression of <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>, E). Regulation of ion channel gene expression by Trl was indicated from the enrichment of Trl binding sites in regulatory regions of some ion channel loci (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). We purified fpDANs with knock down of <italic>Trl</italic> (<italic>THD’&gt;Trl<sup>RNAi-1</sup></italic>) and measured expression of a few key voltage-gated ion channel genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). <italic>NaCP60E</italic>, <italic>para</italic> (Na<sup>+</sup> channels), <italic>cac</italic>, <italic>ca-α1D</italic> (VGCC subunits), <italic>hk</italic>, and <italic>eag</italic> (outward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels) are all downregulated between 0.6-0.9 fold upon <italic>Trl</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>) as well as upon loss of SOCE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of key voltage-gated ion channel genes which are required for the depolarization-mediated response, maintenance of electrical excitability and neurotransmitter release is a focus of the transcriptional program set in place by SOCE-Trl-Set2.</p>
<p>To test the functional consequences of altered ion channel gene expression downstream of Trl, neuronal activity of the fpDANs was tested by means of KCl-evoked depolarisation. PPL1 DANs exhibited a robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> response that was lost upon knock down of <italic>Trl</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H-J</xref>; data in orange). In consonance with the earlier behavioural experiments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), overexpression of <italic>Trl<sup>+</sup></italic> in <italic>THD’</italic> DANs did not rescue the KCl response in PPL1 DANs with loss of SOCE (<italic>OraiE<sup>180A</sup>; Trl<sup>OE</sup></italic>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>, J), further reinforcing the hypothesis that, Trl activity in fpDANs is dependent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Orai.</p>
<p>Response to KCl is also lost in PPL1 neurons by knockdown of <italic>Set2</italic> and restored to a significant extent by overexpression of <italic>Set2</italic> in <italic>THD’</italic> DANs lacking SOCE (<italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup>;Set2<sup>OE</sup></italic><sup>;</sup> <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>).

Both forms of perturbation abrogated the depolarisation response to KCl in PPL1 neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6D-F</xref>; data in purple or orange respectively).

<p>Having confirmed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response towards KCl depolarisation requires VGCCs, we tested the expression level of key components of <italic>Drosophila</italic> VGCCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>) in <italic>THD’</italic> DANs, including <italic>cacophony</italic> (<italic>cac</italic>), <italic>ca-α1D</italic>, <italic>ca-α1T</italic>, and <italic>ca-ý</italic>.

<p>The functional significance of downregulation of VGCC subunits by the SOCE-Trl-Set2 pathway was tested directly by knockdown of the 4 VGCC subunits independently in PPL1 neurons followed by measurement of flight bout durations. Significant loss of flight was observed with knockdown of each subunit (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>) though in no case was the phenotype as strong as what is observed with loss of SOCE (<italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These data suggest that in addition to VGCC subunit expression, appropriate expression of other ion channels in the fpDANs is of functional significance. This idea is further supported by the observation that loss of flight upon loss of SOCE cannot be restored by overexpression of <italic>cac</italic> alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>) indicating that optimal neuronal activity requires an ensemble of genes, including ion channels, whose expression is regulated by SOCE-Trl-Set2.</p>

<p>Over the course of development, neurons define an excitability set point within a dynamic range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Truszkowski and Aizenman, 2015</xref>), which stabilizes existing connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Mayseless et al., 2023</xref>) and enables circuit maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Johnson-Venkatesh et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we identify an essential role for the store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel <italic>Orai</italic> in setting the excitability threshold of a subset of dopaminergic neurons central to a MB circuit for <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight. Orai<italic>-</italic>mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, initiated by neuromodulatory acetylcholine signals, is required for amplification of a signalling cascade, that begins by activation of the homeo-box transcription factor Trl, followed by upregulation of several genes, including <italic>Set2</italic>, a gene that encodes an enzyme for an activating epigenetic mark, H3K36me3. Set2 in turn establishes a transcriptional feedback loop to drive expression of key neuronal signaling genes, including a repertoire of voltage-gated ion channel genes required for neuronal activity in mature PPL1 dopaminergic neurons.</p>

<title>SOCE supports gene expression transitions during critical developmental windows</title>
<p>Studies in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body have identified spontaneous bouts of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel mediated neuronal activity, through as yet unknown mechanisms, which occur during early adulthood driving refinement and maturation of behaviours such as associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Leinwand and Scott, 2021</xref>). Our studies here, on a subset of 21-23 central dopaminergic neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref>, C) of which some send projections to the mushroom body and regulate flight behaviour, provide a mechanistic explanation for neuromodulation-dependent intracellular signaling culminating in transcriptional maturation of a circuit supporting adult flight. In the critical developmental window of 72-96 hrs APF, a cohort of SOCE-responsive genes, that include a range of ion channels, undergo a wave of induction. Loss of SOCE at this stage thus renders these neurons functionally incompetent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B-D</xref>, 6G-I, 7D-F) and abrogates flight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Developmentally assembled neuronal circuits require experience/activity-dependent maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akin and Zipursky, 2020</xref>). The requirement of SOCE for flight circuit function during the early post eclosion phase (0-2 days) suggests that maturation of the flight circuit extends into early adulthood, where presumably feedback from circuit activity may further refine synaptic strengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sugie et al., 2018</xref>). Expression of <italic>Orai<sup>E180A</sup></italic> in 5 day old adults had no effect on flight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that either SOCE is not required for maintaining gene expression in adults or that wildtype Orai channel proteins from late pupal and early adults perdure for long periods. The absence of any visible changes to neurite patterning suggest that SOCE in the MB-DANs works primarily to refine synaptic function. In summary, our findings here identify Orai-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry as a key signaling step for driving coordinated gene expression enabling the maturation of nascent neuronal circuits and sustenance of adult behaviour.</p>

<title>SOCE regulates a balance between competing epigenetic signatures</title>
<p>Chromatin structure and function is dynamic over the course of brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kishi and Gotoh, 2018</xref>). One way neurons achieve dynamic spatio-temporal control over developmental gene expression is via epigenetic mechanisms such as post translational histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Geng et al., 2021</xref>). Cells possess an extensive toolkit of histone modifiers, with characterised effects on transcriptional output by either activating or repressing gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>). However, relatively little, is known about how modifiers of histone marks are in turn regulated to bring about the requisite changes in neuronal gene expression over developmental timescales.</p>
<p>The SET-domain containing family of histone modifiers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), including H3K36me3 methyltransferase Set2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), identified here appear to function as key transcriptional effectors induced downstream of neuromodulatory inputs that stimulate Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Orai during pupal and adult maturation of flight promoting dopaminergic neurons. SOCE-driven <italic>Set2</italic>-mediated H3K36me3 enhances the expression of key GPCRS, components of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and ion channels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>, B) for optimal dopaminergic neuron function (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D-F</xref>) and flight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Rescue of flight by genetic depletion of an epigenetic ‘eraser’ <italic>Kdm4B</italic>, an H3K36me3 demethylase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) suggests that a balance between perdurance of H3K36me3 and its removal is actively maintained on the expressed genes. Interestingly, another member of the SET domain family, <italic>E(z)</italic> is up-regulated upon loss of SOCE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>)<italic>. E(z)</italic> is a component of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PRC2 complex (Polycomb repressive complex), which represses gene expression through H2K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>).

Loss of SOCE leads to deficient Set2-mediated H3K36me3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), a likely shifting of the balance in favour of PRC2 mediated H3K27me3 and overall repression in gene expression (as observed in Fig S1H, I). Feeding SOCE-deficient animals a pharmacological inhibitor of PRC2 (GSK434) led to a significant rescue in behaviour (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>) presumably by disinhibition of H3K27me3 mediated gene repression. Though flight initiation is rescued in a dose dependent manner, the duration of flight bouts is not sustained (Figure S2H) indicating that suppression of H3K27me3 marks in the SOCE-deficient flies is partial. Our findings indicate additional roles for other histone modifications such as Set1 mediated H3K4me3, which may work in concert to regulate developmental gene expression programs stimulated by SOCE. Future studies directed at a comprehensive cataloguing of multiple epigenetic signatures in defined neuronal subsets using cell-specific techniques should help elucidate these mechanisms.</p>

<title>Trl as an SOCE responsive transcription factor</title>
<p>SOCE-mediated regulation of gene expression has been reported in mammalian neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Somasundaram et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Richhariya et al., 2017</xref>), through as yet unknown mechanisms. A combination of motif enrichment analysis over regulatory regions of SOCE-responsive genes and expression enrichment analysis in cells of interest, helped generate a list of putative SOCE-responsive transcription factors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B). Among these we experimentally validated Trl/Trithorax-like/GAGA factor as a transcription factor required for maturation of excitability in flight promoting dopaminergic neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Although Trl function has been reported in the context of early embryonic development, where it has been implicated in zygotic genome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gaskill et al., 2021</xref>) (ZGA), expression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Shimojima, 2003</xref>), dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Greenberg et al., 2004</xref>), and expression of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> voltage-gated calcium channel subunit in germ cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dorogova et al., 2014</xref>), his is the first ever report of its role in regulating neuronal gene expression in the context of SOCE and circuit maturation.</p>
<p>In vitro studies on <italic>Drosophila</italic> Trl reveal that it utilizes a Q-rich intrinsically disordered domain (IDD) to self-multimerize or interact with a wide range of accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Wilkins and Lis, 1999</xref>). Multimeric complexes of Trl reside on chromatin with an exceptionally long residence time and maintain chromatin in an ‘open’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). Trl has also been reported to directly interact with components of the Transcription initiation and elongation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chopra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Li et al., 2013</xref>), support long distance promoter-enhancer interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mahmoudi, 2003</xref>), mediate active ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling by maintaining nucleosome free stretches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Tsukiyama et al., 1994</xref>), and regulating global gene expression by controlling transcriptional stalling and pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Tsai et al., 2016</xref>). SOCE-dependent gene regulation may rely upon multiple transcription factors acting in concert in a cell type and developmental stage specific contexts, of which Trl may be just one. Future studies directed at other possible transcription factors downstream of SOCE would be of interest.</p>

<title>SOCE and the control of neuronal excitability and cholinergic neuromodulation of a tripartite synapse in the mushroom body</title>
<p>Neurons undergo maturation of their electrical properties with a gradual increase in depolarizing responses and synaptic transmission over the course of pupal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jarvilehto and Finell, 1983</xref>). Here we show that a subset of dopaminergic neurons require a balance of ion channels for optimal excitation and inhibition essential for adult function. Neuromodulatory signals, such as acetylcholine are essential for acquiring this balance and act via an SOCE-Trl-Set2 mechanism during late pupal and early adult stages. The ability of <italic>Set2</italic> overexpression to rescue SOCE-deficient phenotypes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A-C</xref>) indicates that anomalous gene expression is the underlying basis of this phenotype. Indeed, SOCE deficient dopaminergic neurons show reduced expression of an ensemble of voltage-gated ion channel genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref>, F). including genes encoding the outward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel <italic>shaw</italic>, slow-inactivating voltage gated K<sup>+</sup> channel <italic>shaker</italic>, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> gated K<sup>+</sup> channel <italic>slowpoke</italic> and <italic>cacophony</italic> a subunit of the voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Ion channels like <italic>Shaker</italic> and <italic>slowpoke</italic> play an important role in establishing resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Singh and Wu, 1990</xref>), neuronal repolarisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lichtinghagen et al., 1990</xref>) and mediating afterhyperpolarisation (AHP) after repeated bouts of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Ping et al., 2011</xref>). Though dopaminergic neurons require <italic>Set2</italic> mediated expression of <italic>cacophony</italic> for excitability, <italic>cacophony</italic> is in itself insufficient to rescue the loss in excitability and flight deficits upon loss of SOCE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>). Both flight and KCl-depolarisation in SOCE-deficient neurons could, however, be rescued by expression of a heterologous depolarisation activated Na<sup>+</sup> channel NachBac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Nitabach, 2006</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7B-D</xref>), which increases neuronal excitability by stimulating a low threshold positive feedback loop and to a lesser extent by CsChrimson-mediated optogenetic induction of neuronal activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). The poorer rescue by optogenetic activation may stem from the fact that sustained bursts of activity are non-physiological and can deplete the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arrigoni and Saper, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kaeser and Regehr, 2017</xref>). Other indirect forms of inducing neuronal hyperactivation (Figures S7A, B) in SOCE-deficient neurons also achieved minor rescues in flight. These results identify SOCE as a key driver downstream of developmentally salient neuromodulatory signals for expression of an ion channels suite that enables generation of intrinsic electrical properties and functional maturation of the PPL1 DANs, and the flight circuit.</p>

<title>Flight Assays</title>
<p>Flight assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Manjila and Hasan, 2018</xref>). Briefly, flies aged 3–5 days of either sex were tested in batches of 8–10 flies, and a minimum of 30 flies were tested for each genotype. Adult flies were anaesthetized on ice for 2–3 min and then tethered between at the head-thorax junction using a thin metal wire and nail polish. Post recovery at room temperature for 2-3 min, an air puff was provided as stimulus to initiate flight. Flight duration was recorded for each fly for 15 min. For all control genotypes, GAL4 or UAS strains were crossed to the Wild Type strain, <italic>Canton S</italic>. Flight assays are represented in the form of a swarm plot, wherein each dot represents a flight bout duration for a single fly. The colours indicate different genotypes. The ý Flight parameter refers to the mean difference for comparisons against the shared CS control which is shown as a Cumming estimation plot(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ho et al., 2018</xref>). On the lower axes, mean differences are plotted as bootstrap sampling distributions. Each mean difference is depicted as a dot.

Approximately 100 pupae per sample were washed in 1×PBS and 70% ethanol. Pupal/adult CNSs were dissected in Schneider’s medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% PenStrep, 0.02 mM insulin, 20 mM glutamine and 0.04 mg/ml glutathione. Post dissection, the CNSs were treated with an enzyme solution [0.75 g/l Collagenase and 0.4 g/l Dispase in Rinaldini’s solution (8 mg/ml NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml KCl, 0.05 mg/ml NaH2PO4, 1 mg/ml NaHCO3 and 0.1 mg/ml glucose)] at room temperature for 30 min. They were then washed and resuspended in ice-cold Schneider’s medium and gently triturated several times using a pipette tip to obtain a single-cell suspension. This suspension was then passed through a 40 mm mesh filter to remove clumps and kept on ice until sorting (less than 1 h). Flow cytometry was performed on a FACS Aria Fusion cell sorter (BD Biosciences) with a 100 mm nozzle at 60 psi. The threshold for GFP-positive cells was set using dissociated neurons from a non GFP-expressing wild-type strain (<italic>Canton S</italic>).

Each sample consisted of five CNS homogenized in 500 µl of TRIzol (Ambion, ThermoFisher Scientific) per sample. At least three biological replicate samples were made for each genotype. After homogenization the sample was kept on ice and either processed further within 30 min or stored at −80°C for up to 4 weeks before processing. RNA was isolated following the manufacturer’s protocol. Purity of the isolated RNA was estimated by NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and integrity was checked by running it on a 1% Tris-EDTA agarose gel. Approximately 100 ng of total RNA was used per sample for cDNA synthesis. DNAse treatment and first-strand synthesis were performed as described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>).

Embedded brains were bathed in AHL and then subjected to functional imaging. The genetically encoded calcium sensor <italic>GCaMP6m</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) was used to record changes in intracellular cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to stimulation with carbachol or KCl. The GRAB-DA sensor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sun et al., 2018</xref>) was used to measure evoked dopamine release. Images were taken as a time series on a xy plane at an interval of 1 s using a 20× objective with an NA of 0.7 on an Olympus FV3000 inverted confocal microscope. A 488 nm laser line was used to record GCaMP6m / GRAB-DA measurements. All live-imaging experiments were performed with at least 10 independent brain preparations. For measuring evoked responses, KCl/Carbachol, was added on top of the samples.

<p>In Drosophila melanogater, the Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) channel, Orai, is required for the development of flight-promoting dopaminergic neurons. Here, Mitra et al. determine that expression of a loss-of-function Orai1 mutant during the 72-96 hour window of pupal development impairs gene expression in dopaminergic flight neurons in part through the expression of Set2, a histone methyltransferase. The authors identify a large number of genes that are controlled by Set2, and show that Set2 is controlled by the trl transcription factor. Although the findings reported here are <bold>important</bold>, the evidence supporting some of the claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Mitra and coworkers analyses the functional role of Orai in the excitability of central dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila. The authors show that a dominant-negative mutant of Orai (OraiE180A) significantly alters the gene expression profile of flight-promoting dopaminergic neurons (fpDANs). Among them, OraiE180A attenuates the expression of Set2 and enhances that of E(z) shifting the level of epigenetic signatures that modulate gene expression. The present results also demonstrate that Set2 expression via Orai involves the transcription factor Trl. The Orai-Trl-Set1 pathway modulates the expression of VGCC, which, in turn, are involved in dopamine release. The topic investigated is interesting and timely and the study is carefully performed and technically sound; however, there are several major concerns that need to be addressed:</p>
<p>1- In Figure S2E, STIM is overexpressed in the absence of Set2 and this leads to rescue. It is presumed that STIM overexpression causes excess SOCE, yet this is rarely the case. Perhaps the bigger concern, however, is how excess SOCE might overcome the loss of SET2 if SET2 mediates SOCE-induced development of flight. These data are more consistent with something other than SET2 mediating this function.</p>
<p>2- In Figure 3, data is provided linking SET2 expression and Cch-induced Ca2+ responses. The presentation of these data is confusing. In addition, the results may be a simple side effect of SET2-dependent expression of IP3R. Given that this article is about SOCE, why isn't SOCE shown here? More generally, there are no measurements of SOCE in this entire article. Measuring SOCE (not what is measured in response to Cch) could help eliminate some of this confusion.</p>
<p>3- A significant gap in the study relates to the conclusion that trl is a SOCE-regulated transcription factor. This conclusion is entirely based on genetic analysis of STIMKO heterozygous flies in which a copy of the trl13C hypomorph allele is introduced. While these results suggest a genetic interaction between the expression of the two genes, the evidence that expression translates into a functional interaction that places trl immediately downstream of SOCE is not rigorous or convincing. All that can be said is that the double mutant shows a defect in flight which could arise from an interruption of the circuit. Further, it is not clear whether the trl13C hypomorph is only introduced during the critical 72-96 hour time window when the Orai1E180E phenotype shows up. The same applies to the over-expression of Set2 and the other genes. If the expression is not temporally controlled, then the phenotype could be due to the blockade of an entirely different aspect of flight neuron function.</p>
<p>4- In Figure 4, data is shown that SOCE compensates for the loss of Trl, the presumed mediator of SOCE-dependent flight. The fact that flight deficits are rescued by raising SOCE in the absence of Trl is very inconsistent with this conclusion.</p>
<p>5- In Figure 5 (A-C), data is provided that Trl transcripts are unaffected by loss of SOCE and that overexpression cannot rescue flightlessness. From this, the authors conclude that this gene &quot;must&quot; be calcium responsive. While that is one possibility, it is also possible that these genes are not functionally linked.</p>
<p>6- There is no characterization of SOCE in fpDANs from flies expressing native Orai or the dominant negative OraiE180A mutant. While the authors refer to previous studies, as the manuscript is essentially based on Orai function thapsigargin-induced SOCE should be tested using the Ca2+ add-back protocol in order to assess the release of Ca2+ from the ER in response to thapsigargin as well as the subsequent SOCE.</p>
<p>7- In the experiments performed to rescue flight duration in Set2RNAi individuals the authors overexpress STIM and attribute the effect to &quot;Excess STIM presumably drives higher SOCE sufficient to rescue flight bout durations caused by deficient Set2 levels.&quot;. This should be experimentally tested as the STIM:Orai stoichiometry has been demonstrated as essential for SOCE.</p>
<p>8- The authors show that overexpression of OraiE108A results in Stim downregulation at a mRNA level. What about the protein level? And more important, how does OraiE108A downregulate Stim expression? Does it promote Stim degradation? Does it inhibit Stim expression?</p>
<p>9- Lines 271-273, the authors state &quot;whereas overexpression of a transgene encoding Set2 in THD' neurons either with loss of SOCE (OraiE180A) or with knockdown of the IP3R (itprRNAi), lead to significant rescue of the Ca2+ response&quot;. This is attributed to a positive effect of Set2 expression on IP3R expression and the authors show a positive correlation between these two parameters; however, there is no demonstration that Set2 expression can rescue IP3R expression in cells where the IP3R is knocked down (itprRNAi). This should be further demonstrated.</p>
<p>10- The data presented in Figure 3E should be functionally demonstrated by analyzing the ability of CCh to release Ca2+ from the intracellular stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+.</p>
<p>11- The conclusion that SOCE regulates the neuronal excitability threshold is based entirely on either partial behavioral rescue of flight, or measurements of KCl-induced Ca2+ rises monitored by GCaMP6m in DAN neurons. The threshold for neuronal excitability is a precise parameter based on rheobase measurements of action potentials in current-clamp. Measurements of slow calcium signals using a slow dye such as GCaMp6m should not be equated with neuronal excitability. What is measured is a loss of the calcium response in high K depolarization experiments, which occurs due to the loss of expression of Cav channels. Hence, the use of this term is not accurate and will confuse readers. The use of terms referring to neuronal excitability needs to be changed throughout the manuscript. As such, the conclusions regarding neuronal excitability should be strongly tempered and the data reinterpreted as there are no true measurements of neuronal excitability in the manuscript. All that can be said is that expression of certain ion channel genes is suppressed. Since both Na+ channels and K+ channel expression is down-regulated, it is hard to say precisely how membrane excitability is altered without action potential analysis.</p>
<p>12- Related, since trl does not contain any molecular domains that could be regulated by Ca2+ signaling, it is unclear whether trl is directly regulated by SOCE or the regulation is highly indirect. Reporter assays evaluating trl activation upon Ca2+ rises would provide much stronger and more direct evidence for the conclusion that trl is a SOCE-regulated TF. As such the evidence is entirely based on RNAi downregulation of trl which indicates that trl is essential but has no bearing on exactly what point of the signaling cascade it is involved.</p>
<p>13- Are NFAT levels altered in the Orai1 loss of function mutant? If not, this should be explicitly stated. It would seem based on previous literature that some gene regulation may be related to the downregulation of this established Ca2+-dependent transcription factor. Same for NFkb.</p>
<p>14- Does over-expression of Set2 restore ion channel expression especially those of the VGCCs? This would provide rigorous, direct evidence that SOCE-mediated regulation of VGCCs through Set2 controls voltage-gated calcium channel signaling.</p>
<p>15- All 6 representative panels from Figure 3B are duplicated in Figure 4G. Likewise, 2 representative panels from Figure 5H are duplicated in Figure 6D. Although these panels all represent the results from control experiments, the relevant experiments were likely not conducted at the same time and under the same conditions. Thus, control images from other experiments should not be used simply because they correspond to controls. This situation should be clarified.</p>
<p>16- The figures are unusually busy and difficult to follow. In part this is because they usually have many panels (Fig. 1: A-I; Fig. 2, A-J, etc) but also because the arrangement of the panels is not consistent: sometimes the following panel is found to the right, other times it is below. It would help the reader to make the order of the panels consistent, and, if possible, reduce the number of panels and/or move some of the panels to new figures.</p>
<p>17- As a final recommendation, the reviewers suggest that the authors a- Reword the text that refers to membrane excitability since membrane excitability was not directly measured here. b-Explain why STIM1 rescues the partial loss of flight in Set2 RNAi flies (Fig. S2E); and c- Explain how/why trl is calcium regulated and test using luciferase (or other) reporter assays whether Orai activation leads to trl activation.</p>

Perhaps the bigger concern, however, is how excess SOCE might overcome the loss of SET2 if SET2 mediates SOCE-induced development of flight. These data are more consistent with something other than SET2 mediating this function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our statement that STIM overexpression overcomes deficits in SOCE is based on the following published work:</p>
<p>1. Studies of SOCE in wildtype cultured larval Drosophila neurons demonstrated that overexpression of STIM raised SOCE to the same extent as co-expression of STIM and Orai in the WT background (Chakraborty et al, 2016; Figure 1D).</p>
<p>2. Both Carbachol-induced IP3-mediated Ca2+ release and SOCE (measured by Ca2+ add back after Thapsigargin-induced store depletion) were rescued in primary cultures of IP3R hypomorphic mutant (itprku) Drosophila neurons by overexpression of STIM (Agrawal et al., 2010; Figure 8A-G).</p>
<p>3. Deb et al., 2016 (Supplementary Figure 2h,i) reaffirmed that overexpression of STIM significantly improves SOCE after Thapsigargin-induced passive store-depletion in Drosophila neurons expressing IP3RRNAi.</p>
<p>4. Consistent with the cellular rescue of SOCE, defects in flight initiation and physiology observed in the heteroallelic IP3R hypomorphic background (itprku) could be rescued by overexpression of STIM (Agrawal et al., 2010; Figure 3A-E) as well as Orai (Venkiteswaran and Hasan, 2009; Figure 3).</p>
<p>5. In Figure S2E, we show that flight deficits arising from THD’&gt; Set2RNAi are rescued upon overexpression of STIM (i.e. THD’&gt;Set2RNAi; STIMOE). Here and in another recent publication (Mitra et al., 2021) we show that neurons expressing Set2RNAi exhibit reduced expression of the IP3R and reduced ER-Ca2+ release presumably leading to reduced SOCE. As mentioned above we have consistently found that STIM overexpression raises both IP3-mediated Ca2+ release and SOCE in Drosophila neurons.</p>
<p>In this study, we propose that Ca2+ release through the IP3R followed by SOCE are part of a positive feedback loop driving expression of Set2 which in turn upregulates expression of mAChR and IP3R (Figure 3F) to regulate dopaminergic neuron function. Our observation that loss of Set2 (THD’&gt;Set2RNAi) can be rescued by STIM overexpression is consistent with this model because:</p>
<p>1. Loss of Set2 (THD’&gt;Set2RNAi) results in downregulation of several genes including mAChR and IP3R leading to decreased SOCE.</p>
<p>2. As evident from our previous studies increased STIM expression in the Set2RNAi background (THD’&gt;Set2RNAi; STIMOE) is expected to enhance SOCE which we predict would rescue Set2 expression leading to rescue of other Set2 dependent downstream functions like flight (Figure 2D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Figure 3, data is provided linking SET2 expression and Cch-induced Ca2+ responses. The presentation of these data is confusing. In addition, the results may be a simple side effect of SET2-dependent expression of IP3R. Given that this article is about SOCE, why isn't SOCE shown here? More generally, there are no measurements of SOCE in this entire article. Measuring SOCE (not what is measured in response to Cch) could help eliminate some of this confusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will re-write this section in the revised version for better clarity and explain how Set2-dependent IP3R expression is an important component of Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry in fpDANs. Here, we propose that IP3-mediated Ca2+ release  and SOCE, through Orai, are together part of a positive feedback loop driving transcription of Set2 which in turn upregulates mAChR and IP3R expression (Figure 3F). We hypothesized that the observed loss of CCh-induced Ca2+ response in the Set2RNAi background (Figure 3B-D; THD’&gt;Set2RNAi) results from decreased itpr and mAChR expression and verified this in Figure 3E. This is further validated by the rescue of CCh-induced Ca2+ response and itpr/mAChR expression in the OraiE180A background upon Set2 overexpression (Figure 3B-E; THD’&gt;OraiE180A; Set2OE). We were constrained to measure CCh-induced Ca2+ responses in OraiE180A expressing neurons for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. SOCE measurements through Tg mediated store Ca2+ release  followed by Ca2+ add back require a 0 Ca2+ environment that can only be achieved in culture. The Drosophila brain is bathed in hemolymph which contains Ca2+ and there do not exist any methods to readily deplete Ca2+ from the tissue to create a 0 Ca2+ environment without also effecting the health of the neurons.</p>
<p>2. Cultures of the subset of dopaminergic neurons (THD’) we have focused on in this study were not feasible due to the small number of neurons being studied from the total number of dopaminergic neurons in the brain (~35/400). In previous studies we have shown that SOCE post-Tg induced store depletion is abrogated in cultured dopaminergic neurons from Drosophila upon expression of OraiE180A  (Pathak et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Carbachol-induced IP3-mediated Ca2+ release is tightly coupled to SOCE in Drosophila neurons (Venkiteswaran and Hasan, 2009) and Ca2+ release from the IP3R is  physiologically relevant for flight behavior in THD’ neurons (Sharma and Hasan, 2020).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. A significant gap in the study relates to the conclusion that trl is a SOCE-regulated transcription factor. This conclusion is entirely based on genetic analysis of STIMKO heterozygous flies in which a copy of the trl13C hypomorph allele is introduced. While these results suggest a genetic interaction between the expression of the two genes, the evidence that expression translates into a functional interaction that places trl immediately downstream of SOCE is not rigorous or convincing. All that can be said is that the double mutant shows a defect in flight which could arise from an interruption of the circuit. Further, it is not clear whether the trl13C hypomorph is only introduced during the critical 72-96 hour time window when the Orai1E180E phenotype shows up. The same applies to the over-expression of Set2 and the other genes. If the expression is not temporally controlled, then the phenotype could be due to the blockade of an entirely different aspect of flight neuron function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The idea that Trl functions downstream of Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry in THD’ neurons is based on the following genetic evidence:</p>
<p>1. In Figure 4D, we show evidence of genetic interaction between trl-STIM and trl-Set2. The rescue of trl13c/STIMKO with STIM overexpression in THD’ neurons indicates that excess SOCE (driven by STIMOE) may activate the residual Trl  (there exists a WT Trl copy in this genetic background) to rescue THD’ flight function. This is further supported by the rescue of trl/STIMKO with Set2 overexpression in THD’ neurons, which is consistent with the feedback loop model proposed in Figure 5C - where we propose that reduced SOCE leads to reduced ‘activated’ Trl and thus reduced Set2 expression, and the latter is rescued by SET2OEThe manner in which SOCE ‘activates’ Trl is the subject of ongoing investigations.</p>
<p>2. The trl hypomorphic alleles (including trl13C) exist as genetic mutants and  they affect Trl function in all tissues throughout development. While we concede that these mutant alleles would affect multiple functions at other stages of development, which may impinge on the phenotypes noted in Figure S4B, we have used a targeted RNAi approach to validate Trl function specifically in the THD’ neurons (Figure 4C).</p>
<p>3. Overexpression mediated rescues (including Set2) were not induced only during the critical 72-96 hrs APF developmental window. Having established that Orai function drives critical gene expression during this window (Figure 1), it is reasonable to assume that Set2 rescue of loss of flight in OraiE180A occurs in the same time window where flight is disrupted.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>4- In Figure 4, data is shown that SOCE compensates for the loss of Trl, the presumed mediator of SOCE-dependent flight. The fact that flight deficits are rescued by raising SOCE in the absence of Trl is very inconsistent with this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for this confusion and will clarify in the revision. trl13c is a recessive allele of Trl and should be written as such throughout the text and in the figures (i.e trl13c and NOT Trl13c).   In all cases of Trl mutant rescue by STIMOE and Set2OE there exists residual Trl that can be activated by excess SOCE thus leading to the rescue. This is true for trl13C/ STIMKO where each mutant is present as a heterozygote  (the complete genotype of this strain is STIMKO/+; trl13c/+; this will be corrected in the revision). Similarly, for TrlRNAi  we expect reduced levels (but not complete loss) of Trl. Thus the SOCE rescue of loss of Trl occurs in conditions where Trl levels are reduced but NOT absent. Homozygous trl null mutants are lethal.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>5- In Figure 5 (A-C), data is provided that Trl transcripts are unaffected by loss of SOCE and that overexpression cannot rescue flightlessness. From this, the authors conclude that this gene &quot;must&quot; be calcium responsive. While that is one possibility, it is also possible that these genes are not functionally linked.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The idea that Trl is functionally linked to SOCE is based on the following evidence:</p>
<p>1. In Figure 4C we show that flight defects caused by partial loss of Trl (THD’&gt;TrlRNAi) were rescued by STIM overexpression (THD’&gt;TrlRNAi; STIMOE). As mentioned above we have found that STIM overexpression raises SOCE.</p>
<p>2. Heteroalleles of the trl13C hypomorph exhibit a strong genetic interaction with a single copy of the null allele of STIMKO as shown by the flight deficit of trl13c/+;  STIMKO/+ (trl13C/STIMKO ) flies (Figure 4D). The genotypes will be corrected in the revision.</p>
<p>3. Flight defects in trl13C/STIMKO flies could be rescued by STIM overexpression in the THD’ neurons (trl13C/STIMKO; THD’&gt;STIMOE)</p>
<p>4. In Figure 4E, we show that partial loss of Trl in THD’ neurons (THD’&gt;TrlRNAi) leads to decreased expression of the Ca2+ responsive genes mAChR, itpr, and Set2 genes indicating that Trl is a constituent of the SOCE-driven transcriptional feedback loop (Figure 5C).</p>
<p>Since we could not detect a well-defined Ca2+ binding domain in Trl, we hypothesize that it could be activated by a Ca2+ dependent post-translational modification. Phosphoproteome analysis of Trl demonstrated that it does indeed undergo phosphorylation at a Threonine residue (T237; Zhai et al., 2008), which lies within a potential site for CaMKII. Independently, CaMKII has been identified as a  binding partner of Trl from a Trl interactome study (Lomaev et al., 2018). Past work from our group (Ravi et al., 2018) identified a role for CaMKII in THD’ neurons in the context of flight. We are currently testing if CaMKII functions downstream of SOCE in THD’ neurons to mediate flight and will update this information in the next version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>1. There is no characterization of SOCE in fpDANs from flies expressing native Orai or the dominant negative OraiE180A mutant. While the authors refer to previous studies, as the manuscript is essentially based on Orai function thapsigargin-induced SOCE should be tested using the Ca2+ add-back protocol in order to assess the release of Ca2+ from the ER in response to thapsigargin as well as the subsequent SOCE.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The fpDANs consist of 16-19 neurons in each hemisphere (PPL1 are 10-12 and PPM3  are 6-7 cells; Pathak et al., 2015). Measuring SOCE from these neurons in vivo is not possible due to the presence of abundant extracellular Ca2+ in the brain. Given their sparse number, it proved technically challenging to isolate the fpDANs in culture to perform SOCE measurements using the Ca2+ add back protocol. Due to these reasons, we have relied upon using Carbachol to elicit IP3-mediated Ca2+ release and SOCE as a proxy for in vivo SOCE. In previous studies we have shown that Carbachol treatment of cultured Drosophila neurons elicits IP3-mediated Ca2+ release  and SOCE (Agrawal et al., 2010; Figure 8). Moreover, expression of OraiE180A completely blocks SOCE as measured in primary cultures of dopaminergic neurons (Pathak et al., 2015; Figure 1E). Hence we have not repeated  SOCE measurements from all dopaminergic neurons in this work. In the revised version we will explicitly state this weakness of our study and the reasons for it.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In the experiments performed to rescue flight duration in Set2RNAi individuals the authors overexpress STIM and attribute the effect to &quot;Excess STIM presumably drives higher SOCE sufficient to rescue flight bout durations caused by deficient Set2 levels.&quot;. This should be experimentally tested as the STIM:Orai stoichiometry has been demonstrated as essential for SOCE.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The assumption that STIM overexpression drives higher SOCE is based upon previously published work from Drosophila neurons (Agrawal et al., 2010; Chakraborty et al, 2016; Deb et al., 2016) which demonstrates that excess WT STIM overcomes IP3R deficiencies (RNAi or hypomorphic mutants) to rescue SOCE. We agree that STIM-Orai stoichiometry is essential for SOCE, and propose that the rescue backgrounds possess sufficient WT Orai, which is recruited by the excess STIM to mediate the rescue. We will reference the earlier work to validate our use of STIMOE for rescue of SOCE.</p>
<p>Here, we propose that Set2 is part of a positive feedback loop driving transcription of mAChR and IP3R (Figure 3F). In keeping with this hypothesis, we posit that the phenotypes observed in the Set2RNAi background (Figure 2D) result from decreased itpr and mAChR expression (validated in Figure 3E). This is further validated by the Set2 overexpression mediated rescue of OraiE180A (Figure 2D) and rescue of itpr/mAChR expression in the OraiE180A background (Figure 3B-E; THD’&gt;OraiE180A; Set2OE).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors show that overexpression of OraiE108A results in Stim downregulation at a mRNA level. What about the protein level? And more important, how does OraiE108A downregulate Stim expression? Does it promote Stim degradation? Does it inhibit Stim expression?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We hypothesize that changes in STIM mRNA observed in the THD’ &gt; OraiE180A neurons stems from an overall reduction in IP3-mediated Ca2+ release and SOCE due to loss of Trl-Set2 driven gene expression detailed in our transcriptional feedback loop model (Figure 5C). We will attempt to explain this aspect more clearly in the next version of the manuscript. While we agree that measuring levels of STIM protein would be helpful, estimation of protein levels from a limited number of neurons (~35 cells per brain) is technically challenging. The STIM antibody does not work well in immunohistochemistry. In the absence of any experimental evidence we cannot comment on how expression of OraiE180A might affect STIM protein turnover.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Lines 271-273, the authors state &quot;whereas overexpression of a transgene encoding Set2 in THD' neurons either with loss of SOCE (OraiE180A) or with knockdown of the IP3R (itprRNAi), lead to significant rescue of the Ca2+ response&quot;. This is attributed to a positive effect of Set2 expression on IP3R expression and the authors show a positive correlation between these two parameters; however, there is no demonstration that Set2 expression can rescue IP3R expression in cells where the IP3R is knocked down (itprRNAi). This should be further demonstrated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The rescue of IP3R expression by Set2 overexpression in itprRNAi was demonstrated in a different set of Drosophila neurons in an earlier study (Mitra et al., 2021) and has not been repeated specifically in THD’ neurons. Similar to the previous study, here we tested CCh stimulated Ca2+ responses of THD’ neurons with itprRNAi and itprRNAi; SetOE (Fig S3), which are indeed rescued by SET2OE.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The data presented in Figure 3E should be functionally demonstrated by analyzing the ability of CCh to release Ca2+ from the intracellular stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>CCh-mediated Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ has been described in primary cultures of Drosophila neurons in previously published work (Venkiteswaran and Hasan, 2009; Agrawal et al., 2010)  This work focuses on a set of 16-19  dopaminergic neurons in a hemisphere of the Drosophila central brain. It is technically challenging to generate a 0 Ca2+ environment in vivo, which is essential for measuring store Ca2+ release. Given their meagre numbers, primary cultures of these neurons is not readily feasible.</p>

<p>1. The conclusion that SOCE regulates the neuronal excitability threshold is based entirely on either partial behavioral rescue of flight, or measurements of KCl-induced Ca2+ rises monitored by GCaMP6m in DAN neurons. The threshold for neuronal excitability is a precise parameter based on rheobase measurements of action potentials in current-clamp. Measurements of slow calcium signals using a slow dye such as GCaMp6m should not be equated with neuronal excitability. What is measured is a loss of the calcium response in high K depolarization experiments, which occurs due to the loss of expression of Cav channels. Hence, the use of this term is not accurate and will confuse readers. The use of terms referring to neuronal excitability needs to be changed throughout the manuscript. As such, the conclusions regarding neuronal excitability should be strongly tempered and the data reinterpreted as there are no true measurements of neuronal excitability in the manuscript. All that can be said is that expression of certain ion channel genes is suppressed. Since both Na+ channels and K+ channel expression is down-regulated, it is hard to say precisely how membrane excitability is altered without action potential analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The claim that SOCE influences neuronal excitability is based on the following observations:</p>
<p>1. Interruption of the transcriptional feedback loop involving SOCE, Trl, and Set2 through loss of any of its constituents, results in the downregulation of VGCCs (Figure 5G, 6H), which are essential components of action potentials.</p>
<p>2. OraiE180A mediated loss of SOCE in THD’ neurons abrogates the KCl-evoked depolarization response (Figure 6B, C) measured using GCaMP6m. We verified that this response requires VGCC function using pharmacological inhibition of L-type VGCCs (Figure 6E, F).</p>
<p>3. SOCE deficient THD’ neurons, which were presumably compromised in their ability to evoke action potentials could be rescued to undergo KCl-evoked depolarisation by expression of NachBac, which lowers the depolarization threshold (Figure 7C, D) or through optogenetic stimulation using CsChrimson (Figure 7F).</p>
<p>We agree that ‘neuronal excitability threshold’ is a precise electrophysiological parameter that has not been  directly investigated here by measurement of action potentials. Therefore, references to neuronal excitability will be tempered throughout the revised manuscript and be replaced with a more generic reference to ‘neuronal activity’. In this context we propose to include further evidence supporting reduced excitability of THD’ neurons upon loss of SOCE in the revision.</p>
<p>Since one of the key functional outcomes of activity during critical developmental periods such as the 72-96 hrs APF developmental window identified in this study, is remodelling of neuronal morphology, we decided to investigate the same in our context. Neuronal activity can drive changes in neurite complexity and  axonal arborization (Depetris-Chauvin et al., 2011) especially during critical developmental periods (Sachse et al., 2007). To understand  if Orai mediated Ca2+ entry and downstream gene expression through Set2 affects this activity-driven parameter, we investigated the morphology of fpDANs, and specifically measured the complexity of presynaptic terminals within the 2’1 lobe MB using super-resolution microscopy. We found striking changes in the neurite volume upon expression of OraiE180A which could be rescued by restoring either Set2 (OraiE180A; Set2OE) or by inducing hyperactivity through NachBac expression (OraiE180A ; NachBacOE). These data will be included in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>1. Related, since trl does not contain any molecular domains that could be regulated by Ca2+ signaling, it is unclear whether trl is directly regulated by SOCE or the regulation is highly indirect. Reporter assays evaluating trl activation upon Ca2+ rises would provide much stronger and more direct evidence for the conclusion that trl is a SOCE-regulated TF. As such the evidence is entirely based on RNAi downregulation of trl which indicates that trl is essential but has no bearing on exactly what point of the signaling cascade it is involved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that luciferase Trl reporters would provide a direct method to test SOCE-mediated activation. Future investigations will be targeted in this direction. Regarding possible mechanisms of Trl activation - since we could not detect a well-defined Ca2+ binding domain in Trl, we hypothesize that it may be phosphorylation by a Ca2+ sensitive kinase. Phosphoproteome analysis of Trl indicates that it does indeed undergo phosphorylation at a Threonine reside (T237; Zhai et al., 2008), which may be mediated by the Ca2+ sensitive kinase-CaMKII based on binding partners identified in the Trl interactome (Lomaev et al., 2018). Past work (Ravi et al., 2018) has indeed demonstrated a requirement  for CaMKII in THD’ neurons for flight. We are currently testing whether CaMKII functions downstream of SOCE in these neurons to mediate flight, and will be updating this information in the next version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>1. Are NFAT levels altered in the Orai1 loss of function mutant? If not, this should be explicitly stated. It would seem based on previous literature that some gene regulation may be related to the downregulation of this established Ca2+-dependent transcription factor. Same for NFkb.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in the text in lines (307-309), Drosophila NFAT lacks a calcineurin binding site and is therefore not sensitive to Ca2+ (Keyser et al., 2007). In the past we tested if knockdown of NF-kB in dopaminergic neurons gave a flight phenotype and did not observe any measurable deficit. From the RNAseq data we find a slight downregulation of NFAT (0.49 fold, p value=0.048) and NF-kb (0.26 fold, p value =0.258) the significance of which is unclear at this point. We did not find any consensus binding sites for these two factors in the regulatory regions of downregulated genes from THD’ neurons.</p>

<p>1. Does over-expression of Set2 restore ion channel expression especially those of the VGCCs? This would provide rigorous, direct evidence that SOCE-mediated regulation of VGCCs through Set2 controls voltage-gated calcium channel signaling.</p>

<p>Set2 overexpression in the OraiE180A background indeed restores the expression of VGCC genes (Figure 6H).</p>

<p>1. All 6 representative panels from Figure 3B are duplicated in Figure 4G. Likewise, 2 representative panels from Figure 5H are duplicated in Figure 6D. Although these panels all represent the results from control experiments, the relevant experiments were likely not conducted at the same time and under the same conditions. Thus, control images from other experiments should not be used simply because they correspond to controls. This situation should be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We regret the confusion caused by the same representative images for the control experiments. These will be replaced by new representative images for Figure 5H in the next updated version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>1. The figures are unusually busy and difficult to follow. In part this is because they usually have many panels (Fig. 1: A-I; Fig. 2, A-J, etc) but also because the arrangement of the panels is not consistent: sometimes the following panel is found to the right, other times it is below. It would help the reader to make the order of the panels consistent, and, if possible, reduce the number of panels and/or move some of the panels to new figures (eLife does not limit the number of display items).</p>

<p>1. As a final recommendation, the reviewers suggest that the authors a- Reword the text that refers to membrane excitability since membrane excitability was not directly measured here. b-Explain why STIM1 rescues the partial loss of flight in Set2 RNAi flies (Fig. S2E); and c- Explain how/why trl is calcium regulated and test using luciferase (or other) reporter assays whether Orai activation leads to trl activation.</p>

<p>a. Textual references to membrane excitability will be appropriately modified.</p>
<p>b. We have provided a detailed explanation for how STIM overexpression might rescue the phenotypes caused by Set2RNAi in Point 1. In short, these phenotypes depend upon IP3R mediated Ca2+ entry driving a transcriptional feedback loop. We relied upon past reports that STIM overexpression upregulates IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release and SOCE in Drosophila itpr mutant neurons (Agrawal et al., 2010; Chakraborty et al, 2016; Deb et al, 2016). We therefore propose that STIM overexpression in the Set2RNAi background rescues IP3R mediated Ca2+ release followed by SOCE, which drives enhanced Set2 transcription, counteracting the effects of the RNAi. We will explain this more clearly with past references in the next revision.</p>
<p>c. We have provided a detailed response to this comment in Point 12. Briefly, we agree that building luciferase reporters for Trl could be an ideal strategy to test for its responsiveness to SOCE and needs to be done in future. As an alternate strategy, we have looked at data from existing studies of interacting partners of Trl (Lomaev et al., 2017) and identified CamKII, which is both Ca2+ responsive (Braun and Schulman, 1995; Yasuda et al., 2022), and thus might activate Trl through a phosphorylation-switch like mechanism. Moreover, a previous publication identified  a requirement for CamKII in THD’ neurons for Drosophila flight (Ravi et al., 2018). We are testing the ability of a dominant active version of CamKII to rescue THD’&gt;E180A flight deficits and will include this information in the next version of the manuscript.</p>
