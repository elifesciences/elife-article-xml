<title>Abstract</title><p>Ligands such as insulin, epidermal growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, and nerve growth factor (NGF) initiate signals at the cell membrane by binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Along with G-protein coupled receptors, RTKs are the main platforms for transducing extracellular signals into intracellular signals. Studying RTK signaling has been a challenge, however, due to the multiple signaling pathways to which RTKs typically are coupled, including MAP/ERK, PLCγ, and Class 1A phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). The multi-pronged RTK signaling has been a barrier to isolating the effects of any one downstream pathway. Here, we used optogenetic activation of PI3K to decouple its activation from other RTK signaling pathways. In this context, we used genetic code expansion to introduce a click chemistry noncanonical amino acid into the extracellular side of membrane proteins. Applying a cell-impermeant click chemistry fluorophore allowed us to visualize delivery of membrane proteins to the plasma membrane in real time. Using these approaches, we demonstrate that activation of PI3K, without activating other pathways downstream of RTK signaling, is sufficient to traffic the TRPV1 ion channels and insulin receptors to the plasma membrane.</p>

<title>Receptor tyrosine kinases activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase</title>
<p>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are the second largest class of cell surface receptors, with 58 members in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Robinson et al., 2000</xref>). Binding of agonists, typically polypeptides such as growth factors, to their extracellular amino-terminal domains results in autophosphorylation of their intracellular carboxy-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). The autophosphorylated receptors then signal to activate phospholipase Cγ, mitogen activated protein kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). The complex web of signals downstream of RTKs underlies their importance in a cell regulation and dysregulation but also makes studying the roles and dynamics of any particular branch of their signaling pathways challenging.</p>
<p>The Class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) coupled to RTKs are obligate heterodimers composed of regulatory p85 and catalytic p110 subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Geering et al., 2007</xref>). The p85 regulatory subunit contains two SH2 domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2) separated by an inter-SH2 domain (iSH2). The p110 catalytic subunit interacts with the entire N-SH2-iSH2-C-SH2 region of PI3K, with the N-SH2 acting as an autoinhibitory domain to inhibit catalysis. For the well studying RTK tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), binding of its agonist nerve growth factor (NGF) triggers autophosphorylation of a pair of tyrosines. Phospho-TrkA then binds to the PI3K N-SH2. This has the dual effect of recruiting PI3K to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Thorpe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Ziemba et al., 2016</xref>) and causing a conformational change in p85 to relieve auto-inhibition of p110 by the N-SH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Activation of the RTK insulin receptor (InsR) by its agonist, insulin, also involves autophosphorylation of tyrosines on its intracellular domain and subsequent activation of PI3K; however, in the case of InsR, various insulin receptor substrate adaptor proteins link InsR to PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Ye et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Saltiel, 2021</xref>). PI3K bound directly or indirectly to activated RTKs on the membrane then phosphorylates phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) to generate phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>). PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is a well-recognized signal for membrane fusion in organisms ranging from <italic>dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nichols et al., 2015</xref>) to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hawkins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hawkins and Stephens, 2015</xref>). Indeed, PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-triggered membrane fusion mediates tumor cell motility, with PI3K acting as an oncoprotein and its corresponding phosphatase, PTEN, as a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hawkins et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>The OptoPI3K system reversibly activates PI3K to generate PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at the PM. (A) Diagram of PI3K subunits and domains illustrating the regulatory p85 and catalytic p110 subunits. iSH2 domain in p85 subunit interacts with p110. Binding of NGF to TrkA receptor triggers the translocation of PI3K to the PM, phosphorylation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and fusion of TRPV1-containing vesicles with the PM. (B,C) Schematic diagram for OptoPI3K system using PIF-iSH2-YFP. PhyB-mCherry is tethered to the PM using CAAX lipidation (magenta star). The iSH2 domain of p85 is fused to PIF so that translocation of PIF-iSH2-YFP, together with endogenous p110, to the PM promotes PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> synthesis upon 650 nm light. (D) Monitoring PIF-iSH2-YFP translocation to and from the PM with 650 nm and 750 nm light, respectively (top, yellow). Synthesis of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> follows PIF-iSH2-YFP translocation to the PM, as indicated by the localization of the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> probe Akt-PH-CFP (bottom, sky blue). F-11 cells transiently expressing PhyB-mCherry-CAAX, PIF-iSH2-YFP, and Akt-PH-CFP were illuminated with 750 nm or 650 nm light as indicated with the upper bar. Collected traces of PIF-iSH2-YFP and Akt-PH-CFP normalized to the initial baselines during the first episode of 750 nm illumination. The black line indicates the mean of the data and the colored envelope represents the standard error of the mean (n = 8). Because of the very low density of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> present in the PM even in light- or NGF-stimulated cells (Auger et al., 1989), we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to measure PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> density instead of confocal microscopy. TIRF illumination decreases exponentially with distance from the coverslip, selectively illuminating and exciting fluorophores within ∼150 nm of the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mattheyses and Axelrod, 2006</xref>). (E) Scatter plot of PIF-iSH2-YFP and Akt-PH-CFP fluorescence for individual cells. Each point represents the 20 s average for 750 nm (2.66 - 3 min), 650 nm (5.66 - 6 min), and 750 nm (8.66 - 9 min). Translocation of both PIF-iSH2-YFP and Akt-PH-CFP is reversible.</p></caption>

<title>RTK/PI3K signaling increases sensitivity to painful stimuli via TRPV1 ion channels</title>
<p>Increased sensitivity to painful stimuli in injured and inflamed tissue is due to adaptations in the peripheral and central nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">McMahan et al., 2013</xref>). For peripheral sensitization, G-protein coupled receptors and RTKs signal through multiple pathways to produce cellular changes across multiple time scales. NGF is an inflammatory mediator released from leukocytes, including mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes, in response to tissue injury and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Freund-Michel and Frossard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Reis et al., 2022</xref>). Paradoxically, in addition to its role increasing sensitivity to painful stimuli, NGF also is critical for wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ebadi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lambiase et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bonini et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, strategies to block NGF-mediated pain sensitization have the unfortunate consequence of interfering with post-injury recovery.</p>
<p>One of the mechanisms by which NGF increases sensitivity to pain involves a PI3K-induced increase in the number of pain-transducing TRPV1 ion channels in the plasma membrane (PM) of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bonnington and McNaughton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhu and Oxford, 2007</xref>). We recently discovered reciprocal regulation between TRPV1 and PI3K. We found that the NGF-stimulated rise in the PI3K product PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is much greater in cells transiently transfected with TRPV1 than in control cells without TRPV1, i.e., TRPV1 enhances NGF-mediated PI3K activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Stratiievska et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, TRPV1 interacts directly with PI3K (p85α and p85β subunits; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) via its amino-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stein et al., 2006</xref>) and the ARD is sufficient to increase NGF-induced PI3K activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Stratiievska et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these findings, we propose that TRPV1 regulates NGF-induced PI3K activity via this direct interaction.</p>

<title>Insulin/PI3K signaling</title>
<p>Activation of InsR by insulin signals via PI3K to activate a powerful protein kinase, Akt, which in turn regulates multiple cellular processes involved in metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Saltiel, 2021</xref>). The PI3K/Akt pathway is thus of great interest in understanding obesity and type 2 diabetes. Insulin-dependent recycling of InsR has also been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Knutson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Ligand-simulated InsR endocytosis is followed by either targeting to lysosomes for degradation or recycling endosomes for reinsertion into the PM. This return to the PM is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve small Rab family GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iraburu et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K has been shown to inhibit InsR trafficking to the PM, indicating that PI3K activity is necessary for InsR homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sasaoka et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Approaches to studying membrane protein trafficking</title>
<p>The properties of conventional fluorescent labels have posed a significant barrier to understanding trafficking of membrane proteins, including TRPV1. Previous studies have used large tags to label the channel protein, typically a fluorescent protein (e.g., GFP) fused to the intracellular N- or C-terminus. Fusion to fluorescent proteins carries a number of disadvantages. Fluorescent proteins are relatively dim and are susceptible to bleaching. We and others have previously shown that the intracellular termini participate in critical protein-protein interactions, some of which are involved in channel trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Morenilla-Palao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jeske et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Camprubi-Robles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jeske et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Xing et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gregorio-Teruel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mathivanan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Meng et al., 2016</xref>). The presence of large fluorescent proteins could perturb these interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tsien, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Montecinos-Franjola et al., 2020</xref>). TRPV1 is expressed heavily in intracellular membranes, making it nearly impossible to optically isolate just those channels on the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gallego-Sandín et al., 2009</xref>). Fluorescent anti-TRPV1 antibodies have been used to label extracellular epitopes to distinguish these populations (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Nakazawa et al., 2021</xref>)), but antibodies have the same problem of large size, and we have found that antibodies that recognize extracellular regions of TRPV1 are not very specific.</p>
<p>Click chemistry offers a rapid, specific, and flexible method for labeling of proteins in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lang and Chin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nikić et al., 2015</xref>; Kenry and Liu, 2019). We have previously incorporated click chemistry-compatible noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into amino acid positions in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells and shown we can achieve highly efficient and rapid labeling when introducing the appropriate click chemistry probe into the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jana et al., 2023</xref>). This approach requires co-expression of the target gene with an amber stop codon (TAG) with a plasmid encoding an evolved aminoacyl tRNA synthetase that is orthogonal to mammalian cells, together with its cognate tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Uttamapinant et al., 2015</xref>). An additional plasmid encoding a dominant negative form of eukaryotic dominant negative elongation release factor can be expressed to increase efficiency of ncAA incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schmied et al., 2014</xref>). Incorporating a click chemistry ncAA into an extracellular position in a membrane protein and then applying a membrane-impermeant click chemistry-conjugated fluorophore would allow specific labeling of protein at the surface, even for those proteins that localize to both the surface and intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gregory et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mateos-Gil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Neubert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Ojima et al., 2021</xref>). The recent development of click chemistry ncAAs and fluorescent probes that react very rapidly (&gt;10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) make this an attractive approach for tracking membrane protein trafficking in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Peng and Hang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Row and Prescher, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Meineke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jana et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In this work, we leverage optogenetics to activate PI3K with light, genetic code expansion to incorporate a click chemistry ncAA, and a new, membrane-impermeant click chemistry-conjugated fluorophore to interrogate the mechanism by which NGF induces trafficking of TRPV1 to the PM. By isolating the PI3K pathway downstream of NGF from the other pathways coupled to TrkA (PLCγ and MAP/ERK), we demonstrate that PI3K activity is sufficient to increase TRPV1 trafficking to the PM. We apply the same approach to InsR, to demonstrate that our new approach is of general use for different types of membrane proteins, and show that activation of PI3K is sufficient to increase InsR trafficking to the PM. Given the importance of InsR recycling in the development of insulin resistance, understanding the role of PI3K in regulating InsR expression on the PM is critical.</p>

<p>Here, we used the previously published phytochrome B (PhyB)/phytochrome interacting factor (PIF) system to activate and deactivate PI3K with light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Levskaya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Toettcher et al., 2011</xref>). Uncoupling PI3K from activation of TrkA allowed us to study the effects of PI3K on membrane protein trafficking without activating other signaling pathways downstream of TrkA. To apply the PhyB/PIF system to control PI3K activity, we fused the inter-SH2 domain (iSH2) of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to PIF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). It has previously been shown that the iSH2 domain associates with the endogenous p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Klippel et al., 1993</xref>). Because this heterodimer is missing the autoinhibitory domains of p85, it is constitutively active, so that PI3K phosphorylates its substrate, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to make PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> whenever the PIF-iSH2-YFP is driven to the membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Suh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2012</xref>). The iSH2 domain has been previously expressed as a fusion protein with PIF and has been shown to reversibly translocate to the PM and activate PI3K in response to light (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Levskaya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Toettcher et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Using a CFP-labelled pleckstrin homology domain from the enzyme Akt (Akt-PH-CFP), which specifically binds the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> product of PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lemmon, 2008</xref>), as a probe for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, we confirmed that the PhyB/PIF-iSH2 machinery could be used to rapidly generate PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in response to 650 nm light (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>). In response to 750 nm light, PIF-iSH2-YFP was released from the membrane and the levels of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> returned to baseline, presumably due to the activity of the endogenous PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> phosphatase PTEN. Similar experiment using GRP1-PH-CFP, another PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> probe yielded the same results (Figure 1-figure supplement 2).</p>

<title>Activation of PI3K, without other pathways downstream of NGF/TrkA, is sufficient to drive trafficking of TRPV1 to the PM</title>
<p>We and others have previously demonstrated that activation of the RTK TrkA by nerve growth factor leads to increased trafficking of the ion channel TRPV1 to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhu and Oxford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Stratiievska et al., 2018</xref>) This increase in surface expression is associated with increased sensitivity to painful stimuli sensed by TRPV1. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>, the NGF-induced trafficking of TRPV1 follows the increase in PM PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels.

<p>We used PhyB with PIF-iSH2 to test the hypothesis that PI3K activity is <italic>sufficient</italic> to drive trafficking of TRPV1 to the PM. Together with PhyB, PIF-iSH2 (without a fluorescent tag) and Akt-PH-CFP, we expressed TRPV1 fused to YFP. Stimulation of cells with 650 nm light gave the expected rise in PM-associated Akt-PH-CFP fluorescence and, importantly, a rise in PM-associated TRPV1-YFP fluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>). The light-induced rise in PM PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and TRPV1 qualitatively resembled those induced by NGF. Because PLCγ and the MAP/ERK were not directly activated by the 650 nm light, we conclude that activation of the PI3K pathway is sufficient to cause TRPV1 trafficking to the PM.</p>

<title>TRPV1 prevents dissociation of PIF-iSH2-YFP from the membrane in response to 750 nm light</title>
<p>In monitoring localization of PIF-iSH2-YFP in light-activated PI3K experiments in TRPV1-expressing cells, we found that PIF-iSH2-YFP no longer translocated to the cytoplasm in response to 750 nm light (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Indeed, the small amount of mCherry excitation light used to identify PhyB-mCherry positive cells seemed to be sufficient to cause a slow accumulation of PIF-iSH2-YFP at the PM even during continuous exposure of the cell to 750 nm light (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Not surprisingly, with PIF-iSH2-YFP accumulating at the PM during imaging of TRPV1-expressing cells, the 650 nm light-induced increase in plasma-membrane associated Akt-PH-CFP did not reverse upon exposure to 750 nm light (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). TRPV1 expression had no effect on a version of PIF-YFP that lacked the iSH2 domain (<xref rid="figs2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that irreversible localization to the PM required both the iSH2 fragment of PI3K and TRPV1. Expression of the related TRPM4 ion channels, which do not include an ankyrin repeat domain, also had no effect on 750 nm light-induced dissociation of PIF-iSH2-YFP from the PM (<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that this effect is specific to TRPV1. We have previously shown that the ankyrin repeat domain of TRPV1 interacts directly with the p85 subunit of PI3K from which iSH2 is derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stein et al., 2006</xref>). We speculate that the PIF-iSH2-YFP in TRPV1-expressing cells might not dissociate from the PM when stimulated with 750 nm light because it encounters TRPV1 at the PM and binds to it, remaining bound to TRPV1 even after releasing PhyB.</p>

<title>Resolving changes in surface expression requires improved approaches</title>
<p>TIRF microscopy was needed to resolve the NGF- and light-induced increase in PM PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels but is a poor approach for distinguishing membrane protein localization in the PM from that in intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Stratiievska et al., 2018</xref>). For membrane proteins with very high endoplasmic reticulum localization, like TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tominaga et al., 1998</xref>), this makes any changes in fluorescence intensity measured with TIRF an underestimate of true changes in surface localization.</p>
<p>To circumvent contamination of TIRF signals on the PM with fluorescence from intracellular compartments, we implemented an inverse-electron-demand Diels–Alder cycloaddition click chemistry approach to selectively label PM localized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arsić et al., 2022</xref>). For this application, we used genetic code expansion to incorporate a noncanonical amino acid at an extracellular site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Neubert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bessa-Neto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kuhlemann et al., 2021</xref>). We used Tet3-Bu (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), a tetrazine-containing amino acid which can be efficiently labelled with a cyclopropane-fused strained trans-cyclooctene (sTCO) with no detectable off-target reactivity within the time scale of our experiments (see below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jana et al., 2023</xref>). Our goal was to express membrane proteins incorporating Tet3-Bu at an extracellular site measure labeling with a membrane-impermeant sTCO-coupled dye (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) under control conditions and then again after activation of PI3K with either NGF or 650 nm light.</p>

GFP fluorescence reflects expression of the proteins in the confocal volume across the field of view. Initially the cells did not show any detectable Cy5 fluorescence but after incubation of several minutes of 200 nM sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 showed Cy5 fluorescence at the PM.

Solid traces represent the mean and envelopes the standard error of the mean (n = 3 for TRPV1 and n = 11 for InsR). Dashed traces represent a fit to the mean with a single exponential (tau = 17.8 s for TRPV1; tau = 13.8 s for InsR).

<p>We tested our click chemistry/noncanonical amino acid approach using TRPV1 and the insulin receptor (InsR), a model RTK we and others have previously used in studies with different noncanonical amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nikić et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jones et al., 2021</xref>). For both proteins, we used amber codon suppression to site-specifically incorporate Tet3-Bu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jang et al., 2020</xref>) into an extracellular loop (T468Tet3-Bu for TRPV1 and Tet3-BuK676 for InsR). This involved introducing a TAG stop codon at the selected site within the coding sequence that would place the noncanonical amino acid on the extracellular side of the PM. We then co-expressed one plasmid encoding either TRPV1-T468TAG or InsR-K676TAG fused to GFP, a second plasmid encoding an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase evolved to incorporate the noncanonical amino acid and the orthogonal tRNA, and a third plasmid encoding a dominant negative elongation release factor, which increased the efficiency of Tet3-Bu incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schmied et al., 2014</xref>). The cell culture medium was then supplemented with Tet3-Bu. As indicated by the GFP signal and in-gel fluorescence, measured in transfected cells, both TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu-GFP and InsR-K676Tet3-Bu-GFP expressed at high levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,E</xref> and <xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1C</xref>). To test whether incorporation of Tet3-Bu interfered with the function of TRPV1, we measured capsaicin-activated currents with whole-cell voltage clamp and found that TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu-GFP gave robust capsaicin-activated currents (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). To determine whether InsR-K676TAG protein retained its function, we measured insulin-induced endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carpentier et al., 1992</xref>) and found endocytosis in response to insulin was maintained (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 2</xref>) with approximately the expected kinetics (Figure 3 – supplemental movie).</p>

<title>Developing a membrane-impermeant sTCO dye</title>
<p>Strained trans-cyclooctenes bearing functional groups such as spin labels and fluorophores have been used previously for in-cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Murrey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ryan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jana et al., 2023</xref>). To determine whether existing sTCO-conjugated dyes would give the required PM-selective labeling, we tested whether sTCO-TAMRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jang et al., 2020</xref>), or sTCO-JF646 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jana et al., 2023</xref>) were membrane impermeant. We also synthesized and tested sTCO-fluorescein. Unfortunately, these compounds readily equilibrated across the cell PM at the concentrations required for labeling, giving indistinguishable cytosolic fluorescence in untransfected and transfected cells (<xref rid="figs3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 3A-C</xref>). We therefore synthesized a new sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 conjugate, which contains two negative charges at physiological pH to minimize passive diffusion through membrane and therefore selectively label membrane proteins at the cell surface (<xref rid="figs3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hoffmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nikić et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kozma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Keller et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 would selectively label a membrane protein with an extracellular Tet3-Bu, we measured Cy5 fluorescence in the presence of 200 nM sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 in the bath, a low concentration that gives very low background fluorescence. The click chemistry reaction between Tet3-Bu incorporated at the extracellular sites and sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 effectively concentrated the dye at the PM, allowing significant membrane labeling to be observed for both membrane proteins examined (TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu-GFP – <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and InsR-K676Tet3-Bu-GFP – <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Importantly, sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 did not appear to equilibrate across the cell membrane and did not label untransfected cells (i.e., those without GFP). <italic>In vitro</italic>, the click chemistry reaction between free Tet3-Bu ncAA and sTCO occurs with a rate of 2×10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>; this reaction rate increased by 4 fold when Tet3-Bu was incorporated on the surface of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jang et al., 2020</xref>). The low background fluorescence recorded with 200 nM dye in the bath allowed us to measure the rate of labeling for TRPV1-468Tet3-Bu-GFP and InsR-646Tet3-Bu-GFP with sTCO-sulfo-Cy5. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, the reaction rate we measured was approximately 1×10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> for both proteins, somewhat slower than expected for a protein in solution and on par with the reaction between the free amino acid and sTCO in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Meijer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Click chemistry labeling can be used to measure NGF-induced trafficking of TRPV1 to the PM</title>
<p>Based on the extensive contamination of TIRF signals with fluorescence from the ER and other intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Stratiievska et al., 2018</xref>), we hypothesized that our previous measurements of NGF-induced trafficking of TRPV1 to the PM using TIRF represent underestimates of the true changes in PM TRPV1. If this were the case, using click chemistry to resolve NGF-induced changes in PM TRPV1 should reveal a greater increase in PM TRPV1. At the beginning of the experiment, we labeled surface TRPV1-468Tet3-Bu-GFP with a pulse of 1 µM sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 and then washed the label from the bath (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We used this higher concentration of sTCO-dye (5 times higher than in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) to label the PM channels more rapidly, as the NGF-induced trafficking of TRPV1 to the PM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; yellow) occurs with kinetics comparable to labeling with 200 nM sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>; see also <xref rid="figs3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 3D</xref>). We then treated the cells with NGF for ten minutes and again pulse labelled the surface channels with a brief exposure to 1 µM sTCO-sulfo-Cy5. We observed a ∼1.4 fold increase in PM Cy5 staining, indicating that NGF induced trafficking of TRPV1 to the surface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref>). In contrast, the total number of TRPV1 channels did not change, as evidenced by the total intensity of GFP fluorescence, which was not affected by NGF. This NGF-induced increase in surface expression is indeed greater than the ∼1.1-fold increase in NGF-induced surface expression of TRPV1 observed in TIRF experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Click chemistry labeling can be used to measure light-induced trafficking to the PM</title>
<p>We next asked whether click chemistry labeling could improve the resolution of PM trafficking in a system in which we have decoupled PI3K activity from other pathways downstream of NGF, i.e., the PhyB/PIF system. Results from these experiments with TRPV1-468Tet3-Bu-GFP and InsR-676Tet3-Bu-GFP and shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. After first labeling cells with sTCO-sulfo-Cy5, we exposed cells to an initial 10-minute exposure to 750 nm light and labeled any newly delivered protein at the PM using a second treatment with sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The GFP fluorescence remained the same under all conditions indicating that total protein expression did not change over the course of the experiments. For TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu-GFP, the sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 labeling increased slightly in response to the initial exposure to 750 nm light (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-E</xref>). This small increase in sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 labeling was specific to TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu, as 750 nm light produced no change in sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 labeling of InsR-K676Tet3-Bu-GFP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-I</xref>). The TRPV1-specific increase in labeling after 750 nm illumination is likely due to the small, irreversible PM localization of PIF-iSH2-YFP that occurs in TRPV1-expressing cells (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1</xref>). This small increase in sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 labeling of TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu was also seen in control experiments using two sequential exposures to 750 nm light (<xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1</xref>).

<p>After the initial control period with 750 nm light, we exposed the cells to 650 nm light for 10 minutes to activate PI3K and then labeled newly delivered protein at the PM with sTCO-sulfo-Cy5. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-E</xref> for TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-I</xref> for InsR-K676Tet3-Bu-GFP, activation of PI3K with 650 nm light increased expression of protein on the PM. For TRPV1, the amplitude of the increase in surface expression, ∼1.4-fold, was similar to that observed in click chemistry experiments in response to NGF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Surprisingly, the increase in surface expression of InsR-K676-Tet3-Bu was also about 1.4-fold. Like the NGF receptor TrkA, InsR is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose activation stimulates PI3K activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Saltiel, 2021</xref>). Binding of insulin to InsR is a well-studied signal for InsR endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carpentier et al., 1992</xref>), and PI3K activation downstream of InsR is key to delivery of GLUT4 transporters to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Saltiel, 2021</xref>). However, to our knowledge, PI3K activity has not been previously known to stimulate InsR delivery to the PM. Although it would be exceedingly interesting if insulin binding to InsR could trigger both InsR endocytosis <italic>and</italic> exocytosis, further studies will be required to determine the physiological significance, if any, of PI3K-stimluated delivery of InsR to the PM.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we present proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating the simultaneous use of an optogenetic approach for PI3K activation and genetic code expansion/click chemistry to interrogate regulation of membrane protein trafficking. This combination of approaches is especially useful for membrane proteins with significant expression in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or other intracellular compartments, which makes it very difficult to identify proteins in the PM definitively when using fusions with GFP or similar genetically encoded labels. In addition to distinguishing proteins at the surface, using a small ncAA and click chemistry is likely much less perturbing to protein structure and function than fusion with a ∼20-30 kDa protein such as GFP, SNAP-tag or HaloTag. Restricting the ncAA and fluorescent label to an extracellular region/loop is also less likely to interfere with protein-protein interactions on the intracellular side, compared with a large protein fusion to an intracellular N- or C-terminal of a protein of interest.</p>
<p>Successful implementation of this approach required overcoming a number of barriers: efficient incorporation of Tet3-Bu into the extracellular sites; demonstration that the Tet3-Bu-incorporating protein had the expected functional properties; development of a membrane impermeant sTCO-coupled dye; and optimization of the PhyB/PIF and genetic code expansion machinery in the same cells. Incorporation of Tet3-Bu at the extracellular side of TRPV1 was well tolerated in the S1-S2 loop, with two of four sites yielding functional, capsaicin-activated channels. We have found incorporation efficiency to be difficult to predict. Screening through desirable sites typically is the best approach, with approximately one half to one third of selected sites showing reasonable levels of ncAA incorporation.</p>
<p>There is significant room for improvement of these methods, particularly in developing more rapid labeling of the ncAA. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, complete labeling with a low concentration of sTCO-dye required more than 10 minutes. Monitoring membrane protein trafficking to the surface in real time will require a reaction that is at least five- to 10-fold faster. Increasing the speed of labeling can be accomplished using ≥1 µM sTCO-dye, but at such high concentrations of dye the background signal from dye in solution interferes with imaging. We have recently developed new ncAAs with the tetrazine ring more proximal to the amino acid beta carbon, which we term Tet4, that react with sTCO-based labels with rates as fast as 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jana et al., 2023</xref>). The aminoacyl tRNA synthetases that incorporate Tet4 amino acids into mammalian cells are not as efficient as those for Tet3 amino acids. Improving the efficiency of incorporating Tet4 amino acids would allow us to express Tet4-incorporating proteins and measure delivery of proteins to the PM in real time.</p>
<p>Another limitation to our approach is the need to co-express five to six plasmids to use PhyB/PIF and Tet/sTCO machinery simultaneously. Developing stable cell lines for ncAA incorporation would reduce the need for multiple plasmid transfection and, perhaps, lead to more uniform expression across cell populations. The PhyB/PIF machinery requires supplementing cell medium with the phycocyanobilin chromophore, making it incompatible with <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Introducing four genes, PcyA, H01, Fd, and Fnr, and knocking down/out biliverdin reductase A leads to efficient synthesis of phycocyanobilin in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Uda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Uda et al., 2020</xref>). It is therefore possible that genetically modified animals might one day express the PhyB/PIF machinery and chromophore and allow optogenetic activation of PI3K <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, there is as yet no method for synthesizing the necessary ncAAs within cells, precluding <italic>in vivo</italic> use of the PhyB/PIF with tetrazine-based genetic code expansion.</p>
<p>PI3K is a universal signal for trafficking to the PM. In <italic>dictyostelium</italic>, PI3K activation at the leading edge of cells underlies chemotaxis towards nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nichols et al., 2015</xref>). In macrophages, PI3K at the leading edge of cells drives motility towards the object of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hawkins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hawkins and Stephens, 2015</xref>). In the cases discussed here, membrane proteins constitute the cargo delivered to the PM in response to PI3K signaling. A vast literature has examined the mechanisms by which InsR is recycled from the PM in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Knutson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Ye et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), but less is known about ways in which delivery of InsR to the PM is regulated. We show here, for the first time, that activation of PI3K is sufficient to increase InsR in the PM. Future studies will be needed to understand the role for this process in liver and muscle cells. For TRPV1, PI3K was identified as an important signal that enhances surface expression in response to nerve growth factor, but the steps between PI3K activation and fusion of vesicles containing TRPV1 cargo with the PM are a mystery. The tools developed here provide a means by which the cellular mechanisms underlying PI3K-mediated delivery of membrane proteins can be interrogated.</p>

Gibson cloning was used to generate the C-terminal GFP fusion for TRPV1 and to introduce 468TAG stop codon. All constructs were verified using Sangar sequencing.</p>
<p>In selecting the extracellular site for ncAA incorporation into TRPV1, we focused on the S1-S2 loop (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) because the S3-S4 loop is very short (5 amino acids) and we wished to avoid the pore turret between S5 and S6, which has been implicated in gating of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bae et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). In our initial screen, we tested incorporation at four positions, R455, V457, K464 and T468 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and used a C-terminal GFP fusion to facilitate screening. We found that TRPV1-K464Tet3-Bu-GFP and TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu-GFP produced robust, capsaicin-activated currents when interrogated with whole-cell patch-clamp (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3– figure supplement 1A-B</xref>), whereas TRPV1-R455Tet3-Bu-GFP and TRPV1-V457Tet3-Bu-GFP of incorporation did not (data not shown). We focused on TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu-GFP, as TRPV1-K464Tat3-Bu-GFP was not efficiently labelled in subsequent experiments (data not shown). We next tested whether expression of full-length TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu-GFP required incorporation of Tet3-Bu using in-gel GFP fluorescence. As shown in <xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3– figure supplement 1C</xref>, detergent solubilized cell lysates from cells expressing TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu-GFP showed a band at the expected molecular weight when the medium was supplemented with Tet3-Bu, but no GFP fluorescence at this molecular weight was observed when the medium lacked Tet3-Bu. These data indicate that TRPV1-T468Tet3-Bu-GFP incorporated Tet3-Bu without measurable incorporation of natural amino acids at the TAG codon site.</p>

These cells were a gift from Orion Weiner (UCSF, San Francisco, CA). NIH-3T3 cells were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), L-Glutamine (Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza, Switzerland).</p>

F-11 cells were incubated in Ham’s F-12 Nutrient Mixture Gibco) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and HAT supplement (100 μM sodium hypoxanthine, 400 nM aminopterin, 16 μM thymidine; Invitrogen). Click chemistry experiments in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> through 6 were performed in HEK293T/17 cells (Catalog #CRL-11268, ATCC, Gaithersburg, MD) because these cells are optimized for transfection with multiple plasmids. HEK293T/17 cells were incubated according to manufacturer’s instructions in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin.</p>
<p>Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or JetPrime (Polyplus, Illkirch, France) according to the instructions of the manufacturers. Cells were passaged on to 25-mm round glass coverslips (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) 12 hours after transfection and cultured until used for experimentation 16–48 hours later. The coverslips were coated with poly-L-lysine to aid cell attachment (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For the optogenetic system, HEK293T/17 cells were transfected with PhyB-mCherry-CAAX (5 µg/well in 6-well culture plate), PIF-ISH2-YFP (or PIF-YFP) 0.5 µg. The 10:1 ratio helped to express more PhyB membrane target and lesser amount of PIF cargo. When cytoplasmic PIF-ISH2-YFP was highly expressed, its translocation toward the PM upon activating 650 nm light appeared significantly reduced, likely due to the difficulty of separating signal in the cytoplasm from that at the PM. For expression of TAG-encoding cDNAs, HEK293T/17 cells in 6-well plates at 30-50% confluency were transfected target gene cDNAs at 2:1 ratio (proteins with TAG codon: RS 2-84), with a total of 2 µg/well. Dominant negative elongation release factor (DN-eRF-E55D; 0.4 µg) was added to reduce truncation of the protein at the TAG codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schmied et al., 2014</xref>). For NGF stimulation, F-11 cells were transfected with 1 µg each of TrkA and p75NTR along with 1 µg TRPV1 constructs. For other constructs, 1-3 µg cDNA was used for transfection. During experiments, cells were perfused with Ringer’s solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES and 5 glucose, pH 7.3). All experiments were performed at room temperature except Figure 3-figure supplement 2.</p>

<p>Cells were incubated in the dark with 10 μM PCB in the culture medium for at least 1 hour prior to experiments. To avoid photodamage of Opto3K, handling of cells during and subsequent to PCB loading was performed in the dark room using a green safety flashlight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Levskaya et al., 2009</xref>).

<title>TIRF and confocal imaging</title>
<p>The total internal fluorescence (TIRF) imaging set up was as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Stratiievska et al., 2018</xref>). We used an inverted microscope (Nikon Ti-E) equipped with a 60x TIRF objective (NA 1.49). For activating/deactivating opto-PI3K with light, we used HQ630/20 X (42490) and HQ760/40 X (226723) excitation filters inserted in the overhead condenser filter slider. The whole experimental chamber was illuminated with activating or deactivating light using the maximum intensity (100 W at full spectrum) of the condenser lamp. Light intensity at the focal plane was 2.4 mW and 3.7 mW for 650 nm and 750 nm illumination, respectively.</p>
<p>Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) fusion proteins were imaged using excitation from a 440 nm laser and a 480/40 nm emission filter. Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) fusion proteins were monitored using the 514 nm line of an argon laser and a 525/50 nm emission filter. mCherry was excited at 561 nm and fluorescence was collected with 605/70 nm emission filter.</p>
<p>Time-lapse images were obtained every 10 or 20 seconds using either a QuantEM or an Evolve EMCCD camera (Photometrics). Movies were then processed using ImageJ software (NIH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rasband, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn around the footprint of individual cells and the average ROI pixel intensity was measured. Background fluorescence from cell-free areas were subtracted. Measurements were analyzed using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR) software, Traces were normalized by the average intensity during 1 or 3 min time period prior to activating 650 nm light.</p>
<p>The confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Illumination of 650-750 nm lights were controlled as described for TIRF microscopy experiments. CFP, YFP, mCherry, and JF646 were excited with 440, 514, 561, 633 nm lasers, respectively. Data were analyzed with ImageJ. The lookup table of images were changed during analysis, but the same range was applied for all images within a time series experiment.</p>

<p>The PhyB –PIF light-inducible interaction is rapid (a few tens of seconds) and fully reversible (within ∼30 seconds) and can be repeated multiple times. (A) Schematic diagram for optogenetic PhyB-PIF system. PhyB-mCherry loaded with the chromophore phycocyanobilin localizes to the PM due to a CAAX tag to induce lipidation (squiggly line). Illumination with 650 nm light induces a conformational change in PhyB that increases its affinity for PIF-YFP, effectively recruiting PIF-YFP to the PM. The conformational change in PhyB reverses with illumination with 750 nm light, causing PIF-YFP to dissociate and return to the cytoplasm. (B) A representative confocal experiment with an NIH3T3 cell stably expressing PhyB-mCherry-CAAX and PIF-YFP. Images were obtained at times indicated in C and are all shown on the same lookup table. During illumination with 650 nm light, PIF-YFP translocated to the PM quickly, with a corresponding decrease in cytoplasmic fluorescence.

<p>TRPV1 does not retain PIF lacking iSH2 at the PM of F-11 cells. (A) Normalized TIRF fluorescence was recorded in F-11 cells transfected with PhyB-mCherry-CAAX, PIF-YFP (no iSH2 domain), and either TRPV1-CFP or TRPV1 (no fluorescent tag). Reversible translocation of PIF-YFP upon 650 nm illumination demonstrates that PIF lacking iSH2 domain does not interact with TRPV1 channels on the PM (n = 8).

<caption><title>Incorporation of Tet3-Bu into TRPV1 and InsR.</title>
<p>(A) Whole-cell patch clamp recording demonstrates that TRPV1 incorporating Tet3-Bu remains functional. Application of 1 μM capsaicin to HEK-293T/17 cells transfected with either TRPV1-GFP (top) or TRPV1-468Tet3-Bu (bottom) induced inward currents at a holding potential of -60 mV. (B) Collected whole-cell electrophysiology data from all cells with peak capsaicin-activated currents normalized to the area of cell membrane (n = 8 and 9 for TRPV1-GFP and TRPV1-468Tet3-Bu, respectively). (C) In-gel fluorescence screening demonstrates that expression of full-length TRPV1-468Tet3-Bu or InsR-676Tet3-Bu requires the presence of Tet3-Bu (‘Tet3 (+)’). Wild type TRPV1-GFP is shown for reference. Detergent-extracted cell lysates were run on SDS/PAGE.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work seeks to isolate the specific effects of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) on the trafficking of the ion channel TRPV1, distinct from other receptor tyrosine kinase-activated effectors. It builds on earlier studies by the same group (Stein et al. 2006; Stratiievska et al. 2018), which described the regulatory relationship between PI3K, nerve growth factor (NGF), and TRPV1 trafficking. A central theme of this study is the development of methods that precisely measure the influence of PI3K on TRPV1 trafficking and vice versa. The authors employ a range of innovative methodologies to explore the dynamics between TRPV1 and PI3K trafficking.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength of this study is the application of innovative methods to understand the interaction between PI3K and TRPV1 trafficking. The key techniques presented include:</p>
<p>(1) The optogenetic trafficking system based on phytochrome B, introduced in this research. Its interaction mechanism, dependent on reversible light activation, is comprehensively explained in Figures 1 and 2, with the system's efficacy demonstrated in Figure 3.</p>
<p>(2) An extracellular labeling method using click chemistry, which although not exclusive to this study, introduces specific reagents engineered for membrane impermeability.</p>
<p>The central biological insight presented here is the sufficiency of PI3K activation to guide TRPV1 trafficking to the plasma membrane. An additional notable discovery is the potential regulation of insulin receptors via this mechanism.</p>
<p>The paper's strengths are anchored in its innovative methodologies and the valuable collaboration between groups specializing in distinct areas of research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper might benefit from a more streamlined structure and a clearer emphasis on its findings. A possible way to enhance its impact might be to focus more on its methodological aspects. The methodological facets stand out as both innovative and impactful. These experiments are well-executed and align with biological expectations. It's evident how these techniques could be tailored for many protein trafficking studies, a sentiment echoed in the manuscript (lines 287-288). When seen through a purely biological lens, some findings, like those concerning the PI3K-TRPV1 interaction, are very similar to previous work (Stratiievska et al. 2018). A biological focus demands further characterization of this interaction through mutagenesis. Also, the incorporation of insights on the insulin receptor feels somewhat tangential. A cohesive approach could be to reshape the manuscript with a primary focus on methodology, using TRPV1 and InsR as illustrative examples.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The authors developed new tools for isolating PI3K activity and for labeling newly made membrane proteins for monitoring membrane trafficking. They found that PI3K activity alone was able to explain the increased presence of TRPV1 on the membrane independent of other cascades induced by NGF signaling. They also showed an interesting feedback between PI3K and the insulin receptor trafficking to the membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength of the paper is the innovative combination of techniques. The first technique used the optogenetic PhyB/PIF system. They anchored PhyB to the membrane and fused PIF with the interSH2 domain from PI3K. This allowed them to use 650nm light to induce an interaction between the PhyB and PIF resulting in a recruitment of the endogenous PI3K to the membrane through the iSH2 domain without actual activation of an RTK. This allowed them to dissect out one function, just PI3K recruitment/activation from the vast number of RTK downstream cascades.</p>
<p>The second technique was the development of a new non-canonical amino acid that is cell-impermeant. The authors synthesized the sTSO-sulfa-Cy5 compound that will react with the Tet3 ncAA through click chemistry. They showed that the sulfa-Cy5 did not cross the membrane and would be used to track protein production over time, though the reaction rates were slow as noted by the authors. The comparison of the sulfa-Cy5 data with the standard GFP with TIRF showed a clear difference indicating the useful information that is gained with the ncAA.</p>
<p>Another strength comes from the discovery that an isolated PI3K is responsible for increasing TRPV1 and InR trafficking to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>The discussion does not go into much detail regarding the importance of their discovery of TRPV1 and InR increases trafficking due to PI3K activation. It also jumps to the limitations of in vivo implementation prematurely. These weaknesses are minor however.</p>
<p>The authors achieved their goal of creating the tools needed to separate out one of the many RTK signals and give a strong proof of concept implementation of their tools. Their results support their conclusions and will help understand how TRPV1 is regulated by signals other than the traditional channel activators. The tools developed in the article will be of use to the broader cell biology and biophysics community, not just the channel community. The opto control of the PhyB/PIF system makes it more convenient than other systems since it does not take the typical wavelengths needed for fluorescence. The cell-impermeant ncAA will also be a great tool for those studying membrane proteins, protein trafficking and protein dynamics.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Koh, Stratiievska, and their colleagues investigate the mechanism by which TRPV1 channels are delivered to the plasma membrane following the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, specifically focusing on the NGF receptor. They demonstrate that the activation of the NGF receptor's PI3K pathway alone is sufficient to increase the levels of TRPV1 at the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employ cutting-edge optogenetic, imaging, and chemical-biology techniques to achieve their research goals. They ingeniously use optogenetics to selectively activate the PI3K pathway without affecting other NGF pathways. Additionally, they develop a novel, membrane-impermeable fluorescent probe for labeling cell-surface proteins through click-chemistry.</p>
<p>Comment on revised version:</p>
<p>We commend the authors on the significant improvements made to the manuscript. They have adequately addressed our comments. Notably, the new control experiments shown in Figure 4E and Figure 5 Fig. Supp 1 convincingly demonstrate the specificity of the NGF and 650 nm light stimuli, respectively. The addition of quantitative analyses strengthens the findings significantly. Furthermore, the manuscript is now presented in a much linear manner, enhancing its clarity and impact.</p>

<p>New data figures:</p>
<p>• Fig 3 – fig supp 2 – new experiment with insulin-triggered endocytosis of InsR</p>
<p>• Fig 3 – fig supp 3 – new experiments, all using the same protein construct</p>
<p>• Fig 3 – movie–  new experiment with insulin-triggered endocytosis of InsR</p>
<p>• Fig 4 – added new vehicle-only negative control experiments</p>
<p>• Fig 5 – fig supp 1 – new negative control experiments with sequential exposures to 750 nm light</p>
<p>Added figure panels with quantification/statistics for:  Fig. 1F; , Figure 1- figure supp 2B, Figure 2B, D, Fig. 2 – fig supp 1B, D; Fig 2 – fig supp 2B;  Fig 2 – fig supp 3B;</p>

<p>(1) The paper might benefit from a more streamlined structure and a clearer emphasis on its findings. A possible way to enhance its impact might be to focus more on its methodological aspects. The methodological facets stand out as both innovative and impactful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have rewritten the manuscript to center the methods, with our applications to TRPV1 and the InsR serving as examples.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 243: Please provide a reference for Tet3-Bu or clarify its origin in this study. A concise description would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Jang et al., 2020 and Jana et al., 2023 studies are cited and give the structure of Tet3-Bu in Figure 3A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Consider merging Figures 1 and 2 for clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because the cell types and constructs expressed differ for the figures, we did not merge them. However, we moved Figure 1 to the supplement because it repeats previously published data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Lines 281 and 293 should refer to Figure 5C, not 5B.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is now corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Should the paper pivot towards methodology, combining Figures 6 and 7 might be more coherent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The experiments in Figures 6 and 7 are different, making it difficult to merge them. However, Figures 7 and 8 describe the same experimental approach applied to two different membrane proteins. To align with our new focus on the methods and deemphasis of the biological system, we have merged Figures 7 and 8.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) A brief discussion comparing the cell surface labeling techniques and the merits of the presented system would offer valuable context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that additional discussion here would be helpful but were also trying to satisfy Reviewer #3’s request to reduce review-like content that disrupts the flow of the primary results. We therefore did not add a discussion of cell-surface labeling techniques.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>(1) To monitor the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphates, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain from Akt was used. This PH domain is not specific for just PI(3,4,5)P3 as stated by the authors. The Akt PH domain also binds PI(3,4)P2. The observed PI3K localization increase will also increase PI(3,4)P2 concentrations so the observed responses may not be solely because of PI(3,4,5)P3…</p>
<p>…Repeating the PH domain experiments with a PH domain that is specific for just PI(3,4,5)P3, like GRP1 or Btk, would be useful to separate out any contributions from PI(3,4)P2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have repeated key experiments demonstrating optogenetic activation of PI3K with the Grp1-PH domain and included these data in Figure 1-figure supplement 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The data in Figure 4 supplement was confusing to interpret since it is unclear whether a membrane protein with the Tet3 is being expressed at the same time as the ncAA for labeling or if the observed labeling is endogenous. If the observed labeling in Figure 4 supplement D is endogenous, then significant concerns come up regarding the background labeling of the sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 used in the rest of the experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated the data in this figure using the same protein (InsR-Tet3-Bu-GFP) for every sTCO-conjugated dye tested. The protein is also labelled with GFP, making it clear which cells in the field were transfected and which were not. The new panels showing the bright field images for each field further aid readers in identifying untransfected cells. We believe the new presentation addresses the reviewer’s concerns about distinguishing sTCO labeling of Tet3-Bu-incorporating protein from labeling of endogenous proteins.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I recommend reorganizing the article to be more linear. For example, Figure 4 is not fully explained until after Figure 4 supplement and Figure 5. This non-linear organization required a lot of back and forth reading to fully understand the logic of the experiments as well as the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have improved the presentation along the lines suggested by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The InsR data is interesting as a proof of concept however the writing around the InsR looks like an afterthought. The explanation for why InsR is chosen, what is known and unknown about its trafficking is given secondary importance in the writing but not in the figures. This difference weakens the article.</p>

<p>The reviewer is also concerned by the lack of any statistical analyses, and of appropriate control experiments:</p>
<p>(1) The trapping of PI3K at the plasma membrane, shown in Figure 3 supplementary 1, is not very convincing. It is unclear whether PI3K is trapped at the membrane, as claimed by the authors, or whether PI3K slowly accumulates at the membrane independently of the light stimulation. Indeed, the baseline fluorescence isn't flat to start with (especially in F-11 cells), and the change in fluorescence under 650 nm light is very modest, much weaker, in fact, than in control experiments without TRPV1 (Figure 2C). Do the authors observe a similar drift in fluorescence in absence of photostimulation at 650 nm? Such control experiment needs to be performed and discussed. More importantly, authors need to provide quantitative (and not just qualitative) measures of the changes in fluorescence observed in the different conditions, and run adequate statistical analyses to compare the different conditions (for all the figures of the manuscript where this applies).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We can see that the language of “trapped at the membrane” is more of an interpretation than a description. We now describe this result as a lack of dissociation of PIF-iSH2 from the membrane in response to 750 nm light. We more clearly explain our interpretation and label it as speculative.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Consider moving Figure 3 Supplementary 1 from supplementary information to the main document due to its importance. It seems like an important finding to me, and I believe also to the authors, who wrote a whole paragraph on PI3K trapping in the discussion section (lines 361-380).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the results from this figure are important. To better align with the request of all reviewers to shorten the manuscript and reduce the number of figures in the main text, however, we have left the figure in the supplement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 3: why is the increase in IP3 levels not reversible as in Figure 2? Is this because IP3 is detected only at the membrane level (TIRF experiment) and not the entire cell? Authors should comment on this aspect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described in response to Comment#2, we now better explain our interpretation. Briefly, we speculate that the PIF-iSH2 that encounters TRPV1 in the plasma membrane binds to the ankyrin repeat domain of TRPV1 and, therefore, does not readily dissociate from membrane in response to 750 nm light.</p>

<p>(4) Figure 4E: Verify the functionality of the Insulin receptor mutants, as was done for TRPV1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added new experiments to demonstrate that the insulin receptor incorporating Tet3-Bu is functional. Because the insulin receptor is not electrogenic, we could not use electrophysiology to validate its function. Instead, we measured the insulin-dependent endocytosis of the receptor. These data are now presented in Figure 3 – figure supplement 2 and Figure 3 –  supplemental movie.</p>

<p>(5) Figures 6 to 8: The authors quantify the change in plasma membrane expression of TRPV1 and insulin receptors after NGF treatment (or photoactivation), but an important control experiment is missing. They first label cells with sulfo-Cy5, then treat them with NGF (or photoactivate them with 650 nm light), and then label them again with sulfo-Cy5, supposedly to label only the TRPV1 receptors that newly arrived at the membrane. However, we have no evidence that the first sulfo-Cy5 labeling (1 uM, 5 min) was complete. In fact, labeling with sulfo-Cy5 (200 nM) in Figure 4 never reaches saturation, not even after 20 min. The authors need to control for this, by comparing the change in fluorescence with and without NGF treatment. The GFP control is simply not sufficient. Also, include Figure 8 in the text, as it is missing from the results section, and discuss the results in more detail. Indeed, the current data is appealing as it suggests that what was observed with TRPV1 is also true for the Insulin receptor, but without a proper control this could just be an artefact.</p>

<p>We have performed several new control experiments to address the reviewer’s concerns. (1) For NGF-induced increase in TRPV1 at the plasma membrane, we repeated the experiment using a vehicle instead of NGF. These data, added to Figure 4E, demonstrate that the increase in plasma membrane TRPV1 depends on NGF. (2) For the light-activated increase in plasma membrane TRPV1, we repeated the experiment using a second exposure to the deactivating 750 nm light instead of the activating 650 nm light and added the data as Figure 5, figure supplement 1A-E. These new data demonstrate that the increase in plasma membrane TRPV1 occurred only in response to  the activating wavelength of light. (3) To address the same as the previous comment, but for the insulin receptor, we repeated the insulin receptor experiments also using a second exposure to the deactivating wavelength of light. These data are now shown in Figure 5, figure supplement 1F-I and demonstrate that the increase in the insulin receptor levels in the plasma membrane required the activating wavelength of light.</p>

<p>(6) Line 313: &quot;Importantly, sTCO-sulfo-Cy5 did not appear to equilibrate across the cell membrane and did not label untransfected cells (i.e., those without GFP; Figure 4 - figure supplement 1)&quot;. I don't see where the absence of labeling of untransfected cells is shown. The authors should show fluorescence changes on the surface of both transfected and untransfected cells and, as discussed above, quantify the data and provide statistical analyses.</p>

<p>(11) Figure 1B: it is unclear how long after 650 nm light switching the image is taken. The red bar indicating 650 nm light makes it look like the image is taken right after light switching, which would suggest that PIF-YFP trafficking to the membrane takes milliseconds in response to 650 nm light. However, the legend says that photoactivation kinetics are in the range of 10 seconds. Please accurately position the red bar in Figure 1B to reflect the time between light switching and imaging, and specify the time between light switching and imaging in the figure legend.</p>
