<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Organ function declines with age, and large-scale transcriptomic analyses have highlighted differential aging trajectories across tissues. The mechanisms underlying shared and organ-selective functional changes across the lifespan, however, still remains poorly understood. Given the central role of mitochondria in powering cellular processes needed to maintain tissue health, we therefore undertook a systematic assessment of respiratory activity across 33 different tissues in young (2.5 months) and old (20 months) mice of both sexes. Our high-resolution mitochondrial respiration atlas reveals: 1) within any group of mice, mitochondrial activity varies widely across tissues, with the highest values consistently seen in heart, brown fat, and kidney; 2) biological sex is a significant but minor contributor to mitochondrial respiration, and its contributions are tissue-specific, with major differences seen in the pancreas, stomach, and white adipose tissue; 3) age is a dominant factor affecting mitochondrial activity, especially across different fat depots and skeletal muscle groups, and most brain regions; 4) age-effects can be sex- and tissue-specific, with some of the largest effects seen in pancreas, heart, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle; and 5) while aging alters the functional trajectories of mitochondria in a majority of tissues, some are remarkably resilient to age-induced changes. Altogether, our data provide the most comprehensive compendium of mitochondrial respiration and illuminate functional signatures of aging across diverse tissues and organ systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aging is complex biological phenomenon that results in functional decline across tissues and organs systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Age is one of the most significant contributors to disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), and the aging process is influenced by a variety of genetic and environmental factors at the tissue and organismal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The application of omics technologies in recent years has led to unprecedented insights into the complex biology of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of mouse tissues across the lifespan have shown that aging tempo and trajectory, as indicated by tissue transcriptomic signatures, varies widely across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Remarkably, many of the transcriptomic signatures of aging across tissues can be significantly reversed by caloric restriction or rejuvenated by the transfusion of young blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Large-scale proteomics analyses of the human plasma proteome also reveal distinct waves of changes across the lifespan, which are associated with distinct biological pathways and affect age-related phenotypic traits and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite enormous progress, there is no consensus regarding the mechanisms underlying aging at the cellular and tissue level. Although many non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been put forth to explain the root cause of aging—oxidative damage, genomic instability, epigenetic changes, loss of proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, telomere shortening, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion—it remains a major challenge to distinguish between the driver and passenger mechanisms of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Nevertheless, efforts to understand the proximal and ultimate cause of aging will facilitate development of therapeutics aimed at improving healthy aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, we focused on aging from a mitochondrial perspective, as this organelle is known to play an important role in the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Mitochondria supply the bulk of the energy needed to maintain tissue health and repair tissue damage, and their function tends to decline with age. Over time, damage accumulates in mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and lipids, which compromises their functional integrity and leads to dysregulated metabolism and increased oxidative stress. Recent transcriptomic analyses have highlighted major reductions in electron transport chain genes across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), and these changes can be significantly reversed by the transfusion of young blood into an old mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Aging-associated reduction in mitochondrial OXPHOS genes appear to be conserved between human, mouse, fly, and worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in various age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Boosting mitochondrial health has been shown to delay age-related decline in organ function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the central role of mitochondria in tissue health, we aimed to address the extent and magnitude of aging-induced changes in mitochondrial function across tissues and organ systems. Although many studies have examined mitochondrial respiratory capacity in various tissues, the scale was limited in that only a very small number of tissues could be interrogated at the same time. This is largely due to the inherent low-throughput method of assessing respiration which requires freshly isolated mitochondria or cells from tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Consequently, it was not previously feasible to have a comprehensive and systems-level analysis of mitochondrial function across many tissues and the lifespan.</p>
<p>This barrier, however, has been recently overcome. An innovative method by Acin-Perez and coworkers has made it possible now to assess mitochondrial function in previously frozen tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). This new method circumvents the requirement for the isolation of mitochondria at the time of tissue harvest, allowing a large number of tissues (e..g., from a mouse) to be collected, frozen, and assayed at a later time. We adopted the new method in a standardized workflow to profile mitochondrial activity in 33 tissues from young and old mice of both sexes. The dataset consists of a total of 1320 tissue samples from 40 mice and 3960 high-resolution respirometry assays encompassing three technical replicates. Our study represents the largest and the most comprehensive tissue respirometry analysis to date. Our data provide an unprecedented view on the variations and changes in mitochondrial functional capacity across tissues, sex, and age, thus informing ongoing studies on the causes and consequences of aging.</p>

<title>Pan-tissue mitochondrial respiration atlas overview, work-flow, and analysis pipeline</title>
<p>To assay mitochondrial respiration and its maintenance across age and sex, we collected 33 tissues from young (2.5 months; ∼18-year-equivalent in human) or old (20 months; ∼65-year-equivalent in human) male or female mice (<italic>n</italic> = 10 mice per age and sex). The tissues collected include different brain regions (hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and hypothalamus), different sections of the GI tract (stomach, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, cecum, proximal colon, and distal colon), various fat depots (gonadal, inguinal, mesenteric), different skeletal muscle groups (tongue, diaphragm, quadriceps complex, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus), reproductive organs (testis and fallopian tubes), as well as liver, pancreas, heart atria and ventricle, spleen, kidney cortex and medulla, eye, and skin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Our aim was to provide a comprehensive systems-level view of mitochondrial respiration across tissues, sex, and age.</p>

<p>Our standardized workflow involved thawing frozen tissue samples in buffer, minced, and homogenized. Samples were centrifuged to pellet cell debris and the supernatant was collected for immediate protein and mitochondrial content quantification (via MitoTracker Deep Red, MTDR). Sample respiration rates were then assayed using a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The basic respiration assay consisted of four sequential steps: first, baseline unstimulated measurements were obtained. Then, NADH was used to assess respiration via mitochondrial complex I (CI), or succinate was used as to assess respiration via mitochondrial complex II (CII) in the presence of rotenone (Rot, a CI inhibitor). Following this, samples were exposed to rotenone and antimycin A (AA, a complex III inhibitor) to silence respiration. Then, TMPD in the presence of ascorbate was used to assess respiration through mitochondrial complex IV (CIV), via donation of electrons to cytochrome c (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Detailed information of the methodology can be found in the methods section, which closely follows the method first described by Acin-Perez <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). High resolution respirometry data for each of the 33 tissues were used in all subsequent comparison (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1-33</xref>).</p>

<title>Mitochondrial function across different organ systems in male and female mice</title>
<p>The first analysis made was within a group (male, female, young, or old) across all tissues. This allowed us to focus on shared and unique mitochondrial properties across different tissues within a single mouse system. Ranking young male or young female tissues by their respiration via CI (NADH-stimulated), CII (succinate-stimulated), or CIV (TMPD and ascorbate-stimulated) showed that both sexes have the greatest oxygen consumption in the heart atria and ventricles, brown adipose tissue (BAT), kidney cortex and medulla, and the lowest respiration in the colon (distal or proximal), plantaris muscle, jejunum, ileum, and mesenteric white adipose tissue (mesWAT) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Ranking old male tissues by their respiration via CI, CII, or CIV showed that the heart atria and ventricles, BAT, kidney cortex and medulla have the highest oxygen consumption, while the ileum, pancreas, skin, duodenum, stomach, gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT), mesWAT, and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) have the lowest (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Ranking all old female tissues by their respiration via CI, CII, or CIV showed that the heart atria and ventricles, BAT, quadriceps muscles, and diaphragm have the highest respiration, while the pancreas, iWAT, mesWAT, ileum, distal colon, eyes, and skin have the lowest (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analyses revealed a wide range in mitochondrial respiratory capacity across nearly all tissues. We observed tissue-types of high similarity, such as the different regions of the brain (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>) and kidney cortex and medulla (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>), as well as those displaying degrees of functional heterogeneity, such as the heart atria and ventricle (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 3</xref>), different skeletal muscle groups (<xref rid="fig2s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 4</xref>) and white adipose tissue depots (<xref rid="fig2s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 5</xref>), and different sections of the gastrointestinal tract (<xref rid="fig2s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 6</xref>). Together, these data help illustrate the heterogeneity or lack thereof in mitochondrial function across different tissues and organ systems. Remarkably, even when age and sex are controlled for, mitochondria within a single tissue-classification or organ system can have distinct respiration signatures.</p>

<title>Sex differences in mitochondrial function in young mice</title>
<p>The first pan-tissue comparison of mitochondrial function across groups was made between young male and female mice. In this comparison, we focused on the effects of sex on mitochondrial respiration in young mice. A systems-level view of mitochondrial respiration via CI, CII, or CIV across 32 tissues (omitting reproductive tissues) showed that young male and female mice have similar distributions in oxygen consumption rate (OCR; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>, left panel). Individual tissue-level analysis of respiration through CI showed no significant difference between young male and female mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). However, individual tissue comparisons of respiration through CII showed that young males have higher mitochondrial respiration in the stomach and gastrocnemius muscles, and reduced mitochondrial activity in gWAT, duodenum, ileum, and distal colon, relative to young females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). Respiration at CIV showed that young males have higher mitochondrial activity in the BAT, kidney medulla, hippocampus, and stomach, and reduced mitochondrial activity in the gWAT, duodenum, and distal colon, when compared to young females (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel). A relative and global view of the sex-specific differences across young male and female mice showed that males have higher mitochondrial respiration in the stomach, kidney, and skeletal muscle, whereas females have higher mitochondrial respiration in the gastrointestinal tract and different fat depots (gWAT, and mesWAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of age on male mitochondrial function</title>
<p>The second tissue-by-tissue comparison of mitochondrial function was made across age, where we focused on the effects of age on mitochondrial respiration in young and old male mice. A systems-level view of respiration via CI, CII, or CIV across all 33 tissues showed that old and young male mice have similar distributions of OCR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>, left panel). However, an individual tissue view showed many differences in response to age. Old males showed a striking increase in mitochondrial activity via CI in the heart atria and ventricles, skeletal muscles (quadriceps, diaphragm, soleus, tongue, plantaris), and mesWAT, and reduced mitochondrial respiration in the brain cortex, relative to young males (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel). Viewing respiration through CII also showed that old males have markedly higher mitochondrial activity in the heart, skeletal muscles (quadriceps, diaphragm, plantaris), jejunum, ileum, and mesWAT when compared to young males (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, right panel). In contrast, old males had reduced mitochondrial activity via CII in the brain (cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus), BAT, stomach, and eyes when compared to young males. Respiration at CIV showed that old males have markedly elevated mitochondrial activity in the skeletal muscle (quadriceps, diaphragm, soleus, plantaris) and cecum, and reduced mitochondrial activity in the brain (cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus), BAT, liver, spleen, stomach, and iWAT, relative to young males (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, right panel). A relative and global view of the age-specific differences across male mice showed that old males have significantly elevated mitochondrial activity in the skeletal muscles, mesWAT, GI tract, and heart, with a concomitant reduction in mitochondrial activity in the stomach, iWAT, gWAT, eyes, and nearly all brain regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Together, these data indicate age has a strong effect in modulating mitochondrial respiration in male mice.</p>

<title>Effects of age on female mitochondrial function</title>
<p>The third tissue-by-tissue comparison of mitochondrial function was made between old and young female mice. Systems-level analysis of respiration via CI, CII, or CIV across all 33 tissues showed no significant differences in OCR distribution between old and young female mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>, left panel). Individual tissue comparisons, however, showed many significant differences in response to age. Respiration through CI showed that old females have elevated mitochondrial activity in the heart ventricles, skeletal muscles (quadriceps, diaphragm, soleus, tongue, and plantaris), stomach, and mesWAT, and a concomitant reduction in mitochondrial activity in the cerebellum when compared to young females (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, right panel). Respiration through CII also showed that old females have increased mitochondrial respiration in the heart ventricles, skeletal muscles (quadriceps, diaphragm, plantaris), and mesWAT relative to young females (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, right panel). In contrast, old females had reduced mitochondrial respiration via CII in the liver, brain (cortex and cerebellum), gWAT, fallopian tubes, duodenum, eyes, and pancreas when compared to young females. Respiration at CIV likewise showed that old females have elevated mitochondrial activity in the skeletal muscle (quadriceps, diaphragm, plantaris) and mesWAT relative to young females; concomitantly, old females had reduced mitochondrial activity in the brain (cortex and cerebellum), liver, gWAT, stomach, lung, eyes, duodenum, and skin when compared to young females (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, right panel). A relative and global view of the age-specific differences across female mice showed that old females have elevated mitochondrial respiration in the skeletal muscles, mesenteric fat, and heart ventricle, and a concomitant reduction in mitochondrial activity in the eyes, skin, duodenum, gWAT, iWAT, and nearly all brain regions when compared to young females. Similar to males, these data also indicate age has a strong effect in modulating mitochondrial activity in female mice.</p>

<title>Age differentially affects mitochondrial function in male and female mice</title>
<p>The fourth tissue-by-tissue comparison of mitochondrial function was made between old male and female mice, where we focused on the effects of sex on mitochondrial respiration in old mice. A systems-level view of respiration through CI, CII, or CIV across all 33 tissues showed no differences in OCR distribution across sex in old mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>, left panel). At the individual tissue level, however, old male mice had greater mitochondrial activity via CI in the heart atria, kidney medulla, and soleus muscle as compared to old females. Respiration through CII showed that old males have higher mitochondrial activity in the kidney (cortex and medulla) and pancreas, and reduced mitochondrial activity in the stomach, relative to old females (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, right panel). Respiration at CIV showed that old males have higher mitochondrial respiration in the kidney medulla, soleus muscle, and lungs, and reduced mitochondrial activity in the cerebellum and mesWAT, when compared to old females (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, right panel). A global and relative view of the sex-specific differences across age showed that old males have elevated mitochondrial activity in the distal colon, lung, eyes, pancreas, kidney, and heart when compared to old females, whereas old females have higher mitochondrial activity in all adipose tissue depots, stomach, and nearly all brain regions when compared to old males (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>

<p>Grouping significant differences by the cross-group comparison in which they occurred showed that young male (YM)-by-old male (OM) have the most significant differences with 37 in total, followed by young female (YF)-by-old female (OF) with 35, YM-by-YF with 14, and OM-by-OF with 12 significant differences (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Clustering the significant difference counts by type, sex (originating from YM-by-YF or OM-by-OF) or age (originating from YM-by-OM or YF-by-OF), we saw that although both sex and age exerted an effect on mitochondrial respiration, it was age that resulted in the highest number of significant changes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). We next sought to quantify the number of tissues significantly affected in at least one mitochondrial parameter per cross-group comparison. There were eight tissues with a difference when comparing young male and female, 10 when comparing old male and female, and 21 tissues when comparing young and old male, or young and old female (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the majority of significant differences observed are the result of age.</p>
<p>Next, we calculated the absolute difference of means and summed the resultant values based on their effect-type, sex (originating from YM-by-YF or OM-by-OF) or age (originating from YM-by-YF or OM-by-OF) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). This analysis offered an added magnitude perspective to our view of changes in mitochondrial respiration across sex and age. It allowed us to see that respiration via CI, CII, and CIV all have a greater magnitude of difference as a result of age as compared to sex. Each graph in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref> shows ranked values (lowest/left to highest/right) within the age and sex groupings with the top tissues colored and labeled with their percent contribution to the total. The highest contributors to the differences in respiration via CI as a result of age were heart (ventricles and atria), BAT, and quadriceps muscles, while those for sex are heart (ventricles and atria) and BAT. The highest contributors to the differences in respiration through CII as a result of age were heart ventricles, BAT, quadriceps, and diaphragm, while those for sex are heart (ventricles and atria), kidney (cortex and medulla), and BAT. The highest contributors to the differences in respiration at CIV as a result of age were heart (ventricles and atria), BAT, quadriceps, and diaphragm, while those for sex were BAT and heart (ventricles and atria). It is important to note that these rankings do not indicate directionality of a difference, only total magnitude. Additionally, these changes are represented as absolute magnitude of difference. Therefore, tissues with lower absolute oxygen consumption values would skew towards lower ranking, even though the relative change occurring within that tissue may be large.</p>
<p>Principle component (PC) analysis of each mitochondrial respiration dataset showed a primary and consistent separation across PC1 as a result of age (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). A small percentage of the variance can be explained through PC2 as a result of sex, although this effect was not as consistent as that seen with age. Pearson correlation heat maps further highlighted age as a key factor relating samples across groups (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Male and female samples of the same age positively correlated with one another, while young and old samples regardless of sex showed a negative correlation. These combined data indicate that while sex does affect mitochondrial respiration, age is the dominant factor.</p>

<title>The sex-specific impact of age on mitochondrial function</title>
<p>To investigate the sex-dependent effects on mitochondrial function across age, we first calculated all of the relative change values for males and females from young to old. Summation of relative change values of all tissues within a specific mitochondrial parameter—respiration through CI, CII, or CIV—allowed us to view sex-specific systems-level effects across age (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-B</xref>). Both the male and female systems showed a relative net increase in CI and decrease in CIV activity with age. Interestingly, with respect to CII activity, the male and female systems had divergent response. The net relative CII activity increased in males and decreased in females with age. These data suggest that: 1) independent of sex, CI and CIV are uniquely regulated, showing net opposite responses with age, and 2) CII activity is the most sex-affected respiratory component across age and tissues.</p>

<p>Heat maps of the individual tissue-level data presented in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-B</xref> further highlight the tissue-level similarities and differences across age, sex, and mitochondrial respiration type (i.e., through CI, CII, or CIV). For example, respiration through CI, CII, or CIV showed that the plantaris muscles (PL), diaphragm muscle (DI), quadriceps muscles (QD), jejunum (JE), and mesenteric white adipose tissue (MW) have the greatest positive relative change in response to age, while the eye (EY), gonadal white adipose tissue (GW), skin (SK), and stomach (ST) were among the tissues that showed the greatest negative relative change with age (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the tissues with the strongest sex-specific age effects, we organized male and female data by the largest (left) to smallest (right) difference of relative change. This multi-dimensional view highlights differences within a tissue across sex in response to age (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). The largest sex-specific effects of age on respiration via CI were found in the stomach (ST), jenujum (JE), distal colon (DC), quadriceps muscles (QD), and pancreas (PN); in contrast, the kidney cortex (KC), cecum (CC), cerebellum (CE), soleus muscle (SL), and diaphragm muscle (DI) displayed the most similarity of change (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, top panel). The largest sex-specific effects of age on respiration through CII were found in the stomach (ST), duodenum (DU), distal colon (DC), pancreas (PN), and jejunum (JE); in contrast, the liver (LV), skin (SK), hamstring muscle (HS), kidney medulla (KM), and tongue (TN) displayed the smallest sex-differences (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, middle panel). Finally, the most sex-specific effects of age on respiration through CIV were found in mesenteric white adipose tissue (MW), jejunum (JE), duodenum (DU), distal colon (DC), and skin (SK); in contrast, the tongue (TN), heart ventricles (HV), gastrocnemius muscle (GS), distal colon (DI), and brain cortex (CO) displayed the greatest similarity of change with age (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, bottom panel).</p>
<p>All sexually divergent tissues are marked specifically within each graph per mitochondrial respiration-type. Respiration via CI showed 5 tissues with sexual divergence in response to aging, and these were stomach (ST), distal colon (DC), pancreas (PN), lung (LN), and kidney medulla (KM) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, top panel). Respiration through CII showed 5 tissues with sexual divergence in response to aging, and these were duodenum (DU), pancreas (PN), lung (LN), heart atria (HA), and tongue (TN) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, second panel). Respiration at CIV also showed 5 tissues with sexual divergence in response to aging, and these were jejunum (JE), distal colon (DC), hamstring (HS), heart atria (HA), and kidney medulla (KM) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, bottom). Together, these data show the relative magnitude of change across sex and age, and highlight the tissue- and sex-specific regulation of mitochondrial respiration with aging.</p>
<p>We further grouped the above data by directionality to visualize male and female tissue responses to aging (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). From this, we can quickly visualize tissues displaying a shared direction of change in respiration via CI, CII, or CIV across sex and age. Additionally, some tissues responded in an age-and-sex-specific manner (i.e., display divergence in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). This data clustering summarizes the shared (age-specific) or opposite (sex-specific) directionality of mitochondrial function across tissues in respond to age.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the mitochondrial activity of a particular tissue could increase or decrease in a sex-specific way even though the directionality is the same. For example, respiration through CII for the stomach (ST) showed male and female values decreasing with age, yet the male had a larger relative decrease when compared to female (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, middle panel). Another consideration should be given to the divergent group with varying degrees of divergence. For example, CI-associated respiration of the stomach (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, top panel) showed a strong divergence given that male had a strong decline in function while the female increased over time. On the other hand, the CI-associated respiration of the kidney medulla showed a weak divergence; although the directionality of change was opposite, the magnitude was small.</p>
<p>Lastly, we grouped all the tissues with a consistent shared (across sex) relative increase or decrease in CI-, CII-, and CIV-associated respiration in response to age (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>). The tissues with a shared (across sex) increased response to aging were plantaris (PL), quadriceps (QD), diaphragm (DI), soleus (SL), heart ventricle (HV), ileum (IL), cecum (CC), proximal colon (PC), and mesenteric fat (MW). Interestingly, PL, QD, DI, and SL are all skeletal muscles and IL, CC, and PC are all part of the digestive tract. Also of note, the gastrocnemius (GT), hamstring (HS), and tongue (TN) muscles were not uniformly increasing with age. In fact, these muscles showed reduced mitochondrial respiration with age, in striking contrast to other skeletal muscle types assayed. The tissues with a shared (across sex) decrease in response to aging were brown fat (BT), gonadal fat (GW), inguinal fat (IW), brain cortex (CO), hippocampus (HI), hypothalamus (HY), cerebellum (CE), liver (LV), kidney cortex (KC), eye (EY), skin (SK), and spleen (SP). Different fat depots and many of the brain regions showed a consistent decline in respiratory function with age, regardless of sex. The kidney cortex (KC) oddly showed a respiratory effect distinct from the medulla, which was almost completely resistant to age-related respiratory changes. The eyes (EY) not only showed a consistent decline in respiration with age, but also had one of the largest combined relative effects. Together, the shared and divergent analyses presented (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E and F</xref>) illuminate the modulation of mitochondrial function across age.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we provide the most comprehensive catalog of sex- and age-associated mitochondrial respiration signatures across diverse tissues and organs system. One important aspect of our study to emphasize is the experimental uniformity. All the tissue samples were collected from the same set of mice, and processed and analyzed in a uniform and standardized manner on the same respirometry platform in a single laboratory. Combined with the ten biological replicates, our experimental setup and workflow markedly enhanced the rigor and reduced the variations in data quality. From the mitochondrial respiration compendium, we can clearly see that mitochondrial function varies widely across tissues and that aging has a much larger effect than sex on mitochondrial activity across tissues.</p>
<p>The transcriptomic dataset generated by the Tabula Muris Consortium clearly indicates organ-specific temporal signatures across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), and this is assumed to track closely with tissue function even though no equivalent systematic interrogation of tissue function across the lifespan has been performed. In this regard, our mitochondrial activity atlas aligned and corroborated with the conclusion from large-scale transcriptomic analyses that the aging process and trajectory can vary substantially across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). This reinforces the notion that while an organism ages, the aging-associated decline in organ function is not uniform across tissues and organ systems. Given that genetics and environmental factors all contribute to tissue health and their functional breakdown with age, this further amplifies the heterogenous process of aging across a population.</p>
<p>Although sex is a significant biological variable influencing many aspects of physiology and pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), we were surprised that sex has a relatively modest impact on respiratory capacity in mitochondria across tissues and age. The modest impact of sex on mitochondrial respiration across tissues is also consistent with the relatively minor impact of sex on tissue transcriptome across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). The caveat, however, is that our study is based on a single strain of mice with a uniform genetic background. The contribution of biological sex may be more pronounced in an outbred population where sex hormones interact with other genetic and environmental determinants to influence mitochondrial activity across tissues and age.</p>
<p>Aging is a dynamic process that unfolds across the lifespan, and this involves changes at the molecular, cellular, biochemical, and tissue level. Transcriptomics analyses have consistently shown that aging induces a reduction in mitochondrial OXPHOS genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), and this likely contributes to the reduced mitochondrial activity we observed across many tissues in old mice. Changes in cell function, however, are often counter measured by homeostatic responses. While many tissues showed a significant reduction in mitochondrial function, some tissues also showed a concomitant increase in mitochondrial activity with age. With the assumption that organ function declines with age, our data suggests a potential organ-selective compensatory response to declining efficiency in cellular function which entails a greater demand on mitochondrial ATP production. This hypothesis awaits future experimental confirmation.</p>
<p>Every respirometry method has its advantages and limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Unlike the mitochondrial respiration analysis in intact cells or isolated mitochondria, our respirometry analysis was performed in mitochondria-enriched lysate derived from frozen tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). In an intact mitochondrion, the rate of mitochondrial respiration is regulated by both substrate supply across the mitochondrial membrane and the rate of NADH and FADH production via the TCA cycle and fatty acid β-oxidation. In the absence of an intact mitochondrial membrane, our assays measure maximal mitochondrial respiration through CI, CII, or CIV. Thus, our mitochondrial activity reflects maximal respiration across tissues. In an <italic>in vivo</italic> milieu, mitochondrial activity is likely regulated and may not reach its maximal capacity as reflected in our assay. However, the advantage of the frozen-tissue method makes it feasible to carry out large-scale respirometry analyses, which outweigh its limitations.</p>
<p>In summary, our mitochondrial functional signatures demonstrate similar and divergent responses to aging across tissues. Whether changes in tissue mitochondrial respiration reflect the cause, consequence, or both, of aging remains to be determined. We anticipate that the integration of this knowledge with other large-scale omics data will help uncover potential genetic, epigenetic, and biochemical mechanisms linking mitochondrial health and organismal aging.</p>

<title>Mouse model</title>
<p>All wild-type C57BL/6J male and female mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and fed a standard chow (Envigo; 2018SX). In total, the young group was comprised of 10 male and 10 female 8-week-old mice, and the old group was comprised of 10 male and 10 female 80-week-old mice. Mice were housed in polycarbonate cages on a 12h:12h light-dark photocycle with ad libitum access to water and food. All mice were fasted for 2 h prior to euthanasia and dissection. Tissues were collected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80°C until analysis. All mouse protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (animal protocol # MO22M367). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines and followed the standards established by the Animal Welfare Acts.</p>

<title>Comprehensive multi-organ dissection</title>
<p>Each mouse was dissected cleanly, swiftly, and in a concerted manner by three people. Each mouse dissection took approximately 8-10 min, with 33 tissues collected per dissection. After euthanasia, blood was collected via decapitation. The head was then immediately given to dissector one to collect brain regions (hypothalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex), eyes, and tongue. Simultaneously, the visceral cavity was opened by dissector two. Inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) was collected immediately after opening the abdominal skin. After that the abdominal muscle was cut and gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) and testes or fallopian tubes were collected. Following this, the visceral organs were partitioned in two groups. Dissector two promptly dissected liver, stomach, kidneys (further separated the cortex and medulla), spleen, diaphragm, heart (further divided into atria and ventricles), lungs, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skin (cleared of hair using Topical Nair lotion, cleaned, then collected). At the same time, dissector three was collecting the pancreas, mesenteric white adipose tissue (mesWAT), small intestine (further split into duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), cecum, and large intestine (further split into proximal and distal colon). As soon as tissue collection in the head was finished, the mouse carcass was cut transversely at the lumbar spine and handed to dissector one for muscle dissection. Dissector one then rapidly and precisely anatomized (bilaterally) the quadriceps (entire complex – rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and vastus medialis), hamstrings (biceps femoris), gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles. All tissues were washed with sterile 1X PBS to remove residual blood prior to snap freeze. Additionally, the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine were cleared and cleaned of debris with PBS prior to freezing. The Cecum, however, was kept whole containing all fecal/food matter and microorganisms present. All dissected tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C for later analysis.</p>

Samples were thawed in 1X MAS buffer (70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 5 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM HEPES pH 7.4), finely minced with scissors, then homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer on ice. The entire sample, bilateral for skeletal muscles, was homogenized and used for respirometry with the exception of liver in which only a piece was homogenized. This was done to provide a true tissue average and avoid regional differences in mitochondria. The resulting homogenate was spun at 1000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and immediately used for protein quantification by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, 23225). Each well of the Seahorse microplate was loaded with the designated amount (in µg) of homogenate protein (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Each biological replicate is comprised of three technical replicates. Samples from all tissues were treated separately with NADH (1 mM) as a complex I substrate or Succinate (a complex II substrate, 5 mM) in the presence of rotenone (a complex I inhibitor, 2 µM), then with the inhibitors rotenone (2 µM) and Antimycin A (4 µM), followed by TMPD (N,N,N’,N’-Tetramethyl-p-Phenylenediamine; also known as Wurster’s Reagent, 0.45 mM) and Ascorbate (Vitamin C, 1 mM) to activate complex IV, and finally treated with Azide (40 mM) to assess non-mitochondrial respiration.</p>

<title>Quantification of mitochondrial content</title>
<p>Mitochondrial content of homogenates used for respirometry was quantified with MitoTracker Deep Red FM (MTDR, Invitrogen, M22426) staining as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Briefly, lysates were incubated with MTDR (1 µM) for 10 min at 37°C, then centrifuged at 2000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was carefully removed and replaced with 1X MAS solution and fluorescence was read with excitation and emission wavelengths of 625 nm and 670 nm, respectively. All measurements were read with a BioTek Synergy HTX Multimode Plate Reader (Agilent). All samples from a single tissue-type were measured on the same plate, in duplicate, with an equal gain setting of 90 to ensure comparability across samples. To minimize non-specific background signal contribution, control wells were loaded with MTDR + 1X MAS and subtracted from all sample values.</p>

<p>The authors present an <bold>important</bold> resource to quantify mitochondrial function across many organs in mice. The <bold>convincing</bold> conclusions are supported by the identification of processes that specifically differ between young and old, or between male and female mice. All reviewers point to the merit of this study in providing a comprehensive resource to contextualize mitochondrial functions across the body. Some further suggestions are made to clarify conclusions in terms of data normalization, interpretations of comparative analyses between organs.</p>

<p>In this study, Sarver and colleagues carried out an exhaustive analysis of the functioning of various components (Complex I/II/IV) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) using a real-time cell metabolic analysis technique (commonly referred as Seahorse oxygen consumption rate (OCR) assay). The authors aimed to generate an atlas of ETC function in about 3 dozen tissue types isolated from all major mammalian organ systems. They used a recently published improvised method by which ETC function can be quantified in freshly frozen tissues. This method enabled them to collect data from almost all organ systems from the same mouse and use many biological replicates (10 mice/experiment) required for an unbiased and statistically robust analysis. Moreover, they studied the influence of sex (male and female) and aging (young adult and old age) on ETC function in these organ systems. The main findings of this study are (1) cells in the heart and kidneys have very active ETC complexes compared to other organ systems, (2) the sex of the mice has little influence on the ETC function, and (3) aging undermined the mitochondrial function in most tissue, but surprisingly in some tissue aging promoted the activity of ETC complexes (e.g., Quadriceps, plantaris muscle, and Diaphragm). Although this study provides a comprehensive outlook on the ETC function in various tissues, the main caveat is that it's too technical and descriptive. The authors didn't invest much effort in putting their findings in the context of the biological function of the tissue analyzed, i.e., some tissues might be more glycolytic than others and have low ETC activity. Also, it is unclear what slight changes in the activity of one or the other ETC complex mean in terms of mitochondrial ATP production. Likely, these small changes reported do not affect the mitochondrial respiration. With such a detailed dataset, the study falls short of deriving more functionally relevant conclusions about the heterogeneity of mitochondrial function in various tissues. In the current format, the readers get lost in the large amount of data presented in a technical manner. Also, it is highly recommended that all the raw data and the values be made available as an Excel sheet (or other user-friendly formats) as a resource to the community.</p>
<p>Major concerns</p>
<p>(1) In this study, the authors used the method developed by Acin-Perez and colleagues (EMBO J, 2020) to analyze ETC complex activities in mitochondria derived from the snap-frozen tissue samples. However, the preservation of cellular/mitochondrial integrity in different types of tissues after being snap-frozen was not validated. Additionally, the conservation of mitochondrial respiration in snap-frozen tissues might differ, especially in those derived from old mice. For example, quadriceps (young male/female), plantaris (young male/female), intestinal segments (duodenum), and pancreas preparations show almost no activity (nearly flat OCR in Seahorse assays). For such a comprehensive study, the author must at least validate those tissues where the OCR plots looked suboptimal with the mitochondrial preparations derived from the fresh tissue. Since aging has been identified as the most important effector in this study, it is essential to validate how aging affects respiration in various fresh frozen tissues. Such analysis will ensure that the results presented are not due to the differential preservation of the mitochondrial respiration in the frozen tissue. In addition, such validations will further strengthen the conclusions and promote the broad usability of this &quot;new&quot; method.</p>
<p>(2) In this study, the authors sampled the maximal activity of ETC complex I, II, and IV, but throughout the manuscript, they discussed the data in the context of mitochondrial function. However, it is unclear how the changes in CI, CII, and CIV activity affect overall mitochondrial function (if at all) and how small changes seen in the maximal activity of one or more complexes affect the efficiency and efficacy of ATP production (OxPhos). The authors report huge variability between the activity of different complexes - in some tissues all three complexes (CI, CII, and CIV) and often in others, just one complex was affected. For example, as presented in Figure 4, there is no difference in CI activity in the hippocampus and cerebellum, but there is a slight change in CII and CIV activity. In contrast, in heart atria, there is a change in the activity of CI but not in CII and CIV. However, the authors still suggest that there is a significant difference in mitochondrial activity (e.g., &quot;Old males showed a striking increase in mitochondrial activity via CI in the heart atria....reduced mitochondrial respiration in the brain cortex...&quot; - Lines 5-7, Page 9). Until and unless a clear justification is provided, the authors should not make these broad claims on mitochondrial respiration based on small changes in the activity of one or more complexes (CI/CII/CIV). With such a data-heavy and descriptive study, it is confusing to track what is relevant and what is not for the functioning of mitochondria.</p>
<p>(3) What do differences in the ETC complex CI, CII, and CIV activity in the same tissue mean? What role does the differential activity of these complexes (CI, CII, and CIV) play in mitochondrial function? What do changes in Oxphos mean for different tissues? Does that mean the tissue (cells involved) shift more towards glycolysis to derive their energy? In the best world, a few experiments related to the glycolytic state of the cells would have been ideal to solidify their finding further. The authors could have easily used ECAR measurements for some tissues to support their key conclusions.</p>
<p>(4) The authors further analyzed parameters that significantly changed across their study (Figure 7, 98 data points analyzed). The main caveat of such analysis is that some tissue types would be represented three or even more times (due to changes in the activity of all three complexes - CI, CII, and CIV, and across different ages and sexes), and some just once. Such a method of analysis will skew the interpretation towards a few over-represented organ/tissue systems. Perhaps the authors should separately analyze tissue where all three complexes are affected from those with just one affected complex.</p>
<p>(5) The current protocol does not provide cell-type-specific resolution and will be unable to identify the cellular source of mitochondrial respiration. This becomes important, especially for those organ systems with tremendous cellular heterogeneity, such as the brain. The authors should discuss whether the observed changes result from an altered mitochondria respiratory capacity or if changes in proportions of cell types in the different conditions studied (young vs. aged) might also contribute to differential mitochondrial respiration.</p>
<p>(6) Another critical concern of this study is that the same datasets were repeatedly analyzed and reanalyzed throughout the study with almost the same conclusion - namely, aging affects mitochondrial function, and sex-specific differences are limited to very few organs. Although this study has considerable potential, the authors missed the chance to add new insights into the distinct characteristics of mitochondrial activity in various tissue and organ systems. The author should invest significant efforts in putting their data in the context of mitochondrial function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors utilize a new technique to measure mitochondrial respiration from frozen tissue extracts, which goes around the historical problem of purifying mitochondria prior to analysis, a process that requires a fair amount of time and cannot be easily scaled up.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial respiration across tissues, sexes, and two different ages provides foundational knowledge needed in the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While many of the findings are mostly descriptive, this paper provides a large amount of data for the community and can be used as a reference for further studies. As the authors suggest, this is a new atlas of mitochondrial function in mouse. The inclusion of a middle aged time point and a slightly older young point (3-6 months) would be beneficial to the study.</p>

<p>The aim of the study was to map, a) whether different tissues exhibit different metabolic profiles (this is known already), what differences are found between female and male mice and how the profiles changes with age. In particular, the study recorded the activity of respirasomes, i.e. the concerted activity of mitochondrial respiratory complex chains consisting of CI+CIII2+CIV, CII+CIII2+CIV or CIV alone.</p>
<p>The strength is certainly the atlas of oxidative metabolism in the whole mouse body, the inclusion of the two different sexes and the comparison between young and old mice. The measurement was performed on frozen tissue, which is possible as already shown (Acin-Perez et al, EMBO J, 2020).</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>The assay reveals the maximum capacity of enzyme activity, which is an artificial situation and may differ from in vivo respiration, as the authors themselves discuss. The material used was a very crude preparation of cells containing mitochondria and other cytosolic compounds and organelles. Thus, the conditions are not well defined and the respiratory chain activity was certainly uncoupled from ATP synthesis. Preparation of more pure mitochondria and testing for coupling would allow evaluation of additional parameters: P/O ratios, feedback mechanism, basal respiration, and ATP-coupled respiration, which reflect in vivo conditions much better. The discussion is rather descriptive and cautious and could lead to some speculations about what could cause the differences in respiration and also what consequences these could have, or what certain changes imply.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this study is an important step towards this kind of analysis.</p>
