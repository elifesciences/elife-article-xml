<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the world population ages, new molecular targets in aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are needed to combat the expected influx of new AD cases. Until now, the role of RNA structure in aging and neurodegeneration has largely remained unexplored. METHODS: In this study, we examined human hippocampal <italic>postmortem</italic> tissue for the formation of RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) in aging and AD.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We found that rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in the hippocampus with both age and with AD severity. We further found that neurons with accumulation of phospho-tau immunostaining contained rG4s, that rG4 structure can drive tau aggregation, and that rG4 staining density depended on APOE genotype in the human tissue examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Combined with previous studies showing the dependence of rG4 structure on stress and the extreme power of rG4s at oligomerizing proteins, we propose a model of neurodegeneration in which chronic rG4 formation drives proteostasis collapse. These morphological findings suggest that further investigation of RNA structure in neurodegeneration is a critical avenue for future treatments and diagnoses.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the aged population increases, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRDs) will become one of the world’s largest medical and economic crises due to the lack of early diagnostic methods and durable therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Age is the highest risk factor for AD, as disease prevalence increases exponentially as a function of age, and close to 40% of older adults over the age of 80 experience AD or ADRDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The most important genetic risk factor for developing late onset AD (LOAD) is the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, at least in Caucasians, where carriers of one or two copies of the APOE4 allele have a substantial increase in the risk for developing LOAD when compared to carriers of the APOE2 or 3 alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Beyond APOE, recent meta-analyses combining genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have expanded the number of AD-risk loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, but most of the disease-associated variants reside in non-protein coding regions of the genome, making it difficult to elucidate how they affect AD susceptibility and pathogenesis.</p>
<p>The exact mechanisms behind these two predominant AD risk factors remains a mystery but both are widely associated with increased abnormal protein aggregation, which is the most abundantly observed pathological hallmark of AD pathogenesis. AD and ADRDs all have an abnormal protein aggregation profile that includes: 1) extracellular amyloid senile plaque deposition occurring at least 5-10 years before mild cognitive impairments (MCI) are observed and, 2) aggregates of phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) forming intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) near MCI onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Novel biomarker studies have shown that hyperphosphorylated Tau species exist in plasma prior to onset of dementia symptoms, with specific phosphorylation sites seeming to affect the affinity of binding of the Tau protein to microtubules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. With advancing age, protein aggregation is accelerated by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the onset of neuroinflammation in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Having APOE4 was shown to significantly increase accumulation of amyloid and NFTs in Caucasians, and also increases inflammation and reactive oxygen species in the human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The effects of these AD risk factors have been studied mostly at the protein level in the brain, but not yet at RNA level, where structure and function have a myriad of important roles in numerous biological processes.</p>
<p>RNA higher order structures of particular interest are RNA guanine-rich G-quadruplexes (rG4s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. G-quadruplexes are secondary structures that can fold under physiological conditions by guanine-rich DNA and RNA molecules and occur in the genomes and transcriptomes of many species, including humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. rG4s are four-stranded helices formed by guanine tetrads through Hoogsteen base-pairing, with a monovalent cation channel running down the middle of the tetrads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. G4s are potentially involved in the regulation of DNA and RNA processes, such as replication, transcription, translation, RNA localization, and degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Recently, rG4s were shown to form as a function of stress in eukaryotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Under non-stress conditions, rG4s were largely unfolded, but upon introduction of stress (including ROS stress) the rG4s preferentially folded and remained folded until the cessation of stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. This observation raises the possibility that rG4s could preferentially fold under the increased and chronic stress conditions of aging and AD in the human brain, leading to abnormally high levels of rG4 formation in older adults or in adults with protein misfolding diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. RNA has been known to be included in AD-related aggregates of both amyloid and NFTs in patients with AD for decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and a recent sequencing study of nucleic acids embedded in AD aggregates showed an enrichment in potential rG4-forming sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>It has recently been shown that rG4s can greatly enhance protein oligomerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, rG4s can bind to and greatly enhance the phase transition of tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Similarly, Zwierzchowski-Zarate et al explored the effects of different RNA sequences on tau aggregation in a cellular model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In their study, several sequences caused an increase in tau aggregation, but the highest level of tau aggregation was achieved with a GGGC repeat sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, the structure of the RNAs, including possible rG4 formation, was not explored or speculated upon. We therefore performed CD spectroscopy to determine if the sequence associated with the highest levels of tau fibrillation might be forming rG4 secondary structures. The CD spectra show that this RNA forms parallel rG4 structures <italic>in vitro</italic> (Supplementary Data Fig. 1).</p>
<p>Based on these previous <italic>in vitro</italic> and cellular studies, an increased presence of rG4s in the brain could contribute to AD-associated aggregation. However, the presence of rG4s in the human brain or other human tissues has not been shown previously, nor how it relates to aging or AD pathology. This was the focus of the current study.</p>

<title>Human brain tissue</title>
<p>This work was approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. However, the use of <italic>postmortem</italic> brain tissue for research is exempt according to federal IRB regulations and does not require IRB review and approval. All efforts were made to consider diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the selection of brain tissues for this study. The tissues included in this study were obtained from the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) brain bank (Dr. Eric Hamlett). <italic>Postmortem</italic> consent was obtained from the next of kin, and the brain was rapidly removed. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> shows the demographics for the 21 cases used for this study. The tissue was sliced in 1 cm coronal slices and subjected to free-floating fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 72 hours. The fixed tissue was then transferred to a 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer (PB), followed by transfer to a cryoprotection solution in PBS (30% Glycerol, 30% Ethylene Glycol and 40% PO4 Buffer) and stored in −20° C until dissection. Anatomical blocks from 19 brain regions were dissected from the 1 cm slabs, embedded in paraffin and cut at a thickness of 5µm on a Microm Microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) and stained for routine neuropathological staging according to the NIA-AA <italic>Revised Criteria for Diagnosis and Staging of Alzheimer’s Disease</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized in xylene (RPI, CAT#111056) and rehydrated using wash steps at: 100%, 95%, 70%, 50% ethanol followed by distilled water. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed using 0.05% citraconic acid at pH 7.2 for 20 minutes in a steamer. Slides were then washed with a saline solution buffered with tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris, TBS) and blocked with 0.25% triton-X and 5% normal serum for 1 hour. After blocking, slides were rinsed again with TBS and incubated with 1X True Black Lipofuscin Autofluorescence Quencher (Biotium CAT#23007) diluted in 70% ethanol. Slides were washed 3 times with TBS then incubated with primary antibodies listed in Supplementary Data Table 1 overnight, followed by Goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 555 (Thermo Scientific #A32727) or Donkey anti-rabbit Alexafluor 488 (Invitrogen #A-21206) at 1:500 dilution for 1 hour. Slides were then washed 3 times with TBS and cover-slipped using mounting media containing DAPI (Thermo Scientific, CAT#P36931). Staining controls included omission of primary or secondary antibodies (Supplementary Data Fig. 2). In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, we performed sequential double labeling, first with BG4, and then with rRNA antibody at 1:250 (Abcam #ab17119).</p>
<p>In addition, we examined whether Braak stage correlated with aging itself (Supplementary Data Fig. 3). Although not significant at the 0.05 level, there was a weak correlation between Braak and Age. Braak staging is a paradigm used to describe density and regional spread of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the Alzheimer brain and includes levels 0-VI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease) is a staging paradigm for Alzheimer’s disease that takes into account amyloid plaque formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Imaging and Statistical methods</title>
<p>Slides were imaged on a confocal microscope at 10X, 20X and 60X magnification at wavelengths 355, 488, and 555. Images used for quantification were taken at constant microscope and intensity settings. All image quantification was performed using Fiji ImageJ. Quantification was performed by a researcher who was blinded to the neuropathological diagnosis of individual cases and with no knowledge of Braak Stage or Age for the case being quantified. Supplemental Table 2 presents side by side comparisons of quantification from 2 researchers who were both blinded to group diagnosis and individual cases. Data used in the paper are highlighted. One data point with too much variation between quantifications was removed to increase rigor. Background was subtracted using a rolling ball radius. Images were then divided into 3 regions of interests (ROI); OML, DG and CA4. (Supplementary Data Fig. 4) Images were submitted to an auto-threshold and particle’s analyzed to get a percent area measurement of BG4 staining. These were graphed and linearly fit using Kaleidagraph using Pearson fit. Spearman and Pearson R and p-values are reported for 18 cases for age correlation and 18 cases for Braak correlation. An unpaired T-test with unequal variance was performed for the two groups E2/E3 and E3/E3 vs E3/E4 and E4/E4. When the singular African American case was removed from the APOE quantification, the t-probability remained highly significant at 0.0045 vs 0.002. All quantification was performed on 10X images obtained from an Olympus microscope.</p>

The CD measurement was taken from 300 nm to 210 nm at 1nm intervals using a 50 nm/min scanning speed. The sequence used was 5’- CGGGCGGCGGGGGGGCCCGGGCGGCGGGGGGGCCCGGGCG-3’ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.

<sec id="s3a">
<label>3.1</label><title>Formation of rG4s in aging</title>
<p>To determine if rG4s form in the human brain, we used the well-characterized single-chain BG4 anti-quadruplex antibody (Sigma-Aldrich MABE917, antibody null controls in Supplementary Data Fig. 2) to stain human hippocampal <italic>postmortem</italic> tissue of different ages under conditions that strongly favor cytoplasmic rG4 identification using triton-X fixation in cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. The tissues were obtained in collaboration with the brain bank at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). The study included 21 cases, male and female, of different ages and with or without a clinical or neuropathological diagnosis of AD (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). All cases had received a neuropathological examination including assessment of Braak and CERAD stages according to the updated NIA criteria except in those cases in which no pathology was noted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>First, the rG4 staining profiles were compared between different ages, with an age range of 30-92 years of age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). We discovered a significant age-related increase in rG4 immunostaining, with the densest staining observed in older individuals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). The largest difference in staining between young and older cases was observed in the outer molecular layer (OML) and in the hilar region, CA4 (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, legend arrows). The strongest overall staining for BG4 was found in the dentate gyrus granular cell layer (DG), but with less observable age-related increases. Staining density measurements confirmed these findings and demonstrated a highly significant increase in BG4 staining in the oldest cases studied within the OML (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) and the CA4 regions of cornu ammonis (Supplementary data Fig. 5a), confirming increased intracellular BG4 accumulation as a function of age. Plotting BG4 percent area versus age confirmed the observed findings and showed correlation (Spearman R= 0.49) with high significance (p= 0.038 in the OML region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Positive and significant Pearson but not Spearman correlations were observed between age and BG4 area in the CA4 region, Supplementary data Fig. 5a), and non-significant correlations were observed in the dentate granule cell layer. No significant correlation was found with BG4 stain and <italic>postmortem</italic> interval (PMI) (Spearman R = −0.18, p = 0.49 see Supplementary Data Fig. 6). In total, these data show that rG4s increased as a function of age in the human brain. We observed multiple outliers in both older and younger individuals due to Braak stage. For example, an 85-year-old individual with Braak stage 0, or 59-year-old individual with Braak stage 5.5 were outliers as a function of age. This led us to analyze whether rG4 formation increased with Braak stage, a measure of AD severity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<label>3.2</label><title>Formation of <italic>rG4</italic>s in AD</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether the formation of rG4s was associated with AD neuropathology. Braak staging is a neuropathological staging method that takes into account the density of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) both within each brain region and also from region to region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, with higher numerical values representing greater AD severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Like in the case of aging, increased BG4 staining was readily apparent in AD cases, especially in those cases associated with a higher Braak stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). In the OML, plotting BG4 percent area versus Braak stage demonstrated a strong correlation (Spearman R= 0.72) with highly significantly increased BG4 staining with higher Braak stages (p = 0.00086) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Positive significant correlations (R = 0.52, p = 0.028) between Braak stage severity and BG4 staining were also observed within the CA4 region (Supplementary data fig. 4). Interestingly, the OML region is highly involved in AD pathology, and is a hippocampal region where AD pathology is often observed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> suggesting that the presence of rG4s in this particular brain region might have significance for amyloid as well as NFT formation during the AD disease process. In addition, a prominent loss of synapses in AD is found in the OML, suggesting a potential close connection with layer 2 of the entorhinal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>If rG4 formation is more prevalent in AD than in non-AD cases and directly involved in AD pathology, we would also predict that rG4 formation would be more prevalent in APOE genotypes that are predisposed for higher LOAD risk, i.e. patients with one or two copies of the APOE4 genotype. Indeed, there was a significant (t-probability 0.002) increase in BG4 staining levels in the OML in <italic>postmortem</italic> cases with one or more APOE4 alleles compared to those with only APOE2 or APOE3 alleles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). This result, although correlative, is consistent with a previous study performed <italic>in vitro</italic> in which the RNA sequences found in aggregates in different APOE genotype cell lines were different<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Images obtained at high magnification using a confocal microscope (Olympus) showed that a large amount of the BG4 immunostaining was localized in the cytoplasm near the nucleus in a punctate pattern, reminiscent of known rG4 formation in vitro and in cell lines in rRNA ribosomal extensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We therefore also stained with an anti-rRNA antibody to determine whether this was the case in human tissue as well. As expected, the stains overlapped (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, Fig. S7), showing that at least a large percentage of the observed BG4 signal arose from rG4s and not nuclear DNA G4s. This result also confirms that previously observed rG4 formation in ribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> also occurs in human brain tissue.</p>

<p>To further explore the formation of rG4s in the human hippocampus, we examined the staining pattern in different cell types based on specific antibody markers. Co-staining with markers for the most common brain cell types, rG4s were clearly abundant in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). rG4s exhibited no apparent colocalization with microglia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). This pattern is especially noticeable in the double labeling with SOX10 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), which clearly shows the nuclear oligodendrocyte marker SOX10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> staining in proximity to the cytoplasmic BG4 immunostaining.</p>
<p>We co-stained BG4 with different p-tau epitope antibodies to determine whether pathological aggregation of tau proteins co-occurred with BG4 immunostaining (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Indeed, we found that BG4 immunostaining co-localized with hyper-phosphorylated tau immunostaining in neurons located in the CA1-4 regions of the hippocampus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We used two different antibodies directed against the serine 396 site (S396) and the threonine 231 (T231) to investigate co-localization with different p-Tau epitopes. Quantifying the percentage of cells co-stained with BG4 and pTau revealed that 85% of the S396 p-tau positive cells also had positive BG4 staining, and 82% of the T231 p-tau positive cells also had positive BG4 staining.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that rG4s form preferentially as a function of age and AD pathology in neurons and glial cells the human <italic>postmortem</italic> brain. While the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus exhibited the most BG4 immunostaining overall, this was not an area most changed with aging and AD, as considerably greater changes were observed in the OML and the CA4 region of the hippocampus. rG4s were primarily found in the cytoplasm near the nucleus of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and were also found in neurons that contained regions of positive staining against two different epitopes of p-tau. The BG4 staining levels were also impacted by APOE status, with the presence of one or two APOE4 alleles associated with higher BG4 levels in the OML region. The OML is an interesting region of the hippocampus from the pathology standpoint, since this is the region of the hippocampus exhibiting the most prominent synaptic loss early in the disease process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. We have recently demonstrated a significant loss of presynaptic components of the OML in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, strengthening the findings observed herein and suggesting a particular vulnerability of this region of the hippocampus to AD progressive pathology.</p>
<p>Combining these observations with those previously made on the reliance of rG4 structure on cellular stress and the roles of rG4s in protein oligomerization and tau aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we can propose a model of how rG4s form and could perpetuate the effects of AD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). As ROS and other protein stresses accumulate with age and according to APOE genotype, rG4s form. Although rG4s can rescue protein folding and could release proteins when unfolded at stress cessation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, under persistent stress proteins RNA would not be released from the G-quadruplexes, leading to increased protein oligomerization and aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This function has previously been suggested for RNA in biomolecular condensates more generally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The acceleration of protein oligomerization and aggregation by the rG4s could then contribute to a vicious cycle of increased aggregation, leading to synaptic loss as described recently for the OML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Recent in vitro work confirms an interaction between rG4 formation and p-Tau aggregation specifically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In vitro experiments focused on the specific mechanisms for the rG4 influence on Tau phosphorylation and/or aggregation will be a future focus following these preliminary observations. Of note, the previous studies showing that the fixation conditions used here strongly favor rG4 identification instead of DNA G4 identification were performed in cells, and so it is possible that in tissue some DNA staining could also occur, however this is not suggested by the co-stain with rRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
<p>Of note, the accumulation or rG4s in neurodegeneration could have roles in addition to those of protein aggregation. RNA transport dysregulation has also been a common factor identified in neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and it could be possible that the rG4 build-up observed here could be in part a product of this process or could lead to it. It has also been proposed that the RNA transport dysregulation and protein aggregation processes could be linked <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. This remains an area of needed future investigation.</p>
<p>This work raises the possibility of using rG4s as potential drug targets in AD, or given the high correlation with AD severity, as early AD biomarkers. Future work can focus on ameliorating AD symptoms through rG4 binding molecules or detecting brain-derived rG4s as disease biomarkers for diagnosis. Many different rG4-binding molecules have already been created and shown to bind in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and provide a set of promising lead compounds for potential AD treatment.</p>
<p>Although here we have examined only AD, there are many other aging-related diseases featuring protein aggregation, including Parkinson’s Disease, ALS, Fragile X syndrome, and Huntington’s Disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Notably, all of these diseases now have significant evidence showing rG4s as interactors with the aggregating proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, and in the case of Fragile X, a recent study demonstrated that rG4s could contribute to its aggregation and neurotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. In addition, a recent manuscript by Raguseo et al., showed an increased prevalence of G4-structures in C9orf72 mutant human motor neurons in ALS/FTD when compared to healthy motor neurons, and direct involvement of the rG4 complex in the aggregation process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. These recent findings illustrate the need to explore rG4 complexes and their role in neurodegeneration further. The results here combined with these previous studies suggest that the formation of rG4s could be a common mechanism of neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>This is an interesting manuscript where the authors systematically measure rG4 levels in brain samples at different ages of patients affected by AD. To the best of my knowledge this is the first time that BG4 staining is used in this context and the authors provide compelling evidence to show an association with BG4 staining and age or AD progression, which interestingly indicates that such RNA structure might play a role in regulating protein homeostasis as previously speculated. The methods used and the results reported seems robust and reproducible. There were two main things that needed addressing:</p>
<p>(1) Usually in BG4 staining experiments to ensure that the signal detected is genuinely due to rG4 an RNase treatment experiment is performed. This does not have to be extended to all the samples presented but having a couple of controls where the authors observe loss of staining upon RNase treatment will be key to ensure with confidence that rG4s are detected under the experimental conditions. This is particularly relevant for this brain tissue samples where BG4 staining has never been performed before.</p>
<p>(2) The authors have an association between rG4-formation and age/disease progression. They also observe distribution dependency of this, which is great. However, this is still an association which does not allow the model to be supported. This is not something that can be fixed with an easy experiment and it is what it is, but my point is that the narrative of the manuscript should be more fair and reflect the fact that, although interesting, what the authors are observing is a simple correlation. They should still go ahead and propose a model for it, but they should be more balanced in the conclusion and do not imply that this evidence is sufficient to demonstrate the proposed model. It is absolutely fine to refer to the literature and comment on the fact that similar observations have been reported and this is in line with those, but still this is not an ultimate demonstration.</p>

<p>RNA guanine-rich G-quadruplexes (rG4s) are non-canonical higher order nucleic acid structures that can form under physiological conditions. Interestingly, cellular stress is positively correlated with rG4 induction.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors examined human hippocampal postmortem tissue for the formation ofrG4s in aging and Alzheimer Disease (AD). rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in the hippocampus with both age and with AD severity. 21 cases were used in this study (age range 30-92).</p>
<p>This immunostaining co-localized with hyper-phosphorylated tau immunostaining in neurons. The BG4 staining levels were also impacted by APOE status. rG4 structure was previously found to drive tau aggregation. Based on these observations, the authors propose a model of neurodegeneration in which chronic rG4 formation drives proteostasis collapse.</p>
<p>This model is interesting, and would explain different observations (e.g., RNA is present in AD aggregates and rG4s can enhance protein oligomerization and tau aggregation).</p>
<p>Main issue from the previous round of review:</p>
<p>There is indeed a positive correlation between Braak stage severity and BG4 staining, but this correlation is relatively weak and borderline significant ((R = 0.52, p value = 0.028). This is probably the main limitation of this study, which should be clearly acknowledged (together with a reminder that &quot;correlation is not causality&quot;). Related to this, here is no clear justification to exclude the four individuals in Fig 1d (without them R increases to 0.78). Please remove this statement. On the other hand, the difference based on APOE status is more striking.</p>
<p>Comments on current version:</p>
<p>The authors have made laudable efforts to address the criticisms I made in my evaluation of the original manuscript.</p>

<p>This is an interesting manuscript where the authors systematically measure rG4 levels in brain samples at different ages of patients affected by AD. To the best of my knowledge this is the first time that BG4 staining is used in this context and the authors provide compelling evidence to show an association with BG4 staining and age or AD progression, which interestingly indicates that such RNA structure might play a role in regulating protein homeostasis as previously speculated. The methods used and the results reported seem robust and reproducible.</p>
<p>In terms of the conclusions, however, I think that there are 2 main things that need addressing prior to publication:</p>
<p>(1) Usually in BG4 staining experiments to ensure that the signal detected is genuinely due to rG4 an RNase treatment experiment is performed. This does not have to be extended to all the samples presented but having a couple of controls where the authors observe loss of staining upon RNase treatment will be key to ensure with confidence that rG4s are detected under the experimental conditions. This is particularly relevant for this brain tissue samples where BG4 staining has never been performed before.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With what is now known about RNA rG4s and the recent reconciliation of the controversy on rG4 formation (Kharel, Nature Communications 2023), this experiment is no longer strictly required for demonstration of rG4 formation. Despite this change, we did attempt this experiment at the reviewer’s suggestion, but the controls were not successful, suggesting it may not be feasible with our fixing and staining conditions. That said, we agree that despite the G4 staining appearing primarily outside the nucleus, it would be helpful to have some direct indication of whether we were observing primarily RNA or DNA G4s, and so we performed an alternate experiment to determine this.</p>
<p>In our previous submission, we had performed ribosomal RNA staining  (Figure S7), and the staining patterns were similar to that of BG4, especially the punctate pattern near the nuclei. Therefore, we directly asked whether the BG4 was largely binding to rRNA and have now shown the resulting co-stain in Figure 3b. These results show that at least a large amount of the BG4 staining does arise from rG4s in ribosomes. At high magnification, we observe that the BG4 stains a subset of the ribosomes, consistent with previous observations of high rG4 levels in ribosomes both in vitro and in cells (Mestre-Fos, 2019 J Mol Biol, Mestre-Fos 2019 PLoS One, Mestre-Fos 2020 J Biol Chem), but this had never been demonstrated in tissue. This experiment has therefore both answered the primary question of whether we are primarily observing rG4s, as well as provided more detailed information on the cellular sublocalization of rG4 formation, and provided the first evidence of rG4 formation on ribosomes in tissue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors have an association between rG4-formation and age/disease progression. They also observe distribution dependency of this, which is great.

<p>We agree that these are correlative studies (of necessity when studying human tissue), but recent experiments have shown that rG4s affect the aggregation of Tau in vitro – and we have now better clarified this in the text itself. We have now also been more careful in drawing causative conclusions as shown in the revised text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor point:</p>
<p>(3) rG4s themselves have been shown to generate aggregates in ALS models in the absence of any protein (Ragueso et al. Nat Commun 2023). I think this is also important in the light of my comment on the model, could well be that these rG4s are causing aggregates themselves that act as nucleation point for the proteins as reported in the paper I mentioned. Providing a broader and more unbiased view of the current literature on the topic would be fair, rather than focusing on reports more in line with the model proposed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have modified the discussion and added a broader context, including the Ragueso report described above.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Significance):</bold></p>
<p>This is a significant novel study, as per my comments above. I believe that such a study will be of impact in the G4 and neurodegenerative fields. Providing that the authors can address the criticisms above, I strongly believe that this manuscript would be of value to the scientific community. The main strength is the novelty of the study (never done before) the main weakness is the lack of the RNase control at the moment and the slightly over interpretation of the findings (see comments above).</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p>
<p>RNA guanine-rich G-quadruplexes (rG4s) are non-canonical higher order nucleic acid structures that can form under physiological conditions. Interestingly, cellular stress is positively correlated with rG4 induction.  In this study, the authors examined human hippocampal postmortem tissue for the formation ofrG4s in aging and Alzheimer Disease (AD). rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in the hippocampus with both age and with AD severity. 21 cases were used in this study (age range 30-92).  This immunostaining co-localized with hyper-phosphorylated tau immunostaining in neurons. The BG4 staining levels were also impacted by APOE status. rG4 structure was previously found to drive tau aggregation. Based on these observations, the authors propose a model of neurodegeneration in which chronic rG4 formation drives proteostasis collapse.</p>
<p>This model is interesting, and would explain different observations (e.g., RNA is present in AD aggregates and rG4s can enhance protein oligomerization and tau aggregation).</p>
<p>Main issue:</p>
<p>There is indeed a positive correlation between Braak stage severity and BG4 staining, but this correlation is relatively weak and borderline significant ((R = 0.52, p value = 0.028). This is probably the main limitation of this study, which should be clearly acknowledged (together with a reminder that &quot;correlation is not causality”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that we had not explained this clearly enough in the text (based on the reviewer’s comment), as the correlation mentioned by the Reviewer was for the CA4 region only, and not the OML, which was substantially more correlated and statistically significant (Spearman R= 0.72, p = 0.00086). As a result, we believe this was a miscommunication that is rectified by the revised text:</p>
<p>“In the OML, plotting BG4 percent area versus Braak stage demonstrated a strong correlation (Spearman R= 0.72) with highly significantly increased BG4 staining with higher Braak stages (p = 0.00086) (Fig. 2b).”</p>

<p>Related to this, here is no clear justification to exclude the four individuals in Fig 1d (without them R increases to 0.78). Please remove this statement. On the other hand, the difference based on APOE status is more striking.</p>

<p>We did not mean to imply that deleting these outliers was correct, but merely were demonstrating that they were in fact outliers. To avoid this misinterpretation, we have now deleted the sentence in the Figure 1d caption mentioning the outliers.</p>

<p>Minor suggestions</p>
<p>- &quot;BG4 immunostaining was in many cases localized in the cytoplasm near the nucleus in a punctate pattern&quot;. Define &quot;many&quot;</p>

<p>The CD spectrum in Sup Fig 1 is the sequence that had previously been shown to aid in tau aggregation seeding, but had not been suspected by those authors to be a quadruplex. So we tested that here and showed it is a quadruplex, as described at the end of the introduction. We have added wording to the figure legend to clarify where its corresponding description in the main text can be found. We have also checked and corrected the wavelength and units.</p>

<p>Provide a link between Alzheimer disease and RNA G-quadruplexes.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p>
<p>This study investigated the formation of RNA G quadruplexes (rG4) in aging and AD in human hippocampal postmortem tissue. The rG4 immunostaining in the hippocampus increases strongly with age and with the severity of AD. Furthermore, rG4 is present in neurons with an accumulation of phosphorylated tau immunostaining.</p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>(1) The method used in this study is primarily immunostaining of BG4, and the results cannot be considered correct without additional data from more multifaceted analyses (biochemical analysis, RNA expression analysis, etc.).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the Reviewer’s assessment of the value of these experiments. The most relevant biochemical experiments at the cellular and molecular level showing the role of G4s in aggregation in general and Tau in particular have been done and are referenced in the text. The results here stand on their own and are highly novel and significant, as evaluated by both of the other reviewers. There has been no previous work demonstrating the presence of rG4s in human brain – either in controls or in patients with AD. AD is a complex condition that only occurs spontaneously in the human brain and no other species; because of this complexity, novel aspects are best first studied in human brain tissue using the methods employed here.</p>

<p>(2) Overall, the quality of the stained images is poor, and detailed quantitative analysis using further high quality data is essential to conclude the authors' conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have again looked at our images and they are not poor quality -they are confocal images taken at recommended resolution of the confocal microscope. It is possible the poor quality came from pdf compression by the manuscript submission portal, which is beyond our control as they were uploaded at high resolution. These data were quantified by scientists who were blinded to the diagnosis of each case. The level of description on the detailed quantification is higher than we have observed in similar studies. We therefore disagree with the reviewer’s conclusion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Significance):</bold></p>
<p>Overall, this study is not a deeply analyzed study. In addition, the authors of this study need further understanding regarding G4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is also unclear why the reviewer believes that we do not have sufficient understanding of G4s, and would request that the reviewer instead provides specific comments regarding what is lacking in terms of knowledge on G4s, as we respectfully disagree with this judgement of our knowledge-base (see other G4 papers from the Horowitz lab, Begeman, 2020, Litberg 2023, Son, 2023 referenced below).</p>
