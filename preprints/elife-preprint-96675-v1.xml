<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Protein aggregates are spatially organized and regulated in cells to prevent deleterious effects of proteostatic stress. Misfolding of proteins in the ER result in aggregate formation, but how the aggregates are processed especially during cell division is not well understood. Here, we induced proteostatic stress and protein aggregation using a proteostasis reporter, which is prone to misfolding and aggregation in the ER. Unexpectedly, we detected solid-like protein aggregates deposited mainly in the nucleus and surrounded by the ER membrane. The membrane-bound aggregates were then cleared as cells progressed through mitosis and cytokinesis. Aggregate clearance was depended on Hsp70 family chaperones in the ER, particularly BiP, and proteasomal activity. The clearance culminates at mitotic exit and required cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) inactivation but was independent of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C). Thus, dividing cells have the capacity to clear protein aggregates to maintain proteostasis in the newly divided cells, which could have implications for human disease development and aging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nascent polypeptides fold into three-dimensional structures to perform their biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>). Misfolded proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues exposed and result in aggregation of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>). Intramolecular beta-sheets in some proteins are also structural elements prone for protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tyedmers et al., 2010</xref>). Protein misfolding and aggregation not only disrupt the native function of the protein but also could interfere other proteins’ functions by co-aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Olzscha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Woerner et al., 2016</xref>). This challenges proteome homeostasis (proteostasis) and causes proteostatic stress in cells, which is a main driver of cellular aging and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Cells evolve several protein quality control (PQC) systems to maintain their proteostasis in which components of PQC systems facilitate refolding, degradation, and spatial deposition of misfolded protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jayaraj et al., 2020</xref>). Molecular chaperones are key players in the PQC system. They are involved to fold nascent polypeptides, target misfolded proteins for degradation by ubiquitin-proteasome system or autophagy, and promote solubilisation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tyedmers et al., 2010</xref>). Eukaryotic cells confine misfolded proteins and smaller aggregates into distinct cellular deposition sites, which reduce the reactivity of these harmful species to the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>). These deposition sites include aggresomes or aggresome-like induced structures locating near centrosomes, INQ (intranuclear quality control compartment) residing in the nucleus, cytosolic CytoQ, and the perivacuolar IPOD (insoluble protein deposit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>). Confinement of protein aggregates in a deposition site facilitates retention of aggregates in short-lived cells (mother cells) during asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fuentealba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Rujano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Singhvi and Garriga, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) processes one-third of cellular proteome and possesses stronger ability to maintain aggregation-prone proteins in a non-toxic state than the cytosol owing to its specific molecular chaperone environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Vincenz-Donnelly et al., 2018</xref>). Chaperones in the ER such as HSPA5/BiP regulates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which blocks instant protein synthesis and activates transcription of genes involved in PQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Preissler and Ron, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wiseman et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the proteostatic stress in the ER triggers ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and ER-phagy to remove misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mochida and Nakatogawa, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Olzmann et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the high capacity of proteostatic stress response in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rousseau et al., 2004</xref>; Vincenz- Donnelly et al., 2018), excessive misfolded proteins still lead to formation of protein aggregates in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Melo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Miyata et al., 2020</xref>). In response to protein aggregation in the ER, BiP functions as a disaggregase to promote solubilization of these aggregates. In cells undergoing asymmetric cell division such as in the budding yeast, the ER diffusion barrier and the ER stress surveillance (ERSU) pathway ensure ER protein aggregates are retained preferentially in the short- lived mother cells during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Clay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Pina and Niwa, 2015</xref>). How ER protein aggregates are regulated in dividing cells, especially those that do not undergo asymmetric cell division, is less well studied. We addressed the fate of ER protein aggregates in human cells undergoing cell division symmetrically and identified a clearance mechanism of protein aggregates when cells are exiting mitosis.</p>

<title>Targeting a proteostasis reporter to the ER results in protein aggregate formation in the nucleus</title>
<p>To investigate how cells maintain their proteostasis during cell division, we employed a proteostasis reporter consists of a firefly luciferase mutant prone for protein mis-folding and protein aggregation fused to a green fluorescent protein (FlucDM-eGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>). Next, we targeted the reporter to the ER by fusing a ER-targeting sequence at its N-terminus (ER-FlucDM-eGFP). Interestingly, we found that ER-FlucDM-eGFP assembled into visible protein aggregates in the nucleus when stably expressed in mammary epithelial MCF10A cells in the absence of any perturbation of the proteome stability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The protein aggregates were below detection limit of our microscopy in first 2 days after lentivirus transduction, but progressively accumulated in cells and stabilized in the population several days after lentivirus transduction. This contrasted with a previous study in which the ER-FlucDM-eGFP was transiently expressed in cells and hence did not allow long term tracking of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>). Luciferase activity measurement showed that ER-FlucDM-eGFP has significantly reduced enzymatic activity and was not functional possibly due to mis-folding and protein aggregation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, we observed the colocalization of ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates and thioflavin T (ThT), a universal dye to detect amyloid fibril, further supporting these aggregates were misfolded protein aggregates (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). Thus, expression of ER-FlucDM-eGFP results in proteostatic stress and allows us to study how protein aggregates are regulated in human cells.</p>

<p>Formation of protein aggregates in the nucleus by ER-FlucDM-eGFP was not limited to MCF10A cells. The protein aggregates were also detected in the nucleus when ER-FlucDM-eGFP was expressed in other cell lines such as A549, MDA-MB-231 and U2OS cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and S1A). Similar observations were found when the reporter was fused to the red fluorescent protein mCherry or when a different N-terminal signal peptide sequence was used. In addition, when ER-FlucDM was replaced by ER-HaloDM, which is a modified haloalkane dehalogenase prone to mis-folding and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Melo et al., 2022</xref>), we observed similar protein aggregates in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and S1C). However, only very low number of cells formed aggregates in the nucleus when intact GFP was targeted to the ER (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>). Thus, ER-FlucDM-eGFP formed protein aggregates in the nucleus independent of cell line, fluorescent protein types, specific ER targeting sequence and FlucDM.</p>
<p>Despite localizing in the nucleus, we found that the protein aggregates were surrounded by the ER membrane as stained by the ER-tracker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To further confirm this, we sectioned the cells and used electron microscopy to observe the protein aggregates. We found that the aggregates were surrounded by a single layer membrane closed to the inner membrane of the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, the aggregates are intra-nuclear membranous structure surrounded by the ER membrane.</p>

<title><bold>Differential and slow turnover of protein aggregates in cells at interphase and mitosis</bold></title>
<p>Pathological proteins aggregates such as Z-α1-antitrypsin accumulated in the ER exhibited minimal turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dickens et al., 2016</xref>). To test whether ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates has a reduced dynamics as well, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in cells expressing both ER-FlucDM-eGFP and ER-FlucDM-mCherry. The ER-FlucDM-eGFP signal served as a tracker for the location of aggregates and the ER-FlucDM-mCherry was used to probe the aggregate dynamics. We photobleached ER-FlucDM-mCherry with 561 nm laser while ensuring ER- FlucDM-eGFP signal was not affected. In interphase cells, ER-FlucDM-mCherry aggregates intensity barely recovered after 4.5 min post-bleaching, indicating that ER-FlucDM-mCherry aggregates possessed minimal turnover similar to that of in other protein aggregates such as Z-α1- antitrypsin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, ER-HaloDM-eGFP aggregates in the nucleus also displayed low recovery after photobleaching (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). When ER-FlucDM-mCherry aggregates were photobleached in mitotic cells, the recovery of intensity was also much lesser than the ER-FlucDM- mCherry signal present in the ER network (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). However, ER-FlucDM-mCherry aggregates in mitotic cells showed a higher recovery than that of in interphase cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; aggregates of interphase cells recovered from 0.131 ± 0.093 to 0.157 ± 0.095; aggregates of mitotic cells recovered from 0.196 ± 0.137 to 0.356 ± 0.151).</p>

</fig>
<p>Consistently, the single-cell analysis revealed that in mitotic cells, there was an increase of the recovery intensity of ER-FlucDM-mCherry in late time-point as compared to that of in early time- points after photobleaching. The increased recovery intensity was not observed in ER-FlucDM- mCherry aggregates of interphase cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). Taken together, ER-FlucDM-mCherry aggregates in the nucleus have low turnover and the aggregate displays increased turnover in mitotic cells.</p>

<title>Protein aggregates are cleared during cell division</title>
<p>Since aggregates displayed some levels of turnover during mitosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, 2C and 2D), we next investigated the aggregate behaviour throughout cell division. To this end, we labelled cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP with SiR-Tubulin to distinguish cells at various stages based on the microtubule organization. We categorized cells into interphase and prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase and early G1 cells based on their microtubule structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we analyzed the number and area of aggregates in cells of each category. Interestingly, we observed that the number and area of aggregates in telophase and early G1 cells were significantly lower than in interphase cells, suggesting that aggregates are cleared gradually when cells progress through mitosis and cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="579754v2_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To test whether this was the case, we employed time-lapse imaging to profile aggregates in cells undergoing division. To increase the number of dividing cells during imaging, we synchronized cells at G2/M and released them into mitosis prior to imaging. We observed that upon entry into mitosis, the ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates were released from the nucleus during nuclear envelope breakdown and gradually decreased in numbers as cells progress through mitosis and cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and Video 1). In majority of early divided G1 cells, there was essentially no detectable aggregates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, the aggregates released from the nucleus during mitosis were still surrounded by the ER membrane as indicated by the ER-tracker (Figures S3A and S3B). The decrease of aggregates appears to happen specifically in dividing cells as the number and area of aggregates remained largely unchanged in interphase cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Furthermore, aggregates formed in cells expressing ER-HaloDM-eGFP decreased in numbers when cells progress through mitosis and cytokinesis (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref> and Video 2), suggesting that the clearance of protein aggregates during cell division was not specific to ER-FlucDM-eGFP.</p>

<title>Effects of ER stress inducers on aggregate clearance in mitotic cells</title>
<p>Expression of ER-FlucDM-eGFP results in proteostatic stress in cells. Consistently, we observed that gene expression for chaperones and co-chaperones in the ER were upregulated in these cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating cells involved ER proteostasis control during adaptation. We speculated that acute perturbation to ER homeostasis could exacerbate the proteostatic stress in dividing cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP and affect aggregate clearance during mitosis. To test if this was the case, synchronized cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP were released into mitosis in the presence of either DMSO (control) or 1 μM thapsigargin (Thaps), which blocks the ER calcium ion pump and causes ER stress. In cells at prometaphase and metaphase (35 min after release), DMSO and Thaps treatments showed comparable number and area of aggregates in cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). However, in cells at the late stage of cell division (65 min after release), there were significantly higher number of aggregates retained in the cytosol of Thaps-treated cells than DMSO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Consistently, time-lapse microscopy revealed that ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates retained in the cytosol after cytokinesis in Thaps-treated cells, whereas the aggregates were largely cleared in control cells completing cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D</xref>, 4E, S4A and Video 4). Thus, acute treatment of ER stress inducer Thaps in dividing cells prevents clearance of ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates.</p>

<p>A previous study showed that cells with protein aggregates treated for hours with Thaps or Tunicamycin (Tuni), which inhibits protein glycosylation in the ER, promotes aggregate clearance in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Melo et al., 2022</xref>). To test if prolonged treatment of cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP with Tuni could promote aggregate clearance, we pretreated cells blocked at G2/M with varying concentrations of Tuni for 3 hours and released cells into mitosis. Interestingly, prolonged pretreatment of Tuni prior to mitosis promoted aggregate clearance in dividing cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). Thus, acute treatment of cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP with ER stress inducers prevents aggregate clearance in dividing cells while prolonged treatment with ER stress inducers promotes aggregate clearance.</p>

<title>Hsp70 family protein BiP is required for aggregate clearance during cell division</title>
<p>Since we observed that the expression of a chaperone Hsp70 (HSPA5/BiP) was upregulated in cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and Hsp70 is involved in elimination of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Melo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Nillegoda et al., 2015</xref>), we next tested whether the clearance of ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates in dividing cells was mediated by Hsp70 family proteins.

<p>HSPA5/BiP is a major Hsp70 family member in regulating ER proteostasis. We next tested whether inhibition of BiP function could affect clearance of aggregates in dividing cells. Similar to VER treatment, inhibition of BiP’s ATPase activity by YUM-70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Samanta et al., 2021</xref>) led to a dose- dependent accumulation of ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates in cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Moreover, by using immunofluorescence staining, we found a strong colocalization of BiP and ER-FlucDM- eGFP, consistent with a role of BiP in regulating ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates (Figures S5A and S5B). Collectively, our data demonstrated that the clearance of ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates was regulated by the HSP70 family proteins, particularly BiP.</p>

<title>Aggregate clearance is a mitotic exit event but is independent of the anaphase promoting complex (APC/C)</title>
<p>Protein aggregates are subjected to proteasomal degradation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tyedmers et al., 2010</xref>). To test if aggregate clearance during cell division involves proteasomes, we inhibited the proteasome activity with MG132 in dividing cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP. After treating cells released from the G2/M boundary with low or high concentrations of MG132 for 55 minutes, majority of mitotic cells were arrested at metaphase and accumulated high number of aggregates as compared to control cells treated with DMSO (Figures S6A and S6B). Next, we inhibited the proteasome with MG132 in cells at late anaphase or telophase and examined the aggregates 35 minutes after MG132 treatment (Figures S6C and S6F). In cells completing cytokinesis, there were significantly high number of aggregates in the early divided cells treated with MG132 versus the control (Figures S6D, 6E, S6G and S6H) Since protein aggregates are cleared when cells progress through mitosis and cytokinesis, which are the cell cycle stage with low Cyclin B/CDK1 activity, we speculated that inactivation of CDK1 activity in MG132-treated and metaphase-arrested cells could lead to clearance of ER-FlucDM- eGFP aggregates in the cytosol. To test if this was the case, we released cells into mitosis in the presence of MG132 for 55 minutes and treated metaphase-arrested cells with RO-3306 to inhibit Cdk1 activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates were cleared in cells treated with RO-3306 while the aggregates were retained in cells treated with DMSO (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B</xref> and S6I). Consistently, live cell imaging demonstrated similar accelerated clearance in Cdk1 inhibited cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Thus, clearance of the aggregates happens when cells exit from mitosis.</p>

<p>We established that clearance of aggregates during cell division requires proteasomes and CDK inactivation, it is possible that the anaphase promoting complex (APC/C), which is a E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Watson et al., 2019</xref>), is involved in clearing the aggregates. To test if this was the case, we inhibited APC/C activity using a cocktail of APC/C inhibitors (APC/Ci) consists of Apcin and ProTAME in dividing cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sackton et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, inhibition of APC/C did not affect aggregate clearance as APC/Ci-treated cells that have arrested at metaphase have comparable number of aggregates as in control DMSO-treated cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). When cells at late anaphase or telophase were treated with APC/Ci, the newly divided cells have similar number of aggregates as in control cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6G</xref>, 6H and 6I). Lastly, we verified the efficacy of APC/C inhibition using cells expressing the APC/C reporter derived from Geminin (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6J</xref>). Consistently, APC/Ci treatment has prevented the removal of APC/C reporter in newly divided cells indicating that the APC/C was inhibited by the dosage of APC/Ci used in our experiments (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6K</xref>). Taken together, our data showed that clearance of ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates happens when cells exit from mitosis, is proteasome dependent but does not involve APC/C.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We showed that stably expression of ER-FlucDM-eGFP leads to proteostatic stress and formation of protein aggregates in human cells without the use of additional proteostatic stressors. This fluorescent based live-cell imaging reporter enables us to study how protein aggregates are regulated in dividing cells, which are sensitive to genetic or environmental perturbations. Conventional methods that use proteasomal inhibitors to cause proteome imbalance are not ideal to investigate proteostasis in dividing cells given an essential role of protesomes in driving mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ghislain et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Glotzer et al., 1991</xref>). Additionally, methods such as heat shock also perturb mitotic progression, especially in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kakihana et al., 2019</xref>). By using ER-FlucDM-eGFP that does not perturb cell cycle progression, we reveal an unexpected process of clearing protein aggregates in cells progressing through mitosis and cytokinesis.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that the proteome of mitotic cells have higher structural stability and less aggregation prone compared to that of in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Becher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wirth et al., 2013</xref>). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation of mitotic proteins are suggested to be responsible for the protein stability during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Becher et al., 2018</xref>). The aggregate clearance we identified in this study could represent an active mechanism that increases proteome stability in dividing cells. We found that aggregate clearance requires Cdk1 inactivation, which is a hallmark of mitotic exit, however, does not involve APC/C that is important in driving mitotic exit through protein degradation. It is possible that APC/C targets mostly cytosolic proteins whereas ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates are confined in a membrane during mitosis. Furthermore, the clearance of protein aggregates coincides with ER reorganization that happens throughout mitosis and cytokinesis, which may contribute to the aggregate clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bergman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schlaitz et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Misfolded or damaged proteins form protein aggregates and are spatially organized into specific subcellular sites to sequester them from other cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hill et al., 2017</xref>). These aggregate deposition sites are localized in the cytosol or in the nucleus to confine misfolded proteins and aggregates for elimination from cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, we identified confinement of ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates in the nucleus and are surrounded by a single layer membrane. These intranuclear membranous structures contain ER membranes and BiP, which is a key Hsp70 family chaperone in the ER and translocates into the nucleus under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). How protein aggregates are targeted and assembled into the intranuclear membranous structure awaits future investigation. Interestingly, upon entry into mitosis, concomitant with the nuclear membrane breakdown, the membranous structure is released from the nucleus and the aggregates are cleared when cells progress though mitosis till early G1 phase of the daughter cells. The confinement and clearance of protein aggregates during cell division presumably protect dividing cells from harmful effects of protein misfolding and aggregation and to ensure reliable inheritance of genetic materials. It has been reported that aggregates are asymmetrically retained in one of the daughter cells that are usually short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Rujano et al., 2006</xref>). The aggregate clearance mechanism we report here may provide an additional cellular defense strategy to overcome proteostatic stress and to maintain proteome integrity during cell division.</p>
<p>Hsp70 chaperones regulate proteostasis by preventing protein aggregation, promoting disaggregation and subjecting solubilized aggregates to degradation or refolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Rosenzweig et al., 2019</xref>). A recent study showed that BiP solubilizes aggregates and drives aggregate clearance in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Melo et al., 2022</xref>). Our study of mitotic aggregate clearance in dividing cells further extend the role of BiP in disaggregation. Consistently, we found that Cdk1 inactivation in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor could still lead to aggregate clearance, suggesting a partial role of the proteosome in clearing aggregates and the disaggregation breaks down the aggregates into smaller and possibly soluble species. Interestingly, Melo et al. showed that aggregate clearance is promoted by treating cells with ER stressors as the treatment triggers UPR, which in turn leads to higher activity of BiP to cope with the ER stress. We observed differential responses of aggregate clearance to ER stressors depending on the duration of the treatments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). It is possible that acute treatment of the ER stressor on dividing cells does not provide sufficient time for cells to accumulate abundant amount of BiP given that mitotic cells are not very transcriptionally active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Palozola et al., 2017</xref>). Also, degradation of BiP could be accelerated upon the treatment of ER stressors, which in turn undermines the abundance of BiP in disaggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shim et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, short term treatment of the ER stressor in cells exacerbates the ER stress and affects aggregate clearance during cell division, whereas longer treatment of the ER stressor promotes aggregate clearance. Mechanistic understanding of aggregate clearance during cell division could offer new insights to understand disaggregation in proteostasis control.</p>

<p>Fiji was used to process images. All Z-stack images for quantification were first projected using max- intensity projection (Fiji/image/stacks/Z project). To quantify aggregates, projected images were classified by Trainable Weka Segmentation (Fiji/Plugins/Segmentation/Trainable Weka Segmentation). The segmented images were processed by using the ImageJ Macro commands: run(“8-bit”); setOption(“BlackBackground”, true); run(“Convert to Mask”); run(“Watershed”) before using Analyze Particles (Fiji/Analyze/Analyze Particles). For time-lapse images except images from FRAP, the segmented images were processed by using the ImageJ Macro commands: run(“8-bit”); setThreshold(0, 120); run(“Make Binary”, “method=Default background=Light black”); run(“Invert LUT”); run(“Watershed”, “stack”) before using Analyze Particles (Fiji/Analyze/Analyze Particles).</p>
<p>For FRAP analysis of ER-eGFP and ER-HaloDM-eGFP, region-of-interests (ROI) in projected images were manually selected and the average fluorescence intensity of ROIs was measured in Fiji. For FRAP analysis of aggregates in cells co-expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP and ER-FlucDM- mCherry (both interphase and mitosis), the aggregates were first segmented by Weka Segmentation. The unsegmented images from the mCherry channel were processed by Analyze Particles (Fiji/Analyze/Analyze Particles) based on the corresponding segmented images from the GFP channel. For fluorescence intensity quantification, background in all FRAP experiments were subtracted by one hundreds.</p>

<p>How misfolded proteins are segregated and cleared is a significant question in mechanistic cell biology, since clearance of these aggregates can protect against pathologies that may otherwise arise. The authors discover a cell cycle stage-dependent clearing mechanism that involves the ER chaperone BiP, the proteosome, and CDK inactivation, but is curiously independent of the APC. These are <bold>valuable</bold> and interesting new observations, but the evidence supporting these claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>, and needs to be strengthened and further validated.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript utilizes a previously reported misfolding-prone reporter to assess its behaviour in ER in different cell line models. They make two interesting observations:</p>
<p>(1) Upon prolonged incubation, the reporter accumulates in nuclear aggregates.</p>
<p>(2) The aggregates are cleared during mitosis. They further provide some insight into the role of chaperones and ER stressors in aggregate clearance. These observations provide a starting point for addressing the role of mitosis in aggregate clearance. Needless to say, going ahead understanding the impact of aggregate clearance on cell division will be equally important.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study almost entirely relies on an imaging approach to address the issue of aggregate clearance. A complementary biochemical approach would be more insightful. The intriguing observations pertaining to aggregates in the nucleus and their clearance during mitosis lack mechanistic understanding. The issue pertaining to the functional relevance of aggregation clearance or its lack thereof has not been addressed. Experiments addressing these issues would be a terrific addition to this manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors provide an interesting observation that ER-targeted excess misfolded proteins localize to the nucleus within membrane-entrapped vesicles for further quality control during cell division. This is useful information indicating transient nuclear compartmentalization as a quality control strategy for misfolded ER proteins in mitotic cells, although endogenous substrates of this pathway are yet to be identified.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This microscopy-based study reports unique membrane-based compartments of ER-targeted misfolded proteins within the nucleus. Quarantining aggregating proteins in membrane-less compartments is a widely accepted protein quality control mechanism. This work highlights the importance of membrane-bound quarantining strategies for aggregating proteins. These observations open up multiple questions on proteostasis biology. How do these membrane-bound bodies enter the nucleus? How are the single-layer membranes formed? How exactly are these membrane-bound aggregates degraded? Are similar membrane-bound nuclear deposits present in post-mitotic cells that are relevant in age-related proteostasis diseases? Etc. Thus, the observations reported here are potentially interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study, like many other studies, used a set of model misfolding-prone proteins to uncover the interesting nuclear-compartment-based quality control of ER proteins. The endogenous ER-proteins that reach a similar stage of overdose of misfolding during ER stress remain unknown.</p>
<p>The mechanism of disaggregation of membrane-trapped misfolded proteins is unclear. Do these come out of the membrane traps? The authors report a few vesicles in living cells. This may suggest that membrane-untrapped proteins are disaggregated while trapped proteins remain aggregates within membranes.</p>
<p>The authors figure out the involvement of proteasome and Hsp70 during the disaggregation process. However, the detailed mechanisms including the ubiquitin ligases are not identified. Also, is the protein ubiquitinated at this stage?</p>
<p>This paper suffers from a lack of cellular biochemistry. Western blots confirming the solubility and insolubility of the misfolded proteins are required. This will also help to calculate the specific activity of luciferase more accurately than estimating the fluorescence intensities of soluble and aggregated/compartmentalized proteins. Microscopy suggested the dissolution of the membrane-based compartments and probably disaggregation of the protein. This data should be substantiated using Western blots. Degradation can only be confirmed by Western blots. The authors should try time course experiments to correlate with microscopy data. Cycloheximide chase experiments will be useful.</p>
<p>The cell models express the ER-targeted misfolded proteins constitutively that may already reprogram the proteostasis. The authors may try one experiment with inducible overexpression.</p>
<p>It is clear that a saturating dose of ER-targeted misfolded proteins activates the pathway. The authors performed a few RT-PCR experiments to indicate the proteostasis-sensitivity. Proteome-based experiments will be better to substantiate proteostasis saturation.</p>
<p>The authors should immunostain the nuclear compartments for other ER-membrane resident proteins that span either the bilayer or a single layer. The data may be discussed.</p>
<p>All microscopy figures should include control cells with similarly aggregating proteins or without aggregates as appropriate. For example, is the nuclear-targeted FlucDM-EGFP similarly entrapped? A control experiment will be interesting. Expression of control proteins should be estimated by western blots.</p>
<p>There are few more points that may be out of the scope of the manuscript. For example, how do these compartments enter the nucleus? Whether similar entry mechanisms/events are ever reported? What do the authors speculate? Also, the bilayer membrane becomes a single layer. This is potentially interesting and should be discussed with probable mechanisms. Also, do these nuclear compartments interfere with transcription and thereby deregulate cell division? What about post-mitotic cells? Similar deposits may be potentially toxic in the absence of cell division. All these may be discussed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper describes a new mechanism of clearance of protein aggregates occurring during mitosis.</p>
<p>The authors have observed that animal cells can clear misfolded aggregated proteins at the end of mitosis. The images and data gathered are solid, convincing, and statistically significant. However, there is a lack of insight into the underlying mechanism. They show the involvement of the ER, ATPase-dependent, BiP chaperone, and the requirement of Cdk1 inactivation (a hallmark of mitotic exit) in the process. They also show that the mechanism seems to be independent of the APC/C complex (anaphase-promoting complex). Several points need to be clarified regarding the mechanism that clears the aggregates during mitosis:</p>
<p>• What happens in the cell substructure during mitosis to explain the recruitment of BiP towards the aggregates, which seem to be relocated to the cytoplasm surrounded by the ER membrane.</p>
<p>• How the changes in the cell substructure during mitosis explain the relocation of protein aggregates during mitosis.</p>
<p>• Why BiP seems to be the main player of this mechanism and not the cyto Hsp70 first described to be involved in protein disaggregation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Experimental data showing clearance of protein aggregates during mitosis is solid, statistically significant, and very interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Weak mechanistic insight to explain the process of protein disaggregation, particularly the interconnection between what happens in the cell substructure during mitosis to trigger and drive clearance of protein aggregates.</p>
