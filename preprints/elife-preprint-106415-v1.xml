<title>Abstract</title><p>Distribution of Ranvier nodes along myelinated axons is a critical determinant of conduction velocity, significantly influencing spike arrival timing and hence neural circuit function. The patterns of nodal distribution are not necessarily uniform but vary across brain regions and even along individual axons. Although various factors could contribute to these patterns, the complexity arising from multicellular interactions between oligodendrocytes and axons has left the underlying regulatory mechanisms unclear. In this study, we identified the factors contributing to the emergence of a biased nodal distribution pattern along single axons using the chick brainstem auditory circuit as a model, in which the distance between adjacent nodes (internodal length) varies along the axons of avian cochlear nucleus neurons in a region-dependent manner, thereby enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length and oligodendrocyte morphology, either, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes determines the biased nodal distribution pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density. Our findings highlight the importance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in fine-tuning neural circuit function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ranvier nodes are highly excitable domains distributed along myelinated axons and contribute to increase conduction velocity through saltatory conduction. The distance between adjacent nodes (internodal length) affects the speed of saltatory conduction, with longer internodes leading to faster conduction, and hence has a significant impact on neural circuit function by influencing the timing of input arrival at target neurons. The pattern of nodal distribution along axons is not necessarily uniform. Recent studies have shown that the internodal length varies not only among axonal types and brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chong et al., 2012</xref>), but also along individual axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>). Despite its potential importance in neural information processing, the mechanisms regulating nodal distribution patterns are not well understood.</p>
<p>Various factors could contribute to the emergence of nodal distribution patterns along axons. In the central nervous system (CNS), each Ranvier node is formed through the following processes. Immature oligodendrocytes contact axons with their processes, initiating myelin formation that extends along the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Snaidero et al., 2014</xref>). At the ends of the extending myelin, the paranodal domain, at which the myelin tip contacts the axon, acts as a diffusion barrier and facilitates the clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) and the scaffolding protein ankyrinG (AnkG) to form a heminode. Subsequent restriction of the gap between two neighboring heminodes forms a mature Ranvier node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vabnick et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Susuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rasband and Peles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">2021</xref>). Thus, the formation of nodal distribution along axons is based on multicellular interactions among oligodendrocytes and axons and could be influenced by multiple factors associated with these cells; the factors related to oligodendrocytes include their morphological characteristics (e.g., the number and length of myelin sheaths) and cell density relative to axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chong et al., 2012</xref>), while those related to axons include their branching, diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>), and neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fields, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bechler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the contributions of these factors would vary significantly due to the diversity of both cell types and developmental stages, which obscures our understanding of the mechanisms of determining the nodal distribution patterns.</p>
<p>To understand the regulatory mechanisms of nodal distribution, the chicken brainstem auditory circuit is an excellent model, because the nodal distribution is biased in a region-dependent manner along the same projection axons, minimizing the effects of neuronal diversity. In addition, this regional difference in internodal length is also important in the computation of neural circuits for sound localization. Sound localization is the ability to identify the direction of sound source and involves detecting the time difference in sound arrivals between the ears (interaural time difference, ITD) in the order of microseconds. The ITD detection is mediated by an array of coincidence detector neurons in the nucleus laminaris (NL) that receive excitatory synaptic inputs from both sides of the nucleus magnocellularis (NM), a homologue of mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carr and Konishi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hyson 2005</xref>). In this circuit, the distribution of nodes along the axon of NM neurons differs among regions; the internodal length is longer at the tract region across the midline than at other regions including the NL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Seidl et al., 2010</xref>). The long internodes reduce the conduction time from the contralateral side and compensate for the difference in axonal pathlengths between the two sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Seidl et al., 2014</xref>), while the short internodes expand the dynamic range for detectable ITD within the NL. Therefore, this model will be an important stepping stone for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of nodal distribution and their impact on neural circuit function.</p>

<p>In this study, we tested the potential factors contributing to the regional differences in the nodal distribution along NM axons using high-resolution 3D morphometry of the optically-cleared brainstem auditory circuit. The results showed that NM axons are almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes with distinct morphological features after hearing onset. This morphological difference was not due to axonal structure. Inhibition of vesicular release from NM axons did not affect the internodal length and oligodendrocyte morphology but caused unmyelinated segments on NM axons via a suppression of oligodendrogenesis at the NL region. These results identified that the main factor contributing to the biased nodal distribution pattern in the ITD circuit is the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes. Activity-dependent signaling also contributed to this circuit by ensuring the density of oligodendrocytes through enhanced oligodendrogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of regulating nodal distribution along single axons and also into the significance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in neural circuit function.</p>

<title>Ranvier nodes developed in a similar time course along NM axons after hearing onset</title>
<p>NM neurons in chick embryos form axonal projections to the NL at embryonic day 10 (E10), begin to receive auditory input from around E12, and are functionally mature by the time around hatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To clarify how node formation progresses along development and whether there are regional differences in the timing of node formation, we examined the development of nodes at the tract and NL regions by double staining with AnkG and pan Nav antibodies or AnkG and Caspr antibodies, a marker for the paranodal domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1DâF</xref>).</p>
<p>At E12, we did not find these molecules at each region. At E15, Nav-positive clusters appeared and they were localized specifically at one end of the fibrous AnkG signals. The remaining Nav-negative part of AnkG signals would correspond to the paranodal domain, as myelin sheath at the domain shows transient expression of AnkG during the immature period of CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chang et al., 2014</xref>), and these structures were defined as âheminodeâ. At E18, Caspr signals became detectable at the paranodal domain of heminode. In addition, some Caspr signals appeared on both sides of the fibrous AnkG signals, sandwiching the Nav cluster. These structures would be formed through the fusion of adjacent heminodes and were defined as âimmature nodeâ. At E21, many nodes showed mature patterns, with complete colocalization of Nav and AnkG at a short nodal domain, which was flanked by Caspr-positive paranodal domains (âmature nodeâ). Triple staining of these molecules confirmed the three stages of nodal development along the axon of NM neurons. Quantification of their abundance revealed that their maturation progressed gradually after hearing onset and was almost completed around hatch. 90 % of the node types were heminodes at E15. This decreased to about 50% by E18 and to about 10% by E21 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, H), suggesting that NM axons are almost fully myelinated by E21. Although the increase in the proportion of immature nodes was slightly preceded at the tract region, the overall tendency did not differ greatly between the regions. These data indicate that the formation of Ranvier nodes progress in a similar time course along the axon.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Development of myelin sheath along NM axons</title>
<p>Formation of nodes requires maturation of myelin sheaths. To clarify their relationship on NM axons, we also examined the development of myelin with an antibody against myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) during the period of node formation.</p>
<p>The immunosignals for MAG appeared around the midline of the brainstem at E12 and extended along the axons of NM neurons at E15, becoming more intense at later ages for both tract and NL regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, B). These are consistent with the time course of node formation. Importantly, many oligodendrocytes were situated along the axon, as identified by immunopositivity Olig2, a marker in the nucleus of oligodendrocyte lineage cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, the MAG signals overlapped with the heminodes at E15. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that myelin sheaths already exist around the paranodal domains at the very early stage of node formation, in agreement with the idea that the early nodes can shift their position dynamically with myelin maturation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These raised the questions as to when the biased nodal distribution pattern emerges during development and whether and how oligodendrocytes contribute to the process.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Internodal length was determined roughly during node formation</title>
<p>To answer these questions, we first evaluated the internodal length between mature/immature nodes at E18 and P9 at the tract and NL regions. These two time points correspond to the periods during and after node formation, respectively. We labeled axons with a tracer, rhodamine dextran, visualized nodes with the Caspr antibody, and measured the internodal length at each region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>The internodal length was about 3 times longer in the tract region compared with the NL region at P9 (tract: 211.1Â±9.6 Î¼m; NL: 63.9Â±3.0 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), as observed in posthatch animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Seidl et al., 2010</xref>). The differences in internodal length in these two regions of axons was already evident at E18, although the internodal length was shorter by 20% at E18 in both tract and NL regions (tract: 171.0Â±7.0 Î¼m; NL: 53.4Â±3.8 Î¼m). The slightly shorter internodal length at E18 would reflect an elongation of internode during development in accordance with maturation of the brain size. Thus, the nodal distribution pattern was already determined at the early period of node formation, implying that reorganization of internodes would not contribute to the biased internodal length.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Morphology of oligodendrocytes differed between tract and NL regions</title>
<p>We next explored the contributions of oligodendrocytes to the regional difference in internodal length by evaluating the morphology of individual oligodendrocytes at E21. We sparsely labeled mature oligodendrocytes by expressing tdTomato with a palmitoylation signal (paltdTomato) under MBP promoter using <italic>in ovo</italic> electroporation and the iOn switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kumamoto et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B), while labeling bilateral NM axons with GFP by transfection of avian adeno-associated virus (A3V) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The 3D morphology of oligodendrocytes was then observed in 200 Î¼m-thick brainstem slices optically cleared with SlowFade Glass mountant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) (Video 1, 2). We focused our analyses on oligodendrocytes ensheathing the main trunk of NM axons.</p>

<p>As presumed, length of myelin sheaths differed significantly between the tract and NL regions (tract: 174.1Â±5.0 Î¼m; NL: 59.7Â±2.4 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), which was consistent with the difference in internodal length between the regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, the diameter of myelin sheath including the axon did not differ between the regions and did not show any correlation with the myelin length (tract: 1.69Â±0.05 Î¼m; NL: 1.64Â±0.07 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, G). In each oligodendrocyte, the average myelin length was shorter by 3 times (tract: 181.1Â±7.3 Î¼m NL: 63.6Â±4.7 Î¼m), the number of myelin sheaths was larger by 2 times (tract: 3.0Â±0.2; NL: 6.6Â±0.6), and the total myelin length was shorter by 1.3 times (tract: 527.9Â±27.2 Î¼m; NL: 394.6Â±29.7 Î¼m) at the NL region compared to the tract region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3HâJ</xref>). In addition, the cell body size was 30% smaller in cross-sectional area at the NL region (tract: 78.2Â±2.7 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>; NL: 52.5Â±1.9 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Thus, oligodendrocyte morphology was heterogeneous, with distinct differences in several aspects between the tract and NL regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>, M), even though they were myelinating the same axons.</p>

<p>The distinct oligodendrocyte morphologies imply differences in their intrinsic properties (e.g., the ability to produce and extend myelin sheaths), but the involvement of other external constraints cannot yet be ruled out. The structure of axons, such as branch points and diameter, is one of these external constraints, and can affect myelin extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore investigated the relationship between the structural features of NM axons and the nodal distribution at E21. To accomplish this, we labeled the axon of NM neurons by expressing GFP with a palmitoylation signal (palGFP) using <italic>in ovo</italic> electroporation and examined the nodal distribution three-dimensionally along the axon in 200 Î¼m-thick brainstem slices optically cleared after staining with a Caspr antibody (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4AâD</xref>) (Video 3).</p>

<p>The results showed that on the main trunk of the axons, most of the Caspr signals showed mature/immature node patterns, confirming that the axons were almost fully myelinated. These axons formed multiple collateral branches innervating the ventral dendritic layer at the NL region, and triads of paranodal domains were frequently observed at the branch points. The internodal length (73.1Â±2.1 Î¼m) being about 40% shorter compared to the branch point interval (122.5Â±6.7 Î¼m) at the NL region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, F). The number of internodes between adjacent branch points averaged 1.6 and was correlated with the length of branch point interval (â0â: 27.5Â±3.9 Î¼m; â1â: 79.3Â±5.1 Î¼m; â2â: 156.3Â±7.1 Î¼m; â3â¦â: 232.0Â±10.0 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>, I). In areas with very short branch point intervals (bottom 10%: &lt;40 Î¼m), the axon lacked Caspr signals frequently (61.5%), implying that these areas are less likely to be myelinated (internode=0 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). On the other hand, even in areas with long branch point intervals (top 10%: &gt;220 Î¼m), the internodal length did not increase and it was 2 times shorter than that at the tract region (&lt;220 Î¼m: 71.4Â±2.4 Î¼m; &gt;220 Î¼m: 79.9Â±3.9 Î¼m; tract: 164.3Â±4.2 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). These observations suggest that the branch point interval is not a critical determinant of the short internodes at the NL region, although it can be a limiting factor in areas with the shorter branch point interval.</p>
<p>The diameter of axon main trunk did not differ between the tract and NL regions (tract: 1.40Â±0.03 Î¼m; NL: 1.47Â±0.04 Î¼m) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>), corresponding to the diameter of myelin sheaths including axon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). This was consistent with the previous report showing that the axon diameter did not differ between the tract and the distal portion of ventral NL regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Seidl et al., 2010</xref>), confirming that the diameter of NM axons is not a factor determining the regional differences in nodal distribution.</p>

<title>Oligodendrogenesis was augmented at NL region</title>
<p>Given that NM axons were fully myelinated, oligodendrocyte density could also be a constraint of individual oligodendrocyte morphology; if the density is high, it may limit the extension of myelin sheath due to mutual competition for territory on the axon. Therefore, we examined the density of oligodendrocyte lineage cells during development by labeling the cells with the Olig2 antibody and quantifying their density at the tract and NL regions between E9 and E21(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> top, B).</p>

<p>The results showed that the density of Olig2-positive cells increased with development, peaked at E15, and decreased slightly afterwards. Importantly, the extent of this increase was more robust and about 1.3-fold higher at the NL region than at the tract region. The differences in oligodendrocyte density could result from several factors, including the density of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which mature into oligodendrocytes through several steps of maturation, as well as the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of these cells. We measured the density of OPCs by labeling the cells with Nkx2.2 antibodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> bottom, C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Xu et al., 2000</xref>). The density of Nkx2.2-positive cells increased sharply and reached a plateau by E12 at both regions, while the extent of this increase was also higher at the NL region. These cells were restricted to the ventral and dorsal fiber layers and almost absent in the somatic and dendritic layers of NL. These results suggest that the density of OPCs increases around the period of hearing onset to a larger extent at the NL region, contributing to the higher density of oligodendrocyte lineage cells at this region. We evaluated the level of proliferation of OPCs with BrdU labeling and found that the density of BrdU-positive cells was significantly higher at the NL region during E12â16 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, E). BrdU-positive cells were immunopositive for both Olig2 and Nkx2.2, confirming that they were OPCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, G). These results suggest that the higher densities of OPCs and oligodendrocyte lineage cells at the NL region occur through a region-specific facilitation of oligodendrogenesis.</p>

<p>The results showed that although Caspr-positive nodes were still observed in the axons expressing eTeNT, these axons showed an increase in the fraction of heminodes of about 30% causing unmyelinated segments at the NL region (A3V-GFP: 4.6Â±1.2%; A3V-eTeNT: 17.6Â±3.0%) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>â G).

<title>Inhibition of vesicular release did not affect oligodendrocyte morphology but suppressed oligodendrogenesis at NL region</title>
<p>The reduction of myelin sheath density by eTeNT could occur through a decrease in the number of myelin sheaths formed by each oligodendrocyte and/or through a decrease in the density of oligodendrocytes themselves.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study identified several factors responsible for biased nodal distribution patterns along axons, including heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology, regional differences in proliferation of OPCs, and activity-dependent signaling from axons through vesicular release.</p>
<p>Using the chick brainstem auditory circuit known for its characteristic nodal distribution as a model, we found that NM axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes with distinct morphologies between the two regions having markedly different internodal lengths. This regional heterogeneity reflected differences in the intrinsic property of oligodendrocytes in these two regions rather than the extrinsic constraints. Inhibiting vesicular release from NM axons caused unmyelinated segments by region-specific suppression of oligodendrogenesis without affecting internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, suggesting that primary role of neural activity is to ensure the oligodendrocyte density necessary for full myelination of axons.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Biased nodal distribution pattern reflects regional heterogeneity of oligodendrocyte</title>
<p>The main factor contributing to regional differences in internodal length along NM axons was regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology. The morphological differences were observed not only in the length of myelin sheaths, but also in the number of myelin sheaths and the size of cell bodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Considering the morphological classification of oligodendrocytes by PÃ­o del RÃ­o-Hortega (1928), oligodendrocytes at the tract and NL regions could be classified into type III and type II, respectively. Such morphological heterogeneity could be related to the variation of gene profiles among oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Butt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Marques et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>). Differences in the pericellular microenvironment and/or the origin of OPCs during development may contribute to the diverse gene profiles of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Crawford et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Foerster et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boshans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sherafat et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, oligodendrocytes in the brainstem have two developmental origins, derived from the ventral and dorsal sides of the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Vallstedt et al., 2005</xref>). Whether oligodendrocytes and OPCs at the tract and NL regions differ in their origins and/or gene profiles is an important issue to be examined in the future.</p>
<p>The regional differences in the morphology of oligodendrocytes would reflect their intrinsic properties at each region; the ability of myelin production is higher, while that of myelin extension is lower at the NL region than at the tract region. Supportively, the axonal factors, such as structure and vesicular release, did not affect the regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, 6). Oligodendrocyte density did not affect the morphology, either; the number and length of myelin sheaths did not increase even when unmyelinated segments appeared after inhibition of vesicular release. Thus, the morphology of oligodendrocyte and hence the length of myelin sheaths, are determined according to the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes at each region, which underlies the regional differentiation of nodal distribution along NM axons. Variations in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes are also reported in other brain regions. Oligodendrocytes in white matter are morphologically distinct from those in gray matter, and their original features did not change even when OPCs were cross-transplanted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">ViganÃ² et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, OPCs collected from different brain regions show their original morphological features when cultured on artificial fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>). In summary, our findings provide the perspective that oligodendrocytes with different intrinsic properties work together to fine-tune the neural circuit function involved in ITD detection.</p>

<title>Adaptive oligodendrogenesis ensures full myelination of axons at NL region</title>
<p>Neuronal activity can affect oligodendrocyte maturation and morphology, but the effects are not uniform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, the effect of the inhibition of vesicular release from axons on myelination is known to depend on the type of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Koudelka et al., 2016</xref>). In the axons of NM neurons, the activity-dependent signaling did not affect myelin formation in mature oligodendrocytes but facilitated proliferation and differentiation of OPCs. Given that the enhancement of oligodendrogenesis was confined to the NL region and that A3V transduction into NM neurons was highly efficient (about 90%, comparable to previous reports; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Matsui et al., 2012</xref>), exocytosis from the presynaptic terminals of NM axons caused the effects by altering the perisynaptic microenvironment. Glutamate and several trophic factors such as BDNF, which are released from the terminals of NM axons, may act on the OPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Du et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pease-Raissi &amp; Chan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fekete &amp; Nishiyama, 2022</xref>) directly via spillover from the synapse and/or indirectly via activation of NL neurons or astrocytes. Supportively, mRNA of NR1, a major subunit of NMDA receptor, is strongly expressed in glial cells, presumably oligodendrocyte lineage cells, at the ventral and dorsal dendritic layers of NL after E10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tang and Carr, 2007</xref>). Future studies are needed to determine what ligands mediate the differentiation and proliferation of OPCs as the activity-dependent signaling and whether there are regional differences in the sensitivity of these OPCs to the ligands along the NM axon.</p>
<p>Adaptive oligodendrogenesis would support the function of brainstem auditory circuits by ensuring the full myelination of NM axons. Full myelination of the auditory pathway enables rapid membrane responses and high metabolic support during high-frequency firing, which are critical for precise and reliable processing of sound information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the full myelination at the NL region, which is mediated by the adaptive enhancement of oligodendrogenesis, would be particularly important for ITD detection. The contralateral projections of NM neurons have a sequential branching structure called a âdelay lineâ at the ventral area of NL in chickens. This delay line produces an output delay of up to 180 Î¼s for contralateral NL neurons along the medial to lateral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Overholt et al., 1992</xref>). This delay covers the physiological ITD range for the chicken, allowing the ITDs to be encoded in a âplace mapâ within the NL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jeffress, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">KÃ¶ppl &amp; Carr, 2008</xref>). This should provide the neural basis for the ability of excellent sound localization in chickens, which can discriminate ITDs of about 20 Î¼s (8.9Â° minimum audible angle) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Krumm et al., 2022</xref>). Reliable myelination of the delay line ensures constant conduction velocity and output delay and hence is critical for precise ITD calculation. Thus, the adaptive oligodendrogenesis at the NL region would be a mechanism that secures the accuracy of ITD calculation in the avian auditory circuit. Interestingly, ITD representation within the NL exhibits plasticity around the period of hearing onset in the barn owl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Carr et al., 2024</xref>), which coincides with the period of adaptive oligodendrogenesis, speculating its contribution to the plasticity.</p>

<title>Commonalities and differences with the sound localization circuit in mammals</title>
<p>Regional regulation of conduction velocity has also been reported in mammals. In a brainstem auditory circuit of gerbils, which is involved in the processing of ITDs, several regional differentiations have been observed in the nodal distribution along the axon. In the axon of spherical bushy cells, a mammalian homologue of NM neurons, the internodal length is longer for contralateral side than for ipsilateral side, presumably compensating for the different axonal pathlength between the two sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Seidl &amp; Rubel, 2016</xref>). On the other hand, in the axon of globular bushy cells that project to medial nucleus of trapezoid body, the internodal length is longer for those innervating more medial location (i.e. more distal location), ensuring simultaneous inputs within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ford et al., 2015</xref>). These regional differentiations of nodal distribution would be acquired independently in mammals and birds through evolutionary convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lipovsek &amp; Wingate, 2018</xref>), emphasizing their importance in securing ITD computation in the microsecond order. Notably, in globular bushy cells, neural activity did not alter the nodal distribution, but instead regulated the conduction velocity by adaptively changing the axon diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nabel et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism of action of activity-dependent signaling is different among neurons and species. It will be interesting to determine to what extent the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes and other extrinsic constraints contribute to the nodal distribution in mammalian ITD circuits. Such comparisons will help to understand the fundamental logic and mechanisms of determining nodal distribution patterns along the axons.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study identified the factors mediating the regional differentiation of nodal distribution along single axons in the auditory pathway of chicken; the differentiation of nodal distribution reflects regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology, and the activity-dependent signaling from axons via vesicular release contributes to the full myelination of axons through region-specific enhancement of oligodendrogenesis. The results in this model system provide evidence that oligodendrocyte heterogeneity, which is widely observed in the brain, can contributes to achieving optimal timing of signals and optimal function of local circuits in the nervous system.</p>

Chicks were perfused transcardially with a periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde fixative (ml/g body weight): 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 2.7% (w/v) lysine HCl, 0.21% (w/v) NaIO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.1% (w/v) Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. The brainstem was postfixed for 1.5 hours at 4Â°C. After cryoprotection with 30% (w/w) sucrose in PBS, coronal sections (20â30 Î¼m) were obtained. The sections were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies, then with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (10 Î¼g/ml, Molecular Probes) for 2 hours and were observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus). For each image, 6-9 confocal planes were Z-stacked with a step of 0.8 Î¼m. Images were analyzed in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Anterograde labeling of NM axons was made by injecting dextran (MW 3000) conjugated with TMR (Life Technologies, 10â40% in 0.1 M phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 2.0 with HCl) into the midline tract region through a patch pipette and incubating the brainstem in the HG-ACSF for 30 min at 38Â°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lawrence and Trussell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wirth et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Internodal length was measured as follows. Images were captured with a Ã60, 1.35-NA objective (Olympus), and 6-10 confocal planes were Z-stacked with maximum projection. Internodal length was defined as a distance between adjacent nodes, which determined by identifying a pair of Caspr signals. Number of oligodendrocytes and their precursors was measured as follows. Images were captured with a Ã20, 0.75-NA objective (Olympus), and a single confocal plane was used for the measurement. The number was measured automatically by setting a threshold in areas over 14000 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> at each region.</p>

<p>Immunostaining and 3D-imaging of 200 Î¼m-thick brainstem slices Chick embryos were perfused transcardially at E21 with PBS containing 10 U/mL heparin followed by 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brainstem was postfixed overnight at 4Â°C. After cryoprotection with 30% (w/w) sucrose in PBS, coronal sections (200 Î¼m thickness) were obtained. The brainstem slices were delipidated and permeabilized with cold acetone for 3 min, washed in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) NaBH4 for 5 min to remove autofluorescence, and stained with primary antibody for 3 days, followed by secondary antibody for 1 day. The stained slices were embedded with SlowFade Glass Soft-set Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 200 Î¼m-thick silicone rubber spacer and No.0 coverslip (CG00C2, ThorLab), thereby making them transparent.</p>
<p>3D images were captured with a Ã60, 1.42-NA oil-immersion objective (UPLXAPO60XO, Olympus) or Ã100, 1.5-NA oil-immersion objective (UPLAPO100XOHR, Olympus) under a spinning disk confocal laser-scanning microscope (SpinSR10, Olympus).

<title>3D morphometry</title>
<p>In the 3D images captured by SpinSR10, myelin length, internode length, and branch point interval were traced using SNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arshadi et al., 2021</xref>), a Fiji plugin. Oligodendrocytes presumed not myelinating NM axons (e.g., oligodendrocytes that are not present within NM axon bundles or whose myelin sheaths barely along the axon bundle) were excluded from the analysis. For myelin and axon diameters, the length between intensity peaks of membrane-localized fluorescent proteins on a line orthogonal to the axon was measured. For nodal distribution along a single axon, three different axonal segments were defined according to the types of nodes at the ends; âinternode w/o heminodeâ was a segment between mature/immature nodes, âinternode w/ heminodeâ was a segment either between a mature/immature node and a heminode, or between heminodes flanking unmyelinated segments when the axon was separated by multiple heminodes, and âunmyelinated segmentâ was a non-overlapping segment between heminodes consisting of adjacent internodes. Quantified data were graphed using PlotsOfData (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Postma et al., 2019</xref>) or Excel (Microsoft).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study uses the delay line axon model in the chick brainstem auditory circuit to examine the interactions between oligodendrocytes and axons in the formation of internodal distances. This is a significant and actively studied topic, and the authors have used this preparation to support the hypothesis that regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocytes underlies the observed variation in internodal length. In a <bold>solid</bold> series of experiments, the authors have used enhanced tetanus neurotoxin light chains, a genetically encoded silencing tool, to inhibit vesicular release from axons and support the hypothesis that regional heterogeneity among oligodendrocytes may underlie the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Egawa and colleagues investigates differences in nodal spacing in an avian auditory brain stem circuit. The results are clearly presented and data are of very high quality. The authors make two main conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) Node spacing, i.e. internodal length, is intrinsically specified by the oligodendrocytes in the region they are found in, rather than axonal properties (branching or diameter).</p>
<p>(2) Activity is necessary (we don't know what kind of signaling) for normal numbers of oligodendrocytes and therefore the extent of myelination.</p>
<p>These are interesting observations, albeit phenomenon. I have only a few criticisms that should be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) The use of the term 'distribution' when describing the location of nodes is confusing. I think the authors mean rather than the patterns of nodal distribution, the pattern of nodal spacing. They have investigated spacing along the axon. I encourage the authors to substitute node spacing or internodal length for node distribution.</p>
<p>(2) In Seidl et al. (J Neurosci 2010) it was reported that axon diameter and internodal length (nodal spacing) were different for regions of the circuit. Can the authors help me better understand the difference between the Seidl results and those presented here?</p>
<p>(3) The authors looked only in very young animals - are the results reported here applicable only to development, or does additional refinement take place with aging?</p>
<p>(4) The fact that internodal length is specified by the oligodendrocyte suggests that activity may not modify the location of nodes of Ranvier - although again, the authors have only looked during early development. This is quite different than this reviewer's original thoughts - that activity altered internodal length and axon diameter. Thus, the results here argue against node plasticity. The authors may choose to highlight this point or argue for or against it based on results in adult birds?:</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>This paper may argue against node plasticity as a mechanism for tuning of neural circuits. Myelin plasticity is a very hot topic right now and node plasticity reflects myelin plasticity. this seems to be a circuit where perhaps plasticity is NOT occurring. That would be interesting to test directly. One limitation is that this is limited to development.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Egawa et al describe the developmental timeline of the assembly of nodes of Ranvier in the chick brainstem auditory circuit. In this unique system, the spacing between nodes varies significantly in different regions of the same axon from early stages, which the authors suggest is critical for accurate sound localization. Egawa et al set out to determine which factors regulate this differential node spacing. They do this by using immunohistological analyses to test the correlation of node spacing with morphological properties of the axons, and properties of oligodendrocytes, glial cells that wrap axons with the myelin sheaths that flank the nodes of Ranvier. They find that axonal structure does not vary significantly, but that oligodendrocyte density and morphology varies in the different regions traversed by these axons, which suggests this is a key determinant of the region-specific differences in node density and myelin sheath length. They also find that differential oligodendrocyte density is partly determined by secreted neuronal signals, as (presumed) blockage of vesicle fusion with tetanus toxin reduced oligodendrocyte density in the region where it is normally higher. Based on these findings, the authors propose that oligodendrocyte morphology, myelin sheath length, and consequently nodal distribution are primarily determined by intrinsic oligodendrocyte properties rather than neuronal factors such as activity.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) It is essential that the authors validate the efficiency of TeNT to prove that vesicular release is indeed inhibited, to be able to make any claims about the effect of vesicular release on oligodendrogenesis/myelination.</p>
<p>(2) Related to 1, can the authors clarify if their TeNT expression system results in the whole tract being silenced? It appears from Fig. 6 that their approach leads to sparse expression of TeNT in individual neurons, which enables them to measure myelination parameters. Can the authors discuss how silencing a single axon can lead to a regional effect in oligodendrocyte number?</p>
<p>(3) The authors need to fully revise their statistical analyses throughout and supply additional information that is needed to assess if their analyses are adequate:</p>
<p>
(3.1) the authors use a variety of statistical tests and it is not always obvious why they chose a particular test. For example, in Fig. 2G they chose a Kruskal-Wallis test instead of a two-way ANOVA or Mann-Whitney U test, which are much more common in the field. What is the rationale for the test choice?</p>
<p>
(3.2) in some cases, the choice of test appears wholly inappropriate. For example, in Fig. 3H-K, an unpaired t-test is inappropriate if the two regions were analysed in the same samples. In Fig. 5, was a t-test used for comparisons between multiple groups in the same dataset? If so, an ANOVA may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>
(3.3) in some cases, the authors do not mention which test was used (Fig 3: E-G no test indicated, despite asterisks; G/L/M - which regression test that was used? What does r indicate?)</p>
<p>
(3.4) more concerningly, throughout the results, data may have been pseudo-replicated. t-tests and ANOVAs assume that each observation in a dataset is independent of the other observations. In figures 1-4 and 6 there is a very large &quot;n&quot; number, but the authors do not indicate what this corresponds to. This leaves it open to interpretation, and the large values suggest that the number of nodes, internodal segments, or cells may have been used. These are not independent experimental units, and should be averaged per independent biological replicate - i.e. per animal (N).</p>
<p>
(3.5) related to the pseudo-replication issue, can the authors include individual datapoints in graphs for full transparency, per biological replicates, in addition or in alternative to bar-graphs (e.g. Fig. 5 and 6).</p>
<p>(4) The main finding of the study is that the density of nodes differs between two regions of the chicken auditory circuit, probably due to morphological differences in the respective oligodendrocytes. Can the authors discuss if this finding is likely to be specific to the bird auditory circuit?</p>
<p>(5) Provided the authors amend their statistical analyses, and assuming significant differences remain as shown, the study shows a correlation (but not causation) between node spacing and oligodendrocyte density, but the authors did not manipulate oligodendrocyte density per se (i.e. cell-autonomously). Therefore, the authors should either include such experiments, or revise some of their phrasing to soften their claims and conclusions. For example, the word &quot;determine&quot; in the title could be replaced by &quot;correlate with&quot; for a more accurate representation of the work. Similar sentences throughout the main text should be amended.</p>
<p>(6) The authors fail to introduce, or discuss, very pertinent prior studies, in particular to contextualize their findings with:</p>
<p>
(6.1) known neuron-autonomous modes of node formation prior to myelination, e.g. Zonta et al (PMID 18573915); Vagionitis et al (PMID 35172135); Freeman et al (PMID 25561543)</p>
<p>
(6.2) known effects of vesicular fusion directly on myelinating capacity and oligodendrogenesis, e.g. Mensch et al (PMID 25849985)</p>
<p>
(6.3) known correlation of myelin length and thickness with axonal diameter, e.g. Murray &amp; Blakemore (PMID 7012280); Ibrahim et al (PMID 8583214); Hildebrand et al (PMID 8441812).</p>
<p>
(6.4) regional heterogeneity in the oligodendrocyte transcriptome (page 9, studies summarized in PMID 36313617)</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>In our view the study tackles a fundamental question likely to be of interest to a specialized audience of cellular neuroscientists. This descriptive study is suggestive that in the studied system, oligodendrocyte density determines the spacing between nodes of Ranvier, but further manipulations of oligodendrocyte density per se are needed to test this convincingly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have investigated the myelination pattern along the axons of chick avian cochlear nucleus. It has already been shown that there are regional differences in the internodal length of axons in the nucleus magnocellularis. In the tract region across the midline, internodes are longer than in the nucleus laminaris region. Here the authors suggest that the difference in internodal length is attributed to heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes. In the tract region oligodendrocytes would contribute longer myelin internodes, while oligodendrocytes in the nucleus laminaris region would synthesize shorter myelin internodes. Not only length of myelin internodes differs, but also along the same axon unmyelinated areas between two internodes may vary. This is an interesting contribution since all these differences contribute to differential conduction velocity regulating ipsilateral and contralateral innervation of coincidence detector neurons. However, the demonstration falls rather short of being convincing.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The authors neglect the possibility that nodal cluster may be formed prior to myelin deposition. They have investigated stages E12 (no nodal clusters) and E15 (nodal cluster plus MAG+ myelin). Fig. 1D is of dubious quality. It would be important to investigate stages between E12 and E15 to observe the formation of pre-nodes, i.e., clustering of nodal components prior to myelin deposition.</p>
<p>(2) The claim that axonal diameter is constant along the axonal length need to be demonstrated at the EM level. This would also allow to measure possible regional differences in the thickness of the myelin sheath and number of myelin wraps.</p>
<p>(3) The observation that internodal length differs is explain by heterogeneity of sources of oligodendrocyte is not convincing. Oligodendrocytes a priori from the same origin remyelinate shorter internode after a demyelination event.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>The authors suggest that the difference in internodal length is attributed to heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes. In the tract region oligodendrocytes would contribute longer myelin internodes, while oligodendrocytes in the nucleus laminaris region would synthesize shorter myelin internodes. Not only length of myelin internodes differs, but also along the same axon unmyelinated areas between two internodes may vary. This is an interesting contribution since all these differences contribute to differential conduction velocity regulating ipsilateral and contralateral innervation of coincidence detector neurons.</p>

<p>General Statements</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the constructive comments from the reviewers, which have significantly enhanced the clarity and rigor of our manuscript. Most of their suggestions have already been incorporated into the revised version. Additionally, we are conducting an additional experiment to further substantiate our conclusions, and preliminary data seem to support our findings.</p>
<p>As pointed out by Reviewer #1, the regulation of neural circuit function by oligodendrocytes is currently a highly significant and actively studied topic. Our study demonstrates that regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocytes underlies the microsecond-level computational processes in the sound localization circuit. We believe this work represents a substantial contribution to the field.</p>
<p>Description of the planned revisions</p>
<p>â¢ Evaluation of node formation along axons sparsely expressing eTeNT (related to Reviewer #2: comment 1)</p>
<p>Based on the approximately 90% expression efficiency of A3V-eTeNT in NM neurons, we interpreted that vesicular release from NM axons was largely inhibited in the NL region, leading to the suppression of oligodendrogenesis and the subsequent emergence of unmyelinated segments. However, the effects of eTeNT on myelination are likely diverse, and a possibility remains that eTeNT directly disrupted axon-oligodendrocyte interactions, preventing oligodendrocytes from myelinating the axons expressing eTeNT.</p>
<p>To test this possibility, we have initiated an additional experiment to evaluate formation of nodes along axons, while expressing eTeNT sparsely by electroporation. Preliminary results indicated that unmyelinated segments did not increase, supporting our original conclusion. After completion of the experiment, we will include the findings as a Supplementary Figure associated with Figure 6, which will provide a clearer understanding of how eTeNT influences myelination.</p>
<p>Description of the revisions that have already been incorporated in the transferred manuscript</p>
<p>â¢ Revised terminology from &quot;nodal distribution&quot; to &quot;nodal spacing&quot; throughout the manuscript. (Reviewer #1: comment 1)</p>
<p>â¢ Emphasized that our analyses were focused on the main trunk of NM axons (Reviewer #1: comment 2) We explicitly stated throughout the manuscript that we analyzed the main trunk of NM axons and made it clear that our findings do not contradict those by Seidl et al. (J Neurosci 2010), showing the similar axon diameter between midline and ventral NL regions (page 7, line 7).</p>
<p>â¢ Added an explanation on the maturation of sound localization circuit (Reviewer #1: comment 3) We explained that chickens have high ability of sound localization at hatch, emphasizing that the sound localization circuit is almost fully developed by E21 (page 4, line 12).</p>
<p>â¢ Emphasized the diverse effects of neuronal activity on oligodendrocytes (page 10, line 18) (Reviewer #1: comment 4)</p>
<p>â¢ Added details on the efficiency of A3V-eTeNT expression in NM neurons to the Results section (page 8, line 5) (Reviewer #2: comment 1)</p>
<p>â¢ Made it clear in Figure Legend for Figure 6D that the analysis was conducted under the condition, where most of the axons were labeled by A3V-eTeNT (page 31, line 9) (Reviewer #2: comment 2)</p>
<p>â¢ Clarified the rationale for statistical test selection (Reviewer #2: comment 3.1)</p>
<p>â¢ Reanalyzed all statistical data with appropriate methods using R (Reviewer #2: comment 3.2)</p>
<p>â¢ Clearly indicated which statistical tests were used in each figure (Reviewer #2: comment 3.3)</p>
<p>â¢ Clarified what n represents and N used in each experiment (Reviewer #2: comment 3.4)</p>
<p>â¢ Added individual data points to bar graphs in Figure  5 and 6 (Reviewer #2: comment 3.5)</p>
<p>â¢ Emphasized the importance of comparing the ITD circuit with that of rodents (page 11, line 32) (Reviewer #2: comment 4)</p>
<p>â¢ Softened the expressions related to &quot;determine&quot; (Reviewer #2: comment 5)</p>
<p>Our study demonstrates that regional differences in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes are the prominent determinant of nodal spacing patterns. However, we acknowledge that this does not establish a direct causation. Accordingly, relevant expressions have been revised throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>â¢ Added references (Reviewer #2: comment 6)</p>
<p>â¢ Corrected units in Figure 1G (Reviewer #2: comment 7)</p>
<p>â¢ Added discussion about the involvement of pre-nodal clusters in the regional differences in nodal spacing (page 9, line 35) (Reviewer #3: comment 1).</p>
<p>Related to this issue, we have added new data to Figure 6I.</p>
<p>â¢ Discussed the possibility that the developmental origin and/or the pericellular microenvironment of OPCs contributed to the regional heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes (page 9, line 21) (Reviewer #3: comment 3).</p>
<p>â¢ Added references used in the response to reviewers into the main text.</p>
<p>â¢ Corrected the data error in Figure 6G, H</p>
<p>â¢ Corrected the dataset in Figure 3E</p>
<p>We limited the data in Figure 3EâG to those measuring both myelin length and diameter simultaneously.</p>
<p>Description of analyses that authors prefer not to carry out</p>
<p>â¢ Analysis in adult chickens (Reviewer #1: comment 3,4)</p>
<p>The chick brainstem auditory circuit is nearly fully developed by E21, and we have also demonstrated that nodal spacing increases by approximately 20% while maintaining regional differences up to P9. Therefore, our study covers the period from pre-myelination to postfunctional maturation, and we think that the necessity of analyzing aged animals is small.</p>
<p>â¢ Functional evaluation of the efficiency of eTeNT suppression (Reviewer #2: comment 1)</p>
<p>It is technically challenging to quantitatively assess the inhibition of vesicular release by eTeNT in NM axons given that multiple synapses from different NM axons converge onto postsynaptic neurons. In addition, previous studies have already validated the efficacy of this construct in multiple species. Therefore, we will not evaluate electrophysiologically the extent of vesicular release inhibition by eTeNT in this study. Instead, we have provided clear evidence that A3V-eTeNT is expressed efficiently and leads to notable phenotypic changes, such as the inhibition of oligodendrogenesis. (page 8, line 5).</p>
<p>â¢ Replacing figures with data averaged per animal (Reviewer #2: comment 3.4)</p>
<p>Our study focuses on the distribution of morphological characteristics at the single-cell level rather than solely on group means. Averaging measurements per animal could obscure this cellular heterogeneity and potentially misrepresent our findings. Given that data distributions in our plots show clear distinctions, we believe that averaging per biological replicate is not essential in this case. If requested, we will be happy to provide the outputs of PlotsOfDifferences as supplementary source data files, similar to those used in eLife publications, for each figure.</p>
<p>â¢ Additional experiments to manipulate oligodendrocyte density (Reviewer #2: comment 5)</p>
<p>We have already demonstrated that A3V-eTeNT reduces oligodendrocyte density in the NL region, and some of the arguments in our study are based on this result. Therefore, we think that further experiments are not necessary.</p>
<p>â¢ Verification of the presence of pre-nodal clusters (Reviewer #3: comment 1)</p>
<p>We investigated the presence of pre-nodal clusters on NM axons, but we could not identify them in the immunohistochemistry of AnkG. As the occurrence of pre-nodal clusters varies depending on neuronal type, we consider that pre-nodal clusters are not prominent in the NM axons and that further experimental validation would not be necessary. Instead, we have added a discussion on the possibility that pre-nodal clusters contribute to regional differences in nodal spacing along NM axons (page 9, line 35).</p>
<p>â¢ Axon diameter measurements using EM (Reviewer #3: comment 2)</p>
<p>This experiment was already done by Seidl et al. (2010), and hence, we do not think it necessary to repeat it. We believe that the relative differences in axon diameter between the regions could be adequately assessed using the optical approach with membrane-targeted GFP.</p>
