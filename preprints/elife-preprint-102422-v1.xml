<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Recently, a new class of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) lyases (GAGases) belonging to PL35 family has been discovered with an ultrabroad substrate spectrum that can degrade three types of uronic acid-containing GAGs (hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate) or even alginate. In this study, the structures of GAGase II from <italic>Spirosoma fluviale</italic> and GAGase VII from <italic>Bacteroides intestinalis</italic> DSM 17393 were determined at 1.9 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively, and their catalytic mechanism was investigated by the site-directed mutant of their crucial residues and molecular docking assay. Structural analysis showed that GAGase II and GAGase VII consist of an N-terminal (α/α)<sub>7</sub> toroid multidomain and a C-terminal two-layered β-sheet domain with Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Notably, although GAGases share similar folds and catalytic mechanisms with some GAG lyases and alginate lyases, they exhibit higher structural homology with alginate lyases than GAG lyases, which may present a crucial structural evidence for the speculation that GAG lyases with (α/α)<sub>n</sub> toroid and antiparallel β-sheet structures arrived by a divergent evolution from alginate lyases with the same folds. Overall, this study not only solved the structure of PL35 GAG lyases for the first time and investigated their catalytic mechanism, especially the reason why GAGase III can additionally degrade alginate, but also provided a key clue in the divergent evolution of GAG lyases that originated from alginate lyases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a class of linear polyanionic polysaccharides ubiquitously distributed on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of animal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cohen and Merzendorfer,2019</xref>), and they participate in various physiological and pathological processes through interacting with a series of chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dyer, et al.,2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Irie, et al.,2008</xref>), growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sirko, et al.,2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhang, et al.,2019</xref>) or other ECM components. Except for keratan sulfate (KS), which does not contain hexuronic acid (HexUA) residues, other GAGs are composed of repeating disaccharides consisted of HexUA (D-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) or L-iduronic acid (IdoUA)) and hexosamine (HexNAc) (D-<italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) or D-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)). Based on the disaccharide composition and the type of glycosidic bonds between disaccharides units, HexUA-containing GAGs are classified into three classes: hyaluronan (HA), chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS) and heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin (Hep) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cohen and Merzendorfer,2019</xref>). HA is the only non-sulfated GAG composed of repeating -GlcUAβ1-3GlcNAc-disaccharides linked by β1-4 glycosidic bonds. In contrast, the structures of CS/DS and Hep/HS are highly complex due to sulfation and epimerization modifications. The backbone of CS is composed of repeating -GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc-disaccharides linked by β1-4 glycosidic bonds, and is further sulfated at C-2 of GlcUA and C-4/C-6 of GalNAc by sulfotransferases; meanwhile, the GlcUA residues in CS can be epimerized into IdoUA residues by glucuronyl C-5 epimerase to form DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kusche-Gullberg and Kjellen,2003</xref>). Similarly, HS/Hep composed of repeating −4GlcUAβ1-4GlcNAcα1-units can be sulfated at C-2 of GlcUA and N/C-2/C-3/C-6 of GlcNAc/deacetylated GlcN, and GlcUA residues are often epimerized to IdoUA residues, especially in Hep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cohen and Merzendorfer,2019</xref>). Such complex modification through sulfation and epimerization endows sulfated GAGs with diverse biological functions.</p>
<p>GAG lyases, belonging to the superfamily of polysaccharide lyases (PLs), specifically catalyze the degradation of HexUA-containing GAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Charnock, et al.,2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garron and Cygler,2010</xref>). These reactions generate a plethora of oligosaccharides that contain an unsaturated double bond between C-4 and C-5 on uronic acids at their nonreducing ends, which is generated via a β-elimination mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garron and Cygler,2010</xref>). As a complimentary mechanistic strategy to glycoside hydrolases (GHs), GAG lyases degrade HexUA-containing GAGs without the participation of a water molecule and involved in the polysaccharide metabolism of microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garron and Cygler,2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ndeh, et al.,2020</xref>). For the past many years, an increasing number of gene sequences containing PL catalytic modules and some ancillary modules have been annotated as PLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lombard, et al.,2010</xref>). Based on their sequence homologies, 43 families (and an unclassified PL0 family) have been hierarchically classified in the CAZy database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org/">http://www.cazy.org/</ext-link>), and at least one member of each family has been subjected to activity identification and biochemical property analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Drula, et al.,2022</xref>). The identified GAG lyases are widely distributed in the PL6, PL8, PL12, PL13, PL15, PL16, PL21, PL23, PL29, PL30, PL33, PL35 and PL37 families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Drula, et al.,2022</xref>). Based on substrate specificity, GAG lyases are classified as HA-specific lyases, which can degrade HA only, CS/DS lyases (chondroitinase, CSases), which degrade CS/DS as well as HA in most cases, and Hep/HS lyases (heparinases, Hepases), which specifically cleave Hep/HS. All identified GAG lyases have substrate specificity to strictly distinguish one or two kinds of GAGs based on saccharide composition and glycosidic bonds between each HexUA-HexNAc disaccharide units, while other uronic acid-containing polysaccharides are usually unable to serve as substrates for these enzymes.</p>
<p>With the evolution of host polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Csoka and Stern,2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Popper, et al.,2011</xref>), the bacterial enzymes that degrade these polysaccharides have also evolved to varying degrees in response to complex environments. As a kind of unbranched anionic extracellular polysaccharide produced by lower organisms algae and bacteria (such as brown alga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Popper, et al.,2011</xref>) and bacteria belonging to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Evans and Linker,1973</xref>) and <italic>Azotobacter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Clementi,1997</xref>), alginate containing no hexosamine and sulfation possesses a simpler structure than GAGs in animals and should emerge earlier than GAGs during the course of evolution. Like GAGs, alginate is a linear polyanionic polysaccharide that contains HexUA residues; however, alginate possesses a completely different chemical structure, which is composed of D-mannuronate (M) and its C5 epimer L-guluronate (G), and M and G residues often alternate randomly to form heteropolyuronic blocks, including polyM composed of M residues linked by β1-4 bonds, polyG composed of G residues linked by α1-4 bonds, and polyMG/GM composed of alternating M and G linked by β/α1-4 bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pawar and Edgar,2012</xref>). Likewise, a series of alginate lyases essential for the metabolism of alginate were identified from microorganisms and algae as well as lower marine animals, which belong to the PL5, PL6, PL7, PL8, PL14, PL15, PL17, PL18, PL31, PL32, PL34, PL36, PL38, PL39 and PL41 families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Drula, et al.,2022</xref>). Based on their specificity, these lyases are also divided into the following categories: M block-specific lyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Itoh, et al.,2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhu, et al.,2015</xref>), G block-specific lyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Matsubara, et al.,1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yamasaki, et al.,2005</xref>) and MG-specific alginate lyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jagtap, et al.,2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yamasaki, et al.,2004</xref>). From an evolutionary perspective in previous reports, GAG lyases are thought to have originated from alginate lyases by a divergent evolution through adaptation to the evolution of substrate polysaccharides, which is mainly attributed to some homology in the sequences and folds of these two types of enzymes, such as the (α/α)<sub>n</sub> toroid and antiparallel β-sheet folds of GAG lyases in PL8 (hyaluronate lyase and chondroitin lyase), PL12 (heparinase III), PL21 (heparinase II) and PL23 (chondroitin lyase) families and alginate lyases in PL15, PL17 and PL39 families, the β-jelly roll fold of heparinase I in PL13 family and alginate lyases in PL7 and PL18 families, and the β-helix fold of chondroitinase B and alginate lyase in PL6 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Garron and Cygler,2014</xref>). Considering that the alginate with simpler structure from brown alga or bacteria might appear earlier, it is possible that the ancestral enzymes originally used alginate as a substrate. However, enzymes with transitional characteristics in activity and structure have not been discovered to support this speculation.</p>
<p>Recently, a new class of GAG lyases belonging to PL35 family was discovered with an ultrabroad substrate spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wei, et al.,2024</xref>). Unlike the identified GAG lyases (HA-specific lyases, CSases and Hepases) with quite strict substrate specificities, these novel GAG lyases can degrade three types of uronic acid-containing GAGs (HA, CS and HS), and thus were named GAGases. More interestingly, one of the eight identified GAGases (GAGase III) can even degrade alginate. Analysis of substrate structure preference represented by GAGase I showed that GAGases selectively act on GAG domains composed of non/6-<italic>O</italic>-/<italic>N</italic>-sulfated hexosamines and D-glucuronic acid, among which GAGase III can also selectively degrade polyM blocks composed of D-mannuronic acids but not polyG blocks composed of L-guluronic acids in alginate. Furthermore, the primary structure alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that GAGases have considerable degree of homology with not only GAG lyases from PL15, PL21 and PL33 families but also alginate lyases from PL15, PL17 and PL34 families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wei, et al.,2024</xref>), indicating that GAGases may exhibit some transitional features from alginate lyases to GAG lyases in structure.</p>
<p>In this study, crystal structures of two GAGases (GAGase II and GAGase VII) were determined for the first time, and their catalytic mechanism was further elucidated through the site-directed mutagenesis of their crucial site residues and molecular docking. Structural alignment showed that GAGases are more structural similarity to some alginate lyases rather than GAG lyases, suggesting that PL35 family GAGases might originate from alginate lyases possessing an N-terminal (α/α)<sub>n</sub> toroid domain and a C-terminal antiparallel β-sheet domain. Moreover, one of the reasons why GAGase III can additionally degrade M-block alginate are also resolved by structural modeling, structural alignment and site-directed mutagenesis. This study not only helps to resolve the catalytic mechanism of the PL35 family lyases in particular GAGases, but also provides a potential structural evidence for the divergent evolution of GAG lyases.</p>

<title>Overall crystal structures of GAGase II and GAGase VII</title>
<p>To explore the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism of the GAGases, the eight enzymes with different sequence identity (<italic>Supplemental Table S1</italic>) were individually used to prepare their crystals for structural analysis. Finally, the structures of GAGase II from <italic>Spirosoma fluviale</italic> (GenBank accession number: SOD82962.1, 81.2% sequence identity with GAGase I), GAGase VII from <italic>Bacteroides intestinalis</italic> (GenBank accession number: EDV05210.1, 44.8% sequence identity with GAGase I) and selenomethionine (SeMet)-labelled GAGase II (Se-GAGase II) in their ligand-free states were solved at 1.9 Å, 2.4 Å and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Both GAGase II and GAGase VII are monomers consisting of two domains: a N-terminal (α/α)<sub>7</sub> toroid domain and a C-terminal two-layered β-sheet domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>The N-terminal domain (Met<sup>34</sup>-Ala<sup>365</sup>) of GAGase II is composed of 16 large or small α-helices (α1-α16) to form an (α/α)<sub>7</sub> toroid domain. Specifically, the N-terminal 16 α-helices constitute seven complete α-helix pairs (α1-2, α3-4, α5-7, α8-9, α10-12, α13-14 and α15-16), forming seven hairpin structures, which eventually embrace into the (α/α)<sub>7</sub> toroid structure. The transition between α6 to α8 and between α10 to 12 is discontinuous, and both transitions possess a small α-helix α7 and α11, respectively. In each hairpin structure, two antiparallel α-helices are connected by loops composed of 9-12 residues, and each hairpin contains a turn structure composed of 1-4 residues. The N-terminal of this toroid domain is connected to a signal peptide that has been removed during cloning expression, and its C-terminal is connected to the two-layered β-sheet domain through a 17-residue linkage (Trp<sup>350</sup>-Met<sup>365</sup>). Its inner layer is formed by helices α1, α3, α5, α8, α10, α13 and α16, while its outer layer is formed by α2, α4, α6+α7, α9, α11+α12, α14 and α15. Moreover, the α-helix pairs α13-14 and α15-16 are significantly shorter than the first five sets, and α15 and α16 are connected by a short β-turn consisting of only 3 residues, which makes the toroid structure closed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>The C-terminal domain (Met<sup>366</sup>-Ser<sup>612</sup>) of GAGase II is composed of 17 β-strands (β1-β17) to form a two-layered β-sheet domain with 4 small α-helices located between β5-β6 and β8-β9. Both layers of this C-terminal β-sheet domain are composed of eight groups of β-strands, namely β1-β5, β11 and β15-β16 and β7-β10, β12-β14 and β17. The two layers are roughly parallel to each other and twisted to form an angle of approximately 60°. The first five β-strands (β1-β5) of the C-terminal domain are arranged in anti-parallel configuration. Subsequently, there is an Ω-loop structure wrapping around a metal ions (Mn<sup>2+</sup>), which consists of three small α-helices and a small β-strands, with many positively charged amino acid residues (such as His<sup>401</sup>, His<sup>403</sup>, Tyr<sup>427</sup>, Glu<sup>431</sup>, Trp<sup>438</sup>, Arg<sup>446</sup> and so on) on top, which might serve as potential substrate-binding sites. Finally, the C-terminal domain terminates at β17 in the second layer of the bilayer structure. Taken together, these structural elements constitute the C-terminal anti-parallel bilayer β-sheet domain of GAGase II (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to GAGase II, GAGase VII also has an N-terminal (α/α)<sub>7</sub> toroid domain (Leu<sup>35</sup>-Arg<sup>360</sup>) composed of 16 α-helices, but its α1 helix consists of only three residues (Glu<sup>42</sup>-Val<sup>44</sup>) and a long loop chain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1B</xref>). Moreover, the C-terminal two-layered β-sheet domain (Met<sup>361</sup>-Met<sup>616</sup>) of GAGase VII is also composed of 17 β-strands (β1-β15, β16a, β16b and β17). However, unlike GAGase II, its β16 strands is interrupted into two small β-strands (β16a, β16b) by a randomly coiled loop chain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1B</xref>). Compared with GAGase II, these additional loop regions may make GAGase VII less structurally stable than GAGase II, and may be an important factor in why the activity of GAGase VII is far lower than GAGase II. Nevertheless, structural alignment further shows that GAGase II has good superposition with GAGase VII and other GAGases, indicating that GAGases are highly conserved in structures (<italic>Supplemental Figure S1</italic>).</p>

Structurally, the Mn<sup>2+</sup> is located inside the long Ω loop after the β1-β5 antiparallel β-sheet, and coordinates with the nearby nitrogen and oxygen atoms of several residues such as Asp and His in both GAGase VII and GAGase II (GAGase II also has coordination with three surrounding water molecules), with distances of 2.0-2.5 Å. Such interaction should stabilize the nearby loop structures and may form a substrate-binding site relevant for substrate selectivity. To investigate the roles of these adjacent residues interacting with the Mn<sup>2+</sup>, His<sup>403</sup>, Asp<sup>405</sup>, Asp<sup>421</sup> and His<sup>457</sup> in GAGase II were individually mutated to alanine (Ala), and the results showed that these mutations resulted in complete or substantial inactivation of GAGase II (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

<title>Multiple structural alignments of GAGase II and its structurally similar GAG lyases and alginate lyases</title>
<p>The ultrabroad substrate degradation spectra of GAGases indicate that they should be structurally homologous with some other PLs with different substrate specificities. By using GAGase II as a representative, a structural alignment assay showed that the PL35 GAGases are structurally similar to various N-terminal (α/α)<sub>n</sub> toroid domain and C-terminal antiparallel β-sheet domain-containing GAG/alginate lyases from PL8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fethiere, et al.,1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huang, et al.,2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li and Jedrzejas,2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lunin, et al.,2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shaya, et al.,2008</xref>), PL12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hashimoto, et al.,2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ulaganathan, et al.,2017</xref>), PL15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ochiai, et al.,2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhang, et al.,2021</xref>), PL17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park, et al.,2014</xref>), PL21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shaya, et al.,2006</xref>), PL23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sugiura, et al.,2011</xref>) and PL39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ji, et al.,2019</xref>).

Among them, GAGases show more structural similarity to alginate lyases, such as those from the PL15 (PDB code: 3a0o) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ochiai, et al.,2010</xref>), PL17 (PDB code: 4NEI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park, et al.,2014</xref>) and PL39 (PDB code: 6JP4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ji, et al.,2019</xref>) families, than various GAG lyases (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), indicating that GAGases might originate from alginate lyase rather than GAG lyase. Reasonable support for this speculation could be the significant alginate-degrading activity of GAGase III. Therefore, the broad substrate spectrum of GAGases may be because they are evolutionarily transitional types with the enzymatic features of alginate lyases and GAG lyases.</p>

<title>Catalytic center and substrate binding sites of GAGases</title>
<p>Based on the sequence and structural alignment with homogenous alginate/GAG lyases, the conserved residues Tyr<sup>246</sup>, His<sup>401</sup>, Asn<sup>192</sup> of GAGase II, Tyr<sup>243</sup>, His<sup>398</sup>, Asn<sup>189</sup> of GAGase III, and Tyr<sup>241</sup>, His<sup>397</sup>, Asn<sup>187</sup> of GAGase VII may be the key triplet residues involved in their β-elimination catalysis active sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). To confirm this hypothesis, a site-directed mutagenesis assay was performed in which these residues were individually replaced by Ala; as a result, the activity of all of mutants toward CS-C was completely lost (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). These results indicate that GAGases act through a general acid‒base catalytic mechanism by using His/Tyr as a Brønsted acid/base, similar to that observed for various other identified GAG/alginate lyases (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Compared with their homologous GAG/alginate lyases, GAGases contain a shorter catalytic cavity, which may explain why they can accommodate and degrade a variety of substrates with very different structures. However, we were unsuccessful in preparing the cocrystals of GAGases/their inactive mutants with substrates to reveal their substrate binding and degradation mechanisms. Alternatively, molecular docking experiments of GAGase II with several structurally defined hexasaccharide (Hexa) substrates were performed as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>. Based on the docking results obtained for GAGase II with an HA Hexa (GlcUA1–3GlcNAc)<sub>3</sub> (PDB code: 1HYA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Winter, et al.,1975</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), the nonreducing end of the substrate at the “-1” and “-2” subsites is near some positively charged amino acids, including Arg<sup>87</sup>, Arg<sup>88</sup>, Arg<sup>94</sup>, His<sup>136</sup>, Asn<sup>191</sup> and Asn<sup>192</sup>, in the vicinity of the catalytic cavity of GAGase II, which could facilitate the binding of negatively charged substrates. Besides, several acidic amino acids (Glu<sup>242</sup>, Asp<sup>299</sup> and Glu<sup>431</sup>) are very close to the “+1” and “+2” subsites, which could promote the release of the reducing end product via charge repulsion. There are some other residues surrounding around the catalytic cavity, such as Tyr<sup>240</sup>, Gln<sup>307</sup>, Arg<sup>342</sup>, Tyr<sup>427</sup>, Glu<sup>428</sup>, Glu<sup>431</sup>, Trp<sup>438</sup>, Met<sup>440</sup> and Arg<sup>446</sup>, which may play a key role in stabilization of the catalytic cavity and overall structure. Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues individually replaced with Ala showed that all resulting mutants were partially or completely inactivated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), confirming that these residues play important roles in the binding and release of substrate and structural stabilization.</p>

<title>Substrate selectivity of GAGases</title>
<p>As mentioned above, GAGase III can degrade not only HA, CS and HS but also alginate, even though the activity on alginate is relatively low (about 1/50 of the activity on HA). To investigate the reason why this enzyme is capable to act on alginate, its structure was predicted using Robetta, and aligned with GAGase II and GAGase VII. Results showed that GAGase III has a unique His<sup>188</sup> residue in the catalytic cavity of GAGase III, which is conserved in alginate lyases from PL17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park, et al.,2014</xref>), PL39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ji, et al.,2019</xref>), PL38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ronne, et al.,2023</xref>), PL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pandey, et al.,2021</xref>) and PL15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ochiai, et al.,2010</xref>) families, while other GAGases have a conserved asparagine residue such as the Asn<sup>191</sup> of GAGase II and the Asn<sup>186</sup> of GAGase VII in the corresponding position (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref>). To verify the function of this histidine, His<sup>188</sup> was replaced with alanine and asparagine, respectively, and the results of substrate-specificity analysis showed that the alginate-degrading activity of GAGase III-H188A and H188N was completely abolished but only partially affect its GAG-degrading activity, indicating that the His<sup>188</sup> residue is essential for the alginate-degrading activity of GAGase III (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref>). However, when the asparagine residue at the corresponding position of other GAGases was muted to histidine residue the obtained mutants did not exhibit any alginate-degrading activity (<italic>Supplemental Figure S2</italic>), suggesting that other structural factors that are vital to the alginate-degrading activity of GAGase II remains to determine excepting for the His<sup>188</sup> residue.</p>

<p>GAGases show preference for some specific sulfation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wei, et al.,2024</xref>). For example, GAGases prefer to degrade CS domains composed of non-/6-<italic>O</italic>-sulfated but not 4-<italic>O</italic>-sulfated GalNAc residues and D-GlcA residues. To further investigate the reason why these enzymes have such structural preference for substrates, we tried to prepare the co-crystal of GAGase II or VII with various structure-defined oligosaccharide substrates, but ultimately failed. Therefore, we used molecular docking analysis to preliminarily explore the possible reasons why GAGases have substrate structural preference. To this end, docking assays of GAGase II with a nonsulfated CS Hexa (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc)<sub>3</sub> (PDB code: 2KQO) and a tri-4-<italic>O</italic>-sulfated CS Hexa (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S))<sub>3</sub> (PDB code: 1C4S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sattelle, et al.,2010</xref>) were carried out, respectively. In the docked model, the monosaccharide residues of the substrate were named “+1” and “+2” toward reducing end, and “-1” and “-2” toward non-reducing end from the β1-4 cleavage site following the nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Davies, et al.,1997</xref>). The results show that for the nonsulfated CS Hexa, the GlcUA residue at the “+1” subsite is closely approached by the Tyr<sup>246</sup> residue as a Brønsted base (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref><italic> left</italic>), which facilitates the uptake of the C5 proton of GlcUA by Tyr<sup>246</sup>, and in the case of tri-4-<italic>O</italic>-sulfated CS Hexa, the 4-<italic>O</italic>-sulfate group in GalNAc residue at the “+2” subsite interacts with the neutralizer Asn<sup>192</sup> and the catalytic residue Tyr<sup>246</sup> via hydrogen bonds etc., the C5 proton of GlcUA at the “+1” subsite is away from the key catalytic residue Tyr<sup>246</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref><italic> right</italic>, <italic>Supplemental Figure S3</italic>), which hinders the degradation of CS with such sulfation pattern, as we detected in the biochemical analysis above.

<title>Catalytic mechanism of GAGases</title>
<p>In summary, taking GAGase II as representative, the catalytic process of GAGases is proposed as follows: the negatively charged GAG substrate binds to several positively charged residues, such as Arg<sup>87</sup>, Arg<sup>88</sup>, Arg<sup>94</sup>, His<sup>136</sup>, Asn<sup>191</sup> and Asn<sup>192</sup>, near the catalytic triad residues in the catalytic cavity; the Asn<sup>191</sup> and Asn<sup>192</sup> residues interact with the carboxyl group of GlcUA at the +1 subsite to reduce the p<italic>K</italic>a and promote the protonation of the C5 proton; His<sup>401</sup> works as a proton receptor (Brønsted base) to abstract protons from the C5 position of GlcUA and create an enolate tautomeric; the protonated Tyr<sup>246</sup> (Brønsted acid) provides a proton to the C-4–O-1 glycosidic bond between the “-1” and “+1” subsite; the glycosidic bond is cleaved as an electron transfer occurs from the carboxyl group to form a double bond between C4 and C5 of GlcUA; and a new reducing end and a new unsaturated nonreducing end are recreated; moreover, the degradation of polyM by GAGase III requires the involvement of His<sup>188</sup> residue, which may involve in the neutralization of carboxyl groups in M-blocks in alginate (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>GAG lyases derived from microorganisms, as GAG-specific degrading enzymes, are classified into 13 PL families in the CAZy database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Drula, et al.,2022</xref>). They are not only critical for microorganisms to degrade and utilize GAGs as carbon sources, but also become useful tools for structural and functional studies of GAGs. In contrast, alginate lyases, as alginate-specific degrading enzymes, are classified into 15 PL families in the CAZy database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Drula, et al.,2022</xref>). They are essential for the metabolism of alginate in microorganisms and algae as well as lower marine animals, and have completely different substrate specificities than GAG lyases. Due to the similarity between GAG lyases and alginate lyases in folds, GAG lyases are thought to have originated from the divergent evolution of alginate lyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Garron and Cygler,2014</xref>), but enzymes that exhibit transitional features in function and structure, which would provide direct evidence to support this view, are lacking. On the basis of previous functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wei, et al.,2024</xref>), structural studies of GAGases with HA, CS, HS and even alginate-degrading activities should further provide substantial evidence for the evolution of GAG lyases.</p>
<p>Prior to this study, no member of the PL35 family had been structurally characterized. Here, the structures of GAGase II and VII were determined at resolutions of 1.9 Å and 2.4 Å, respectively, and both exhibit a highly homologous structure of “N-terminal (α/α)<sub>7</sub> toroid and C-terminal two-layer antiparallel β-sheet”, which is also the fold adopted by most structurally known GAG lyases except CSase B in PL6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huang, et al.,1999</xref>), Hepase I in PL13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Han, et al.,2009</xref>) and hyaluronan lyase in PL16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Martinez-Fleites, et al.,2009</xref>). Structural alignment has shown that GAGases share considerable degrees of homology with all GAG/alginate lyases with the (α/α)<sub>n</sub> toroid and antiparallel β-sheet fold in PL8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fethiere, et al.,1999</xref>), PL12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hashimoto, et al.,2014</xref>), PL15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ochiai, et al.,2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhang, et al.,2021</xref>), PL17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park, et al.,2014</xref>), PL21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shaya, et al.,2006</xref>), PL23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sugiura, et al.,2011</xref>) and PL39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ji, et al.,2019</xref>) families, especially the key catalytic triplet residues (Tyr, His and Asn) in their active centers, which are highly conserved; thus, they may share a similar Brønsted base/acid catalytic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garron and Cygler,2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Garron and Cygler,2014</xref>). Notably, GAGases are more structurally homologous to alginate lyases from PL15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ochiai, et al.,2010</xref>), PL17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park, et al.,2014</xref>) and PL39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ji, et al.,2019</xref>) family than to various GAG lyases, which further structurally supports the speculation that GAGases originated from alginate lyases.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, many different GAG/alginate lyases share similar catalytic center sites and the same catalytic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garron and Cygler,2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Garron and Cygler,2014</xref>), but their differences in substrate selectivity and endo-/exolytic manner are mainly attributed to subtle differences in the substrate-binding sites. The recognition of appropriate substrates by PLs mainly depends on the interaction between the positively charged side chains of basic amino acid residues in their substrate-binding sites and the negatively charged carboxyl groups of HexUA residues in substrates. Moreover, compared to the structurally and biochemically characterized members of the PL8, PL12, PL15, PL21 and PL39 families, PL35 family proteins possess a more open and shorter catalytic cavity; thus, PL35 family proteins can more easily accommodate various substrates with different structures but may exhibit a weaker ability to bind and degrade specific substrates. The activities of GAGases towards various GAGs and alginate are much lower than those of GAG or alginate-specific lyases.</p>
<p>In addition, GAGases tend to act on GlcUA-containing HA, CS and HS but not IdoUA-containing DS and Hep, which should result from the absence of a His residue functioning as an <italic>anti</italic>-base in the catalytic cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garron and Cygler,2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shaya, et al.,2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shaya, et al.,2006</xref>). The His residue as an <italic>anti</italic>-base can substitute Tyr to absorb the C5 proton in the IdoUA and ensure that β-elimination is carried out successfully, which is detected in chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase (2Q1F) from PL8 family (His<sup>454</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shaya, et al.,2008</xref>) and heparinase II (2FUQ) from PL21 family (His<sup>202</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shaya, et al.,2006</xref>), and endows these enzymes with a bifunctional activity against GlcUA- and IdoUA-containing GAGs. Notably, GAGase III, the only identified GAGase with alginate-degrading activity, has a unique His<sup>188</sup> residue also conversed in various alginate lyases from PL5, PL15, PL17, PL38 and PL39 families. Mutation assay showed that the His<sup>188</sup> is a key residue for the alginate-degrading activity of GAGase III. However, when a conversed asparagine residue at the corresponding position of other GAGases was replaced by histidine, the muted GAGases still could not act on alginate, indicating that some other unidentified structural factors are also involved in the alginate degradation of GAGase III. Overall, while the substrate-degrading features of GAGases can be preliminarily elucidated structurally, more direct evidence remains to be obtained by detailed structural and biochemical approaches.</p>
<p>In addition, the identification of GAGases may help clarify an inappropriate naming issue regarding the functional module “Hepar_II_III superfamily”. This which functional module is commonly found in not only GAG lyases but also alginate lyases with an “N-terminal (α/α)<sub>n</sub> toroid + C-terminal β-sandwich” structure. Interestingly, however, a large number of identified alginate lyases with the functional module “Hepar_II_III superfamily” do not have the ability to degrade Hep/HS. Historically, due to the importance of Hep as an anticoagulant in clinical application, Hep/HS-related studies including heparinases have received much higher attention than alginate-related studies including alginate lyases, which may be the reason why some sequences in alginate lyases that are homologous to heparinase are annotated named the “Hepar_II_III superfamily” module. From an evolutionary perspective, this “Hepar_II_III superfamily” module might be a conserved functional domain in the divergent evolution process from alginate lyase to GAG lyase. Therefore, it might be more reasonable and accurate for this functional domain to be named as the “alginate lyase superfamily” module, and the presence of this functional module in GAGases with evolutionary transitional characteristics may well support this view.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the first determination of the structure of GAGases not only facilitates the elucidation of the catalytic mechanism of PL35 family enzymes, especially the substrate selection mechanism of GAGases, but also provides potential evidence for the hypothesis that GAG lyase evolved from alginate lyase.</p>

<p>The cloning and induced expression of PL35 family GAGases were described in previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wei, et al.,2024</xref>).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to uncover molecular and structural details underlying the broad substrate specificity of glycosaminoglycan lyases belonging to a specific family (PL35). They determined the crystal structures of two such enzymes, conducted in vitro enzyme activity assays, and a thorough structure-guided mutagenesis campaign to interrogate the role of specific residues. They made progress towards achieving their aims but I see significant holes in data that need to be determined and in the authors' analyses.</p>
<p>Impact on the field:</p>
<p>I expect this work will have a limited impact on the field, although, with additional experimental work and better analysis, this paper will be able to stand on its own as a solid piece of structure-function analysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strengths of the study were the combination of structure and enzyme activity assays, comprehensive structural analysis, as well as a thorough structure-guided mutagenesis campaign.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There were several weaknesses, particularly:</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim to have done an ICP-MS experiment to show Mn2+ binds to their enzyme but did not present the data. The authors could have used the anomalous scattering properties of Mn2+ at the synchrotron to determine the presence and location of this cation (i.e. fluorescence spectra, and/or anomalous data collection at the Mn2+ absorption peak).</p>
<p>(2) The authors have an over-reliance on molecular docking for understanding the position of substrates bound to the enzyme. The docking analysis performed was cursory at best; Autodock Vina is a fine program but more rigorous software could have been chosen, as well we molecular dynamics simulations. As well the authors do not use any substrate/product-bound structures from the broader PL enzyme family to guide the placement of the substrates in the GAGases, and interpret the molecular docking models.</p>
<p>(3) The conclusion that the structures of GAGase II and VII are most similar to the structures of alginate lyases (Table 2 data), and the authors' reliance on DALI, are both questioned. DALI uses a global alignment algorithm, which when used for multi-domain enzymes such as these tends to result in sub-optimal alignment of active site residues, particularly if the active site is formed between the two domains as is the case here. The authors should evaluate local alignment methods focused on the optimization of the superposition of a single domain; these methods may result in a more appropriate alignment of the active site residues and different alignment statistics. This may influence the overall conclusion of the evolutionary history of these PL35 enzymes.</p>
<p>(4) The data on the GAGase III residue His188 is not well interpreted; substitution of this residue clearly impacts HA and HS hydrolysis as well. The data on the impact on alginate hydrolysis is weak, which could be due to the fact that the WT enzyme has poor activity against alginate to start with.</p>
<p>(5) The authors did not use the words &quot;homology&quot;, &quot;homologous&quot;, or &quot;homolog&quot; correctly (these terms mean the subjects have a known evolutionary relationship, which may or may not be known in the contexts the authors used these targets); the words &quot;similarity&quot; and &quot;similar&quot; are recommended to be used instead.</p>
<p>(6) The authors discuss a &quot;shorter&quot; cavity in GAGases, which does not make sense and is not supported by any figure or analysis. I recommend a figure with a surface representation of the various enzymes of interest, with dimensions of the cavity labeled (as a supplemental figure). The authors also do not specifically define what subsites are in the context of this family of enzymes, nor do they specifically label or indicate the location of the subsites on the figures of the GAGase II and IV enzyme structures.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wei et al. present the X-ray crystallographic structures of two PL35 family glycosaminoglycan (GAG) lyases that display a broad substrate specificity. The structural data show that there is a high degree of structural homology between these enzymes and GAGases that have previously been structurally characterized. Central to this are the N-terminal (α/α)7 toroid domain and the C-terminal two-layered β-sheet domain. Structural alignment of these novel PL35 lyases with previously deposited structures shows a highly conserved triplet of residues at the heart of the active sites. Docking studies identified potentially important residues for substrate binding and turnover, and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis paired with enzymatic assays confirmed the importance of many of these residues. A third PL35 GAGase that is able to turn over alginate was not crystallized, but a predicted model showed a conserved active site Asn was mutated to a His, which could potentially explain its ability to act on alginate. Mutation of the His into either Ala or Asn abrogated its activity on alginate, providing supporting evidence for the importance of the His. Finally, a catalytic mechanism is proposed for the activity of the PL35 lyases. Overall, the authors used an appropriate set of methods to investigate their claims, and the data largely support their conclusions. These results will likely provide a platform for further studies into the broad substrate specificity of PL35 lyases, as well as for studies into the evolutionary origins of these unique enzymes</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The crystallographic data are of very high quality, and the use of modern structural prediction tools to allow for comparison of GAGase III to GAGase II/GAGase VII was nice to see. The authors were comprehensive in their comparison of the PL35 lyases to those in other families. The use of molecular docking to identify key residues and the use of site-directed mutagenesis to investigate substrate specificity was good, especially going the extra distance to mutate the conserved Asn to His in GAGase II and GAGase VII.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The structural models simply are not complete. A cursory look at the electron density and the models show that there are many positive density peaks that have not had anything modelled into them. The electron density also does not support the placement of a Mn2+ in the model. The authors indicate that ICP-MS was done to identify the metal, but no ICP-MS data is presented in the main text or supplementary. I believe the authors put too much emphasis on the possibility of GAGase III representing an evolutionary intermediate between GAG lyases and alginate lyases based on a single Asn to His mutation in the active site, and I don't believe that enough time was spent discussing how this &quot;more open and shorter&quot; catalytic cavity would necessarily mean that the enzyme could accommodate a broader set of substrates. Finally, the proposed mechanism does not bring the enzyme back to its starting state.</p>
