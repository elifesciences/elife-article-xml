<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Allergic asthma is a disease driven by T helper 2 (Th2) cells, eosinophilia, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and IgE-secreting B cells. Asthma is largely controlled by corticosteroids and ý2 adregenic receptor agonists that target and relax airway smooth muscle (ASM). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype secreted by naïve B cells is important for class switching but may have other undefined functions.</p>
<p>We investigated the role of IgM in a house dust mite (HDM)-induced Th2 allergic asthma model. We sensitised wild-type (WT) and IgM-deficient (IgM<sup>-/-</sup>) mice with HDM and measured AHR, and Th2 responses. We performed RNA sequencing on the whole lung of WT and IgM<sup>-/-</sup> mice sensitised to saline or HDM. We validated our AHR data on human ASM by deleting genes using CRISPR and measuring contraction by single-cell force cytometry.</p>
<p>We found IgM to be essential in AHR but not Th2 airway inflammation or eosinophilia. RNA sequencing of lung tissue suggested that IgM regulated AHR through modulating brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2-like protein 1 (<italic>Baiap2l1</italic>) and other genes. Deletion of <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> led to a differential reduction in human ASM contraction when stimulated with TNF-α and Acetylcholine, but not IL-13.</p>
<p>These findings have implications for future treatment of asthma beyond current therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is the first antibody isotype expressed during B cell development and the first humoral antibody responder, conserved across all species from zebrafish to humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. IgM can be divided into natural and antigen-induced IgM and can either be membrane-bound IgM-type B cell receptor (BCR) or secreted IgM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Natural IgM plays multiple roles in homeostasis including scavenging and clearance of apoptotic cell debris in conjunction with phagocytic macrophages, B cell survival through tonic signals, lymphoid tissue architecture and prevention of autoimmune diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. At mucosal sites, both natural and antigen-induced IgM play a role in shaping healthy microbiota and IgM repertoire is also shaped by microbiota <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Secreted IgM antigen complexes can connect signals via unique and shared receptors, suggestive of a more pleiotropic role in homeostasis and disease states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Natural IgM and secreted IgM are essential in many infectious and non-infectious diseases including those induced by parasites, fungi, bacterial, viral and autoimmune diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, anti-α-gal IgM and anti-MSP1 directed antibodies are protective against primary and secondary infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Mice deficient of secreted IgM are susceptible to pulmonary <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and <italic>P. carinii</italic> infection partly due to reduced activation of innate and adaptive responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. At mucosal surfaces, IgM promotes healthy gut bacteria that is beneficial for homeostasis such as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Natural and induced secreted IgM produced mainly by B1a cells is protective against <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In these settings, the protective effects of sIgM depended on cytokines IL-1ý and GM-CSF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The involvement of natural or induced IgM in allergic asthma is unknown, despite selective IgM syndrome dominated by asthma patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Asthma is a T helper 2 (Th2) disease characterised by eosinophilic lung inflammation, mucus production, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), Th2 cytokines (interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13) and B cells producing IgE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. IgM is central to class switch recombination that results in IgE class switched B cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We and others recently showed that that the role of B cells in asthma is complex, where the load of the antigen is crucial in their function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Mice deficient of B cells (μMT<sup>-/-</sup>) can mount exaggerated AHR when challenged with house dust mite (HDM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> or ovalbumin (OVA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> partly due to lack of regulatory B cells that dampen AHR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, interleukin 4 receptor alpha signalling in B cells is required for optimal Th2 allergic airway inflammation through regulation of AHR, germinal centre (GC) formation and B effector 2 function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, B cell isotypes show unique functions in allergic asthma, for example IgE and its high affinity receptor, FcεR are redundant in an HDM model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, whereas IgD plays an amplifying and regulatory role in various allergic models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. In this context IgD activate basophils to secrete IL-4 and Th2 induction during the sensitisation stage through binding basophils via galectin-9 and CD44. Once Th2 responses have been amplified, IgD ligation blocked IgE-mediated basophil degranulation through competing for antigen and inhibiting FcεR mediated signalling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. How IgM isotype contributes in the development of allergic asthma is unclear. It is also unclear whether secreted IgM plays different roles compared to membrane bound IgM, which is more likely to undergo class switching to IgE. We challenged mice lacking both membrane and secreted IgM with HDM and other allergens and found a profound reduction in AHR. RNA sequencing of lung tissue showed a downregulation of brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2-like protein 1 (<italic>Baiap2l1</italic>) and erythroid differentiation regulatory factor 1 (<italic>Erdr1</italic>) genes associated with actin cytoskeleton and rearrangement smooth muscle contraction. As a proof of principle, we showed in human smooth muscle cell line that deletion of these genes via CRISPR-resulted in reduction in smooth muscle contraction at a single cell level. These are unexpected functions of secreted, and membrane bound IgM; namely, its involvement in modulating airway smooth muscle contraction.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Mice</title>
<p>IgM-deficient homozygotes mice on Balb/C background and on C57BL/6 background were backcrossed at least 10 generations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Wild type on Balb/C and C57BL/6 backgrounds were used as a littermate control. Mice were housed in independently ventilated cages under specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of Cape Town Animal Facility. All mice were used at eight to 10 weeks of age and animal procedures were performed according to the strict recommendation by the South African Veterinary Council and were approved by the University of Cape Town Animal Ethics Committee (Reference number 014/019, 018/013 and 022/014).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>House Dust-mite induced allergic airway disease</title>
<p>A high dose and a low dose HDM treatment schedule were used to induce symptoms of allergic asthma in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Mice were anaesthetised with ketamine (Anaket-V; Centaur Labs, Johannesburg, South Africa) and xylazine (Rompun; Bayer, Isando, South Africa). For low-dose HDM, mice were sensitised intratracheally (i.t.) on day 0 with 1 µg of HDM (Stellergens Greer Laboratories, Lenoir, U.S.A.) and intranasally challenged with 3 ug HDM on days 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. For high-dose HDM, mice were with HDM 100 ug and challenged with HDM 10 ug. AHR was measured on day 15. After the procedure, mice were euthanised and tissue samples were collected for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Adoptive transfer of naïve B cells</title>
<p>Spleens were collected from naïve congenic CD45.1 Balb/C mice and passed through 40μm strainer to obtain single-cell suspensions. Cells were stained with FITC-B220 and APC-CD19 for 30min at 4°C. A dead cell exclusion dye (7AAD) was added before sorting on BD FACS Aria I to at least 96% purity. 2-5 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> cells were adoptively transferred intravenously (i.v.) into IgM<sup>-/-</sup> recipient mice a day before HDM sensitisation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Adoptive transfer of naïve serum</title>
<p>Naïve wild-type mice were euthanised and blood was collected via cardiac puncture before being spun down (5500rpm, 10min, RT) to collect serum. Serum (200μL) was injected intraperitoneally into IgM-deficient mice, 1 day before sensitisation with HDM. In some experiments, serum was injected intraperitoneally at day -1, 0, and a day before challenges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation</title>
<p>Mice were sensitised intraperitoneally with (50µg in 200µl) of ovalbumin (OVA) adsorbed to 0.65% alum (Sigma-Aldrich, Aston Manor, South Africa) on days 0, 7, 14. On days 23, 24, 25, mice were intranasally challenged with 100µg of OVA under anaesthesia with ketamine (Anaket-V; Centaur Labs, Johannesburg, South Africa) and xylazine (Rompun; Bayer, Isando, South Africa). AHR was measured on day 26. After the procedure, mice were euthanized with halothane and tissue samples collected for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Papain-induced lung inflammation</title>
<p>Mice were anaesthetized with isoflourane (3L/min) briefly before being challenged with 50μL of 25 μg of Papain (Sigma-Aldrich, Aston Manor, South Africa) on days 1, 2 and 3 or PBS. AHR was measured on day 4. After the procedure, mice were euthanized with halothane and tissue samples collected for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Airway Hyperresponsiveness</title>
<p>Airway resistance and elastance of the whole respiratory system (airways, lung chest wall) after intranasal challenge was determined by forced oscillation measurements as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> with the Flexivent system (SCIREQ, Montreal, Canada) by using the single compartment (‘‘snapshot’’) perturbation. Measurements were carried out with increasing doses of acetyl-ý-methylcholine (methacholine, Sigma-Aldrich, Aston Manor, South Africa) (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/mL) for Balb/C or (0, 20, 40, 80 160 and 320 mg/mL) for C57BL/6. Differences in the dose-response curves were analysed by repeated-measures Two-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni post-test. Only mice with acceptable measurements for all doses (coefficient of determination &gt;0.90) were included in the analysis.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Single-cell suspensions were prepared from lymph nodes in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) media (Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom) by passing them through 100µm strainer. To obtain single cell suspensions from lung tissues, a left lobe was digested for 1 hour at 37°C in RPMI containing 13 mg/mL DNase I (Roche, Randburg, South Africa) and 50 U/mL collagenase IV (Gibco, Waltham, Massachusetts) and passed through 70µm strainer. Antibodies used in these experiments included, phycoerythrobilin (PE)-conjugated anti-Siglec-F (clone, E50-2440), anti-IL-5 (clone, TRFK5), anti-CD44 (clone, KM114), anti-T and B cell activation antigen (clone, GL7), anti-CD43 (clone, S7), FITC-conjugated anti-Ly6G (clone, 1A8), anti-IgD (clone, 11-26C2a), IL-4 (clone, 11B11), anti-PD-1-(clone, 29F.1A12), PerCP Cy5.5-conjugated anti-Ly6C (clone, AL-21), -CD45.1 (clone, A20), anti-IL-17 (clone, TC11-18H10), anti-mouse alpha muscle actin (Abcam, ab8211-500), Allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD11c (clone, HL3), anti-CD5 (clone, 53-7.3), BV421 conjugated anti-CD11b (clone, M1/70), anti-CD62L (clone, MEL-14), anti-IgG1 (clone, A110-1), AlexaFlour 700-conjugated anti-CD3ε (clone, 145-2C11) -anti-IFN-γ (clone, XMG1.2), BV510-anti-CD4 (clone, RM4-5) and anti-B220 (clone, RA3-6B2), APC-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD19 (clone, 1D3) and anti-CD8 (clone, 53-6.7), BV786 conjugated anti-IgE (clone, R35-72) and anti-IL-33R (ST2) (clone, U29-93), biotin-conjugated anti-IgM (clone, AF-78), anti-CD95 (clone, Jo2), anti-CD249 (clone, BP-1), anti-CD45 (clone, 30-F11) were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). PE-Cynanine7 anti-F4/80 (clone, BM8), anti-IL-13 (clone, eBio13A), anti-CXCR5 (clone, L138D7), AlexaFlouro 700-conjugated anti-MHC II (clone, M5/114), Rabbit anti-BAIAP2L1 (Abcam, PA554000), Live/dead Fixable Yellow stain (Qdot605 dead cell exclusion dye) were purchased from eBiosciences. Biotin-labelled antibodies were detected by Texas Red conjugated PE (BD Biosciences). PE-Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (Abcam, ab72465) was used to detect Rabbit anti-BAIAP2L1. For staining, cells (1 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>) were stained and washed in PBS, 3% FCS FACS buffer. For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were restimulated with phorbal myristate acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) (50 ng/mL), ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) (250ng/mL), and monensin (Sigma-Aldrich) (200mM in IMDM/10% FCS) for 5h at 37°C then fixed in 2% PFA, permeabilised with Foxp3 transcriptional factor staining buffer kit (eBioscience) before intracellular staining with appropriate cytokine antibodies and acquisition through LSR Fortessa machine (BD Immunocytometry system, San Jose, CA, USA) and data was analysed using Flowjo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR, USA).</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>Left upper lung lobes was fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were stained with periodic acid-Schiff for mucus secretion, and haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain for inflammation. Slides were scanned at 20x magnification on the virtual slide VS120 microscope (Olympus, Japan). Downstream processing of images was done through Image J (FIJI) for image extraction at series 15 and Ilastik software was used for mucus area quantification on whole lung sections.

We used Agilent 2100 Bio analyzer (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit) to do the total RNA sample QC: RNA concentration, RIN value,28S/18S and the fragment length distribution. The first step in the workflow involved purifying the poly-A containing mRNA molecules using poly-T oligo attached magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA was fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments were copied into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. This was followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. These cDNA fragments had addition of a single ’A’ base and subsequent ligation of the adapter. The products were then purified and enriched with PCR amplification. PCR yields were quantified by Qubit and pooled samples together to make a single strand DNA circle (ssDNA circle), which gave the final library. DNA nanoballs (DNBs) were generated with the ssDNA circle by rolling circle replication (RCR) to enlarge the fluorescent signals at the sequencing process. The DNBs were loaded into the patterned nanoarrays and pair-end reads of 100 bp were read through on the DNBseq platform for the following data analysis study. For this step, the DNBseq platform combines the DNA nanoball-based nanoarrays and stepwise sequencing using Combinational Probe-Anchor Synthesis Sequencing Method.</p>

<p>We sensitised and challenged IgM-deficient (IgM<sup>-/-</sup>) and wild-type Balb/c (WT) mice with HDM intratracheally (i.t.) and analysed AHR, lung infiltrates and cytokines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1a). We found moderately reduced resistance and elastance in IgM<sup>-/-</sup> sensitised with a high dose of HDM (100μg) compared to WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Similarly, we also observed a profound reduction in AHR in IgM<sup>-/-</sup> mice sensitised with a low dose of HDM (1μg) compared to WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Interestingly, lung eosinophils were intact at both low dose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and high dose HDM (Supplementary Fig. 1d). We could also show that AHR reduction in IgM<sup>-/-</sup> mice was not allergen-specific, as we observed similar findings using ovalbumin (OVA) complexed to alum adjuvant (Supplementary Fig. 2a-b) and acute papain-induced allergic inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 2c-d). We observed similar finding of profound AHR reduction in IgM<sup>-/-</sup> mice in C57BL/6 background compared to WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 3a). These findings suggested that IgM-deficient mice have profound AHR reduction independent of allergen or mice background strain.</p>

<title>T helper 2 cells are intact in the absence of IgM, and serum transfer can partially restore antibody function</title>
<p>To investigate whether the reduction in AHR was due to reduced Th2 cells and cytokines, we stimulated total mLN and lung cells with anti-CD3 for 5 days or with PMA/ionomycin for 5 hrs in the presence of monensin and measured secreted or intracellular IL-4 and IL-13 expression.

To investigate what drives this reduced AHR in the absence of IgM between secreted antibodies or the IgM B cell receptor on the surface of B cells, we transferred serum from naïve WT mice into IgM<sup>-/-</sup> mice a day before sensitization, during sensitisation and a day before challenge with HDM allergen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.

The redundant role of IgE was consistent with previous studies where IgE nor its high-affinity receptor (FcχRI) were essential in AHR in an HDM or OVA models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.

To understand why we could not reconstitute IgM, we checked for transferred congenic B cells in different organs after reconstitution with WT BM in IgM<sup>-/-</sup> mice and found some engraftment in BM and spleen, but poor engraftment to lung and mLNs which may partially explain our inability to restore AHR in IgM<sup>-/-</sup> mice challenged with HDM (Supplementary Fig. 5d).</p>

We found lower expression levels of BAIAP2L1 in IgM-deficient mice compared to WT mice challenged with HDM by western blotting, although this was not significant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Human Protein Atlas search suggested that BAIAP2L1 is expressed by multiple cell types including fibroblasts, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle and macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We then investigated by immunofluorescence which cell types within the lung could be expressing BAIAP2L1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). We found BAIAP2L1 to be closely expressed within structural cells in close contact to smooth muscle cells (less than 10μm), a cell type known to be essential in bronchoconstriction. Airway smooth muscle together with the extracellular matrix contributes to smooth muscle hypertrophy which causes the narrowing of the airways. These cells by histology appear to be separated due to fixation methods but are mashed together, especially during the remodelling of the airways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. IgM deficiency did not impact this expression in cells in close contact with smooth muscle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Because both western blot and immunofluorescent were inconclusive, we also verified the expression of BAIAP2L1 via flow cytometry (gating in Supplementary Fig. 8a) and found it to be expressed mainly by alpha-smooth muscle cells and increased in expression in HDM treated mice compared to PBS control mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Furthermore, we showed a reduction in BAIAP2L1 expression amongst alpha-smooth muscle cells but not other cells (CD45 positive or alpha-smooth muscle negative cells, Supplementary Fig. 8b) in IgM-deficient mice compared to WT mice treated with HDM, although this did not reach significance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Overall, this data suggested that BAIAP2L1 is reduced at RNA and protein level and likely influenced the reduction of AHR in IgM-deficient mice. This was consistent with gene set enrichment in our RNA seq data where there was a dominance of genes associated with muscle contraction which regulates AHR.</p>

<title>CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> leads to reduced airway smooth muscle contraction at a single cell</title>
<p>To understand how <italic>Baiap2l1</italic>, one of the genes downregulated in IgM-deficient mice, could influence AHR, we resorted to an <italic>in vitro</italic> model that allowed us to measure contraction using fluorescently labelled elastomeric contractible surface (FLECS) technology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). We opted for airway smooth muscle as it has been shown to contribute to the narrowing of the airway during an allergic attack and together with neighbouring cells such as extracellular matrix and immune cells are critical in hypertrophy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. We chose the human bronchial smooth muscle cell (BSMCs) line as <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> is expressed in structural cells including muscle and epithelial cells, and actin together with myosin is essential in muscle contraction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. To this end, we used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to knock down <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> in BSMCs (Supplementary Fig. 9a-b). We also included ERDR1 as one of the genes that were also downregulated in IgM-deficient mice. BSMCs (160 000/well) were stimulated with 10μM acetylcholine (ACh), 10 ng/mL of human TNF-α and 100 ng/mL IL-13, followed by transfection with ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing single guide RNA targeting <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> and Cas9 for 48h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Transfected cells were seeded onto elastomeric patterns, stimulated with the same stimulants for 3h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by staining with DAPI and Phalloidin before imaging on Stellarvision microscope and quantification (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). We validated the deletion of <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> by PCR and showed reduced expression of <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> in ACh and TNF-α stimulated cells transfected with <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> sgRNA when compared to scramble sgRNA (Supplementary Fig. 9c, line 3 and 4 compared to line 5 and 6). We also detected low expression of BAIAP2L1 in unstimulated sgRNA scramble and sgRNA <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. 9c, lines 1 and 2). Transfections with sgRNA did not impact cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 9d). As expected, BSMCs displayed a higher level of contraction in TNF-α or IL-13 stimulated cells compared to unstimulated cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>-d). In BSMCs transfected with sgRNA-<italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> and -<italic>ERDR1</italic>, we saw a significant reduction in contraction levels in TNF-α stimulated cells when compared to scramble sgRNA transfected and stimulated cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, c).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we described an unexpected function of IgM in the regulation of bronchoconstriction. We show by RNA sequencing that in the lung tissue of IgM-deficient mice, there is a reduction in genes (<italic>Baiap2l1</italic> and <italic>Erdr1</italic>) associated with actin cytoskeleton and re-arrangement, a key factor in smooth muscle contraction and AHR. We used single-cell force cytometry and CRISPR-Cas9 technology to validate these genes in the human BSM cell line and show as a proof of concept that deletion of <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> reduced muscle contraction in a stimulant-specific manner.</p>
<p>B cells play a complex role in allergic asthma, earlier studies using B cell-deficient mice showed a redundant role of B cells in OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation and airway hyperreactivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. We and others have recently shown using a more complex allergen HDM relevant to human asthma that antigen load is crucial in B cell function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We explored these possibilities in the context of IgM deficiency and observed a profound reduction in AHR. This was in complete contrast to what has been observed in B cell-deficient mice and in IgE or FcεRI-deficient mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We also found a similar reduction in AHR at higher doses of HDM, albeit less pronounced.</p>
<p>Reduction in AHR was not only specific to HDM, but we also found reduced AHR in IgM-deficient mice sensitised with OVA complexed to alum and challenged with OVA, although less pronounced. AHR reduction in IgM-deficient mice was also seen in the acute papain model which only activates innate responses including innate lymphoid cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Interestingly, this reduction in AHR was not associated with reduced allergic airway inflammation including eosinophilia, mucus production or Th2 cells in all models tested, which was unexpected considering these features are key in AHR. B cell-deficient mice show a reduction in eosinophilia and antigen-specific Th2 cells at low doses of HDM, which leads to reduced AHR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Similar findings are observed in mice lacking IL-4Rα specifically in B cells when challenged with HDM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>IgM deficiency did not impact B cell development in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues and accumulation of follicular and germinal centre B cells. Interestingly, there was a lack of class switching to IgG1 and IgE isotypes despite increased expression of IgD. The lack of class switching to IgG1 and IgE contrasts with earlier reports, which suggested that IgD can largely replace IgM for class switching to other isotypes, resulting in delayed neutralising IgG1 against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. To get a better understanding of which IgM function was responsible for AHR, we showed that the transfer of naïve wild-type mice serum to IgM-deficient mice could restore IgE production and HDM-specific IgE and IgG1. This is consistent with what has been observed in the context of influenza viral infections, where the transfer of purified or serum IgM into B cell-deficient mice restored IgM-induced viral neutralisation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. We believe that naïve sera transferred to IgM-deficient mice were able to bind to the surface of B cells via IgM receptors (FcμR / Fcα/μR), which are still present on IgM-deficient B cells, and this signalling is sufficient to facilitate Class Switch Recombination (CSR). This was also confirmed by the ability of B cells to reach germinal centres in IgM-deficient mice during HDM exposure. Our IgM<sup>-/-</sup> mouse lacks both membrane-bound and secreted IgM, and transferred serum contains at least secreted IgM which can bind to B cell surfaces. Of course, we can’t rule out that transferred sera from WT mice also contains some IgG1 which can facilitate class switching to IgE when transferred to IgM-deficient mice. Despite the ability of wild-type serum to restore IgE, it was not enough to restore AHR, which may be due to the difficulties in restoring IgM to normal levels (200-800 µg). Our findings on the redundant role of IgE were consistent with previous studies where IgE nor its high-affinity receptor (FcχRI) were essential in AHR in an HDM or OVA model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The lack of functional role of serum-transferred IgE was consistent with earlier findings on <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> transfer of immune serum where IgE was found not to be essential in protection against <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> re-infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Our efforts to adoptively transfer wild-type bone marrow or sorted B cells into IgM-deficient mice were also largely unsuccessful partly due to poor engraftment of wild-type B cells into secondary lymphoid tissues. Natural secreted IgM is mainly produced by B1 cells in the peritoneal cavity, and it is likely that any transfer of B cells via bone marrow transfer would not be sufficient to restore soluble levels of IgM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>B cell isotype IgD has been shown to promote Th2 cells and OVA-, papain-and NP-specific humoral responses specifically IgG1 and IgE through basophil activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. IgD has also been shown to inhibit IgE-mediated basophil activation through downregulation of genes associated with cytoskeleton organisation such as signal transducers phosphoinositide-3 kinase, RAS, and RHO <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Our RNA sequencing data showed downregulation of <italic>Baiap2l1</italic> and <italic>Erdr1</italic> in IgM-deficient mice, genes which have been shown to associate with actin cytoskeleton and re-arrangement, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Contraction of the ASM is central to AHR as it controls airway diameter and airflow which can increase resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. ASM activated by cytokines such as IL-13 or TNF-α or bronchoconstrictor ACh induces cytosolic calcium accumulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> release results in a cascade of events that involves kinases and phosphorylation of key molecules such as actin and myosin involved in smooth muscle contraction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Gene set enrichment analysis suggested that genes downregulated in IgM-deficient mice were involved in processes such as muscle contraction, muscle twitching, skeletal muscle movement. As a proof of concept we validated the involvement of <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> in bronchial smooth muscle contraction using a high throughput method that allows us to measure contraction of 1000s of single cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. When we deleted <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> using CRISPR-Cas9, we showed that deletion of <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> in BSMCs reduced smooth muscle contraction when stimulated with TNF-α and ACh, but not IL-13. Deletion of ERDR1 had minor impact on muscle contraction across different stimulants suggesting a stimulant and gene-specific role. IRTKS/BAIAP2L1 has been shown to regulate microvilli elongation by forming a complex with actin-regulating protein EPS8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In this setting IRTKS elongate microvilli via distinct mechanisms that require functional WH2 and SH3 domains, which binds EPS8, an F-actin capping and bundling protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We have not fully dissected how <italic>BAIAP2L1</italic> could be regulated by IgM, but it is clear that through its actions to regulate actin bundling, it is involved in muscle contraction which requires actin and myosin head interaction (summarised in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<p>We speculate that IgM can directly activate smooth muscle cells by binding a number of its surface receptors including FcμR, Fcα/μR and pIgR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. IgM binds to FcμR strictly, but shares Fcα/μR and pIgR with IgA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Both Fcα/μR and pIgR can be expressed by non-structural cells at mucosal sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. We would not rule out that the mechanisms of muscle contraction might be through one of these IgM receptors, especially the ones expressed on smooth muscle cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Certainly, our future studies will be directed towards characterizing the mechanism by which IgM potentially activates the smooth muscle.</p>
<p>We believe these findings report for the first time an independent function of IgM from its natural class switching and non-specific binding to microbial components. We believe that IgM function in regulating ASM may be indirect through other unknown factors but does not involve microbiota as treatment of mice with a mixture of antibiotics did not restore AHR. Early vaccination with bacterial species, such as group <italic>A streptococcus</italic> containing GlcNAc or ý-1,3-glucans can protect adult mice against <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>-induced allergic asthma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. This is mainly through conserved germline-encoded IgM antibodies, which have broad specificities to common allergens containing GlcNAc moieties such as Dermatophytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Together these findings demonstrate for the first time an important function of IgM in regulating airway hyperresponsiveness independent of the presence of T helper 2 allergic inflammation. These findings have implications for future treatment of allergic asthma through bronchodilators.</p>

<p>Studying several allergens in different mouse strains, the authors assess the role of IgM in airway inflammatory responses and show that IgM deficient mice have reduced airway hyperresponsiveness. Although the findings, based on experimental evidence from a wide range of immunological and other assays, including the expression of a protein that regulates actin in smooth cells, are interesting and <bold>useful</bold>, the study is <bold>incomplete</bold> as the data and analyses do not support their primary claims.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Hadebe and colleagues describes a striking reduction in airway hyperresponsiveness in Igm-deficient mice in response to HDM, OVA and papain across the B6 and BALB-c backgrounds. The authors suggest that the deficit is not due to improper type 2 immune responses, nor an aberrant B cell response, despite a lack of class switching in these mice. Through RNA-Seq approaches, the authors identify few differences between the lungs of WT and Igm-deficient mice, but see that two genes involved in actin regulation are greatly reduced in IgM-deficient mice. The authors target these genes by CRISPR-Cas9 in in vitro assays of smooth muscle cells to show that these may regulate cell contraction. While the study is conceptually interesting, there are a number of limitations, which stop us from drawing meaningful conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Fig. 1. The authors clearly show that IgMKO mice have striking reduced AHR in the HDM model, despite the presence of a good cellular B cell response.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Fig. 2.</p>
<p>
The authors characterize the cd4 t cell response to HDM in IGMKO mice.</p>
<p>
They have restimulated medLN cells with antiCD3 for 5 days to look for IL-4 and IL-13, and find no discernible difference between WT and KO mice. The absence of PBS-treated WT and KO mice in this analysis means it is unclear if HDM-challenged mice are showing IL-4 or IL-13 levels above that seen at baseline in this assay. The choice of 5 days is strange, given that the response the authors want to see is in already primed cells. A 1-2 day assay would have been better. It is concerning that the authors state that HDM restimulation did not induce cytokine production from medLN cells, since countless studies have shown that restimulation of medLN would induce IL-13, IL-5 and IL-10 production from medLN. This indicates that the sensitization and challenge model used by the authors is not working as it should. The IL-13 staining shown in panel c is also not definitive. One should be able to optimize their assays to achieve a better level of staining, to my mind.</p>
<p>In d-f, the authors perform a serum transfer, but they only do this once. The half life of IgM is quite short. The authors should perform multiple naïve serum transfers to see if this is enough to induce FULL AHR.</p>
<p>The presence of negative values of total IgE in panel F would indicate some errors in calculation of serum IgE concentrations.</p>
<p>Overall, it is hard to be convinced that IgM-deficiency does not lead to a reduction in Th2 inflammation, since the assays appear suboptimal.</p>
<p>Fig. 3. Gene expression differences between WT and KO mice in PBS and HDM challenged settings are shown. PCA analysis does not show clear differences between all four groups, but genes are certainly up and downregulated, in particular when comparing PBS to HDM challenged mice. In both PBS and HDM challenged settings, three genes stand out as being upregulated in WT v KO mice. these are Baiap2l1, erdr1 and Chil1.</p>
<p>Fig. 4. The authors attempt to quantify BAIAP2L1 in mouse lungs. It is difficult to know if the antibody used really detects the correct protein. A BAIAP2L1-KO is not used as a control for staining, and I am not sure if competitive assays for BAIAP2L1 can be set up. The flow data is not convincing. The immunohistochemistry shows BAIAP2L1 (in red) in many, many cells, essentially throughout the section. There is also no discernible difference between WT and KO mice, which one might have expected based on the RNA-Seq data. So, from my perspective, it is hard to say if/where this protein is located, and whether there truly exists a difference in expression between wt and ko mice.</p>
<p>Fig. 5 and 6. The authors use a single cell contractility assay to measure whether BAIAP2L1 and ERDR1 impact on bronchial smooth muscle cell contractility. I am not familiar with the assay, but it looks like an interesting way of analysing contractility at the single cell level.</p>
<p>
The authors state that targeting these two genes with Cas9gRNA reduces smooth muscle cell contractility, and the data presented for contractility supports this observation. However, the efficiency of Cas9-mediated deletion is very unclear. The authors present a PCR in supp fig 9c as evidence of gene deletion, but it is entirely unclear with what efficiency the gene has been deleted. One should use sequencing to confirm deletion. Moreover, if the antibody was truly working, one should be able to use the antibody used in Fig 4 to detect BAIAP2L1 levels in these cells. The authors do not appear to have tried this.</p>
<p>Other impressions:</p>
<p>
The paper is lacking a link between the deficiency of IgM and the effects on smooth muscle cell contraction.</p>
<p>
The levels of IL-13 and TNF in lavage of WT and IGMKO mice could be analysed.</p>
<p>Moreover, what is the impact of IgM itself on smooth muscle cells? In the Fig. 7 schematic, are the authors proposing a direct role for IgM on smooth muscle cells? Does IgM in cell culture media induce contraction of SMC? This could be tested and would be interesting, to my mind.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper by Sabelo et al. describes a new pathway by which lack of IgM in the mouse lowers bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in response to metacholine in several mouse models of allergic airway inflammation in Balb/c mice and C57/Bl6 mice. Strikingly, loss of IgM does not lead to less eosinophilic airway inflammation, Th2 cytokine production or mucus metaplasia, but to a selective loss of BHR. This occurs irrespective of the dose of allergen used. This was important to address since several prior models of HDM allergy have shown that the contribution of B cells to airway inflammation and BHR is dose dependent.</p>
<p>After a description of the phenotype, the authors try to elucidate the mechanisms. There is no loss of B cells in these mice. However, there is a lack of class switching to IgE and IgG1, with a concomitant increase in IgD. Restoring immunoglobulins with transfer of naïve serum in IgM deficient mice leads to restoration of allergen-specific IgE and IgG1 responses, which is not really explained in the paper how this might work. There is also no restoration of IgM responses, and concomitantly, the phenotype of reduced BHR still holds when serum is given, leading authors to conclude that the mechanism is IgE and IgG1 independent. Wild type B cell transfer also does not restore IgM responses, due to lack of engraftment of the B cells. Next authors do whole lung RNA sequencing and pinpoint reduced BAIAP2L1 mRNA as the culprit of the phenotype of IgM-/- mice. However, this cannot be validated fully on protein levels and immunohistology since differences between WT and IgM KO are not statistically significant, and B cell and IgM restoration are impossible. The histology and flow cytometry seems to suggest that expression is mainly found in alpha smooth muscle positive cells, which could still be smooth muscle cells or myofibroblasts. Next therefore, the authors move to CRISPR knock down of BAIAP2L1 in a human smooth muscle cell line, and show that loss leads to less contraction of these cells in vitro in a microscopic FLECS assay, in which smooth muscle cells bind to elastomeric contractible surfaces.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. There is a strong reduction in BHR in IgM-deficient mice, without alterations in B cell number, disconnected from effects on eosinophilia or Th2 cytokine production</p>
<p>
2. BAIAP2L1 has never been linked to asthma in mice or humans</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. While the observations of reduced BHR in IgM deficient mice are strong, there is insufficient mechanistic underpinning on how loss of IgM could lead to reduced expression of BAIAP2L1. Since it is impossible to restore IgM levels by either serum or B cell transfer and since protein levels of BAIAP2L1 are not significantly reduced, there is a lack of a causal relationship that this is the explanation for the lack of BHR in IgM-deficient mice. The reader is unclear if there is a fundamental (maybe developmental) difference in non-hematopoietic cells in these IgM-deficient mice (which might have accumulated another genetic mutation over the years). In this regard, it would be important to know if littermates were newly generated, or historically bred along with the KO line.</p>
<p>
2. There is no mention of the potential role of complement in activation of AHR, which might be altered in IgM-deficient mice</p>
<p>
3. What is the contribution of elevated IgD in the phenotype of the IgM-deficient mice. It has been described by this group that IgD levels are clearly elevated</p>
<p>
4. How can transfer of naïve serum in class switching deficient IgM KO mice lead to restoration of allergen specific IgE and IgG1?</p>
<p>
5. Alpha smooth muscle antigen is also expressed by myofibroblasts. This is insufficiently worked out. The histology mentions &quot;expression in cells in close contact with smooth muscle&quot;. This needs more detail since it is a very vague term. Is it in smooth muscle or in myofibroblasts.</p>
<p>
6. Have polymorphisms in BAIAP2L1 ever been linked to human asthma?</p>
<p>
7. IgM deficient patients are at increased risk for asthma. This paper suggests the opposite. So the translational potential is unclear.</p>
