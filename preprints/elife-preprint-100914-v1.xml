<title>Abstract</title><p>Copper is an essential enzyme cofactor in bacteria, but excess copper is highly toxic. Bacteria can cope with copper stress by increasing copper resistance and initiating chemorepellent response. However, it remains unclear how bacteria coordinate chemotaxis and resistance to copper. By screening proteins that interacted with the chemotaxis kinase CheA, we identified a copper-binding repressor CsoR that interacted with CheA in <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic>. CsoR interacted with the HPT (P1), Dimer (P3), and HATPase_c (P4) domains of CheA and inhibited CheA autophosphorylation, resulting in decreased chemotaxis. The copper-binding of CsoR weakened its interaction with CheA, which relieved the inhibition of chemotaxis by CsoR. In addition, CsoR bound to the promoter of copper-resistance genes to inhibit gene expression, and copper-binding released CsoR from the promoter, leading to increased gene expression and copper resistance. <italic>P. putida</italic> cells exhibited a chemorepellent response to copper in a CheA-dependent manner, and CsoR inhibited the chemorepellent response to copper. Besides, the CheA-CsoR interaction also existed in proteins from several other bacterial species. Our results revealed a mechanism by which bacteria coordinately regulated chemotaxis and resistance to copper by CsoR.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemotaxis is a widespread ability of motile bacteria to direct their movement towards higher concentrations of beneficial chemicals or lower concentrations of toxic chemicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Chemotaxis plays a vital role in bacterial exploration and adaptation to complex environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The chemotaxis signaling pathway is extensively studied in the enteric bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the chemotaxis system consists of five methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) and six core components (the kinase CheA, the response regulator CheY, the coupling protein CheW, the methylesterase CheB, the phosphatase CheZ, and the methyltransferase CheR). In response to decreased attractant or increased repellent, methylated MCPs and the coupling protein CheW activate CheA autophosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The phosphorylated CheA (CheA-P) is a phosphodonor for the response regulator CheY and the methylesterase CheB. After CheY accepts the phosphate group from CheA, it binds FliM and FliN of the motor-switch complex, resulting in a switch in the flagellar rotational direction and bacteria tumbling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, on a slower timescale, phosphorylated CheB demethylates the active MCPs, thus reducing their ability to activate CheA, leading to decreased levels of phosphorylated CheY and less tumbling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The phosphatase CheZ contributes to signal termination by removing the phosphoryl group from phosphorylated CheY, and the methyltransferase CheR contributes to signal adaptation by catalyzing the methylation of MCPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Among the bacterial chemotaxis system components, the kinase CheA is a five-domain enzyme central to the chemotaxis signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The five domains (P1-P5) of CheA each have distinct functions. The P1 domain (HPT domain) contains the phosphoryl-accepting histidine that becomes phosphorylated, the P2 domain (CheY-binding domain) docks the response regulator proteins CheY and CheB, the P3 domain (Dimer domain) dimerizes the CheA protein, the P4 domain (HATPase_c domain) binds ATP and catalyzes phosphoryl transfer to the histidine residue on P1, and the P5 domain (CheW-binding domain) couples CheA to other chemotaxis components by binding both CheW and the chemoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Except for interacting with the components in chemotaxis system, CheA is reported to interact with proteins from other systems. For example, in the plant pathogen <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzicola</italic>, CheA interacts with and phosphorylates the response regulator VemR to regulate bacterial virulence, motility, and EPS production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>, a polarly localized protein ParP interacts with CheA and prevents its dissociation from chemotaxis signaling arrays, facilitating proper chemotaxis and accurate inheritance of these macromolecular chemotactic machines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In <italic>Comamonas testosteroni</italic>, CheA interacts with and phosphorylates the response regulator FlmD, resulting in decreased biofilm formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In <italic>Azospirillum brasilense</italic> with two chemotaxis signaling systems, the kinase CheA from each chemotaxis signaling system physically interacts with the CheY response regulator of another system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, CheA interacts with the phosphodiesterase DipA to regulate its subcellular localization and activity, leading to individual cell heterogeneity and motility behavior diversity in bacterial populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These studies suggest that the CheA-mediated crosstalk between chemotaxis and other systems coordinates complex behaviors in diverse bacteria.</p>
<p>In most living organisms, copper is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in fundamental processes such as respiration and photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, copper also has toxic effects on cells, and bacteria have several strategies to increase their resistance to copper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The direct bacterial response associated with copper resistance is highly conserved and generally involves (a) sensing of the increased copper concentration by sensors, (b) activation of bespoke transcriptional networks, (c) overproduction of copper efflux pumps that secrete copper out of the cells, and (d) recruitment of copper-binding and copper-oxidizing proteins that prevent copper from interacting with cellular components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In addition to the above copper resistance strategies, bacteria can avoid copper stress through chemotaxis. For example, in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, the reactive oxygen species derived from cytoplasmic copper ions mediate the bacterial chemotaxis to copper, and a potential cytoplasmic MCP McpR regulates bacterial chemotaxis in response to cellular copper content, enabling bacteria to escape from copper-rich environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, unlike the widely reported mechanisms of copper resistance in diverse bacterial species, the mechanism(s) of bacterial chemotaxis to copper is poorly studied. Besides, it remains unclear how bacteria coordinate chemotaxis and resistance to copper.</p>
<p>Since the kinase CheA plays a central role in chemotaxis signaling, identifying CheA-interacting proteins would extend the knowledge of chemotaxis regulation. In this study, by screening proteins that interacted with CheA in <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic>, we obtained 16 novel CheA-interacting proteins. Among the 16 proteins, CsoR, a copper-binding transcription regulator, inhibited the autophosphorylation of CheA, leading to decreased chemotaxis. Meanwhile, CsoR functioned as a DNA-binding repressor to inhibit the expression of copper-resistance genes. Copper-binding of CsoR relieved its inhibition of gene expression and chemotaxis.</p>

<title>Identification of new CheA-interacting proteins in <italic>P. putida</italic></title>
<p>We performed a pull-down assay to identify protein(s) interacting with CheA. Purified 6 Ã His-tagged CheA bound onto a Ni-NTA agarose column was used as âbaitâ protein to pull out potential CheA-interacting âpreyâ protein(s) from whole cell lysate of <italic>P. putida</italic> KT2440, and a blank Ni-NTA agarose column was used as a negative control. All âpreyâ proteins from the CheA-binding column and control column were collected, resolved by SDSâPAGE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). In MS analysis, 43 proteins showed a significantly higher amount in the CheA-binding column than in the control column (Log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) &gt; 2) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, Table S1). As expected, the âbaitâ protein CheA showed the highest amount, with a Log2(fold change) value close to 8. Meanwhile, the response regulator CheY and the phosphatase CheZ (two proteins known to be associated with CheA) also showed high Log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) values. In addition to these three proteins (CheA, CheY, and CheZ), the remaining 40 proteins were considered potential new CheA-interacting proteins.</p>

<p>To verify the above result, we performed bacterial two-hybrid (BTH) assay to test the interactions between CheA and the 40 proteins. The results from the BTH assay revealed that 19 proteins showed apparent interaction with CheA, including PP_2969 (CsoR), PP_1612 (Eno), PP_4111 (FusB), PP_5046 (GlnA), PP_1074 (GlpR), PP_4728 (GrpE), PP_0853 (IspG), PP_1877 (MsrC), PP_2378 (NfuA), PP_1023 (Pgl), PP_5006 (PhaD), PP_0691 (ProB), PP_0148, PP_1644, PP_2683, PP_3177, PP_3227, PP_3501, and PP_4460 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Meanwhile, the rest 21 proteins displayed no significant interaction with CheA in BTH assay (Fig. S1a and S1b), suggesting that they were false positive results in the pull-down assay. We further tested the interactions between CheA and the 19 proteins in <italic>P. putida</italic> using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. The results displayed that except three proteins (PP_2683, PP_3227, and PP_4460) showed no apparent interaction with CheA, the other 16 proteins displayed obvious interaction with CheA in the BiFC assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, Fig. S2). Collectively, using pull-down, BTH, and BiFC assays, we identified 16 new CheA-interacting proteins in <italic>P. putida</italic>, including CsoR, Eno, FusB, GlnA, GlpR, GrpE, IspG, MsrC, NfuA, Pgl, PhaD, ProB, PP_0148, PP_1644, PP_3177, and PP_3501.</p>

<title>Effect of CheA-interacting proteins on bacterial chemotaxis</title>
<p>Since CheA played a crucial role in bacterial chemotaxis, we wondered whether the 16 CheA-interacting proteins were involved in regulating chemotaxis. Thus, we overexpressed each of the 16 proteins in wild-type <italic>P. putida</italic> and tested the chemotaxis ability. The wild-type <italic>P. putida</italic> harboring empty vector (WT+pVec) was used as the control. Chemotaxis ability was assessed using semisolid nutrient agar plates on which bacteria formed large colonies (swimming zone) by generating and following attractant gradients leading outward from the colony origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Growth of the 16 strains in liquid medium showed a similar trend as that of the control strain (Fig. S3), suggesting that the 16 proteins had no noticeable effect on bacterial growth. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, five strains (WT+p<italic>csoR</italic>, WT+p<italic>ispG</italic>, WT+p<italic>nfuA</italic>, WT+p<italic>phaD</italic>, and WT+p<italic>PP_1644</italic>) displayed smaller colony than the control strain (WT+pVec), indicating a weaker chemotaxis ability in these five strains. The other 11 strains showed a similar chemotaxis ability as WT+pVec. These results suggested that five CheA-interacting proteins (CsoR, IspG, NfuA, PhaD, and PP_1644) inhibited chemotaxis in <italic>P. putida</italic>.</p>

<title>CsoR and PhaD inhibit CheA autophosphorylation</title>
<p>CheA has autophosphorylation activity, and it can phosphorylate its cognate response regulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. To test whether phosphate transfer existed between CheA and the 16 proteins, we performed a phosphate transfer assay using purified proteins and [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP[Î³P]. We successfully purified 14 out of the 16 proteins but failed to purify two proteins (GlpR and PP_3177) after several attempts. Thus, the two proteins were not included in the phosphate transfer assay. The results showed that CheA exhibited a strong autophosphorylation signal after incubation with [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP[Î³P] for 45 min (Fig. S4a). Then, each of the 14 proteins or CheY (positive control) was added to phosphorylated CheA to investigate the phosphate transfer. The addition of CheY to phosphorylated CheA led to a labeling of CheY and a reduction in the phospholabeling of CheA (Fig. S4a), indicating a phosphate transfer happened between CheA and CheY. However, no labeling of the 14 target proteins was observed, and there was no apparent change in the phospholabeling of CheA after adding each of the 14 proteins (Fig. S4a), suggesting no phosphate transfer happened between CheA and the 14 tested proteins.</p>
<p>Then, we wondered whether the 14 proteins influenced CheA autophosphorylation. To answer this question, we mixed CheA with each of the 14 proteins before adding the substrate [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP[Î³P]. The mixture containing CheA and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a negative control. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, CsoR/PhaD significantly decreased the phospholabeling of CheA. In contrast, the other 12 proteins and BSA had no apparent influence on the phospholabeling of CheA. We further tested the impact of CsoR/PhaD on CheA autophosphorylation with a more detailed assay, in which CheA was mixed with an increased amount of CsoR/PhaD. The results showed that CheA phospholabeling decreased as CsoR/PhaD increased. In contrast, the increase of BSA had no obvious influence on CheA phospholabeling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). These results indicated that CsoR and PhaD inhibited CheA autophosphorylation. It was also possible that CsoR and PhaD degraded the substrate[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP[Î³P] in the reaction mixture, resulting in decreased CheA autophosphorylation. To test this possibility, we examined whether CsoR and PhaD had ATPase activity. The known ATPase FleQ was used as a positive control, and BSA was used as a negative control. The results showed that adding FleQ into the reaction mixture caused a decrease in ATP level (Fig. S4b), indicating the existence of ATPase activity. Meanwhile, the addition of CsoR/PhaD exhibited no apparent influence on ATP level as the addition of BSA (Fig. S4b), suggesting that CsoR and PhaD had no ATPase activity.</p>
<p>In the chemotaxis signaling pathway, CheA transfers the phosphate group to the response regulator CheY to modulate flagellar rotation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Since CsoR and PhaD interacted with CheA, we wondered whether CsoR/PhaD influenced the phosphate transfer between CheA and CheY. Thus, we incubated CsoR/PhaD with the phosphorylated CheA before adding CheY to the reaction mixture. The results revealed that CheA phospholabeling in the CsoR/PhaD-adding group reduced to a similar level as that in the group without CsoR/PhaD (Fig. S4c), implying that CsoR/PhaD had no apparent influence on the phosphate transfer between CheA and CheY.</p>

<title>The domains of CheA involved in interacting with CsoR and PhaD</title>
<p>To further explore how CsoR and PhaD affect CheA autophosphorylation, we determined the domain(s) of CheA involved in interacting with CsoR and PhaD. Similar to the <italic>E. coli</italic> CheA, the <italic>P. putida</italic> CheA consists of five domains with distinct functions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We constructed five truncated CheA variants, with each missing one domain (termed CheA<sub>ÎHPT</sub>/CheA<sub>ÎYB</sub>/CheA<sub>ÎDim</sub>/CheA<sub>ÎHATPase</sub>/CheA<sub>ÎWB</sub>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Then we performed BTH assay to test the interaction between CsoR/PhaD and each of these truncated CheAs. The results revealed that three truncated CheAs (CheA<sub>ÎHPT</sub>, CheA<sub>ÎDim</sub>, and CheA<sub>ÎHATPase</sub>) showed no interaction with CsoR and PhaD. In comparison, the other two truncated CheAs (CheA<sub>ÎYB</sub> and CheA<sub>ÎWB</sub>) interacted with CsoR and PhaD with a similar intensity as the wild-type CheA did (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), indicating that the HPT (P1), Dimer (P3), and HATPase_c (P4) domains were essential for interacting with CsoR and PhaD, while the YB (P2) and WB (P5) domains were not required to interact with CsoR and PhaD. To further test this result, we cloned each of the five domains into a BTH vector and tested the interaction between CsoR/PhaD and each of the five domains. The result showed that the Dimer domain (Dim<sub>CheA</sub>) interacted with CsoR and PhaD like the whole-length CheA did (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The HPT domain (HPT<sub>CheA</sub>) and the HATPase_c domain (HATPase<sub>CheA</sub>) showed a weaker interaction with CsoR and PhaD. Meanwhile, the YB domain (YB<sub>CheA</sub>) and the WB domain (WB<sub>CheA</sub>) displayed no interaction with CsoR and PhaD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Together, these results revealed that the Dimer domain (P1) of CheA played a significant role, the HPT (P3) and HATPase_c (P4) domains played a minor role, while the CheY-binding (P2) and CheW-binding (P5) domains played no role in the interaction between CheA and CsoR/PhaD. Since the three domains involved in interacting with CsoR/PhaD were also essential for CheA autophosphorylation activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, CsoR/PhaD might inhibit CheA autophosphorylation by inhibiting the function of the three domains.</p>

<p>Of the two proteins that inhibit CheA autophosphorylation, CsoR is annotated as a metal-binding transcriptional repressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The homolog of CsoR in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> binds to copper and regulates the expression of copper-resistance genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.

Six metal ions were involved in the assay, including copper (Cu<sup>2+</sup>), zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>), nickel (Ni<sup>2+</sup>), cobalt (Co<sup>2+</sup>), cadmium (Cd<sup>2+</sup>), and magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>). The results revealed that CsoR bound to three out of the six tested metal ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>), and the binding to Cu<sup>2+</sup> was the strongest with a calculated binding constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of 5.5 Â± 1.98 Î¼M. In contrast, the binding to Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> was weak (with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of 125 Â± 38 Î¼M and 253 Â± 42 Î¼M, respectively) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Meanwhile, CsoR showed no apparent binding to Co<sup>2+</sup>/Cd<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> under the same condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). We further constructed a <italic>csoR</italic> deletion mutant (Î<italic>csoR</italic>) and investigated the effect of <italic>csoR</italic> deletion on the expression of copper-resistant genes using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Three key copper-resistant-related genes (<italic>copA-I</italic>, <italic>copA-II</italic>, and <italic>copB-II</italic>) from two copper-resistant-related operons were chosen as targets in qRT-PCR. The results showed that <italic>csoR</italic> deletion (Î<italic>csoR+</italic>pVec) led to a weak but significant increase (about 1.3-fold) in the expression of the three genes, and complementation (Î<italic>csoR+</italic>p<italic>csoR</italic>) decreased the expression of the three genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The addition of CuCl<sub>2</sub> (final concentration 10 Î¼M) induced the expression of the three genes (about 5-fold) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). However, no noticeable difference in gene expression level was observed between WT+pVec and Î<italic>csoR</italic>+pVec, as well as between Î<italic>csoR</italic>+pVec and Î<italic>csoR+</italic>p<italic>csoR</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), implying that CsoR was not required for the copper-induced genes expression.

<title>Copper inhibits the interaction between CheA and CsoR</title>
<p>Since CsoR interacted with CheA and bound copper, we wondered whether copper affected the interaction between CheA and CsoR. Thus, we investigated the interaction between CheA and CsoR under different CuCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations using MST.

<p>A previous study on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CsoR revealed three residues that played a vital role in copper-binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The alignment assay showed that the three residues were conserved among CsoR homologs from several bacterial species, including the <italic>P. putida</italic> CsoR (Fig. S5a). To test the role of the three residues in copper-binding, we individually replaced each of the three residues (Cys40, His65, and Cys69) with alanine and tested the copper-binding ability of these mutated CsoRs (CsoR<sub>C40A</sub>, CsoR<sub>H65A</sub>, and CsoR<sub>C69A</sub>). MST results showed that the CsoR<sub>C69A</sub> displayed significantly decreased copper-binding ability compared to wild-type CsoR. In contrast, CsoR<sub>C40A</sub> and CsoR<sub>H65A</sub> showed a slight decrease in copper-binding ability compared with that of the wild-type CsoR (Fig. S5b), suggesting that the Cys69 residue of CsoR played a critical positive role in copper-binding. Besides, the results from EMSA also supported this conclusion, in which the mutation of C69A, but not C40A/H65A, noticeably inhibited the effect of Cu<sup>2+</sup> on CsoR-DNA interaction (Fig. S5c and S5d). BTH assay revealed that the three point-mutated CsoRs interacted with CheA with a similar intensity to the wild-type CsoR (Fig. S5e). Results from the pull-down assay showed that the addition of Cu<sup>2+</sup> significantly decreased the amount of CsoR<sub>C40A</sub> and CsoR<sub>H65A</sub> bound by CheA, but had less effect on the amount of CsoR<sub>C69A</sub> bound by CheA under the same condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>).

<title>Copper relives the inhibition of CsoR on bacterial chemotaxis</title>
<p>Since CsoR interacted with CheA and inhibited its autophosphorylation, and copper hindered the interaction between CheA and CsoR, we speculated that copper might relieve the inhibition of CsoR on CheA autophosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we added CsoR and copper to the reaction mixture containing CheA and then analyzed the autophosphorylation of CheA using [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP[Î³P]. CsoR alone significantly inhibited CheA autophosphorylation, while adding CsoR and copper showed weaker inhibition on CheA autophosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Besides, CsoR<sub>C69A</sub> showed similar inhibitory effects on CheA autophosphorylation in the presence and absence of Cu<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>), indicating that binding with CsoR was the prerequisite for Cu<sup>2+</sup> to relieve the inhibition of CsoR on CheA autophosphorylation.</p>
<p>We further tested the effect of CsoR on chemotaxis in the presence of copper using the semisolid plate. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, in the absence of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, the overexpression of point-mutated CsoR (CsoR<sub>C40A</sub>/CsoR<sub>H65A</sub>/CsoR<sub>C69A</sub>) led to a similar decrease (about 40%) in chemotaxis as the overexpression of wild-type CsoR. In comparison, in the presence of 200 Î¼M Cu<sup>2+</sup>, the inhibitory effect of CsoR/CsoR<sub>C40A</sub>/CsoR<sub>H65A</sub> overexpression on chemotaxis was weaker (about 20%). However, the inhibitory effect of CsoR<sub>C69A</sub> overexpression on chemotaxis was not affected by Cu<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>).

<title>CsoR inhibits chemorepellent response to copper</title>
<p>Excess copper is toxic to cells, and bacteria avoid high copper concentrations through chemotaxis. Since CsoR interacted with CheA and inhibited chemotaxis, we wondered about the role of CsoR in bacterial chemotaxis to copper. Thus, we tested the chemotaxis response of <italic>P. putida</italic> to copper gradient and the role of CsoR and CheA in this response using semisolid plates. The copper gradient was achieved by placing an agar plug containing 200 mM CuCl<sub>2</sub> in the center of a semisolid plate, and bacterial cells were spotted two centimeters away from the plug to test their chemotaxis to Cu<sup>2+</sup>. An agar plug without CuCl<sub>2</sub> was also placed in the center of a semisolid plate and used as a negative control. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, the swimming zone of all tested strains was a circle shape in the control plate without CuCl<sub>2</sub>. However, all swimming zones showed an oval shape in the plate with CuCl<sub>2</sub> gradient (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>), in which the bacterial movement distance near the plug (D1) was short, and the movement distance from the plug (D2) was long, indicating that the strains showed chemorepellent response to CuCl<sub>2</sub>. The RI value (Response index value, RI=D1/(D1+D2)) was further calculated to characterize the strength of the chemorepellent response to CuCl<sub>2</sub>. The results showed that WT+p<italic>csoR</italic> displayed a higher RI value (0.428 Â± 0.015) than WT+pVec (0.373 Â± 0.021) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>).

Together with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, we proposed a potential model to describe the function of CsoR in regulating copper resistance and bacterial chemotaxis. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, under low copper levels, CsoR molecules exist mainly in none copper-binding status (free CsoR) in the cell, and the free CsoR forms tetramer and binds to promoters of copper-resistance genes (such as <italic>copA-I</italic>), leading to repressed gene transcription and copper resistance ability. Meanwhile, the free CsoR interacts with CheA and inhibits its autophosphorylation, decreasing bacterial chemotaxis ability. Under high copper levels, more copper-binding CsoR molecules exist, and copper-binding changes the conformation of the CsoR tetramer and releases CsoR from promoters, leading to increased gene transcription and copper resistance. Besides, the copper-binding of CsoR decreases the interaction between CsoR and CheA, which relieves the inhibition of CsoR on CheA autophosphorylation, resulting in increased chemotaxis ability.</p>

<p>In classical chemotaxis signaling, MCP on the cell membrane senses external signaling molecules and regulates bacterial chemotaxis by mediating CheA autophosphorylation activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. MCPs can directly bind diverse external signaling molecules, such as amino acids, dipeptides, sugars, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, aromatic molecules, and inorganic phosphate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. However, there are only a few reports on the relationship between MCP and metal ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, and no evidence supports that MCP senses metal ions by direct binding. It is possible that bacteria sense and trigger chemotaxis to metal ions differently from that they sense and trigger chemotaxis to external signaling molecules like amino acids. Our results provide a mechanism by which bacteria sense copper and regulate chemotaxis via the copper-responsive repressor CsoR. Through the interaction between CsoR and CheA, bacteria coordinately regulated chemotaxis and resistance to copper stress, which would favor the bacteria to better adapt to complex environments. Besides, the interaction between CsoR and CheA was not limited to the proteins from <italic>P. putida</italic>, and it was also found in proteins from several other bacterial species (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), implying that the regulation of chemotaxis and resistance to copper via the interaction between CsoR and CheA might be a widespread regulatory mechanism.</p>
<p>Although the <italic>P. putida</italic> CsoR functioned as a copper-responsive regulator to modulate the expression of copper-resistance genes, its effect on gene expression was much weaker than its homologous protein in other bacterial species. In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>C. glutamicum</italic>, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, deletion of <italic>csoR</italic> resulted in an about 10-fold increase in the expression of target genes in the absence of copper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In contrast, deletion of <italic>csoR</italic> in <italic>P. putida</italic> led to a slight but reproducible increase (about 1.3-fold) in gene expression in the absence of copper (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). This difference might be attributed to the existence of several key regulators that activated the expression of copper-resistance genes in response to copper in <italic>P. putida</italic>, such as CueR and CopR. CueR positively regulated the expression of <italic>cueA</italic>, encoding a copper-transporting P1-type ATPase that played a crucial role in copper resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. CopR was essential for expressing several genes implicated in cytoplasmic copper homeostasis, such as <italic>copA-II</italic>, <italic>copB-II</italic>, and <italic>cusA</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The existence of these positive regulators makes the function of CosR a secondary or even dispensable insurance in the expression of copper-resistance genes. Consistent with this, there is no CosR homolog in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and copper homeostasis in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is mainly controlled by CueR and CopR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Through pull-down, BTH, and BiFC assays, we obtained 16 new CheA-interacting proteins involved in different physiological processes (Table S1). Among the 16 proteins, five proteins (CsoR, IspG, NfuA, PhaD, and PP_1644) inhibited bacterial chemotaxis on semisolid plates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Our study here focused on the physiological role of CsoR-CheA interaction. Still, the function of other interactions remained unclear. PhaD is a TetR family transcriptional regulator that behaves as a carbon source-dependent activator of the <italic>pha</italic> cluster related to polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Bacterial PHAs are isotactic polymers synthesized under unfavorable growth conditions in the presence of excess carbon sources. PHAs are critical in central metabolism, acting as dynamic carbon reservoirs and reducing equivalents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. The interaction between PhaD and CheA leads one to speculate that there might be some connection between PHA synthesis and bacterial chemotaxis. Another CheA-interacting protein, PP_1644, also attracts our interest. PP_1644 is annotated as a NAD(P)H dehydrogenase involved in cyclic electron transport and respiration processes. Exploring the physiological role of the interaction between CheA and these proteins in the future helps to reveal the association between the chemotaxis process and other physiological metabolisms.</p>

<p>The routine cloning of DNA fragments into plasmid was performed by following a T5 exonuclease-dependent method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>.

Primers used for plasmid construction are listed in Supplementary Table S3. All cloning steps involving PCR were verified by commercial sequencing (Tsingke, Wuhan, China).</p>
<p>Gene deletion mutant was constructed by homologous recombination using the suicide plasmid pBBR401. For example, to construct a markerless <italic>P. putida csoR</italic> deletion mutant, ~800 bp from the chromosomal regions flanking <italic>csoR</italic> (upstream region and downstream region) were PCR-amplified. The PCR products were cloned into pBBR401 to create pBBR401-<italic>csoR</italic>UP-DOWN. Then, the final plasmid was transferred to <italic>P. putida</italic> by electroporation. The integration strain was selected on plates containing gentamicin.

To construct a vector for target protein expression and purification, we amplified and cloned the target gene into pET-28a with 6 Ã His tag or pHS-Strep with Strep II tag. Overlapping PCR was used to create point mutations of CsoR. To construct a C40A point mutation in CsoR, we amplified two fragments with two primer pairs (CsoR<sub>C40A</sub> s1/CsoR<sub>C40A</sub> a1 and CsoR<sub>C40A</sub> s2/CsoR<sub>C40A</sub> a2). The CsoR<sub>C40A</sub> a1 and the CsoR<sub>C40A</sub> s2 shared reverse complementary sequences containing the point mutation in which the original TGC codon of arginine was replaced by GCC of alanine.

<title>Bacterial chemotaxis assay</title>
<p>The chemotaxis ability of <italic>P. putida</italic> strains was assessed by using semisolid plate and Âµ-slide Chemotaxis plate (Ibidi 80326, Germany). For the method with semisolid plates, an agar plug (1% agar) containing 200 mM CuCl<sub>2</sub> was placed in the center of a LB semisolid plate (0.25% agar) and left at room temperature for 12 h to achieve a CuCl<sub>2</sub> gradient on the semisolid plate. An agar plug without CuCl<sub>2</sub> was also placed in the center of a semisolid plate and used to test bacterial chemotaxis without copper. For the assay to investigate the effect of copper on bacterial chemotaxis, 200 Î¼M CuCl<sub>2</sub> (final concentration) was mixed with semisolid LB before making a semisolid plate. Overnight growth <italic>P. putida</italic> cells were washed and resuspended with fresh M9 medium and adjusted to the same optical density (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5). Then, 2 Î¼L of resuspended cultures was spotted 2 centimeters away from the agar plug/plate center, and the plate was incubated for 16 h (for the control plate) or 18 h (for the copper-containing plate) at 28 Â°C before digital photographs were taken. The distance from the point of inoculation to the edge of the colony growth closest to the agar plug (D1) and the distance from the point of inoculation to the edge of the colony growth farthest from the agar plug (D2) were measured. The response index (RI) value was calculated to characterize the bacterial response to CuCl<sub>2</sub> as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The RI was calculated using the following equation: RI = D1/(D1 + D2). RI values greater than 0.52 and less than 0.48 correspond to attractant and repellent responses, and intermediate values represent nonresponses.</p>
<p>For the method with Âµ-slide Chemotaxis plate (a commercially available microfluidic device with a channel connecting two reservoirs), the reservoirs were filled with the two bacterial solutions (with or without CuCl<sub>2</sub>) following a modified version of the manufacturerâs âFast Methodâ protocol. Briefly, overnight cultures were inoculated with M9 medium and grown at 28 Â°C, 180 rpm, until they reached an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) between 0.3 and 0.35. 1 ml of bacterial culture was washed twice with fresh M9 medium by centrifugation (3 min at 3000 rpm), and finally diluted to a target OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.015 with fresh M9 supplemented with 0.01% Tween 20, with or without 2 mM CuCl<sub>2</sub> for injection into the chemotaxis device. First, the entire device was overfilled with buffer free of CuCl<sub>2</sub> or bacteria through the filling ports, and then the central channelâs ports were closed with plugs. About 65 Âµl was removed from one reservoir, replaced by 65 Âµl of CuCl<sub>2</sub>-free bacterial solution, and then this reservoirâs ports were closed. Finally, all liquid was removed from the other reservoir and replaced with a bacterial solution containing CuCl<sub>2</sub>. For control measurements, neither bacterial solution contained CuCl<sub>2</sub>. Phase contrast microscopy recordings were obtained at room temperature on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope using an sCMOS camera (PCO Edge 4.2) and a 40 x objective lens. Recordings were obtained starting from 20 min after filling the device. Three 15 s-long recordings of cells in the observation area were obtained at 15 fps.

<p>Data presented in this <bold>useful</bold> report suggest a potentially new model for chemotaxis regulation in the gram-negative bacterium P. putida. Data supporting interactions between CheA and the copper-binding protein CsoR, reveal potential mechanisms for coordinating chemotaxis and copper resistance. There was, however concern about the large number of CheA interactors identified in the initial screen and it was felt that the study was <bold>incomplete</bold> without a substantial number of additional experiments to test the model and bolster the authors' conclusions.</p>

<p>This report contains two parts. In the first part, several experiments were carried out to show that CsoR binds to CheA, inhibits CheA phosphorylation, and impairs P. putida chemotaxis. The second part provides some evidence that CsoR is a copper-binding protein, binds to CheA in a copper-dependent manner, and regulates P. putida response to copper, a chemorepellent. Based on these results, a working model is proposed to describe how CsoR coordinates chemotaxis and resistance to copper in P. putida. While the second part of the study is relatively solid, there are some major concerns about the first part.</p>
<p>Critiques:</p>
<p>(1) The rigor from prior research is not clear. In addition to talking about other bacterial chemotaxis, the Introduction should briefly summarize previous work on P. putida chemotaxis and copper resistance.</p>
<p>(2) The rationale for identifying those CheA-binding proteins is vague. CheA has been extensively studied and its functional domains (P1 to P5) have been well characterized. Compared to its counterparts from other bacteria, does P. putida CheA contain a unique motif or domain? Does CsoR bind to other bacterial CheAs or only to P. putida CheA?</p>
<p>(3) Line 133-136, &quot;Collectively, using pull-down, BTH, and BiFC assays, we identified 16 new CheA-interacting proteins in P. putida.&quot; It is surprising that so many proteins were identified but none of them were chemotaxis proteins, in particular those known to interact with CheA, such as CheW, CheY and CheZ, which raises a concern about the specificity of these methods. BTH and BiFC often give false-positive results and thus should be substantiated by other approaches such as co-IP, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), or isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) along with mutagenesis studies.</p>
<p>(4) Line 147-149, &quot;Fig. 2a, five strains (WT+pcsoR, WT+pispG, WT+pnfuA, WT+pphaD, and WT+pPP_1644) displayed smaller colony than the control strain (WT+pVec), indicating a weaker chemotaxis ability in these five strains.&quot; If copper is a chemorepellent, these strains should swim away from high concentrations of copper; thus, the sizes of colonies couldn't be used to measure this response. In the cited reference (reference 29), bacterial response to phenol was measured using a response index (RI).</p>
<p>(5) Figures 2 and 3 show both CsoR and PhaD bind to CheA and inhibit CheA autophosphorylation. Do these two proteins share any sequence or structural similarity? Does PhaD also bind to copper? Otherwise, it is difficult to understand these results.</p>
<p>(6) Line 195-196, &quot;CsoR/PhaD had no apparent influence on the phosphate transfer between CheA and CheY&quot;. CheA controls bacterial chemotaxis through CheY phosphorylation. If this is true, how do CsoR and PhaD affect chemotaxis?</p>
<p>(7) Figure 3 shows that CsoR/PhaD bind to CheA through P1, P3, and P4. This result is intriguing. All CheA proteins contain these three domains. If this is true, CsoR/PhaD should bind to other bacterial CheAs too. That said, this experiment is premature and needs to be confirmed by other approaches.</p>
<p>(8) Figure 5, does PhaD contain these three residues (C40, H65, and C69)? If not, how does PhaD inhibit CheA autophosphorylation and chemotactic response to copper?</p>
<p>(9) Does deletion of cosR or cheA have any impact on P. putida resistance to high concentrations of copper?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript focuses on the apparent involvement of a proposed copper-responsive regulator in the chemotactic response of Pseudomonas putida to Cu(II), a chemorepellent. Broadly, this area is of interest because it could provide insight into how soil microbes mitigate metal stress. Additionally, copper has some historical agricultural use as an antimicrobial, thus can accumulate in soil. The manuscript bases its conclusions on an in vitro screen to identify interacting partners of CheA, an essential kinase in the P. putida chemotaxis-signaling pathway. Much of the subsequent analysis focuses on a regulator of the CsoR/RcnR family (PP_2969).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data presented in this work does not support the model (Figure 8). In particular, PP_2969 is linked to Ni/Co resistance, not Cu resistance. Further, it is not clear how the putative new interactions with CheA would be integrated into diverse responses to various chemoattract/repellents. These two comments are justified below.</p>
<p>PP_2969</p>
<p>(1) The authors present a sequence alignment (Figure S5) that is the sole basis for their initial assignment of this ORF as a CsoR protein. There is a conservation of the primary coordinating ligands (highlighted with asterisks) known to be involved in Cu(I) binding to CsoR (ref 31). There are some key differences, though, in residues immediately adjacent to the conserved Cys (the preceding Ala, which is Tyr in the other sequences). The effect of these changes may be significant in a physiological context.</p>
<p>(2) The gene immediately downstream of PP_2969 is homologous to E. coli RcnA, a demonstrated Ni/Co efflux protein, suggesting that P2969 may be Ni or Co responsive. Indeed PP_2970 has previously been reported as Ni/Co responsive (J. Bact 2009 doi:10.1128/JB.00465-09). The host cytosol plays a critical role in determining metal response, in addition to the protein, which can explain the divergence from the metal response expected from the alignment.</p>
<p>(3) The previous JBact study also explains the lack of an effect (Figure 5b) of deleting PP_2969 on copper-efflux gene expression (copA-I, copA-II, and copB-II) as these are regulated by CueR not PP_2969 consistent with the previous report. Deletion of CsoR/RcnR family regulator will result in constitutive expression of the relevant efflux/detoxification gene, at a level generally equivalent to the de-repression observed in the presence of the signal.</p>
<p>(4) Further, CsoR proteins are Cu(I) responsive so measuring Cu(II) binding affinity is not physiologically relevant (Figures 5a and S5b). The affinities of demonstrated CsoR proteins are 10-18 M and these values are determined by competition assay. The MTS assay and resulting affinities are not physiologically relevant.</p>
<p>(5) The DNA-binding assays are carried out at protein concentrations well above physiological ranges (Figures 5c and d, and S5c, d). The weak binding will in part result from using DNA sequences upstream of the copA genes and not from from PP_2970.</p>
<p>CheA interactions</p>
<p>(1) There is no consideration given to the likely physiological relevance of the new interacting partners for CheA.</p>
<p>(2) How much CheA is present in the cell (copies) and how many copies of other proteins are present? How would specific responses involving individual interacting partners be possible with such a heterogenous pool of putative CheA-complexes in a cell? For PP_2969, the affinity reported (Figure 5A) may lay at the upper end of the CsoR concentration range (for example, CueR in Salmonella is present at ~40 nM).</p>
<p>(3) The two-hybrid system experiment uses a long growth time (60 h) before analysis. Even low LacZ activity levels will generate a blue colour, depending upon growth medium (see doi: 10.1016/0076-6879(91)04011-c). It is also not clear how Miller units can be accurately or precisely determined from a solid plate assay (the reference cited describes a protocol for liquid culture).</p>
