<abstract>
<p>Accurate specification of female and male germ cells during embryonic development is critical for sexual reproduction. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the bipotential precursors of mature gametes that commit to an oogenic or spermatogenic fate in response to sex-determining cues from the fetal gonad. The critical processes required for PGCs to integrate and respond to signals from the somatic environment in gonads are not understood. In this study, we developed the first single-nucleus multiomics map of chromatin accessibility and gene expression during murine PGC development in both XX and XY embryos. Profiling of cell-type specific transcriptomes and regions of open chromatin from the same cell captured the molecular signatures and gene networks underlying PGC sex determination. Joint RNA and ATAC data for single PGCs resolved previously unreported PGC subpopulations and cataloged a multimodal reference atlas of differentiating PGC clusters. We discovered that regulatory element accessibility precedes gene expression during PGC development, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime PGC lineage commitment prior to differentiation. Similarly, we found that sexual dimorphism in chromatin accessibility and gene expression increased temporally in PGCs. Combining single-nucleus sequencing data, we computationally mapped the cohort of transcription factors that regulate the expression of sexually dimorphic genes in PGCs. For example, the gene regulatory networks of XX PGCs are enriched for the transcription factors, TFAP2c, TCFL5, GATA2, MGA, NR6A1, TBX4, and ZFX. Sex-specific enrichment of the forkhead-box and POU6 families of transcription factors was also observed in XY PGCs. Finally, we determined the temporal expression patterns of WNT, BMP, and RA signaling during PGC sex determination, and our discovery analyses identified potentially new cell communication pathways between supporting cells and PGCs. Our results illustrate the diversity of factors involved in programming PGCs towards a sex-specific fate.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proper formation of germ cells during embryonic development is crucial for ensuring the production of functional gametes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The embryonic precursors to mature gametes, primordial germ cells (PGCs), are the bipotential stem cells of the germline that give rise to eggs and sperm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. During embryonic development in mice, PGCs commit to the oogenic or spermatogenic lineage in response to sex-determining cues from the gonadal environment in a process termed PGC sex determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. During sex determination, XX PGCs in the fetal ovary commit to oogenesis by entering meiosis immediately after pre-granulosa cell specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. By contrast, XY PGCs in the fetal testis initiate the spermatogenic program and arrest mitotically in response to signals from Sertoli cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Defects in germ cell differentiation, particularly during fetal life, often lead to reproductive diseases, such as infertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and the formation of germ cell tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Thus, it is necessary to enhance our understanding of germ cell development so we can better identify the etiologies of reproductive dysfunction in humans.</p>
<p>PGC sex determination is induced by the sex-specific activation of transcription factors (TFs) and downstream gene networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In XX PGCs, the retinoic acid (RA)-responsive TFs STRA8 and MEIOSIN and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-responsive TF ZGLP1 are required for entry into meiosis and oogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. These TFs also initiate the expression of genes related to meiotic processes, including <italic>Rec8</italic> and <italic>Sycp1-3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In contrast, XY PGCs require the expression of cell cycle inhibitors, such as <italic>Bnc2</italic> and <italic>Cdkn2b</italic>, and the male-specific genes, <italic>Nanos2</italic> and <italic>Dnd1</italic>, to enter mitotic arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. During the transition from PGC to oogonium or gonocyte, both XX and XY PGCs must also lose their bipotential state by downregulating the pluripotency-related genes, <italic>Pou5f1, Nanog,</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Consequently, there are multiple layers of gene regulation required for sex determination of PGCs.</p>
<p>Beyond the patterns of gene expression in PGCs, relatively little is known about how signals from the gonadal environment activate the expression of sexually dimorphic TFs and genes in PGCs. First, the gene regulatory networks, <italic>i.e.</italic> TFs and their predicted target genes, specific to XX and XY PGCs are not well defined. Second, it remains unclear how the chromatin environment is temporally regulated during PGC sex determination. Finally, additional data are needed on the patterns of ligand-receptor expression in gonadal supporting cells and PGCs. Previous reports have used bulk gene regulation and expression genomics assays to investigate the transcriptional programs underlying PGC development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, these assays may not have the resolution or sensitivity required to detect the transient changes in gene regulation among PGC subpopulations that are essential to sex determination.</p>
<p>In the present study, we employed the integrative genomics method, combined single-nucleus transcriptome and chromatin accessibility sequencing, to decipher various layers of gene regulation during PGC sex determination in mice. We comprehensively profiled 3,054 XX and XY PGCs at embryonic days (E) E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5, which covers the developmental time frame from bipotential to sexually differentiated PGCs. Single-nucleus sequencing enabled the detection of sex-enriched regulatory loci, TFs, and gonadal cues that may be responsible for initiating gene expression in individual PGCs. We first systematically examined the molecular signatures of PGC subpopulations to identify the genes and accessible chromatin regions underpinning the sex-specific fates of PGCs. By combining our epigenomic and transcriptomic data, we predicted <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and sex-enriched TFs to construct the gene regulatory networks unique to XX and XY PGCs. Lastly, we probed the cell-cell communication pathways between supporting cells and PGCs to nominate potentially new ligand-receptor pairs involved in PGC development. Our results provide insights into the cell fate decisions underlying gametogenesis and sex determination of PGCs.</p>

<p>The experiments described herein used homozygous Rosa-tdTomato9 females (JAX 007909) (B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sor&lt;tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze&gt;/J) crossed to homozygous Nr5a1-cre mice (B6D2-Tg(Nr5a1-cre)2Klp), provided by the late Dr. Keith Parker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Female mice were timed-mated and the day of detection of vaginal plug was considered embryonic day (E) E0.5. Mice were housed on a 12 h light:dark cycle, temperature range 70–74 °F and relative humidity range from 40 to 50%.

<title>Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing</title>
<p>Whole ovaries and testes were collected at E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5. The sexes of the embryos were determined using amnion staining, as previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, to identify the presence (XX) or absence (XY) of the Barr body and confirmed with PCR using primers that recognize the Y chromosome. Tomato fluorescence was used to facilitate the dissection of the gonad away from the mesonephros, which was done using needles. Isolated fetal mouse gonads were isolated in PBS, and pairs of gonads or groups pooled between fetuses of the same sex and age were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage. Nuclei isolation was performed using the 10X Genomics Chromium Nuclei Isolation Kit (catalog #1000494) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The total numbers of gonads used per sex and age are listed in <bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>. The 10X Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Library Preparation Kit (catalog #1000284) was used to generate a 10X barcoded library of mRNA and transposed DNA from individual nuclei. The 10X barcoded single-nuclei RNA and ATAC-seq libraries were obtained from 8,687 average (1,555-20,000) nuclei per sample and sequenced with Illumina NOVAseq to a minimum sequencing depth of 129,120,442 raw reads and 22,406 read pairs/nucleus (<bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>). Two independent technical replicates of multiome sequencing were performed for each sex by embryonic stage combination.</p>

<title>Sex filtering</title>

The <italic>UCell</italic> package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (v. 2.0.1) was used to create a module score of the Y-linked genes <italic>Kdm5d, Eif2s3y, Uty,</italic> and <italic>Ddx3y</italic>. Module scores of E11.5 and E12.5 cells above one standard deviation of the mean module score of all XY E13.5 cells were determined to be chromosomally male. Module scores of E11.5 and E12.5 cells below one standard deviation of the mean module score of all XX E13.5 cells were determined to be chromosomally female. Next, we examined the peaks called on chrY outside of the pseudoautosomal region. In total, 21 peaks were identified between chrY 1-90,000,000 bp. Cells with 0 fragment counts within our defined chrY peak region and chrY gene expression module score &lt; 1 standard deviation were removed from the male datasets.

<title><bold>Combined multiome analysis of single-nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility of mouse PGCs</bold></title>
<p>To understand how intrinsic transcription networks inside PGCs and external cues from the gonadal environment control PGC sex determination, we performed combined snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq (10x Genomics Multiome) for all cell populations in mouse fetal gonads. This approach allowed us to obtain paired gene expression and chromatin status from the same cell for all cell populations from female (XX) and male (XY) gonads. Whole gonads from Nr5a1-cre x Rosa-tdTomato9 embryos were collected at embryonic days (E) E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5, which encompass the developmental time frame of sex determination-initiated (E11.5), sexually differentiating (E12.5), and morphologically dimorphic (E13.5) gonads. Sequencing libraries of gonads for each sex and embryonic day were generated from two independent technical replicates for an average 8,687 nuclei/sample with a sequencing depth of ∼75,544 reads/nucleus and ∼5,755 UMIs/nucleus. Based on the well-established germ cell markers <italic>Ddx4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and <italic>Pou5f1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, we identified 3,054 germ cells.

<p>We first asked whether single-nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility information can quantify the similarity or differences within PGC populations. We clustered single PGC nuclei in low-dimensional space based on their snRNA-seq (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b-d</xref></bold>) or snATAC-seq (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e-g</xref></bold>) data using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensional reduction. This graph-based clustering algorithm unbiasedly separated and clustered individual cells with similar transcriptomic profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Such analyses revealed that the transcriptomes of E11.5 XX and XY PGCs overlap extensively, whereas E12.5 and E13.5 PGCs principally separated according to their sex (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). In addition, we uncovered eight broader clusters of PGCs at a resolution that captured PGC subpopulations (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). We determined the cell type composition of the snRNA-seq transcriptome-based clusters by plotting the percentage of PGCs at each embryonic stage and sex (<italic>x</italic>-axis) in each of the 8 transcriptome-based clusters (<italic>y</italic>-axis) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>). First, E11.5 and E12.5 XX PGCs primarily consisted of clusters 0, 1, and 4 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c-d</xref></bold>). At E13.5, XX PGCs separated into three main clusters, 4, 5, and 6, and had significantly higher expression of the synaptonemal complex component and meiotic marker <italic>Sycp1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and the chromatin modifier <italic>Hdac9</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c-d</xref>; Supplementary Figure 2</bold>). In XY gonads, PGCs at E11.5 grouped together into three clusters, 0, 1, and 7 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>). At E12.5-E13.5, XY PGCs converged onto a single distinct population (cluster 7), indicating less transcriptional diversity among E12.5-E13.5 XY PGCs when compared to E12.5-E13.5 XX PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we found that E12.5-E13.5 XY PGCs clustered separately from other PGC populations due to elevated expression of <italic>Bnc2</italic>, which is required for mitotic arrest in PGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and the forkhead-box TF <italic>Foxp1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2</bold>). Finally, a small proportion of all PGC populations (E11.5-E13.5 XX and XY PGCs) were detected in clusters 2 and 3, and displayed enriched expression of ribosome biogenesis genes, the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase <italic>Lars2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and the DNA repair protein <italic>Mgmt</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>; Supplementary Figure 2</bold>). Together, these data indicate that the transcriptomic profiles of PGCs are largely homogenous within each sex at E11.5. Subsequently, XX PGCs maintain their transcriptional heterogeneity at E12.5-E13.5, whereas XY PGCs transcriptionally converge on a single identity beginning at E12.5.</p>
<p>The snRNA-seq clustering revealed transcriptomic characteristics of PGCs. Next, we performed unbiased clustering of PGCs according to their aggregate profiles of snATAC-seq peaks (210,666 total peaks) to detect the patterns of chromatin accessibility associated with PGC development (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref></bold>). The snATAC-seq-based clustering of PGCs showed that the chromatin status of E11.5 XX and XY PGCs was highly similar (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>). By contrast, E12.5-E13.5 XX and XY PGCs formed distinct groupings at opposite poles of the UMAP (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>). Unbiased graph-based clustering of PGCs uncovered 9 clusters of PGCs with unique stage- and sex-specific snATAC-seq peak profiles (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>). First, E11.5-E12.5 XX and XY PGCs together predominantly consisted of accessibility-based clusters 0, 1, and 2, indicating that these germ cells share a highly similar chromatin profile prior to differentiation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f and g</xref></bold>). Second, E13.5 XX PGCs were separated into clusters 3, 4, and 5 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f and g</xref></bold>), which may be due to differences in meiotic entry or progression within these populations of germ cells. Third, E12.5-E13.5 XY PGCs comprised snATAC-seq clusters 6 and 7, suggesting that XY PGCs may adopt a sex-specific chromatin status beginning at E12.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f and g</xref></bold>). Finally, cluster 8, which contained PGCs from both sexes at each stage, was separate from all other accessibility-based clusters (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f and g</xref></bold>). Taken together, our findings indicate that the chromatin accessibility profiles of E11.5 PGCs and several E12.5 PGC subpopulations do not show a sex bias, whereas E13.5 XX and XY PGCs clustered by sex.</p>
<p>The multiome datasets provided us the opportunity to define PGC identities based on a more biologically relevant status at the combined transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility levels. Specifically, we integrated gene expression and chromatin accessibility data within a single PGC to obtain a joint, or multi-modal, definition of PGC identity (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h and i</xref></bold>). Computational integration methods allowed us to co-visualize the variation in both the snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq profiles of PGCs on a single UMAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Simultaneously profiling cell-type specific transcriptomes and regions of open chromatin for single PGCs resolved the sex-specific trajectories of PGCs with much greater resolution (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h and i</xref></bold>). In fact, we observed a strong demarcation between XX and XY PGCs beginning at E12.5 with very little to no overlap between XX and XY PGCs at E12.5-E13.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h-j</xref></bold>). Given that we detected the clearest separation of PGCs when clustering with multi-modal data, we analyzed the trajectory of transcriptomic changes (also known as pseudotime analysis in Monocle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>) among PGCs overlaid on the joint UMAP (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref></bold>). With E11.5 XX and XY PGCs chosen as the starting point (0) of the trajectory analysis, we observed a distinct branching or ‘decision’ point (1) between XX and XY PGCs at E12.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref></bold>). Additionally, our unbiased analysis identified two terminal states (2) of PGCs at the E13.5 XX PGC cluster and E13.5 XY PGC cluster, providing additional confirmation that our data accurately reflect the status of PGC sex determination (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref></bold>). We also observed a closed, or circular, branch of the trajectory path among E12.5 XX PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref></bold>), which may arise from the heterogeneous transcriptomes of female PGCs entering meiosis in an asynchronous manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. These data demonstrate that our approaches enable us to not only visualize the developmental trajectories of PGCs that are clustered with multi-modal data, but also empirically trace their sex-specific fates based on changes in gene regulation.</p>
<p>Clustering of PGCs using combined snRNA- and snATAC-seq data identified eleven distinct groups of PGCs and yielded enhanced cluster resolution of PGC subpopulations (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref></bold>). This analysis resulted in clusters of PGCs that were predominantly sex-specific and enabled the detection of subpopulations of each PGC type (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref></bold>). To better understand the population structure of individual clusters, we plotted the percentage of each PGC type (<italic>x</italic>-axis) for each cluster identified in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref></bold> (<italic>y</italic>-axis) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref></bold>). First, E11.5 XX PGCs clustered into one main population, cluster 1, and later diverged into six subpopulations, clusters 0 through 5 at E12.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i-j</xref></bold>). Clusters 0 - 2 were more similar to E11.5 PGCs, whereas clusters 3 – 5 were composed of E12.5 XX PGCs that were developmentally closer to E13.5 XX PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i-j</xref></bold>). Finally, we found that E13.5 XX PGCs converged onto either one of two developmental fates in clusters 6 and 7, with cluster 7 exhibiting a large spread along the UMAP2 axis (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i-j</xref></bold>). These findings indicate that E12.5-E13.5 XX PGCs may require extensive chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprogramming to adopt the oogenic fate. By comparison, XY PGCs grouped into clusters 0 and 1 at E11.5 and appeared to converge on a single developmental fate at later stages, with E12.5 XY PGCs comprising clusters 8 and 9 and E13.5 XY PGCs belonging to cluster 10 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i-j</xref></bold>). Given that neither expression- nor accessibility-based clustering alone resolved the granularity of PGC populations to the level described here, these data underscore the empirical power of simultaneously measuring multiple modalities from the same cell to define the developmental fate of PGCs.</p>

<title>Molecular characterization of genes known for their roles in XY PGC differentiation</title>
<p>We next asked whether our multiomics approaches could gain insight into the regulatory status of genes that are known to be essential for PGC sex determination. We first investigated the patterns of gene expression and chromatin accessibility of male functional genes, <italic>i.e.</italic> those that have been shown to be functionally important for XY PGC development (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). We found that genes involved in XY PGC development (<italic>i.e., Rb1, Rbl2, Cdkn1b, Cdkn2b, Bnc2, Cnot1, Dnd1,</italic> and <italic>Nanos2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> showed increasing levels of expression in XY PGCs from E11.5 to E13.5, whereas the expression levels of <italic>Cnot1</italic> and <italic>Nanos3</italic> peaked at E12.5 and E11.5, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>).

However, expression of <italic>Cnot1</italic> and <italic>Dnd1</italic> showed an XX biased expression pattern (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). Overall, these data indicate that the majority of male functional genes show a modest increase in expression levels in XY PGCs over XX PGCs.

</fig>
<p>To identify potential mechanisms regulating the expression of XY PGC functional genes, we searched for candidate transcription factors (TFs) with XY-enriched gene expression. We first linked snATAC-seq peaks to XY PGC functional genes (listed previously), hereafter termed peak-to-gene linkages, in XY PGCs. Next, we performed a TF motif enrichment analysis on significant peak-to-gene linkages to identify potential TFs. Finally, we compared the expression levels of potential TFs between XX and XY PGCs to identify TFs with XY-enriched gene expression. This strategy uncovered the Krüppel-like zinc finger family member ZKSCAN5 (Zinc finger with KRAB and SCAN domains 5) as a potential regulator of XY PGC functional genes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). <italic>Zkscan5</italic> showed XY biased expression and the level of <italic>Zkscan5</italic> expression increased from E11.5 to E13.5 in XY PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). In addition, the ZKSCAN5 motif was not enriched in XX PGCs. ZKSCAN5 is not only highly expressed in the adult testis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> but is also proposed to regulate cellular proliferation and growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Thus, although little is known about the function of ZKSCAN5, we hypothesize ZKSCAN5 may possess a regulatory role during male germ cell development. These data highlight the strength of single-nucleus multiomics in discovering candidate factors that may regulate the expression of a cohort of developmental genes and, consequently, direct cell fate decisions.</p>
<p>Among the functionally important PGC genes, <italic>Bnc2</italic> expression was most strongly enriched in XY PGCs. We therefore investigated the regulation of <italic>Bnc2</italic> at the chromatin level as an example to demonstrate the utility of combined multiome datasets. The chromatin accessibility of the <italic>Bnc2</italic> promoter was highest in XY PGCs and increased temporally from E11.5 to E13.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the level of chromatin accessibility at the <italic>Bnc2</italic> locus was positively correlated with <italic>Bnc2</italic> expression in XY PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-c</xref></bold>). We then applied the Cistrome Data Browser (Cistrome DB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> to identify putative regulators of <italic>Bnc2</italic> expression based on transcription factor binding motifs detected within 10 kb of the <italic>Bnc2</italic> promoter (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). The top candidate regulators of the <italic>Bnc2</italic> locus were determined according to a regulatory potential score derived from a combination of TF binding motif information and previously published genomics data (<italic>i.e.</italic> ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). Of the top candidate regulators from the Cistrome DB analysis, expression of <italic>Ctcf</italic>, <italic>Nrf1</italic>, <italic>Polr2a</italic>, and <italic>Brd4</italic> was enriched in XY PGCs at E13.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>). In particular, BRD4 is known to activate transcription elongation by recruiting kinases to the largest RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit, POLR2A, thereby releasing Pol II from its promoter-proximal bound state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Taken together, these findings provide insight into potential XY-specific regulatory mechanisms at the <italic>Bnc2</italic> locus in PGCs.</p>

<title>Characterization of genes known for their roles in XX PGC development</title>
<p>We next performed the same analyses of XX PGC functional genes, <italic>i.e.</italic> those that have been shown to be functionally important for XX PGC development (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>). Overall, as expected, we found that E13.5 XX PGCs expressed genes involved in XX germ cell development (<italic>i.e., Rec8, Sycp2, Sycp3, Ctnnb1, Meioc, Rnf2, Stra8, Ythdc2,</italic> and <italic>Zglp1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> substantially higher than E13.5 XY PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>).

Although <italic>Zglp1</italic> was expressed in fewer XX PGCs than <italic>Rnf2</italic>, <italic>Zglp1</italic> expression increased from E12.5 to E13.5 whereas <italic>Rnf2</italic> expression decreases (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>).

<p>We next identified potential regulators of XX PGC functional genes using the same approach for XY PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Our analysis identified significant enrichment of the binding motif for DMRT1 in the regulatory elements linked to XX PGC functional genes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>). DMRT1 has been shown to control <italic>Stra8</italic> expression in a sex-specific manner, such that <italic>Stra8</italic> is activated in the fetal ovary and repressed in the fetal testis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Our snRNA-seq data also demonstrated <italic>Dmrt1</italic> expression in both XX and XY PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>), which is consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Since <italic>Stra8</italic> plays an essential role in controlling meiotic entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, we next sought to further understand the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying <italic>Stra8</italic> activation. First, we not only found that accessibility of the <italic>Stra8</italic> promoter was highest in XX PGCs, but also that <italic>Stra8</italic> chromatin accessibility was positively correlated with <italic>Stra8</italic> gene expression (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b-c</xref></bold>). Second, the population of E13.5 XX PGCs displaying the strongest <italic>Stra8</italic> expression levels corresponded to the same population of XX PGCs with the highest module score of early meiotic prophase I genes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 3a-b</bold>). Next, to determine putative regulators of <italic>Stra8</italic> expression, we identified enriched TF binding motifs within 10 kb of the <italic>Stra8</italic> promoter using Cistrome DB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref></bold>).

Moreover, RXRA has been shown to positively influence <italic>Stra8</italic> expression levels during oocyte development in the mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.

<title>Expression and <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding of retinoic acid receptors in PGCs</title>
<p>Since recent reports have demonstrated that meiosis occurs normally in the fetal ovary of mice lacking key members of the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, we next asked whether we could detect any evidence for gene regulation by RA receptors in PGCs. Previous studies have demonstrated that RA from the mesonephros induces meiosis in the fetal ovary whereas in the fetal testis, RA is degraded by the enzyme CYP26B1, therefore preventing PGC entry into meiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. However, this model was challenged by the findings that meiosis, and consequently oogenesis, still occurs in XX gonads of mice lacking the RA-synthesizing enzyme, ALDH1, or all RA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, <italic>Stra8</italic> expression was significantly reduced in E13.5 fetal ovaries without <italic>Aldh1a1-3</italic> or all RA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, thus indicating that <italic>Stra8</italic> expression is likely controlled by the RA signaling pathway, in addition to others. We therefore investigated the expression and <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding patterns of members of the RA signaling pathway (<italic>i.e. Rara, Rarb, Rarg, Rxra, Rxrb, Rxrg, Crabp1,</italic> and <italic>Crabp2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4a-b</bold>). We found that expression of the retinoic acid receptor beta, <italic>Rarb</italic>, and cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1, <italic>Crabp1</italic>, were enriched in XX PGCs beginning at E12.5 and continuing to E13.5 (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4a-b</bold>). Similarly, E13.5 XX PGCs showed enriched expression of the retinoid X receptor alpha, <italic>Rxra</italic>, and cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2, <italic>Crabp2</italic> (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4a-b</bold>). By contrast, the expression of <italic>Rara, Rarg,</italic> and <italic>Rxrb</italic> was enriched in XY PGCs, and <italic>Rxrg</italic> was lowly expressed in both XX and XY PGCs (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4a-b</bold>). We also observed significant enrichment of the ‘motif activity score’, an <italic>in silico</italic> measurement of the contribution of a specific motif to gene regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, of all RA receptors in E13.5 XX PGCs (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4c-d</bold>). These data indicate that the RA receptors display strong evidence of <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding in E13.5 XX PGCs but not E13.5 XY PGCs. Furthermore, the binding motifs for the RA receptors were predominantly located in E13.5 XX PGC chromatin peaks that were distal intergenic, intronic, or within promoters (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4e</bold>; motifs for RARB and RXRA provided as examples). These data indicate that the binding motifs for the RA receptors are predominantly enriched in both distal and proximal regulatory elements in E13.5 XX PGCs. The RA receptor motifs were also statistically linked to genes involved in ‘response to retinoic acid’, ‘negative regulation of cell cycle’, and ‘meiotic cell cycle’ (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4f</bold>; motifs for RARB and RXRA provided as examples). Finally, when we searched for the presence of RA receptor motifs in peaks linked to genes related to meiosis and female sex determination, we found that <italic>Stra8, Rec8, Rnf2, Sycp1, Sycp2, Ccnb3,</italic> and <italic>Zglp1</italic> contain the RA receptor motifs in their regulatory sequences (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4g</bold>). Together, these <italic>in silico</italic> experiments indicate that the RA signaling pathway directly regulates the expression of several meiosis-related genes.</p>

<title>Discovery of differentially expressed genes and differentially accessible regulatory loci underlying sex determination of PGCs</title>
<p>We further investigated our multiome dataset to discover genes and <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements enriched in PGCs in a sex-specific manner.

<p>An in-depth analysis of the DEGs between XX and XY germ cells identified sex-enriched genes for PGCs at each embryonic stage (<bold>Supplementary Figure 5a</bold>). For example, we found elevated expression of the WNT protein regulator <italic>Porcn</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, the beta-catenin binding protein <italic>Grip1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, and the growth regulator <italic>Phlda2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> in XX PGCs (<bold>Supplementary Figure 5a</bold>). These observations are consistent with the fact that WNT/β-catenin signaling is involved in specifying the female fate of PGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. We also identified XY enriched DEGs, which included the histone demethylase <italic>Kdm5d</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, the regulator of pluripotency <italic>Dppa5</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>, and the forkhead transcription factor <italic>Foxp1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> (<bold>Supplementary Figure 5a</bold>). Gene ontology (GO) analyses of DEGs revealed several biological processes that show sex-enriched expression patterns (<bold>Supplementary Figure 5b</bold>). For example, the DEGs identified in XX PGCs were assigned to the ‘meiotic chromosome organization’, ‘sister chromatid cohesion’, and ‘WNT signaling pathway’ gene ontologies (<bold>Supplementary Figure 5b</bold>). The DEGs identified in XY PGCs were related to ‘mitotic cell cycle’, ‘TGFβ signaling pathway’, and ‘regulation of translation’ gene ontologies (<bold>Supplementary Figure 5b</bold>). In sum, the DEGs between XX and XY PGCs were characterized by their sex-specific roles in meiotic/mitotic cell cycle regulation, post-transcriptional processing of mRNA, and cell-cell signaling properties (<bold>Supplementary Figure 5a-b</bold>). These analyses provide a clear description of the transcriptional differences between XX and XY PGCs underlying the transition from bipotential germ cells to sex-specific oogonium or gonocytes.</p>
<p>To quantitatively assess chromatin dynamics during PGC sex determination, we next evaluated the number of differentially accessible chromatin peaks (DAPs) between XX and XY germ cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). The DAP analyses ((log<sub>2</sub>fold-change &gt; 0.25) revealed 1,720, 2,311, and 5,626 XX enriched DAPs and 3,341, 3,117, and 15,546 XY enriched DAPs at E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). The largest increase in the number of DA peaks was found between XY PGCs (15,546) and XX PGCs (5,626) at E13.5. The DAPs for XX and XY PGCs at E11.5-E13.5 were predominantly located in promoter, distal intergenic, or intronic regions, indicating that these DAPs likely correspond to gene regulatory sites (<bold>Supplementary Figure 5c</bold>). Together, these data suggest that the chromatin architecture of PGCs, and especially the chromatin of XY PGCs, undergoes significant remodeling during sex determination.</p>
<p>We next sought to associate sex-specific changes in chromatin accessibility with changes in gene expression for PGCs. To determine peak-gene associations, we correlated snATAC-seq peak accessibility with the expression of nearby genes, with the goal to identify sex- and stage-specific chromatin peaks positively correlated with mRNA expression (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05; z-score &gt; 0). This analysis detected putative gene regulatory interactions based on correlations between chromatin peak accessibility and gene expression levels for all peaks and genes within 500 kb of each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Given the notable increase in DA peaks between XX and XY PGCs at E13.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>), we first identified the predicted target genes of all sex-specific DA peaks at this stage (<bold>Supplementary Figure 6a-b</bold>). For E13.5 XX PGCs, we observed positive DA peak-gene correlations for genes enriched for biological functions such as ‘WNT signaling pathway’, ‘chromosome segregation’, ‘chromatin organization’, ‘meiotic cell cycle’, and ‘RNA stabilization’ (<bold>Supplementary Figure 6a</bold>). A similar analysis of E13.5 XY PGCs revealed positive DA peak-gene correlations for genes involved in ‘ncRNA metabolic process’, ‘mitotic cell cycle’, ‘DNA repair’, ‘regulation of translation’, and ‘RNA localization’ (<bold>Supplementary Figure 6b</bold>). These findings demonstrate that we can use chromatin accessibility information to identify the regulatory elements linked to sex-specific genes in PGCs.</p>
<p>We next investigated the associations of differentially accessible (DA) chromatin peaks with differentially expressed (DE) gene expression for each PGC type. At E11.5, we found that DA peak-to-gene linkages were associated with ∼20% of DE genes in XX PGCs and ∼1% of DE genes in XY PGCs (<bold>Supplementary Figure 6c</bold>). The overlap of DA peak-to-gene linkages with DE genes increased steadily at E12.5 and E13.5, with ∼35% and ∼60% of DA peaks in E13.5 XX and XY PGCs, respectively, positively correlated with DE gene expression (<bold>Supplementary Figure 6c</bold>). For example, at E13.5, we identified the DA peaks positively correlated with the DE genes <italic>Porcn</italic> (involved in the processing of WNT proteins)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> and <italic>Rec8</italic> (involved in meiotic recombination)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> in XX PGCs and <italic>Rimbp1</italic> (regulates cytosolic calcium ion concentration)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> in XY PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c-d</xref>; Supplementary Figure 6d</bold>). Immunofluorescence staining also confirmed the expression of <italic>Porcn</italic> in E13.5 fetal XX germ cells (<bold>Supplementary Figure 7a</bold>), demonstrating that single-nucleus multiomics can identify DE genes and the DA chromatin peaks that are associated with their expression.</p>

<title>A computational approach to identify candidate TFs regulating XX PGC gene expression</title>
<p>To better utilize the multiomics data, we developed an analytical flow to identify potential TFs that are involved in regulating the expression of DEGs in PGCs. First, we classified peak status by identifying peaks that are differentially accessible between XX and XY PGCs following the analytical framework in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>. Second, we linked peaks to genes to identify positive correlations between DA chromatin peaks and the expression of DEGs at each embryonic stage (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05; z-score &gt; 0; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>).

<p>In XX PGCs, we uncovered several candidate TF regulators of E11.5-E13.5 XX-enriched DEGs (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8a-c</bold>). We plotted the mRNA expression levels of TFs and the <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding score, termed ‘motif activity’, of all significantly enriched binding motifs (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8a-c</bold>). For example, in E11.5 XX PGCs, RREB1 is a differentially expressed TF showing high gene expression, but negative levels of <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8a</bold>). This finding indicates that although RREB1 is a highly expressed TF in E11.5 XX PGCs, RREB1 does not likely promote increased chromatin accessibility either because it does not bind to chromatin or a critical co-factor is unavailable (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8a</bold>). Following this analytical framework, we focused our analysis on TFs that showed high levels of gene expression, were differentially expressed in XX PGCs, and displayed a positive <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding score (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8a-c</bold>). The TFs meeting these criteria were KLF12, NR6A1, and ZFX in E11.5 XX PGCs; TFAP2c in E12.5 XX PGCs; and BACH2, CREM, GATA2, GLI3, MGA, NFKB1, PLAGL1, TBX4, TCFL5, TFAP2c, ZBTB7c, and ZFX in E13.5 XX PGCs (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8a-c</bold>). Of these sixteen TF candidates with PGC-enriched transcript expression, only seven (<italic>Gata2, Mga, Nr6a1, Tbx4, Tcfl5, Tfap2c,</italic> and <italic>Zfx</italic>) showed enriched expression in germ cells when compared to the somatic compartment of the gonad, and thus met our requirements for further <italic>in silico</italic> investigation (<bold>Supplementary Figure 9a</bold>). These candidate TFs have reported roles in cell fate determination, growth and fertility regulation, and meiotic progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>, all of which are in line with the cellular events that occur as PGCs commit to the female pathway. Nonetheless, the chromatin binding and gene expression of GATA2, MGA, TBX4, TCFL5, and TFAP2c showed the clearest patterns of sexual dimorphism in E13.5 PGCs and represented the most compelling TF candidates (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b-c</xref>; Supplementary Figure 9b-f</bold>).</p>
<p>The binding motif for TFAP2c (also known as <italic>AP2γ</italic>) showed prominent TF-associated accessibility, especially when compared to all other significantly enriched TF binding motifs (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8b-c</bold>). Immunofluorescence staining of TFAP2c also showed enrichment of TFAP2c in E13.5 XX PGCs when compared to the somatic compartment <bold>Supplementary Figure 9g</bold>). Compared to XY PGCs, XX PGCs had enriched <italic>Tfap2c</italic> expression (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05; log2FC &gt; 0.25) and enriched accessibility of the TFAP2c motif at E12.5-E13.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref></bold>). The TFAP2c motif was close to genes related to glycogen metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and chromatin modification (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref></bold>). The predicted target genes of TFAP2c accounted for 75% (372/494) of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkages in XX PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref></bold>), suggesting that TFAP2c is likely a high-level regulator of female PGC sex determination.</p>
<p>In addition to TFAP2c, we also investigated the regulatory potential of TCFL5 (Transcription Factor Like 5) in greater detail. TCFL5 was the most differentially expressed in E13.5 XX PGCs (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05; log2FC &gt; 0.25) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref></bold>). Accessibility of the TCFL5 motif was also enriched in E13.5 XX PGCs, indicating that chromatin binding of TCFL5 is likely strongest at this stage (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref></bold>). The predicted target genes of TCFL5 totaled 74% (367/494) of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkages in XX PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref></bold>). The TCFL5-associated genes were related to chromosome segregation, meiotic cell cycle, sister chromatid cohesion, histone modification, regulation of TF activity, and cell-cell signaling by WNT. Our findings are supported by a recent report on the role of TCFL5 in XX PGCs, which demonstrated the requirement of TCFL5 in meiotic progression and female fertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Given that the motifs for TFAP2c and TCFL5 were not detected at every XX-enriched DEG, we hypothesize that a network of TFs, such as those identified in <bold>Supplementary Figure 9a</bold>, could work in cooperativity to regulate XX PGC gene expression. For example, we found that the predicted target genes of ZFX, MGA, NR6A1, TBX4, and GATA2 accounted for 73% (359/454), 31% (152/494), 20% (100/494), and 6% (32/494), respectively, of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkage in XX PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref></bold>). We also found that TFAP2c, TCFL5, ZFX, MGA, and NR6A1 may regulate the expression of each other (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref></bold>). For instance, the motif for ZFX was located in the enhancers or promoters for TFAP2c, TCFL5, MGA, and NR6A1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref></bold>). Likewise, NR6A1 is predicted to control the expression of TFAP2C, TCFL5, and TBX4 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the motifs for the candidate TFs were statistically linked to genes involved in ‘meiotic cell cycle’ and the ‘WNT signaling pathway’ (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g-h</xref></bold>). Meiosis related genes such as <italic>Tex15, Sycp1, Dmc1,</italic> and <italic>Hormad1</italic> contained the motifs for at least three of the predicted TFs in their regulatory sequences (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref></bold>). A similar pattern was also found for genes related to WNT signaling, e.g. <italic>Pkd1, Notum, Porcn, Fzd3,</italic> and <italic>Eda</italic> were predicted to be regulated by the binding of at least two of the putative TFs in XX PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref></bold>). These data indicate that there may be unknown and undefined TF regulatory networks underlying XX PGC identity and function.</p>

<title>Identification of candidate TF regulators of XY PGC differentiation</title>
<p>To identify candidate TF regulators involved in XY PGC sex determination, we performed the same analysis as described for XX PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). Our analysis focused strictly on differentially expressed TFs that show evidence of chromatin binding based on the empirical <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding score (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 10a-c</bold>). In contrast to XX PGCs (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 8</bold>), we did not identify any significantly enriched TF binding motifs (<italic>p</italic>-value &gt; 0.05) meeting our criteria in E11.5 XY PGCs (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 10a</bold>). Only three XY-enriched TFs, FOXP1, POU6F2, and TCF4, were differentially expressed between XY and XX PGCs at E12.5 (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 10b</bold>), and only TCF4 showed a positive <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding score in E12.5 XY PGCs (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 10b</bold>). For E13.5 XY PGCs, we detected five significantly enriched motifs that bound differentially expressed TFs (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05): FOXK2, FOXO1, FOXP1, POU6F1, and TCF4 (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 9c</bold>). Of these six XY-enriched TF candidates from E11.5 to E13.5, FOXO1, FOXK2, and POU6F1/2 emerged as the top candidates based on germline enriched expression when compared to somatic cells, differential expression in XY PGCs, and positive <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding scores (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 11a-b</bold>; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i-j</xref></bold>).

<p>At E13.5, when the most TFs and their motifs were found in XY PGCs, we observed significant enrichment of the FOX (forkhead-box) protein family of TFs (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 10c</bold>). FOX proteins contain pioneering transcription properties that allow for binding to condensed chromatin and enabling competency of gene activity through histone remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Given their role in opening condensed chromatin, FOX TFs play important roles in regulating the expression of genes involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation, plasticity, and growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In particular, we found that the expression of <italic>Foxo1</italic> and <italic>Foxk2</italic> were specific to XY PGCs when compared to XX germ cells and the XY somatic compartment (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 10c; Supplementary Fig. 11a</bold>; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref></bold>). From our dataset, we found the FOXK2 motif positively associated with genes related to cellular proliferation, cell cycle arrest, mitosis, and DNA damage checkpoint (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5k</xref></bold>). In addition, the predicted target genes of FOXK2 totaled 26% (54/208) of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkages in XY PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5l</xref></bold>). This finding was consistent with the number of predicted target genes of FOXO1, which included 28% (58/208) of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkages in XY PGCs and may be the result of motif redundancy among FOX proteins. Given the substantial increase in the number of DA peaks in E13.5 XY PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>), we hypothesize that the pioneering properties of the FOX family promotes chromatin remodeling as XY PGCs transition to gonocytes.</p>
<p>We also detected significant enrichment of the POU domain, class 6 (POU6) TF family in XY PGCs (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 10b-c; Supplementary Fig. 11a &amp; c; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5j</xref></bold>). The POU family plays important roles in regulating cellular differentiation and the timing of cellular events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. We found XY-enriched expression of POU6F1 and POU6F2 in PGCs, however, only POU6F2 displayed germline enrichment when compared to the somatic cell populations of the gonad (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 11a &amp; c; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5j</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we observed the strongest POU6F1 and POU6F2 <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding scores in XY PGCs at E13.5 (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 11c; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5j</xref></bold>). The POU6F1/2 motif was associated with 19% (40/208) of all DEGs with peak-to-gene linkages in XY PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5l</xref></bold>). POU6F1/2-associated genes were related to voltage-gated chloride channel activity (<italic>Ano6</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>, regulation of cell proliferation (<italic>Appl1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>, regulation of actin filaments (<italic>Fmnl2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>, Notch signaling (<italic>Maml3</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>, lipid metabolism (<italic>Osbpl9</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>, and ubiquitin ligase activity (<italic>Usp7</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5m</xref></bold>). Thus, the POU6 TF family is a top candidate to coordinate gene expression activity in XY PGCs.</p>
<p>We next compared the number and identity of FOXO1-, FOXK2-, and POU6F1/2-associated genes in XY PGCs. First, we did not detect the FOXO1, FOXK2, or POU6F1/2 motifs in the promoters/enhancers for each of these TFs. These findings indicate that these TFs do not regulate the expression of each other, and other mechanisms or regulatory pathways are required to activate the expression of candidate TFs in XY PGCs. Furthermore, the predicted target genes of the FOX and POU6 TF families shared little overlap with each other (11/87) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5m</xref></bold>). The genes that were shared between FOXO1, FOXK2, and POU6F1/2 had reported functions in maintaining survival after DNA damage (<italic>Alkbh8</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>, TGFβ signaling (<italic>Bmp7</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, and initiation of mitosis (<italic>Nek7</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5m</xref></bold>). By comparison, the predicted target genes of FOXO1 and FOXK2 showed considerable overlap (42/47) and included genes related to RNA splicing (<italic>Aqr</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>, cell cycle progression (<italic>Cdk6</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>, cellular metabolism (<italic>Eno1</italic> and <italic>Odc1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>, cell death (<italic>Pml</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>, and negative regulation of the IGF1 signaling pathway (<italic>Socs2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5m</xref></bold>). The motifs for FOXO1, FOXK2, and POU6F1/2 were statistically associated with genes involved in ‘mitotic cell cycle’ and ‘signal transduction’ (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5n-o</xref></bold>). Mitosis-related genes such as <italic>Cradd, Cdk6, Exoc6b,</italic> and <italic>Pml</italic> were potentially regulated by FOXO1 and FOXK2 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5n</xref></bold>). In addition, we noted that the POU6F1/2 motif was associated with <italic>Cradd</italic> and <italic>Psmg2</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5n</xref></bold>). We observed a similar pattern for genes related to signal transduction (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5o</xref></bold>). For example, <italic>Bmp7, Map3k5, Akt3,</italic> and <italic>Sulf1</italic> were associated with FOXO1 and FOXK2, whereas <italic>Bmp7, Map3k5,</italic> and <italic>Sfprp1</italic> were associated with POU6F1/2 motif activity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5o</xref></bold>). Taken together, these data suggest that in XY PGCs, although FOXO1, FOXK2, and POU6F1/2 regulate genes with similar properties, the FOX and POU6 TF families are unlikely to collaboratively regulate gene expression.</p>

<title>Sex-specific enrichment of ligand-receptor signals between gonadal support cells and PGCs</title>
<p>Sexual dimorphism of germ cell differentiation is thought to be controlled by a meiosis-inducing substance produced by the somatic cells of the fetal ovary and/or by a meiosis-preventing substance produced by the fetal testis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. In experimentally generated XX/XY chimeras, both XX and XY PGCs can initiate meiosis when residing in the fetal ovary or enter mitotic arrest when colonizing the fetal testis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. In the fetal ovary, PGC meiosis is induced by retinoic acid (RA) produced by ovarian and mesonephric somatic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Consistent with this model, RA signaling induces expression of <italic>Stra8</italic> and <italic>Meiosin</italic>, both of which are critical for promoting entry into meiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Signaling by WNT and BMP also influences the timing of meiotic onset in XX PGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and inhibin/activin signaling regulates XX germ cell growth and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>. In the fetal testis, RA degradation by CYP26B1 and FGF9 signaling from XY supporting cells result in reduced <italic>Stra8</italic> expression, consequently blocking meiotic entry in XY PGCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, PGC sex determination is dependent on external signals from the gonadal environment rather than chromosomal sex.</p>
<p>To uncover potential instructive signals from the supporting somatic cells (Sertoli cells in the fetal testis or granulosa cells in the fetal ovary) to PGCs, we searched for supporting cell-derived ligands and the corresponding receptors in PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref></bold>), using CellphoneDBv5.0 for cell communication analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. We first identified the supporting cell clusters from the snRNA-seq dataset of whole fetal gonads using the established female and male supporting cell markers <italic>Runx1</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic>, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>. We next quantified the number of significant interactions between supporting cells and PGCs at each embryonic stage (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05; <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref></bold>). Such analyses revealed that the number of interactions gradually increased from E11.5 to E13.5 for both XX and XY gonads (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref></bold>). We also observed that the number of ligand-receptor pairs was 15-38% higher in XX gonads, compared to XY gonads at the same embryonic stage (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref></bold>). To validate our computational approach, we next searched for known pathways associated with PGC differentiation, such as signaling by WNT, inhibin/activin, and BMP (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref></bold>). The number of significant interactions per pathway increased in both XX and XY gonads from E11.5 to E13.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 12a-b</bold>). We also observed a moderate increase in the number of interactions for the inhibin/activin and BMP pathways in XX gonads when compared to XY gonads at the same embryonic stage (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref></bold>). Finally, we found that the number of interactions related to WNT signaling were nearly 2-3 times greater in XX than XY gonads (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 11a-b</bold>). Together, these data demonstrate that sexually dimorphic patterns of cell signaling events were present between supporting cells and PGCs.</p>

<p>We next searched for new sex-specific enrichment of ligand-receptor pairs between supporting cells and PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d-i</xref></bold>). For each embryonic stage, we first identified which signaling pathways were detected in XX alone, XY alone, or both XX and XY gonads that met our statistical threshold (p-value &lt; 0.05; <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d, f</xref>, &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">h</xref></bold>). At E11.5, XX and XY gonads shared the greatest overlap of supporting cell-derived ligands and PGC-expressing receptors (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref></bold>). The shared pathways between XX and XY gonads were largely related to adhesion by collagen/integrin, fibronectin, and cadherin. E11.5 XX gonads had enrichment of 19 ligand-receptor pairs related to, for example, BMP, ephrin, integrin, FGF, and WNT signaling (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref></bold>). By contrast, E11.5 XY gonads had significant enrichment of 10 ligand-receptor pairs predominantly related to cell adhesion pathways like ephrin, nectin, and integrin (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref></bold>). To highlight the general trends of expression between sexes, we compared the mean expression of all representative ligand-receptor pairs from each group in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d, f</xref>, &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">h</xref> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e, g</xref>, &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">i</xref></bold>). In E11.5 gonads, we observed dimorphic expression of XX-enriched interactors, such as BMP2/BMR1A/AVR2B and WNT4/FZD10/LRP5, but not the XY-enriched interactors CADM1/NECTIN3 and EFNB1/EPHB3 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we did not observe a sex bias for the mean expression of interacting pairs for the shared pathway DLK1:NOTCH3 between E11.5 XX and XY gonads (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref></bold>). These data indicate that at E11.5, sexual dimorphism of signaling pathways, in terms of number and mean expression, is most prominent between XX supporting cells and XX PGCs.</p>
<p>In E12.5 and E13.5 gonads, we observed a stronger XX bias in ligand-receptor interactions between supporting cells and PGCs (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f-i</xref></bold>). At E12.5, we observed 49 and 24 significant interactions in XX and XY gonads, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref></bold>). In E12.5 XX gonads, BMP, Insulin-like growth factor (IGF), R-spondin, and WNT signaling were the most frequently observed pathways and displayed strong XX-enriched mean expression (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f-g</xref></bold>). In XY gonads, detection of new signaling pathways emerged from E11.5 to E12.5, including signaling by BMP6, chemokines, Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and Neuregulin (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref></bold>). Compared to E12.5, E13.5 XX gonads continued to have enrichment for the BMP, IGF, and WNT signaling pathways with additional pathways related to midkine (MDK), Calsyntenin (Clstn), and SLIT and NTRK-like protein signaling detected (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f and h</xref></bold>). The BMP5:BMR1A:AVR2B and MDK:PTPRZ1 ligand-receptor interactors also showed XX-biased mean expression (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref></bold>). Similarly in E12.5 and E13.5 XY gonads, we observed maintenance of the ligand-receptor pairs, BMP6:ACVR:1A2B and BMP6:BMR1A:AVR2B (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">h</xref>; Supplemental Data 1</bold>). However, enrichment of signaling by Desert hedgehog, Notch, and WNT inhibition became significant in E13.5 XY gonads but not E12.5 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f and h</xref></bold>). High mean expression of DHH:PTCH:GAS1 and DLK1:NOTCH3 interactors was detected in E13.5 XY gonads but became indetectable in E13.5 XX gonads (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref></bold>). Taken together, these data suggest that sex-specific enrichment of ligand-receptor interactions become gradually more apparent from E11.5 to E13.5.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Male and female germ cells carry the hereditary information required for the generation of a new individual and the perpetuation of sexually reproducing species. Errors in germ cell development and differentiation can result in a variety of reproductive diseases, such as infertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Disruption of gametogenesis during early embryonic development can even lead to the onset of disease later in life, a concept which is supported by the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. Thus, it is of critical importance to understand the molecular and epigenetic signatures of developing germ cells, and particularly PGCs. Nonetheless, the heterogeneous nature and low cell numbers of PGC populations often hinders the identification of novel factors that influence PGC fate. To overcome this limitation, we generated the first single-nucleus atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility for murine PGCs during sex determination. We demonstrate that single-nucleus multiomics successfully captures PGC sex determination at high resolution, identifies putative TFs involved in PGC sex determination, and provides insight into the cellular communication pathways between PGCs and the supporting cells of the gonads.</p>

<title>Integrated RNA and ATAC data for individual PGCs identified significant heterogeneity in XX PGC populations compared to XY PGCs</title>
<p>We first identified the sub-groupings of E11.5-E13.5 XX and XY PGCs and resolved the patterns of gene expression and chromatin accessibility underlying each PGC population. We observed that the combined analysis of integrated snRNA- and snATAC-seq data produced better clustering and separation of PGCs than either assay alone. For example, we found that at E11.5, XX and XY PGCs share highly similar transcriptomic and open chromatin profiles, indicating that PGCs at this stage are bipotential at the level of gene regulation and chromatin accessibility. This observation agrees with the study that showed the global overlap of transcriptomes between E11.5 PGCs from both sexes, in which they detected only 101 DEGs between XX and XY PGCs with functional annotations related to chaperonin complexes and proteasome formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>. At E12.5, subpopulations of PGCs clustered separately within each sex, supporting the model that PGCs do not commit to a sex-specific fate in a synchronous manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. At E13.5, two sub-clusters of XX PGCs appear, consistent with the asynchronous entry of XX PGCs into meiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Others also reported substantial heterogeneity of human and mouse PGC populations, often arising from intrinsic variation in the epigenetic reprogramming required for sex differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup>.

<title>Molecular signatures of differentiating PGCs revealed disease-related genes associated with PGC clusters</title>
<p>When examining genes that could be responsible for the expression-based clustering of PGCs, we found TFs, cell cycle regulators, chromatin modifiers, and ribosome biogenesis genes underlying the diverse transcriptional profiles of differentiating PGCs. Several of the expressed genes enriched in individual PGC clusters were involved in infertility or disease processes when nonfunctional. For example, mutations in <italic>Lars2</italic>, the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, is associated with premature ovarian failure in women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and aberrant methylation at the promoter of <italic>Mgmt,</italic> a gene that is required for DNA repair and linked to the formation of testicular germ cell tumors in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>.

<title>Sexual dimorphism in chromatin accessibility increases temporally during PGC development</title>
<p>The chromatin landscape of PGCs is the most sexually dimorphic at E13.5 when compared to E11.5 and E12.5. The substantial increase in DAPs at E13.5 leads to several hypotheses that could account for the changes to PGC chromatin architecture during sex determination. First, it is possible that the chromatin of bipotential E11.5 PGCs is primed for activating either sex-specific differentiation pathway. Chromatin priming occurs when chromatin is maintained in an accessible state prior to gene expression, and is evidenced in a number of developmental contexts, such as during specification of hematopoietic cells and lineage commitment of embryonic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>. During development, chromatin priming fine-tunes gene activation by enabling a rapid response to external cues that induce cell differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref></sup>. Second, we posit that E11.5 PGCs have fewer DA peaks because they are actively dividing. Mitotic chromosome condensation is known to induce a state of heterochromatin and the eviction of TFs from chromatin in actively dividing cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>. Third, the increased number of DA peaks at E13.5 may be the result of changes to chromatin structure as XX PGCs enter meiotic prophase I, an event that requires dramatic changes to meiotic chromosomes as they undergo DNA double-strand breaks, synapsis, and crossing over<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Indeed, increased chromatin accessibility was found in mouse spermatocytes during prophase I of meiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>. Finally, the upregulated expression of forkhead TFs in male PGCs at E12.5 and E13.5 may induce the <italic>de novo</italic> establishment of DA peaks through their pioneering activity. Nonetheless, our results are consistent with previous reports that demonstrate the global decrease in DNA methylation levels, or increased chromatin accessibility, in mouse PGCs beginning at E9.5 and continuing through E13.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Single-nucleus multiomics identifies evidence for chromatin priming during PGC lineage commitment</title>
<p>Moreover, not all sex- and stage-specific DA chromatin peaks account for changes in differential gene expression for PGCs. Chromatin accessibility and gene expression are often asynchronously correlated during cellular differentiation, such as during chromatin priming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. For example, accessibility of regulatory loci involved in cell-fate decisions may precede gene expression to prime cells towards one developmental lineage versus another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. In the context of germ cell differentiation, PGCs must also undergo extensive chromatin remodeling events, including genome-wide DNA demethylation and a reduction in both repressive and activating histone modifications, prior to sex determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref></sup>. Indeed, chromatin priming has been observed in PGCs from other species, such as macaques, pigs, and goats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup>. Thus, it is likely that the DA chromatin peaks observed for E11.5 and E12.5 PGCs in mice may either reflect global chromatin remodeling events associated with sex determination or foreshadow future cell fate decisions by remaining poised for TF binding. Nevertheless, a comprehensive profile of 3D chromatin structure and enhancer-promoter contacts in differentiating PGCs is needed to fully understand how changes to chromatin facilitate PGC sex determination.</p>

<title>The gene regulatory networks of XX PGCs are enriched for the transcription factors, TFAP2c, TCFL5, GATA2, MGA, NR6A1, TBX4, and ZFX</title>
<p>Our multiomics approach uncovered compelling TF candidates that may be involved in PGC development and differentiation. In XX PGCs, seven TF prospects were identified: GATA2, MGA, NR6A1, TBX4, ZFX, TCFL5, and TFAP2c. Of these TFs, TCFL5 and TFAP2C showed the strongest enriched expression in XX PGCs.

FOXO1 activity is also widely involved in regulating metabolic homeostasis, redox balance, cell death, and DNA damage repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref></sup>. Likewise, FOXK2 functions in similar roles as FOXO1, such as in cellular metabolism, cell survival, and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the POU6 family consists of POU6F1 and POU6F2, which share highly conserved DNA motif recognition sequences and function in similar cellular pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref></sup>. Both POU6F1 and POU6F2 have been reported to suppress tumor proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref></sup>, and POU6F2 mutations have been implicated in the progression of Wilms Tumor, hypogonadism, and pubertal failure in human patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">126</xref></sup>. Investigating the cooperativity of these TFs will greatly improve our understanding of how mitotic arrest and the commitment to spermatogenesis are regulated during germ cell development.</p>

<title>Single-nucleus RNA-seq maps the temporal expression patterns of WNT, BMP, and RA signaling during PGC sex determination</title>
<p>During sex determination, PGCs respond to signals from the supporting cells of the gonads to determine their sex-specific fate. In the fetal ovary, <italic>Runx1+</italic> supporting cells produce WNT4 to maintain germ cell pluripotency and prevent precocious meiotic entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. We observed signaling by WNT4, WNT5A/B, and WNT6 in both XX and XY gonads as early as E11.5. The number of interactions related to WNT signaling also increased from E11.5 to E13.5 in both XX and XY gonads even though diminished WNT signaling is required for meiotic entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. However, XY PGCs showed enrichment of the WNT agonist SFRP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">127</xref></sup> at E13.5, indicating that WNT signaling may be inhibited in XY PGCs earlier than XX PGCs. BMP secretion by ovarian supporting cells also plays a critical role in regulating meiotic entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Even though BMP6 signaling was observed in XY PGCs, BMP2 and BMP5 signaling were specific to XX PGCs beginning at E11.5. Our findings are consistent with functional studies showing that BMP2 signaling induces <italic>Zglp1</italic> expression and promotes the oogenic fate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Additionally, RA produced by both ovarian and mesonephric somatic cells is required to initiate expression of <italic>Stra8</italic> and <italic>Meiosin</italic>, two TFs that are essential for completion of meiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Significant enrichment of the RA signaling pathway was not detected between supporting cells and PGCs in XX or XY gonads at any embryonic stage with CellphoneDB. Given that RA is primarily produced by the mesonephros<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, detection of RA signaling between gonadal supporting cells and PGCs is unlikely. However, <italic>in silico</italic> chromatin binding of RA receptors was enriched in XX PGCs and the RA receptor motifs were found in the regulatory loci for <italic>Rec8, Stra8, Sycp2, Sycp3,</italic> and <italic>Zglp1</italic>, which is consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref></sup>. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the temporal patterns of WNT, BMP, and RA signaling during PGC differentiation.</p>

<title>Discovery analysis identifies potentially new signaling pathways between gonadal supporting cells and PGCs</title>
<p>In addition to these pathways known for their roles in PGC sex determination, we identified several uncharacterized ligand-receptor pairs with sex-specific enrichment. For example, midkine (MDK) signaling was enriched in E13.5 XX gonads. Although the role of MDK signaling in PGCs is not understood, MDK is known to be important for maintaining cell survival and growth and promoting cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">129</xref></sup>. MDK is a heparin-binding cytokine and, together with pleiotrophin, regulates female reproductive activities such as oocyte maturation and the estrous cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">130</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in E13.5 XY gonads, we found enrichment of the Desert Hedgehog (DHH) signaling pathway between <italic>Sox9+</italic> cells and XY PGCs. In addition to regulating fetal Leydig cell differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">131</xref></sup>, DHH signaling has also been shown to regulate germ cell maturation and spermatogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">132</xref></sup>. Ablation of <italic>Dhh</italic> in adult XY mice causes infertility due to a loss of mature sperm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">132</xref></sup>, however, whether <italic>Dhh</italic> regulates germ cell development in fetal XY mice remains to be determined. Overall, we posit that these and other signaling pathways are important for promoting PGC survival and differentiation.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrated the benefit of using multiomics approaches to probe the cellular and developmental pathways involved in cell fate decisions, gametogenesis, and PGC differentiation. Unlike traditional assays, joint RNA and ATAC analyses from individual PGCs enabled the detection of paired chromatin accessibility and gene expression information from the same cell to discover new gene regulatory interactions. We show that our multiomics data accurately identified enrichment of known pathways involved in PGC sex determination, suggesting that our computational approaches are valid and capable of discovering potentially new regulators of PGC fate. Indeed, our findings revealed the diversity of factors required for PGC programming. For example, we cataloged the heterogeneity of PGC populations based on chromatin status and transcription, identified chromatin priming as a major regulatory mechanism in PGC lineage commitment, and revealed a core set of TFs and ligand-receptor pairs unique to XX and XY PGCs. Taken together, our data demonstrate the power of explorative single-nucleus ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to understand the mechanisms inherent to germline differentiation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study uses single nucleus multiomics to profile the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of mouse XX and XY primordial germ cells (PGCs) at three time-points spanning PGC sexual differentiation and entry of XX PGCs into meiosis (embryonic days 11.5-13.5). They find that PGCs can be clustered into sub-populations at each time point, with higher heterogeneity among XX PGCs and more switch-like developmental transitions evident in XY PGCs. In addition, they identify several transcription factors that appear to regulate sex-specific pathways as well as cell-cell communication pathways that may be involved in regulating XX vs XY PGC fate transitions. The findings are important and overall rigorous. The study could be further improved by a better connection to the biological system, including the addition of experiments to validate the 'omics-based findings in vivo and putting the transcriptional heterogeneity of XX PGCs in the context of findings that meiotic entry is spatially asynchronous in the fetal ovary. Overall, this study represents an advance in germ cell regulatory biology and will be a highly used resource in the field of germ cell development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The multiomics data is mostly rigorously collected and carefully interpreted.</p>
<p>(2) The dataset is extremely valuable and helps to answer many long-standing questions in the field.</p>
<p>(3) In general, the conclusions are well anchored in the biology of the germ line in mammals.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The nature of replicates in the data and how they are used in the analysis are not clearly presented in the main text or methods. To interpret the results, it is important to know how replicates were designed and how they were used. Two &quot;technical&quot; replicates are cited but it is not clear what this means.</p>
<p>(2) Transcriptional heterogeneity among XX PGCs is mentioned several times (e.g., lines 321-323) and is a major conclusion of the paper. It has been known for a long time that XX PGCs initiate meiosis in an anterior-to-posterior wave in the fetal ovary starting around E13.5. Some heterogeneity in the XX PGC populations could be explained by spatial position in the ovary without having to invoke novel sub-populations.</p>
<p>(3) There is essentially no validation of any of the conclusions. Heterogeneity in the expression of a given marker could be assessed by immunofluorescence or RNAscope.</p>
<p>(4) The paper sometimes suffers from a problem common to large resource papers, which is that the discussion of specific genes or pathways seems incomplete. An example here is from the analysis of the regulation of the Bnc2 locus, which seems superficial. Relatedly, although many genes and pathways are nominated for important PGC functions, there is no strong major conclusion from the paper overall.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Alexander et al describes a careful and rigorous application of multiomics to mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) and their surrounding gonadal cells during the period of sex differentiation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In thoughtfully designed figures, the authors identify both known and new candidate gene regulatory networks in differentiating XX and XY PGCs and sex-specific interactions of PGCs with supporting cells. In XY germ cells, novel findings include the predicted set of TFs regulating Bnc2, which is known to promote mitotic arrest, as well as the TFs POU6F1/2 and FOXK2 and their predicted targets that function in mitosis and signal transduction. In XX germ cells, the authors deconstruct the regulation of the premeiotic replication regulator Stra8, which reveals TFs involved in meiosis, retinoic acid signaling, pluripotency, and epigenetics among predictions; this finding, along with evidence supporting the regulatory potential of retinoic acid receptors in meiotic gene expression is an important addition to the debate over the necessity of retinoic acid in XX meiotic initiation. In addition, a self-regulatory network of other TFs is hypothesized in XX differentiating PGCs, including TFAP2c, TCF5, ZFX, MGA, and NR6A1, which is predicted to turn on meiotic and Wnt signaling targets. Finally, analysis of PGC-support cell interactions during sex differentiation reveals more interactions in XX, via WNTs and BMPs, as well as some new signaling pathways that predominate in XY PGCs including ephrins, CADM1, Desert Hedgehog, and matrix metalloproteases. This dataset will be an excellent resource for the community, motivating functional studies and serving as a discovery platform.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My one major concern is that the conclusion that PGC sex differentiation (as read out by transcription) involves chromatin priming is overstated. The evidence presented in the figures includes a select handful of genes including Porcn, Rimbp1, Stra8, and Bnc2 for which chromatin accessibility precedes expression. Given that the authors performed all of their comparisons between XX versus XY datasets at each timepoint, have they missed an important comparison that would be a more direct test of chromatin priming: between timepoints for each sex? Furthermore, it remains possible that common mechanisms of differentiation to XX and XY could be missing from this analysis that focused on sex-specific differences.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Alexander et al. reported the gene-regulatory networks underpinning sex determination of murine primordial germ cells (PGCs) through single-nucleus multiomics, offering a detailed chromatin accessibility and gene expression map across three embryonic stages in both male (XY) and female (XX) mice. It highlights how regulatory element accessibility may precede gene expression, pointing to chromatin accessibility as a primer for lineage commitment before differentiation. Sexual dimorphism in these elements and gene expression increases over time, and the study maps transcription factors regulating sexually dimorphic genes in PGCs, identifying sex-specific enrichment in various transcription factors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study includes step-wise multiomic analysis with some computational approach to identify candidate TFs regulating XX and XY PGC gene expression, providing a detailed timeline of chromatin accessibility and gene expression during PGC development, which identifies previously unknown PGC subpopulations and offers a multimodal reference atlas of differentiating PGC clusters. Furthermore, the study maps a complex network of transcription factors associated with sex determination in PGCs, adding depth to our understanding of these processes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the multiomics approach is powerful, it primarily offers correlational insights between chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and transcription factor activity, without direct functional validation of identified regulatory networks.</p>
