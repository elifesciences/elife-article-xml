<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder stemming from deletions or mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (<italic>SMN1</italic>) gene, leading to decreased levels of SMN protein, and subsequent motor neuron death and muscle atrophy. While traditionally viewed as a disorder predominantly affecting motor neurons, recent research suggests the involvement of various peripheral organs in SMA pathology. Notably, the liver has emerged as a significant focus due to the observed fatty liver phenotype and dysfunction in both SMA mouse models and SMA patients. Despite these findings, it remains unclear whether intrinsic depletion of SMN protein in the liver contributes to pathology in the peripheral or central nervous systems. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a mouse model with a liver-specific depletion of SMN by utilizing an <italic>Alb-Cre</italic> transgene together with one <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele and one <italic>Smn</italic> exon 7 allele flanked by loxP sites. Initially, we evaluated phenotypic changes in these mice at postnatal day 19 (P19), a time when the severe model of SMA, the <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic>mice, typically exhibit many symptoms of the disease. Our findings indicate that liver-specific SMN depletion does not induce motor neuron death, neuromuscular pathology or muscle atrophy, characteristics typically observed in the <italic>Smn</italic><sup>2B/-</sup> mouse at P19. However, mild liver steatosis was observed at this time point, although no changes in liver function were detected. Notably, pancreatic alterations resembled that of <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic>mice, with a decrease in insulin-producing β-cells and an increase in glucagon-producing α-cells, accompanied by a reduction in blood glucose and an increase in plasma glucagon and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) levels. Moreover, these changes were transient, as P60 mice exhibited recovery of liver and pancreatic function. While the mosaic pattern of the Cre-mediated excision precludes definitive conclusions regarding the contribution of liver-specific SMN depletion to overall tissue pathology, our findings highlight an intricate connection between liver function and pancreatic abnormalities in SMA, adding a nuanced layer to our understanding of the disease’s complexities.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>Note that the title has been slightly modified as per the suggestion of one of the reviewers. We have carefully addressed the reviewers' constructive feedback and believe the revisions significantly enhance both the clarity and impact of the manuscript.
In this revised version, we have meticulously incorporated all textual suggestions, corrected minor typographical errors, and updated the manuscript with the most recent relevant literature. One of the key improvements is the extension of our analysis to include P60 mice. This new data explores the progression of the phenotype in liver-specific SMN-depleted mice over time, providing insights into whether the observed pathologies worsen or improve. We also expanded our study to include both liver and pancreatic assessments at this later time point.
Additionally, we now present a comprehensive analysis of metabolic hormone levels related to glucose metabolism at both P19 and P60, along with new figures that not only enrich the manuscript's novelty but also deepen our understanding of the model. Furthermore, we have provided a detailed characterization of Cre expression in the liver, pancreas, and spinal cord (SC) at P19, and in the liver at P60. This confirms Cre-specific expression in the liver and reveals a variable pattern of expression across hepatocytes, consistent with prior expectations.
Our revised manuscript also introduces new findings regarding elevated plasma glucagon and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) levels in liver-specific SMN-depleted mice, aligning with histological evidence of pancreatic dysfunction. Interestingly, these effects appear to be transient, likely due to the stochastic nature of Cre expression and the dynamic regenerative capacity of hepatocytes.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Insufficient levels of Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, primarily arising from mutations or deletions in the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene, are the root cause of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a hereditary neuromuscular disorder widely acknowledged as one of the leading genetic causes of infant mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Characterized by the loss of motor neurons, SMA presents as a progressive weakening of muscle strength, primarily impacting proximal muscles. If left untreated, this deterioration culminates in respiratory failure and premature mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The diverse phenotypes observed in SMA patients can be attributed to the genetic variations within the <italic>SMN</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Humans harbor two copies of the <italic>SMN</italic> gene, <italic>SMN1</italic> and <italic>SMN2</italic>, which share a nearly identical sequence except for a critical C to T substitution at position 6 of exon 7 in <italic>SMN2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This single nucleotide change disrupts splicing of the gene, resulting in the predominant production of an unstable protein lacking exon 7, known as <italic>SMN</italic>Δ<italic>7</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Despite this, approximately 10% of functional full-length (FL) SMN protein is still produced by the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Consequently, the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene serves as a modifier of disease phenotype, with a higher copy number correlating with milder disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast, mice possess a single copy of the <italic>Smn</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Notably, while homozygous deletion of both <italic>SMN</italic> genes has not been observed in humans, the homozygous deletion of the <italic>Smn</italic> gene in mice induces morphological alterations and degenerative changes in embryos post-morula stage, ultimately resulting in death at preimplantation stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. This underscores the pivotal role of the <italic>SMN</italic> gene in early embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent research has unveiled the extensive impact of SMN depletion beyond motor neurons, implicating additional tissues such as the liver and pancreas in both SMA patients and mouse models of SMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Despite major therapeutic advancements focusing on restoring SMN levels, which have notably enhanced both lifespan and quality of life in SMA patients, complete phenotypic rescue remains elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Additionally, existing therapies primarily target postnatal treatment, potentially overlooking crucial developmental changes stemming from SMN depletion. This underscores the likelihood of a broader role for the <italic>SMN</italic> gene in multiple non-neuronal cell types, necessitating further exploration.</p>
<p>Attention has been increasingly drawn to the liver as a critical area of investigation in SMA research. Both clinical studies and preclinical mouse models have unveiled disruptions in fatty acid metabolism, leading to an increased susceptibility among SMA patients to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Given its multifaceted role in regulating numerous biological functions, including the storage and regulation of lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and iron, as well as the synthesis of essential growth factors and the clearance of toxic metabolites, any disruptions in liver function may have deleterious effects on other tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To explore the role of SMN in the liver, prior studies have utilized a transgenic mouse model featuring the Cre recombinase transgene driven by the α-fetoprotein promoter (<italic>Alfp-Cre</italic>). This approach led to near-total depletion of SMN protein specifically in the liver, resulting in severe impairment of liver development and late embryonic lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In our study, to better represent the level of SMN depletion in the liver observed in SMA and elucidate the intricate interplay between SMN deficiency in the liver and its systemic impact in SMA-like pathology, we utilized a mouse model employing <italic>Alb-Cre</italic>, where the albumin promoter drives expression of Cre recombinase in a liver-specific manner. This model also harbors one <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele and one <italic>Smn</italic> exon 7 allele flanked by loxP sites (F7). The <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele contains a 3-base pair substitution in the mouse <italic>Smn</italic> gene, resulting in aberrant splicing of exon 7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Consequently, this genetic approach results in the production of approximately 30% full-length functional SMN protein production in the liver.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal that our novel liver-specific SMN depleted (herein referred to as <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>) mouse model induces mild liver steatosis and disrupts pancreatic function at postnatal day 19 (P19), characterized by decreased insulin-positive and increased glucagon-positive cells, alongside reduced blood glucose levels. However, both liver and pancreatic defects were rescued by P60. Remarkably, this mouse model does not exhibit an overt SMA phenotype, demonstrating normal lifespan and motor function. Nevertheless, our data suggests an intricate relationship between hepatic function and pancreatic abnormalities in SMA, thereby enhancing our comprehension of the disease’s pathophysiology.</p>

<title>Generation of liver-specific SMN-depleted mice</title>
<p>To elucidate the impact of liver-specific SMN depletion on both CNS and peripheral tissue pathology, we utilized mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse albumin promoter, referred to as <italic>Alb<sup>Cre</sup></italic>. This strain is commonly employed for liver-specific gene knockout using the Cre/loxP system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We generated the <italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>genotype by crossing <italic>Smn<sup>F7/F7</sup></italic> with <italic>Smn<sup>2B/2B</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The <italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> genotype carries one allele harboring a three nucleotide switch in the exon splicing enhancer within exon 7 of the mouse <italic>Smn</italic> gene (known as <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele), mimicking the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, while the other allele features exon 7 flanked by l<italic>oxP</italic> sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, crosses between <italic>Alb<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Smn<sup>F7/F7</sup></italic>yielded <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Smn<sup>F7/+</sup></italic> offspring.</p>

<p>A. Schematic representation of the breeding scheme to generate liver-specific SMN depletion. In these mice, the <italic>Smn</italic> gene carries one <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele that harbors a three-nucleotide switch in exon 7, and one <italic>Smn</italic> allele whose exon 7 is floxed by loxP sites (<italic>Smn<sup>F7</sup></italic>). The <italic>Alb-Cre</italic> transgene has also been crossed into this background to provide liver-specific expression of the Cre recombinase. B. Littermate controls do not harbor Cre recombinase but do carry one <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele and are thus used as heterozygous controls. C. Upon crossing <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>F7/+</sup></italic> with <italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> animals, Cre recombination will induce specific excision of exon 7 in the liver, leading to reduced SMN protein production only in the liver.

<p>The liver-specific mouse line was subsequentially established through further genetic crosses between <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>;<italic>Smn<sup>F7/+</sup></italic>and <italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>, resulting in various genotypes, including <italic>+/+</italic>;<italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), and <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). As <italic>+/</italic>+;<italic>Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>mice lack Cre recombinase, they were used as heterozygous controls. In contrast, recombination occurs in <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>animals resulting in the specific deletion of one allele of exon 7 in the liver, while the <italic>Smn</italic>2B allele remains unaffected.</p>
<p><italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice, the severe mouse model of SMA, express approximately 15% residual full-length SMN (FLSMN) compared to <italic>Smn<sup>2B/+</sup></italic>heterozygous mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, both genotypes were included in this study as additional controls. Tissues were collected at postnatal day 19 (P19), corresponding to the symptomatic phase of the <italic>Smn</italic><sup>2B/-</sup> mouse model. At this stage, <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic>mice show increased liver steatosis and metabolic defects, ultimately culminating in multiple system defects and mortality, typically occurring around P25<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In contrast, <italic>Smn<sup>2B/+</sup></italic> mice have slightly reduced levels of FLSMN and no overt phenotypical changes compared to wild-type mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We first assessed SMN protein levels in the liver and across CNS and peripheral tissues. Our findings confirmed a reduction in SMN protein levels across various tissues in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-H</xref>). However, in <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>, there was a ∼70% decrease in FLSMN protein expression in the liver (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, D’) compared to littermate control counterparts (<italic>+/+;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>). Conversely, SMN protein levels in the brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, E’), muscle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, F’), spinal cord (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, G’) and pancreas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>, H’) remained unaltered, indicating that deletion of <italic>Smn</italic> exon 7 was restricted to the liver in <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn</italic><sup>2<italic>B/F7</italic></sup>mice. We validated these findings by assessing Cre expression in liver, pancreas, and spinal cord tissues (Supp. Fig. 1A). Cre expression was exclusively observed in the liver, where it exhibited variable expression across hepatocytes, with some cells showing detectable expression while others showed no expression, confirming the stochastic nature of Cre activity in our model. No Cre signal was detected in either the pancreas or spinal cord tissues.</p>

<title>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup> mice show mild yet important liver steatosis</title>
<p>We previously showed that <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit defects in fatty acid metabolism and lipid accumulation in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Additionally, SMA patients face an elevated risk of dyslipidemia and steatosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Hence, we explored whether the intrinsic decrease in SMN levels restricted to the liver would lead to increased lipid accumulation. Histology from <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) qualitatively indicates some level of hepatic microvesicular steatosis and lipid accumulation. However, there was a noticeable variation in cell morphology and Oil Red-O retention among hepatocytes, suggesting incomplete recombination.</p>

<title>Liver-specific SMN-depleted mice display pancreatic defects</title>

Therefore, we conducted immunohistochemistry to investigate the cellular profile of the pancreas, aiming to ascertain whether the targeted depletion of SMN in the liver contributes to pancreatic dysfunction. Surprisingly, double-labeling of insulin-producing β cells and glucagon-producing α cells revealed a significant decrease in the proportion of β cells and a notable increase in α cells in the pancreas of <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>+/+;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> and <italic>Smn</italic><sup>2B/+</sup> heterozygous controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A,B</xref>,F).

<title>Liver-specific SMN depletion does not affect major adipocyte and gastrointestinal hormones</title>
<p>Gastrointestinal (GI) hormones play a key role in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism and pancreatic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, to assess whether adipocytes and GI hormones contribute to liver and pancreatic dysfunction in liver-specific SMN-depleted mice, we measured plasma levels of major adipocyte hormones (leptin and resistin) and GI hormones (ghrelin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), peptide YY (PYY) and secretin) at P19 and P60<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Our data revealed no significant changes in adipocyte hormones at either time point (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A-B</xref>, G-H) across all genotypes. Moreover, few alterations in GI hormones (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C-F</xref>, I-L) were observed exclusively in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice at P19, including a marked reduction of ghrelin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>) – a hormone involved in glucose homeostasis in pancreatic islet and liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> – and secretin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>), which regulates secretory activity in organs such as the liver and pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The liver is pivotal in regulating numerous biological functions in the body. These encompass, among others, the storage and balance of lipids, carbohydrates, and iron, as well as the synthesis of vital growth factors and the clearance of non-essential or harmful metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Given its multifaceted role, any alterations in liver function can potentially have cascading effects on other organs within the body. Hence, aside from elucidating the impact of liver-specific SMN depletion on hepatic function, it is imperative to explore its effects on other tissues, as alterations in these tissues have been documented in various mouse models of SMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Previous work on conditional knockout of <italic>Smn</italic> in the livers of mice resulted in severe impairment of liver development characterized by iron overload and subsequent liver atrophy, ultimately leading to late embryonic lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In our study, we generated a novel mouse model where instead of a complete knockout of <italic>Smn</italic> in the liver, we created a scenario where SMN protein was depleted to 30% of full-length SMN production specifically within the liver, while SMN protein levels in other tissues remain comparable to those of heterozygous controls. Notably, this mouse line did not exhibit any signs of developmental delays, liver atrophy, or reduced lifespan. Nonetheless, within 19 days after birth, <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> mice showed a mild yet rapid onset of fatty liver disease and trends towards an increase in lipid levels when maintained on a normal chow diet, underscoring the importance of SMN in lipid metabolism. Interestingly, these changes were transient, as by P60, liver-specific SMN-depleted mice displayed no lipid accumulation or hepatocyte morphological changes, likely due to the compensatory proliferation of non-recombined cells.</p>
<p>A recent study found that 75% of pediatric and adult SMA patients showed ultrasonic evidence of mild to moderate hepatic steatosis, independent of disease severity or SMA subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> model using SMA patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells (iHeps), a 10-fold increase in lipid accumulation was observed, correlating with reduced SMN protein expression. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed dysregulation in mitochondrial and lipid metabolism pathways, including downregulation of key genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, alongside increased lipid biosynthesis. Notably, repletion of SMN in SMA iHeps restored metabolic and hepatic functions, rescuing steatosis and mitochondrial defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Excitingly, our current work further supports these findings, demonstrating that treatment with an adeno-associated viral vector carrying a liver-specific albumin promoter in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic>mice resulted in partial restoration of liver SMN levels, improving survival, alleviating liver pathology, and restoring muscle size and pancreatic cell balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Additionally, a recent study found that 60.8% of adult SMA type 3 patients (23 patients) exhibited at least one lipid abnormality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, further supporting the hypothesis that hepatocyte-specific SMN deficiency contributes to liver pathology.</p>
<p>Mild liver steatosis may be accompanied by disruptions in crucial liver function markers, notably those implicated in iron metabolism, autophagy, and growth factor regulation, such as IGF-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we initially investigated the expression of HO-1, an enzyme responsible for heme degradation into iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin; and transferrin, a liver-synthesized glycoprotein involved in iron transport across tissues (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>). Prior studies have documented alterations in these proteins in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic>mouse livers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. While our current analysis did not reveal significant differences in <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> mice, the observed upward trend in transferrin and HO levels suggests ongoing changes in iron metabolism, which may not be fully manifested at P19. In addition, incomplete Cre-mediated excision of <italic>Smn<sup>F7</sup></italic> allele may be hindering a comprehensive understanding of SMN’s role in liver function.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no alterations were observed for P62 levels, a multifunctional scaffold protein implicated in autophagy, formation of hepatic inclusion bodies, and hepatocyte cell death (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>) despite its increased presence in mouse models of SMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Similarly, there were no changes detected in IGF-1 protein levels, whose deficiency has been linked to liver pathology and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, and its decrease is evident in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. NAFLD involves the accumulation of fatty acids in more than 5% of liver cells, occurring in the absence of alcohol consumption. This condition presents with varying degrees of severity, with simple steatosis being the most common manifestation. Simple steatosis is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver with minimal impact on liver function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Consequently, our model holds promise as a valuable resource for investigating microvesicular steatohepatitis and NAFLD during the early postnatal period. Additionally, unlike the well-studied <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> model of SMA, this liver-specific SMN depletion enables the study of hepatic SMN function without the confounding effects of systemic SMN depletion or the severe phenotype observed in the <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>Previously, our research unveiled metabolic abnormalities in SMA-like mice, including glucose intolerance, insulin hypersensitivity, and hyperglucagonemia, accompanied by changes in pancreatic islet composition characterized by an increase in glucagon-producing α-cells at the expense of insulin-producing β-cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Histopathological examination of pancreatic tissue from infants and children with SMA type I corroborated these findings, revealing a predominant presence of glucagon-producing α-cells within pancreatic islets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, one-year-old <italic>Smn<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice producing approximately 50% of SMN protein, when exposed to a high-fat diet, exhibited dysregulation in the proportion of glucagon-producing α-cells within pancreatic islets and heightened hepatic insulin and glucagon sensitivity<sup>9</sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we uncovered a novel intrinsic role of liver-specific SMN in pancreatic function, distinct from IGF-1 signaling, pancreatic SMN levels (which remained stable), or canonical SMA pathology. Although the precise role of SMN in the liver-pancreas axis remains unclear, we speculate that altered amino acid metabolism may contribute to the disrupted communication between these two organs. The liver plays a central role in amino acid metabolism, and disturbances in this process can affect the liver-α cell axis, a well-documented feedback loop in which circulating amino acids stimulate glucagon secretion, which in turn regulates hepatic amino acid uptake and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In the context of metabolic diseases such as NAFLD and SMA, liver dysfunction, including impaired lipid metabolism, may disrupt this axis, leading to abnormal glucagon secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. It is possible that dysregulated amino acid pathways may directly influence this feedback loop.</p>
<p>Further evidence for this hypothesis comes from a recent study in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and NAFLD, which found hyperglucagonaemia and altered amino acid profiles. In T2D-NAFLD patients, plasma glucagon levels were significantly higher than in individuals without NAFLD, with a positive correlation between plasma glucagon concentrations and liver fat content. This study also showed increased plasma levels of isoleucine and glutamate, and decreased levels of glycine and serine in individuals with NAFLD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that metabolic dysregulation in the liver, including alterations in amino acid metabolism, may exacerbate glucagon secretion. Interestingly, such changes in amino acid metabolism are consistent with clinical observations in SMA patients, where an “amino acid diet” — low in fats and rich in specific amino acids — has been shown to provide some clinical benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Given this, it is plausible that impaired liver metabolism in SMN-depleted mice alters the liver-α cell axis, leading to dysregulated glucagon and GLP-1 secretion. While this proposed link between liver steatosis, amino acid metabolism, and pancreatic dysfunction is speculative, we are actively investigating the mechanisms underlying this liver-pancreas interplay in mouse models of SMA.</p>
<p>In addition, while the hallmark pathological features of SMA include motor neuron loss, NMJ pathology, muscle atrophy, and consequent motor function alterations, these were not evident in the <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>mouse model at P19. However, given that glucose metabolism defects are observed in various neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders, subsequent work is required to clarify the impact of liver-specific SMN depletion on pancreatic function. Although hepatic and pancreatic abnormalities likely occur independently of disease onset, given that SMN depletion in motor neurons and muscle alone is sufficient to induce a SMA-like phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, the potential influence of these anomalies on SMA progression warrants careful consideration.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings suggest that alterations in SMN production solely within the liver may suffice to induce pathological hepatic and pancreatic function, shedding light on a novel role of SMN in liver physiology.</p>

<title>Tissue harvesting and processing</title>
<p>Following euthanasia, liver, and <italic>tibialis anterior</italic> (TA) muscles underwent fixation in a 1:10 dilution of buffered formalin for 48 h at 4°C, followed by transfer to 70% ethanol at the same temperature until processing. The pancreas was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 48 h at 4°C, then similarly moved to 70% ethanol for processing. For the lumbar spinal cord (SC) and liver (for Oil Red-O staining), fixation was performed overnight at 4°C in 4% PFA, followed by immersion in 30% sucrose in PBS. Subsequently, the liver and spinal cord were flash-frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding medium. Cryosections of the lumbar spinal cord were cut at a thickness of 16 μm, while liver sections were cut at 10 μm and stored at -80°C until immunohistochemical analysis. Cre immunostaining of cryosectioned liver and spinal cord was performed as described in <xref rid="s4d1" ref-type="sec">section 4.4.1</xref>, with the exception that the antigen retrieval step was not performed.</p>
<p>The abdominal musculature was dissected and fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature, followed by 3 washes in 1X PBS, after which the transversus abdominis (TVA) muscle was dissected from the abdominal musculature. TA, liver, and pancreas samples were handled at the University of Ottawa Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. Paraffin blocks containing tissues were sectioned at 4 μm thickness using a microtome. Sections of TA and liver were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) using an XL CV5030 autostainer from Leica. Liver cryosections were stained with Oil Red-O and counterstained with hematoxylin using established protocols. Images of H&amp;E and Oil Red-O-stained samples were scanned with a MIRAX MIDI digital slide scanner manufactured by Zeiss. Image acquisition was performed using Panoramic Viewer 1.15.4 software.</p>

<title>Motor neurons</title>
<p>Lumbar spinal cord sections were prepared for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) staining of motor neurons. The slides were air-dried at room temperature for 30 min and then rinsed in TBS-T for 5 min. Samples were permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, followed by blocking in 1x Power Block (BioGenex, Fremont, CA) for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with a goat anti-ChAT (details in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) antibody at a dilution of 1:100 in 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 nights at 4°C.</p>
<p>After the initial antibody incubation, slides were washed twice for 10 min with TBS-T at room temperature. Following the washes, samples were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-goat IgG at a dilution of 1:200 in 10% donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h at room temperature in a humid chamber. Nuclei were counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS for 5 min.</p>
<p>Finally, the slides were rinsed 3X for 10 min with TBS-T and mounted with Fluoromount-G™ Mounting Medium (Invitrogen). Spinal cord sections were examined under fluorescence using an Axio Imager M2 microscope (Zeiss) and imaged at 20X magnification for quantification, and at 63x for representative pictures. The number of ChAT-positive motor neurons with a diameter of ≥20 μm per ventral horn was recorded for 7-10 different sections per animal, each separated by at least 100 μm to prevent re-counting of the same motor neuron.

<p>Blood was collected from the mice immediately after decapitation using a Microcuvette CB 300 K2E coated with K2 EDTA (16.444.100) for capillary sampling. All samples were taken randomly without a fasting period. The blood was centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 minutes at room temperature to separate the plasma. For plasma volumes less than 50 µL, genotypes were pooled to achieve a minimum volume of 50 µL as needed. The multiplexing analysis was performed using the Luminex™ 200 system (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) by Eve Technologies Corp. (Calgary, Alberta). Twelve markers were simultaneously measured in the samples using Eve Technologies’ Mouse Metabolic Hormone 12-Plex Discovery Assay® (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The 12-plex consisted of Amylin(active), C-Peptide 2, Ghrelin, GIP(total), GLP-1(active), Glucagon, Insulin, Leptin, PP, PYY, Resistin and Secretin. Assay sensitivities of these markers range from 1.4 – 91.8 pg/mL for the 12-plex. Individual analyte sensitivity values are available in the MilliporeSigma MILLIPLEX® MAP protocol.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents a comprehensive exploration of the role of liver-specific Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) depletion in peripheral and central nervous system tissue pathology through a well-constructed mouse model. This study is pioneering in its approach, focusing on the broader physiological implications of SMN, which has traditionally been associated predominantly with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Novelty and Relevance: The study addresses a significant gap in understanding the role of liver-specific SMN depletion in the context of SMA. This is a novel approach that adds valuable insights into the multi-organ impact of SMN deficiency.</p>
<p>(2) Comprehensive Methodology: The use of a well-characterized mouse model with liver-specific SMN depletion is a strength. The study employs a robust set of techniques, including genetic engineering, histological analysis, and various biochemical assays.</p>
<p>(3) Detailed Analysis: The manuscript provides a thorough analysis of liver pathology and its potential systemic effects, particularly on the pancreas and glucose metabolism.</p>
<p>(4) Clear Presentation: The manuscript is well written. The results are presented clearly with well-designed figures and detailed legends.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Limited Time Points: The study primarily focuses on a single time point (P19). This limits the understanding of the temporal progression of liver and pancreatic pathology in the context of SMN depletion. Longitudinal studies would provide a better understanding of disease progression.</p>
<p>(2) Incomplete Recombination: The mosaic pattern of Cre-mediated excision leads to variability in SMN depletion, which complicates the interpretation of some results. Ensuring more consistent recombination across samples would strengthen the conclusions.</p>
<p>After the revision, the authors addressed the reviewers' questions by extending their analyses to include P60 mice, conducting both liver and pancreatic analyses, and adding a comprehensive panel of metabolic hormones related to glucose metabolism in animals at P19 and P60. They also corrected all errors identified during the initial review process and expanded the discussion to clarify raised issues. All my questions have now been addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Marylin Alves de Almeida et al. developed a novel mouse cross via conditionally depleting functional SMN protein in the liver (AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7). This mouse model retains a proportion of SMN in the liver, which better recapitulates SMN deficiency observed in SMA patients and allows further investigation into liver-specific SMN deficiency and its systemic impact. They show that AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice do not develop an apparent SMA phenotype as mice did not develop motor neuron death, neuromuscular pathology or muscle atrophy, which is observed in the Smn2B/- controls. Nonetheless, at P19 and P60, these mice develop mild liver steatosis, and interestingly, this conditional depletion of SMN in the liver impacts cells in the pancreas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The current model has clearly delineated the apparent metabolic perturbations which involve a significantly increased lipid accumulation in the liver and pancreatic cell defects in AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice at P19 and P60. Standard methods like H&amp;E and Oil Red-O staining show that in AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice, their livers closely mimic the livers of Smn2B/- mice, which have the full body knockout of SMN protein. Unlike previous work, this liver-specific conditional depletion of SMN is superior in that it is not lethal to the mouse, which allows an opportunity to investigate the long-term effects of liver-specific SMN on the pathology of SMA.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given that SMA often involves fatty liver, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, using the current mouse model, the authors could have explored the long-term effects of liver-specific depletion of SMN on metabolic phenotypes beyond P19, as well as systemic effects like glucose homeostasis. Given that the authors also report pancreatic cell defects, the long-term effect on insulin secretion and resistance could be further explored. This has been addressed in the revised manuscript. The mechanistic link between a liver-specific SMN depletion and apparent pancreatic cell defects has been made clearer.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>This current work explores a novel mouse cross in order to specifically deplete liver SMN using an Albumin-Cre driver line. This provides insight into the contribution of liver-specific SMN protein to the pathology of SMA, which is relevant for understanding metabolic perturbations in SMA patients. Nonetheless, given that SMA in patients involve a systemic deletion or mutation of the SMN gene, the authors could emphasize the utility of this liver-specific mouse model, as opposed to using in vitro models, which have been recently reported (Leow et al, 2024, JCI).</p>

<p>No further suggestions. Previous recommendations have been addressed by the authors.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The variability in Cre-mediated excision is inherently stochastic, influenced by factors such as Cre expression levels, timing of recombination, and the accessibility of the target locus in individual cells. Achieving complete consistency across samples is particularly challenging, especially given the complexity of our breeding scheme, which occasionally results in litters without any animals of the desired genotype. Importantly, our study not only demonstrates that liver-specific SMN depletion results in liver alterations and pancreatic dysfunction but also highlights the limitations and challenges associated with this mouse model. By doing so, we aim to provide valuable insights for other researchers considering similar approaches in future studies.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Longitudinal Studies: Conducting studies at maybe one more time points postnatally to provide a clearer picture of how liver-specific SMN depletion affects tissue pathology over time.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We extended our analysis to include P60 mice and performed both liver and pancreatic analyses at this time point to address this suggestion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Functional Assays: Incorporate glucose tolerance tests, insulin sensitivity tests, and more detailed metabolic profiling to better understand the physiological consequences of liver-specific SMN depletion on glucose metabolism and pancreatic function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have included a full panel of metabolic hormones associated with glucose metabolism from animals at P19 and P60. These new data, along with additional figures, have now been provided in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Mechanism: Discuss the molecular pathways affected by SMN depletion in the liver and pancreas. Mechanistic studies including transcriptomic or proteomic analyses to identify dysregulated pathways will help.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment. We have thoroughly addressed this suggestion in the Discussion section, particularly in lines 284-298 and 334-359.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Typos in the abstract: beta cells secret insulin and alpha cells produce gulcagon.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for catching this error. It has been corrected to reflect that insulin is produced by beta cells and glucagon by alpha cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Efficiency and specificity of the Alb-Cre: if possible, cross the Alb-Cre with the Rosa26 reporter line to test the efficiency and specificity of the Alb-Cre.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this would provide valuable insights. However, initiating a new breeding program to generate the required genotypes would take over a year and is beyond the scope of this study. To address this in part, we performed Cre immunostaining of the liver, pancreas, and spinal cord at P19, as well as the liver at P60. These results, now included in Supplemental Figure 1, demonstrate liver-specific expression and variability across hepatocytes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The title of this manuscript is potentially misleading. The manuscript largely investigates the involvement of SMN protein on peripheral organs such as the liver, muscles, neuromuscular junction, and the pancreas. Yet, the title could be interpreted that the peripheral nervous system or central nervous system is the main focus. The title should be edited to indicate key terms such as &quot;motor neuron and peripheral tissue pathology&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have revised the title to better represent the study’s focus. It is now “Impact of liver-specific survival motor neuron (SMN) depletion on central nervous system and peripheral tissue pathology”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>Please clarify and explain clearly the various mouse lines (Smn2B/+, Smn2B/- and +/+; Smn2B/F7 ) used as controls as the nomenclature used is confusing. In addition, authors could consider the use of a wild-type mouse line to be used as a control to validate changes in AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now provided clarification on mouse line nomenclature in the Results section (lines 104–124). Full-body heterozygous mice (_Smn_2B/+) are used as controls due to their slightly reduced SMN protein levels and absence of phenotypic changes compared to wild-type mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given that the main phenotype implicated by the liver-specific depletion of SMN protein in AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice is pancreatic abnormalities (changes in alpha- and beta- cell numbers and blood glucose levels), authors should expand further on the pancreatic phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a full panel of metabolic hormones related to glucose metabolism in animals at P19 and P60. Furthermore, this has been discussed in detail in lines 284-298 and 334-344 of the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A pancreas-specific depletion of SMN would provide this current manuscript with a better understanding of the role of SMN in regulating SMA pathology and provide more definitive conclusions on the contribution of liver-specific SMN depletion on normal pancreatic function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this would be very informative. However, to do this would require initiation of a new breeding program that will take more than a year to arrive at the right genotypes. Although valuable, it is beyond the scope of the present study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should also delineate the role of hepatic SMN in pancreatic function, and how the intrinsic liver-specific loss of SMN directly impacts the pancreas. Currently, literature demonstrates that the fatty liver phenotype in SMA patients is a primary SMN-dependent hepatocyte-intrinsic liver defect associated with mitochondrial and other hepatic metabolism implications (see Leow et al, 2024 J Clin Invest). Given that the authors describe that SMN protein levels are not altered in the pancreas of AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice at P19, the authors ought to clarify how pancreas development and function is impacted in this mouse model, whether in-utero or postnatally. This could potentially underscore the cross-talk between liver SMN and pancreas function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have discussed the relationship between hepatic SMN and pancreatic function in the Discussion at lines 284-298 and 334-359.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Authors should also perform some metabolic tolerance tests to both oral glucose and insulin at an older age (e.g. P60) to study their homeostasis in these mice. These would help to substantiate the authors' conclusion and provide the paper with a greater level of novelty.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. A full panel of metabolic hormones related to glucose metabolism at P19 and P60 has been included, supported by additional figures that enhance the manuscript's novelty and depth.</p>

<p>Authors mentioned in the Discussion in lines 238 to 240: &quot;Altogether, our findings underscore the necessity of conducting further investigations at later time points to unveil potential modifications in other pathways and their repercussions on liver physiology&quot;. Please elucidate the effects of longer term liver-specific depletion of SMN beyond P19, such as the onset of NAFLD or a diabetic phenotype due to pancreatic dysfunctions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We extended our data to include P60 mice and performed liver and pancreatic analyses at these time points. The observed effects were transient, possibly due to the stochastic nature of Cre expression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, while AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice had similar weight gain trends as controls, it does appear that AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice weigh more than their controls by P60 (Figure 9C). This data would provide more convincing evidence of the metabolic defects observed in these mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we included new data (Figure 9D) showing % weight gain at P60 normalized to basal weight at P7. However, no statistically significant differences were detected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Other than protein quantification, authors should perform immunohistochemistry or in-situ hybridization of SMN and imaging of AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 organs to validate the loss of liver-specific SMN. It is unclear from western blots that the expression of SMN is only in hepatocytes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Unfortunately, SMN antibodies have not produced reliable tissue immunostaining. To address this, we performed Cre immunostaining of the liver, pancreas, and spinal cord at P19, and the liver at P60, which demonstrated liver-specific expression. These results are now included in Supplemental Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Authors should consider re-wording lines 228 through 231: &quot;While our current analysis did not reveal significant differences in AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice, the observed upward trend in transferrin and HO levels suggests ongoing changes in iron metabolism, which may not be fully manifested at P19&quot;. Alternatively, a higher number of mouse samples would allow them to qualify this statement. Authors should also consider comparing levels of liver biomarkers such as ALT and AST, to check for liver homeostatic function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have removed speculative statements to avoid unsupported claims.</p>

<p>Recommendations:</p>
<p>The methods and additional details to generate the AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 should be explained better in section 2.1 of the Results. It is potentially confusing as to why these mice had to carry both 2B and F7 alleles. Additionally, the role of the F7 allele is not deliberately clear in the Introduction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Additional details are now included in the Introduction (lines 87-90) and the Results section (lines 104-124).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Authors should refer to Leow et al 2024 (J Clin Invest) and discuss how their current findings compare with their hepatocyte-intrinsic SMN deficiency IPSCs model.</p>
<p>
We note a previous publication (Deguise et al 2021 Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol) by the authors which characterized the Smn2B/- mouse model and its NAFLD/NASH features. From our understanding, the Smn2B/- mouse model appears to recapitulate SMA phenotype well, such as the early onset of hepatic steatosis and neurological conditions. As a follow-up to this publication, authors should discuss why this current study of a liver-specific SMN depletion is important and relevant to the study of SMA pathology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful suggestions. We have included a discussion of these findings and their relevance to the study of SMA pathology in lines 284-298 and 309-322.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor corrections:</p>
<p>Abstract (line 32) reads: &quot;a decrease in insulin producing alpha-cells and an increase in glucagon producing beta-cells&quot;. The authors should clarify and correct as insulin producing beta-cells and glucagon producing alpha-cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for catching the error. We corrected the description of insulin- and glucagon-producing cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Please clarify the number and gender of mice used for weight tracking and motor function experiments up to P60 (Figure 9C). It would be inappropriate if male and female mice were plotted together. If so, authors should stratify data by gender.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Unfortunately, we did not stratify the animals by sex due to the unequal and insufficient number of males and females in our study. To address this, we normalized weight gain to each animal’s starting weight, and no significant differences were observed (now shown in Figure 9D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The number of figures should be reduced. We recommend merging Figures 1 and 2 (generation of AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mouse line and validation) and Figures 3 and 4 (liver function). Figures 5 through 9 may be supplemental figures instead.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. We merged Figures 1 and 2, and Figures 3 and 4, as requested. However, we would prefer to keep the other figures within the main results as they assess the impact of liver-specific depletion of SMN on other pathologies within the mouse model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Standardize the use of asterisks and reporting p-values in Figure 2. All other figures in the manuscript utilize asterisks, but Figures 2C', 2D' and 2E' use p-values across comparisons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>P-values were included only when they approached statistical significance, providing additional clarity to the results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is unclear what the white arrow in Figure 7A indicates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is meant to point out the absence of an innervating axon. Please see Figure 5 legend, lines 801-802.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Note spelling errors in Figures 8B and 8C: 'Muscle flber'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for catching this. We have corrected the typo to indicate muscle fiber instead.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Please clarify if muscle fiber size should be indicated as µm2 instead of µ2 in Figures 8B and 8C, as written in Materials and Methods under line 394.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for catching this. We corrected the typo to indicate µm2 instead.</p>
