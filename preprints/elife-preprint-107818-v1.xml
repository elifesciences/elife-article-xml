<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Defining quantitative biochemical mechanisms of microtubule dynamics and regulation is a current challenge. Stu2/XMAP215-family polymerases use tubulin-binding TOG domains to catalyze microtubule growth, but how polymerase activity results from the number and tubulin-binding properties of TOGs is not understood. We tested whether an enzyme-like biochemical model for the unrelated actin polymerase Ena/VASP could be applied to quantitatively relate Stu2 microtubule polymerase activity to the number of its TOGs and the rate constants governing their interactions with tubulin. Stu2 activity displayed enzyme-like characteristics consistent with the biochemical model: Stu2 stimulated microtubule growth rates with hyperbolic dependence on tubulin concentration, and the amount of Stu2 on the microtubule end did not vary with tubulin concentration (microtubule growth rate). Complementary measurements of TOG:tubulin binding revealed high affinity (10 nM) and slow dissociation (0.03 s<sup>-1</sup>). The polymerase and binding measurements can be unified within the biochemical model: Stu2 operates with high efficiency, acting as a tubulin-shuttling antenna on the microtubule end that is primarily limited by the rate of tubulin:TOG association. Our work thus provides a quantitative biochemical mechanism for TOG-based polymerases. That unrelated microtubule and actin polymerases use the same enzyme-like mechanism provides an example of convergent evolution in the cytoskeleton.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic polymers of αβ-tubulin (tubulin) that mediate essential cellular functions such as cell division, transport, and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Janke and Magiera, 2020</xref>). MT dynamics are regulated by multiple MT-associated proteins (MAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brouhard and Rice, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Goodson and Jonasson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gudimchuk and McIntosh, 2021</xref>). Defining and quantifying the biochemical mechanisms underlying MT dynamics and regulation is an ongoing challenge for the field.</p>
<p>Stu2/XMAP215-family proteins are conserved ‘polymerases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gard and Kirschner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ohkura et al., 1988</xref>) that catalyze MT growth using αβ-tubulin-binding TOG (Tumor Overexpressed Gene) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Al-Bassam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). All family members contain multiple, flexibly-linked TOG domains, but the domain organization and oligomerization state of these polymerases can vary across taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Al-Bassam and Chang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Slep, 2009</xref>)(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>): fungal polymerases such as Stu2 (S. cerevisiae) and Alp14 (S. pombe) are homodimers containing two different TOG domains per monomer whereas metazoan polymerases like XMAP215 (X. laevis) and chTOG (H. sapiens) are monomers containing 5 (or possibly 6) different TOG domains. Despite years of study from multiple groups, a quantitative biochemical understanding of how these polymerases work has not yet been defined. Currently, two main classes of mechanism for polymerase activity have been proposed. Our group advanced a ‘concentrating reactants’ model in which catalytic polymerase activity results from linked TOG domains at the MT end recruiting unpolymerized tubulin, thereby increasing the effective concentration of tubulin and consequently the rate of tubulin:MT interactions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>). Another group proposed a ‘polarized unfurling’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Nithianantham et al., 2018</xref>) in which polymerase activity results from a multi-step, multi-tubulin delivery process that postulates specific TOG:TOG contacts and distinct roles for different TOG domains; this model is based on structures of TOG:tubulin complexes but does not obviously explain why polymerase activity is catalytic. These two models represent very different views about how the polymerase might work and have different implications for thinking about TOG-based polymerase mechanism across taxa. Nevertheless, they both share a common limitation: neither quantitatively links polymerase activity to the number and tubulin-binding affinity/kinetics of TOG domains.</p>

<p>With the goal of providing a deeper and more general understanding of Stu2/XMAP215-family polymerase mechanism and whether it is conserved between homodimeric and monomeric family members, we sought to improve over current models by defining a quantitative relationship between the growth-promoting activity of a polymerase and the number and tubulin-binding properties of its TOG domains. We were inspired by prior work on Ena/VASP, an otherwise unrelated actin polymerase that appears to share a similar functional design with Stu2/XMAP215 polymerases: both polymerases contain multiple flexibly linked domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) — TOGs in Stu2/XMAP215 and GAB/EVH2 in Ena/VASP — that preferentially interact with unpolymerized tubulin and actin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ferron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Walders-Harbeck et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast to the MT polymerases, however, for the actin polymerase Ena/VASP there is a quantitative biochemical model that explains how its polymerase activity results from the number and actin-binding kinetics of its GAB domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</xref>). Using Stu2 as a model, we tested whether the biochemical model for an actin polymerase could also be applied to explain the activity of MT polymerases.</p>
<p>The biochemical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</xref>) essentially views the polymerase as analogous to an enzyme that acts on the polymer end, using unpolymerized subunits as its substrate. We first showed that the growth-promoting activity of Stu2 displayed two characteristics required by the biochemical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</xref>): (i) a fixed concentration of Stu2 stimulated MT elongation rate with hyperbolic dependence on tubulin concentration, consistent with enzyme-like action, and (ii) the amount of Stu2 on the MT end did not vary detectably with tubulin concentration, so variation in polymerase-stimulation of MT growth reflects something other than differential accumulation of the polymerase on the MT end. Finally, we directly measured the binding affinity and kinetics for TOG:tubulin interactions, revealing tighter than expected binding that is consistent with the measured dependence of polymerase activity on tubulin concentration.</p>
<p>The binding measurements and polymerase activity can be unified within the biochemical model, providing a quantitative understanding of how MT polymerase activity results from the number and tubulin binding kinetics of TOG domains. The results indicate that Stu2 operates with very high efficiency: the rate-limiting step in the mechanism is unpolymerized tubulin binding to a TOG domain, and once a TOG binds to an unpolymerized tubulin, that tubulin nearly always becomes incorporated into the MT. Nothing in the model requires a specific oligomerization state; given earlier data showing comparable activity for monomeric and dimeric “two TOG” variants of Stu2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>), the enzyme-like biochemical model should be broadly applicable to polymerases across taxa. Thus, Stu2/XMAP215-family polymerases function like tubulin-shuttling antennas that accelerate the arrival of unpolymerized tubulin to the MT end.</p>
<p>This kind of mechanism is more consistent with the ‘concentrating reactants’ mechanism we proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>). The biochemical model does not specify the mechanism of polymerase end localization, but there, too, Stu2/XMAP215 and Ena/VASP polymerases appear to share a common feature: both polymerases only localize to the growing end in the presence of unpolymerized subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>) (in other words, end localization for both polymerases cannot be separated from polymerase activity). The similarity in mechanism between these two otherwise unrelated cytoskeletal polymerases provides an interesting example of convergent evolution. The common design principle likely indicates that localizing flexibly-linked subunit-binding domains to the growing polymer end is sufficient to generate polymerase activity.</p>

<title>Does a similar modular organization in MT and actin polymerases reflect a common biochemical mechanism?</title>
<p>In seeking to define a biochemical mechanism to explain how Stu2/XMAP215-family MT polymerase activity results from the number and tubulin-binding properties of TOG domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), we were intrigued by apparent similarities between Stu2 and the actin polymerase Ena/VASP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), for which a biochemical mechanism has already been defined (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</xref>). Both Stu2 and Ena/VASP are oligomeric polymerases that contain multiple flexibly-linked domains (TOGs for Stu2/XMAP215 and GAB for Ena/VASP) that bind preferentially to unpolymerized tubulin and actin, respectively. We test here whether the model that quantitatively describes how Eva/VASP polymerase activity results from the number and biochemical properties of its actin-binding domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) can also be used to provide a molecular understanding of Stu2 MT polymerase activity.</p>
<p>The biochemical model effectively considers the polymerase as analogous to an enzyme that acts on the polymer end and that uses unpolymerized subunits as its substrate. The biochemical model predicts a Michaelis-Menten-like (hyperbolic) dependence of polymerase-stimulated growth rate on subunit concentration, and it directly relates characteristics of polymerase activity - the apparent maximal stimulation of growth rate (V<sub>max</sub>) and the concentration at which half-maximal stimulation is achieved (K<sub>M</sub>) - to the number of TOG domains (N) and the rate constants for the underlying biochemical reactions: subunits associating/dissociating from a binding domain (k<sub>on</sub>, k<sub>off</sub>, K<sub>D</sub>) or for being transferred from the binding domain to the growing end of the polymer (k<sub>t</sub>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Prior <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements of Stu2/XMAP215-family polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Farmer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Podolski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Roostalu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Thawani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>) have generally varied polymerase concentration at a fixed concentration of tubulin. The model being explored here considers tubulin as the substrate and consequently is most easily tested at a fixed concentration of polymerase using variable tubulin concentration. Thus, we first obtained new measurements to determine whether Stu2-stimulated growth at different tubulin concentrations showed enzyme-like characteristics, as required by the biochemical model.</p>

<p>Stu2 increased microtubule growth rates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,C</xref>), and the Stu2-mediated growth rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) followed Michaelis-Menten-like (hyperbolic) dependence on tubulin concentration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The maximal activity of Stu2(TOG2-TOG2) was comparable to that of Stu2(TOG1-TOG2) (both constructs contain 4 active TOG domains) while the maximal activity of Stu2(TOG1*-TOG2) – a construct that only contains 2 active TOG domains - was roughly half that of the unmutated constructs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>; corresponding V<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> values for the three constructs are summarized in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, box). These results are consistent with prior work on these constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>). That all constructs showed enzyme-like dependence on tubulin concentration means that the data may be amenable to analysis using enzyme-like biochemical model. Hereafter, experiments used Stu2(TOG2-TOG2) and Stu2(TOG1*-TOG2) constructs to avoid having to account for different TOG:tubulin affinities in the model.</p>

<title>The amount of Stu2 on the MT end is independent of MT growth rate</title>
<p>To analyze the Stu2 measurements in the context of the biochemical model requires that the amount of Stu2 on the microtubule end does not vary with tubulin concentration. We therefore quantified the amount of Stu2 on the MT end at low (0.6 µM) and high (1.4 µM) concentrations of αβ-tubulin, using TIRF to visualize GFP-tagged Stu2 on the end of growing, unlabeled MTs. End-resident Stu2 was quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the Stu2-GFP comet (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The measured intensity did not differ detectably between low and high tubulin concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that the amount of Stu2 on the MT end does not depend on the concentration of αβ-tubulin (or, equivalently, on how fast the microtubule is growing).</p>

<p>The measurements reported thus far indicate that Stu2 polymerase activity shows enzyme-like characteristics that make it amenable to analysis using the biochemical model initially developed for Ena/VASP. Specifically, Stu2-stimulated MT growth depends hyperbolically on tubulin concentration (is Michaelis-Menten-like), and the amount of Stu2 on the MT end does not depend on tubulin concentration. In the biochemical model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), the dependence of polymerase activity on tubulin concentration is given by the apparent K<sub>M</sub>, which is defined by K<sub>M</sub> = <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> + <italic>k</italic><sub>t</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>on.</sub> Accordingly, the concentration-dependence of polymerase activity could be dictated by the affinity of TOG:tubulin interactions (“affinity limited”: K<sub>M</sub> ≈ K<sub>D</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>t</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> negligeable), by the rate constants for TOG:tubulin association (k<sub>on</sub>) and for transfer of a TOG-bound tubulin to the polymer end (k<sub>t</sub>) (“kinetically limited”: K<sub>M</sub> ≈ <italic>k</italic><sub>t</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> negligeable), or by a combination of both. To determine which regime is operative requires knowledge about the affinity and kinetics of TOG:tubulin interactions.</p>

<title>Tubulin binds rapidly and tightly to TOG2 (10 nM affinity) under the conditions of the polymerase assay</title>
<p>We previously measured the tubulin-binding affinity of Stu2-TOG1 (70 nM) and Stu2-TOG2 (160 nM) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>), but those equilibrium experiments did not provide information about the rates of TOG:tubulin association and dissociation. Moreover, those earlier measurements may not faithfully reflect the interactions present during the polymerase assay because they were made using different conditions of pH and ionic strength. We used Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI) to determine the affinity and kinetics of TOG2:tubulin interactions under buffer conditions close to those used for measuring polymerase activity (see Methods). Tubulin was site-specifically biotinylated on the C-terminus of β-tubulin using sortase-mediated protein splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Popp et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and then attached to streptavidin-coated chips. BLI measurements using wild-type TOG2 yielded a dose-dependent, saturable binding signal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,C</xref>) and control measurements using TOG2* did not show evidence of binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Fitting the concentration-dependent amplitudes to a one-site binding model yielded an affinity of 8.9 nM for TOG2:tubulin binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Globally fitting single exponential curves to the association and dissociation phases yielded rate constants <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> (3.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) and <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> (3 × 10<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) with good fits (global R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, box).

The ∼10 nM TOG2:tubulin binding affinity is 16-fold stronger than the 160 nM affinity measured previously at higher ionic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>), and negligeable compared to the apparent K<sub>M</sub> for polymerase activity. Thus, the TOG domains are effectively saturated with tubulin in the concentration range we measured, and consequently the polymerase must be kinetically limited by either the rate of TOG:tubulin binding or by the rate of TOG-mediated transfer to tubulin to the microtubule end.</p>

<title>Unifying measurements of polymerase activity and TOG:tubulin interaction kinetics</title>
<p>Are the biochemical measurements of TOG:tubulin interactions consistent with the polymerase measurements? The biochemical model provides a way to address this question because it provides a quantitative link between the enzyme-like characteristics (K<sub>M</sub>, V<sub>max</sub>) of polymerase activity and the tubulin-binding and transfer reactions carried out by the TOG domains. For example, the concentration-dependence of polymerase activity is dictated by the apparent K<sub>M</sub>, which is defined by K<sub>M</sub> = <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> + <italic>k</italic><sub>t</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>); in this expression k<sub>t</sub> is the only unmeasured quantity, so we can solve for its value to obtain <italic>k</italic><sub>t</sub> = 5.04 s<sup>-1</sup>. This transfer rate of ∼5 s<sup>-1</sup> for each TOG domain is close to the ∼10 s<sub><sup>-1</sup></sub> rate at which ‘free’ (not bound to a TOG) tubulins incorporate into growing microtubules in our assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Similarly, the maximal polymerase activity is given by V<sub>max</sub>, which is defined by V<sub>max</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>t</sub>*N; having measured V<sub>max</sub> and derived k<sub>t</sub>, we can calculate the number of TOG domains to obtain N=12 total TOG domains for Stu2(TOG2-TOG2) and N=8 total TOG domains for Stu2(TOG1*-TOG2). Since each Stu2(TOG2-TOG2) dimer contains 4 binding-competent TOGs, N=12 indicates that approximately 3 TOG-TOG2 polymerases reside at the growing microtubule end in our assay. A similar calculation for Stu2(TOG1*-TOG2), which has 2 binding-competent TOGs, yields approximately 4 polymerases at the growing microtubule end. The estimate of 3-4 polymerases on the microtubule end at ∼half-saturating concentrations of Stu2 is consistent with our earlier measurement of ∼6 Stu2(TOG1-TOG2) molecules on the microtubule end under saturating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the measured enzyme-like characteristics of polymerase activity are consistent with and explained by the TOG:tubulin binding kinetics.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The experiments and analyses described here provide a quantitative biochemical mechanism that explains the enzyme-like MT polymerase activity of Stu2 in terms of the number of TOG domains and their rate-constants for binding tubulin. High-affinity (∼10 nM) TOG:tubulin interactions mean that once a TOG:tubulin complex forms, the TOG-bound tubulin will nearly always be delivered to the MT end (the 5 s<sup>-1</sup> rate at which each TOG-bound tubulin is transferred to the MT end is &gt;100-fold faster than the 3 × 10<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> rate at which tubulin dissociates from a TOG). The polymerase therefore operates with very high delivery efficiency. The high affinity of TOG:tubulin interactions, in particular that K<sub>D</sub> &lt;&lt; K<sub>M</sub>, also means that Stu2 is kinetically limited.</p>
<p>Our measurements indicate that the rate of tubulin binding to TOG is most limiting for polymerase activity. Stu2 likely operates under a similar regime in cells, because the concentration of tubulin in yeast has been estimated to be on the order of 0.5 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wethekam and Moore, 2023</xref>), which is comparable to the concentrations used in our in vitro experiments. Thus, Stu2 functions like a tubulin shuttling antenna that enhances capture of unpolymerized tubulin and accelerates its incorporation into the microtubule end.</p>
<p>Nothing in the biochemical model specifies how the tubulin-binding TOG domains need to be linked beyond that they be linked flexibly. Thus, the model should not be limited to homodimeric polymerases such as Stu2: it should apply equally well to monomeric polymerases that contain different numbers of TOG domains such as Zyg9 (3 TOGs) or XMAP215 and chTOG (5 TOGs). For any given polymerase, the overall activity will in general be determined by several factors. The number of tubulin-binding TOG domains and how many polymerases accumulate on the microtubule end together dictate the total number of TOG domains available to shuttle/deliver tubulin. The affinity and kinetics of TOG:tubulin interactions will determine the proportional contributions to polymerase activity from different TOGs, with lower affinity or slower binding TOGs contributing proportionally less than higher affinity, faster binding TOGs (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>)). In addition to the polymerase-intrinsic factors above, whether a given polymerase is affinity or kinetically limited will also depend on the concentration of tubulin, which influences the rates of tubulin:TOG and tubulin:microtubule binding.</p>
<p>In summary, we showed that the same enzyme-like biochemical model can explain the activity of otherwise unrelated microtubule and actin polymerases: each polymerase resides at the polymer end and functions like a shuttling antenna, using multiple flexibly-linked actin or tubulin binding domains to capture and accelerate delivery of unpolymerized subunits to the polymer end. For the Stu2/XMAP215 microtubule polymerases, this is to our knowledge the first time that the polymerase activity has been quantitatively explained in terms of the number of TOG domains and their tubulin-binding rate constants. That two otherwise unrelated cytoskeletal polymerases share the same mechanism provides an interesting example of convergent evolution.</p>

<title>Bio-layer interferometry</title>
<p>We used sortase-mediated protein splicing to selectively label polymerization-blocked tubulin at the C-terminus of β-tubulin. GGGC peptide (Genscript) was incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of EZ-Link™ Maleimide-PEG2-Biotin (MPB) at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 100 mM DTT after 2 hours. This biotinylated peptide provides the substrate for sortase-mediated labeling of tubulin. Labeling of polymerase-blocked tubulin was carried at room temperature for 30 minutes, with 50-fold molar excess of GGGC-MPB and 1.6-fold molar excess of sortase to polymerization-blocked tubulin, in sortase buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 125 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 0.01 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 50 nM GTP). The reaction product was purified again using ion exchange chromatography to get rid of free peptides. The labeled blocked tubulin was confirmed using mass spectrophotometry.</p>
<p>BLI binding measurements were performed using Streptavidin (SA) biosensors on an OctetR8 instrument (Sartorius, Germany). The assay buffer consisted of 90 mM PIPES, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM GTP, 0.1% BSA and 0.005% triton X-100. (BSA and triton X-100 were added to reduce non-specific binding to the biosensors). Biotinylated polymerization-blocked tubulin was immobilized on SA biosensors, which were then washed and dipped into wells containing TOG2 at concentrations ranging from 2.3 to 200 nM. The response level during immobilization was kept below 1 nm to minimize avidity-like artifacts. The association step lasted 300 seconds and was followed by a dissociation step, where the biosensor was moved into a well containing assay buffer, lasting 300 seconds. Data were double reference-subtracted using the signal from an unloaded pin dipped into TOG2 and a pin loading with LR1-457 dipped into assay buffer without TOG2. Association and dissociation rates were determining using a 1:1 binding mode analysis with the Octet BLI Discovery 13.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Orthwein et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Mathematical model for Stu2 mediated microtubule elongation</title>
<p>In this study, we adapted the Ena/VASP model for Stu2, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, the saturation dependence curve for tubulin shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> is reminiscent of the Michaelis-Menten model (V=V<sub>max</sub>[S]/K<sub>M</sub>+[S]) for enzyme kinetics with an assumption that each growing MT tip is associated with a few TOG domains, N. These domains are responsible for capturing tubulin with a rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> and transferring it onto the MT growing end with rate <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>.

<p>In their <bold>important</bold> manuscript, Gangadharan, Kober and Rice focus on how Stu2/XMAP215-family microtubule polymerases use their TOG domains to catalytically promote microtubule growth, testing whether their mechanism follows an enzyme-like kinetic model similar to that of actin polymerases. The authors integrate measurements including microtubule polymerization rates and TOG-tubulin binding kinetics to <bold>convincingly</bold> show that Stu2 follows an enzyme-like model where tight tubulin binding enables efficient polymerization, revealing a shared mechanism with actin polymerases despite their evolutionary divergence. This work will be of general interest to the cell biology and biophysics communities.</p>

<p>This study by Gangadharan and colleagues provides significant progress towards a quantitative biochemical mechanism for Stu2 polymerase activity. A key conceptual advance is the novel application of an enzyme-like model, initially developed for the actin polymerase Ena/VASP, to Stu2.</p>
<p>New refined affinity measurements for a Stu2 TOG domain using Bio-layer interferometry show more than an order of magnitude higher affinity of TOG domains to tubulin compared to previously published reports.</p>
<p>The findings reinforce the &quot;concentrating reactants&quot; or, more specifically, for TOG-domain proteins, the &quot;tubulin-shuttling antenna&quot; model, compared to the &quot;polarized unfurling&quot; model, a more speculative structural hypothesis.</p>
<p>The manuscript builds upon a series of previous manuscripts that showcase the profound intellectual engagement with microtubule polymerization mechanisms by TOG-domain proteins from the Rice lab, a thought leader in microtubule polymerization for over a decade.</p>
<p>Minor remarks:</p>
<p>(1) A major new experimental finding of this paper is the affinity of TOG domains, which is more than an order of magnitude lower (10 nM) than previous measurements from the same lab (~200 nM). The authors attribute this change to ionic strength differences between buffer conditions, citing the lab's previous work (Ayaz et al., 2014). This argument left me contemplating what the buffer conditions are in both experiments, and I wonder if other readers would feel the same. After going down the rabbit hole, I believe the difference in ionic strength is ~2.3 fold, and at least on the back of my envelope, this works out beautifully with the measured differences in affinities. A short version of this argument may strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) I am wondering if there may be an alternative explanation to tubulin binding by TOG being the kinetically rate-limiting step for polymerase function:</p>
<p>TOG + Tubulin ⇌ TOG:Tubulin (fast binding rate, high-affinity binding)</p>
<p>
TOG:Tubulin + MT_end → TOG:MT (tubulin is incorporated into MT, fast transfer rate)</p>
<p>
The binding rate is 3/s, and the transfer rate is 5/s.</p>
<p>I was wondering if the following step should be considered, which involves a conformational change of tubulin (e.g., straightening) TOG:MT → TOG + MT (rate-limiting straightening and unbinding of TOG from the lattice).</p>
<p>Presumably, the affinity of TOGs for straight tubulin is practically zero for the purpose of this discussion, as there is no lattice binding, which means unbinding is likely very rapid; however, straightening may be the rate-limiting factor here.</p>
<p>In theory, straightening should also be rapid; however, we lack measurements of how fast or slow this step occurs within the context of a TOG domain, which presumably skews the process towards curved tubulin.</p>
<p>A hypothetical Stu2, when bound to the microtubule end and with the TOG domain not disengaged from tubulin, would not permit the processivity of that molecule or the binding of a new molecule.</p>
<p>
To emphasize the importance of unbinding, when it is not efficient, as reported for the T238 mutant that results in Stu2 lattice binding (Geyer et al., 2018), the polymerase becomes inefficient.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript from the Rice lab by Gangadharan et al. investigates the polymerization mechanism of the yeast microtubule polymerase Stu2. The lab has published a number of articles demonstrating the structural basis by which the two TOG domains of Stu2 each bind free tubulin heterodimers, and has developed a tethered polymerization model by which the TOG domains drive polymerization by shuttling those tubulin subunits onto the microtubule plus end. A second model was proposed by Nithianantham et al. (eLife, 2018) based on a closed-to-open transitional state in which Stu2 unfurls and loads two longitudinally associated tubulin heterodimers onto the microtubule plus end. While the second model is not directly tested, the current work aims to further characterize/model the tethered polymerization model using a kinetic framework developed by Breitsprecher et al. for Ena/VASP actin polymerization activity, using a model that is enzymatic (EMBO J., 2011). The general architecture and function of Ena/VASP on actin polymerization versus Stu2 on microtubule polymerization is a reasonable relation and hits upon, as the authors note, potential convergent mechanistic evolution across distinct cytoskeletal networks. The model effectively treats tubulin as the substrate, and the polymerized microtubule plus end as the product. If Stu2 is &quot;enzymatic&quot; in this framework, the model predicts it would behave with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, that there would a Vmax, and polymerase activity would either be &quot;affinity limited&quot; by TOG:tubulin affinity (KD) and/or &quot;kinetically limited&quot; by TOG:tubulin association (Kon) and transfer of tubulin to the microtubule plus end (Kt). The authors find that the Brietsprecher model works well for Stu2 activity, and that Stu2 best aligns with a &quot;kinetically limited&quot; model. The work is interesting and adds to the growing elucidation of the Stu2 microtubule polymerase model. While yeast microtubule polymerases are somewhat distinct in their architecture, there is significant overlap that findings from the manuscript can be utilized to inform the mechanisms of larger, more complex microtubule polymerases such as human ch-TOG.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript invokes the enzymatic model of Breitsprecher et al. used for Ena/VASP and conducts an elegant series of (mostly established) experiments to determine whether Stu2 microtubule polymerase activity aligns with the model, which they conclude does align, supported by the data/results obtained.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors used biolayer interferometry to measure TOG:tubulin affinity. The affinities obtained were significantly higher than the lab obtained in an earlier publication using analytical ultracentrifugation. While differences in buffer and salt conditions may underlie these differences, additional runs using comparable buffer systems, or the use of a third independent assay to measure affinities, would have added rigor.</p>
<p>The discussion could be expanded to better compare and contrast the results with both existing polymerase models introduced in the introduction, as well as expanded to look at reversible enzymatic activity (microtubule depolymerization at low to zero tubulin concentrations) and microtubule plus versus minus end activity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Gangadharan and colleagues seeks to establish a quantitative biochemical model for the microtubule polymerase activity of Stu2. Stu2 is the budding yeast member of the XMAP215 protein family, which is broadly conserved across eukaryotes. XMAP215 proteins play a wide variety of important roles in cells, and these are attributed to effects on microtubule dynamics. Many studies over the last ~20 years have shown that XMA215 proteins selectively associate with microtubule ends, where they increase rates of microtubule assembly and disassembly. More recently, structural biology and biochemical studies by the authors and other groups have shown that the multiple TOG domains on XMAP215 proteins are tubulin-binding domains that selectively bind to curved tubulin, which is present in solution and at microtubule ends, but not to straight tubulin which is present in the walls of the microtubule lattice. This has led to the general model that XMAP215 proteins promote polymerization by delivering soluble tubulin to the growing plus end, and two distinct models have been proposed to explain the mechanism. The 'concentrating reactants' model proposed previously by the authors suggests that TOG domains grab hold of tubulin in solution and concentrate at the microtubule end. The 'polarized unfurling' model proposed by the Al Bassam lab suggests that XMAP215 delivers multiple tubulins to the end, using a step-wise mechanism involving different roles for each TOG domain. The current study seeks to improve our understanding of the mechanism by developing a quantitative model to explain the binding and release of tubulins, the number of Stu2 molecules at the end, and the overall rate of tubulin addition. The authors accomplish this goal using new experimental data. The final model fills in new details of the mechanism. The authors draw a comparison between Stu2 and the actin polymerase, which bears similarity to Ena/VASP, and suggest a convergent strategy for cytoskeletal polymerases.</p>

<p>This is a focused and clearly written study that incorporates prior knowledge of XMAP215 and draws inspiration from the actin field. The data are clear and convincing, and the study accomplishes its goal of generating a new, quantitative model for Stu2. The model will be important for microtubule researchers to predict and test key points for altering XMAP215 activity across different organisms and potentially for different tubulin substrates. The comparison to Ena/VASP may also inspire similar comparisons across other microtubule and actin regulators, which could lead to new insights across the cytoskeletal fields.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study is without major weaknesses, but there are several minor weaknesses worth noting. One is that the final model provides new details regarding the Stu2 mechanism, but does not provide a major new advance in our understanding of how the polymerase works. For example, the discussion does not clearly argue for whether the new results and model rule out either of the prior models. This appears consistent with the 'concentrating reactants' model, but does it clearly rule out the 'polarized unfurling' model? A second minor weakness is that the comparison to Ena/VASP is not developed at a deep level based on the final model. I found these ideas exciting and want more critical consideration here, but perhaps it is better suited for a commentary piece to follow.</p>
