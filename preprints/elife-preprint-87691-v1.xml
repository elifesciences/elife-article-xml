<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Brain function originates from hierarchical spatial-temporal neural dynamics distributed across cortical and subcortical networks. However, techniques available to assess large-scale brain network activity with single-neuron resolution in behaving animals remain limited. Here we present Mesotrode that integrates chronic wide-field mesoscale cortical imaging and compact multi-site cortical/subcortical cellular electrophysiology in head-fixed mice that undergo self-initiated running or orofacial movements. Specifically, we harnessed the flexibility of chronic multi-site tetrode recordings to monitor single-neuron activity in multiple subcortical structures while simultaneously imaging the mesoscale activity of the entire dorsal cortex. A mesoscale spike-triggered averaging procedure allowed the identification of cortical activity motifs preferentially associated with single-neuron spiking. Using this approach, we were able to characterize chronic single-neuron-related functional connectivity maps for up to 60 days post-implantation. Neurons recorded from distinct subcortical structures display diverse but segregated cortical maps, suggesting that neurons of different origins participate in distinct cortico-subcortical pathways. We extended the capability of Mesotrode by implanting the micro-electrode at the facial motor nerve and found that facial nerve spiking is functionally associated with the PTA, RSP, and M2 network, and optogenetic inhibition of the PTA area significantly reduced the facial movement of the mice. These findings demonstrate that Mesotrode can be used to sample different combinations of cortico-subcortical networks over prolonged periods, generating multimodal and multi-scale network activity from a single implant, offering new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying specific behaviors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>System-level mechanisms of cognition and action across networks of single neurons in awake, behaving mice remain largely elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Buzsaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aru, Suzuki and Larkum, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Roth and Ding, 2020</xref>). The difficulty comes from recording neural activity over large spatial scales but with single neuron resolution during sensory and motor processes (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Alivisatos <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). In the mammalian brain, large-scale cortical network activity is dynamically sculpted by local or long-range inputs from individual neurons in various cortical or subcortical structures (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Koch <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Decoding the principles of neuronal network activity is essential for understanding brain function (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Oh <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). One important aspect of such understanding is mapping the functional connectivity of single neurons in relation to cortical networks. Emerging studies using <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological and imaging techniques have revealed that activities of single neurons are functionally coupled to those of local microcircuits or the global cortical networks, and such connectivity is dynamically regulated depending on the behavioral state of the animal (Barson <italic>et al</italic>., no date; <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">J. L. Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Clancy, Orsolic and Mrsic-Flogel, 2019</xref>). While most of the current studies only provide a snapshot of the connectivity map of a single neuron, the development of procedures where both single-unit activity and large-scale cortical network dynamics of awake-behaving mice can be chronically recorded is desirable.</p>
<p>Previously, chronic extracellular recordings in rodent brains were achieved most widely using bundled microwires called tetrodes, and more recently extended to the use of high-throughput recording devices such as silicon probes including Neuropixels (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Bragin <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">Vandecasteele <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">Voigts <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Delcasso <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Juavinett, Bekheet and Churchland, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">Steinmetz <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). In the case of conventional chronic tetrode recording setups, a common feature is the inclusion of a microdrive that provides axial control over the positioning of the electrodes which allows the electrode position to be adjusted for better recording qualities throughout the experimental periods. However, this microdrive hinders simultaneous wide-field optical imaging of the cortex, making it difficult to investigate the correlation between subcortical single-unit activation and cortical network activity. On the other hand, chronic silicon probe recordings rely on a skull-mounted probe and a large headstage, also have the same limitation of not allowing for simultaneous wide-field imaging.</p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, we designed the Mesotrode system where we combine <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology via multi-site tetrode implants and mesoscale brain imaging to characterize the functional connectivity of individual cortical or subcortical neurons chronically. We show that these tetrode preparations can obtain high-fidelity, single-unit activity in any cortical or subcortical structure. More importantly, this setup preserves optical access to the entire cranial window of the animal which permits simultaneous functional brain imaging as well as optogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity across the whole dorsal cortex. To obtain high-resolution wide-field imaging of mouse brain activity, we chose to utilize GCaMP6, a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (GECI) widely used to optically record suprathreshold neuronal activation due to its high sensitivity and optimal signal-to-noise ratio (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">T.-W. Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that GECIs can stably report neuronal activity over several months(<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Huber <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Margolis <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">Silasi <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), making them ideal for chronic studies of cortical network dynamics. We found that neurons from various subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, and other midbrain areas, display distinct functional connectivity patterns with the cortex. More importantly, we show that the spike-triggered maps (STMs) of recorded neurons can be stable for up to two months. Moreover, we extended Mesotrode to record facial nerve spiking activity and identified a novel cortical network that is causally involved in controlling facial movement, further highlighting the wide applicability of this technique. These results indicate that our Mesotrode can be widely exploited to investigate multiscale functional connectivity within the central nervous system of mice over an extended timescale.</p>

<title>Chronic single-unit recording with wide-field transcranial imaging window</title>
<p>We developed the Mesotrode implantation procedure with the aim to make them low profile, flexible in location, minimally invasive, and yet stable while maintaining optical access to the entire dorsal cortex such that we can record chronic single neuron activity and mesoscale cortical dynamics simultaneously. Briefly, we fabricated tetrodes from tungsten wires which were then soldered to a miniature connector that was cemented onto the back of the mouse skull during surgery (see Methods). The single tetrode was stiff enough to be straightly inserted into the deep brain areas through a small burr hole (&lt;1mm) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). The body of the tetrode that remained outside of the brain was bent parallel to the skull and the minimal size helped preserve optical transparency during imaging sessions (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). As the miniature connectors are low-profile, mice were group-housed after the surgery (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>), and we did not observe significant damage to the window or the connectors after long-term monitoring. The tetrodes can be flexibly implanted in almost any brain structure of interest, either cortical or subcortical. We have successfully obtained high-quality recordings in the mouse cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, and midbrain. The recording site of each tetrode is confirmed using <italic>post-hoc</italic> histological analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). We found that the single unit activity was relatively stable during one week, two weeks, and two months of recordings after implantation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, G</xref></bold>), which is consistent with previously reported chronic tetrode recordings in mice (<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">Tolias <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hong and Lieber, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim, Brünner and Carlén, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">Voigts <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p>

<p>We implanted a total of 29 tetrodes in the midbrain, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, and cortex of 14 mice, and recorded the activity of 110 neurons with simultaneous mesoscale cortical imaging for up to 2 months after implantation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). We registered all the putative positions of the recorded neurons as well as the tetrode tracks to a 3D mouse brain model, which was reconstructed from an MRI scan (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Egan <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref></bold>). First, we compared the firing profiles of the neurons from different brain regions. On average, we obtained 3-5 neurons per tetrode implanted, and this yield was consistent across regions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). The inter-spike interval (ISI) of neurons recorded from most brain regions ranged between 0.2-0.7s, except for neurons of the striatum, which fires significantly less compared to neurons in other brain regions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>, p &lt; 0.05). The coefficient of variation (CV) of ISI, a metric that indicates the consistency of the firing rate, was similar across brain regions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Spike-triggered average mapping of the thalamus, striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain neuron-defined mesoscale cortical networks</title>
<p>Spike-triggered average mapping (STM) has been previously used to investigate functional connectivity between single spiking neurons and cortical networks (Barson <italic>et al</italic>., no date; <xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Clancy, Orsolic and Mrsic-Flogel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). However, this has only been achieved using acute preparation. To assess the functional connectivity of the chronically recorded neurons, we combined electrophysiological recordings with simultaneous mesoscale cortical imaging through a bilateral window that encompassed the entire dorsal cortex in head-fixed, awake mice (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>, Video 1, 2</bold>). To obtain STMs of the recorded neuron, we calculated the peak response of normalized Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (ΔF/F) of each pixel averaged between 3s before and after (±3s) the onset of each spike, which gave us a wide-field mapping of the cortical areas that were associated with spiking activity of the recorded neuron (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Green reflectance signals, which were recorded with the same frequency as the GCaMP6 signal, were used to correct hemodynamic artifacts (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We found that single neuron defined functional maps were stable across recording sessions and days. For example, the STM of a hippocampus neuron was associated with the RSP, BCS, and M2 region for 10 recording sessions on different days (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref></bold>). To better visualize the stability of STMs across recording, we used Mesonet, a machine-learning based toolbox for parcellating brain regions, to accurately align our mesoscale images to a common brain atlas(<xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). We show that the STMs of a midbrain neuron were relatively stable over 2 months (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref></bold>). The spiking activity of the neuron on different days was highly correlated with the lower limb, upper limb, and trunk sensorimotor areas on both hemispheres of the cortex. To examine the neural correlates of different behaviors, we also incorporated a Raspberry pi camera to monitor the spontaneous behavior of the mice during brain activity recordings (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, E</xref></bold>). In this example, we show that the instantaneous firing rate and patterns of this midbrain neuron were highly correlated with the paw movement of the mouse, consistent with our finding that this neuron is functionally associated with the limb sensorimotor areas. These results highlight the power of this multimodal approach, in that it can link high-resolution single neuron activity with network dynamics of the entire cortex and concurrent animal behavior, which greatly improves our ability to dissect the functional role of individual neurons of any brain region.</p>

<p>To quantify the distribution of distinctively patterned STMs of neurons across brain regions, we applied a graph-based clustering algorithm, Phenograph, on z-scored STMs (Levine <italic>et al</italic>., 2015) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>). In total, we included 1146 STMs of 110 neurons recorded during multiple sessions. This resulted in 10 clusters with each cluster representing a distinct STM pattern evidenced by their within-cluster averaged map (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). Un-matched STMs that were below the similarity threshold (Pearson’s correlation &lt; 0.3) compared to any of the 10 cluster average maps were excluded (94 out of 1146 STMs). For all clusters, individual STMs within the clusters showed high similarity to the cluster average maps (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). In order to validate the optimal number of clusters for partitioning our dataset, we evaluated the clustering effectiveness of a varied number of clusters when applying K-means clustering algorithm using Silhouette score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rousseeuw, 1987</xref>) and confirmed that 10 clusters are most appropriate (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Degrees of separation between clusters were visually inspected by projecting dimensionally reduced STMs onto 3D space using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), a commonly used statistical method for plotting high-dimensional data points onto 3D space (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p><bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold> shows the proportions of STMs of neurons in different brain regions that were assigned to each cluster. We found that STMs in each region exhibited a stereotypical distribution pattern. For example, STMs of cortical neurons were primarily assigned to clusters #1-3 and #5-7, corresponding to motor, barrel, and primary somatosensory cortex activation patterns. These activation areas also matched the locations of the recorded cortical neurons (e.g. motor cortical neurons showed motor area activated STMs), suggesting that the functional connectivity patterns of cortical neurons were localized to cortical areas surrounding the recorded neuron, which is consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Clancy, Orsolic and Mrsic-Flogel, 2019</xref>). Hippocampal neurons primarily displayed STMs with retrosplenial cortex activation (cluster#10, 59.6% of all hippocampal neuron STMs), reaffirming the dense functional connectivity between these two regions (Karimi Abadchi <italic>et al</italic>., 2020). STMs of striatal neurons were dominated by two opposing patterns, where 47.7% of them showed a global activation except for the body (limb and trunk) somatosensory regions (cluster#4) and 28.8% of them showed only activation in the body sensory regions (cluster#9). Thalamic neurons exhibited diverse STM patterns with the primary activated regions in lateral anterior cortical regions (cluster#5, 5.6%, cluster#6, 23.3%, cluster#7 26.3% of all thalamic STMs) and medial cortical regions (cluster#8, 6.5%, cluster#9, 11.6%, cluster#10, 9.9% of all thalamic STMs). This suggested that thalamic neurons had diverse functional connectivity patterns in relation to the dorsal cortex, consistent with previous studies (Xiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2017). STMs of midbrain neurons were most assigned to cluster#8 with medial frontal and somatosensory cortex activation (cluster#8, 44.6% of all midbrain STMs), but also included functional connectivity patterns with various other cortical regions (cluster#6, 10.5%, cluster#9, 12.6%, cluster#10, 11.2% of all midbrain STMs). Interestingly, we found that neurons of different subcortical origins sometimes have overlapping STMs (e.g. cluster#9, and #10 exhibited by neurons from all subcortical regions), which suggests that they may be involved in the same subcortico-cortical functional pathway (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). Taken together, these findings highlighted the capability of Mesotrode to capture the diverse cortical functional connectivity patterns of neurons across brain regions using chronic electrodes.</p>

<title>Linkage of spiking peripheral nerve to specific mesoscopic cortical maps</title>
<p>One key advantage of using our minimally invasive micro-electrode setup is the flexibility of the location where they can be implanted and the relatively small footprint at the insertion site. This allows us to explore the functional connectivity of neurons that are otherwise difficult to study. For example, it’s difficult to simultaneously record the neural activity of the facial motor nucleus and cortex in order to investigate the cortico-brainstem motor pathways that directly innervate facial muscles that control whisker movement and facial expressions in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Petersen, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">Sreenivasan <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Mercer Lindsay <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Here, we implanted micro-wires on the facial motor nerve to record the spiking activity of the axonal projections from the facial motor neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>)</bold>. We obtained the STMs of facial motor nerves by simultaneous wide-field imaging of GCaMP6 mice (n = 5 mice). Surprisingly, we found a distinct cortical pattern, activation in RSP, M2, and PTA areas (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)</bold>, associated with facial motor nerve spiking activity (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, D</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, <xref rid="fig6_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, Video 3</bold>) in awake mice showing spontaneous movements. Using automated light-based mapping technology (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Ayling <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), we found a broad area of the dorsal cortex, including the PTA region could evoke facial motor nerve spiking activity when optogenetically stimulated (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F, G</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">H</xref>, <xref rid="fig6_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2-7</xref>, Video 4</bold>) within Thy1-ChR2 mice (n = 6 mice). To further investigate causal relationships, we directly inhibited the PTA by optogenetically stimulating inhibitory neurons of the PTA region of VGAT-ChR2 mice (n = 3 mice). Echoing our previous finding, inhibiting the PTA not only stopped the PTA neurons from firing but also prevented the facial movements of these mice when the blue light stimulation was on (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, Video 5</bold>). To eliminate the possibility that this observation is due to indirect inhibition of other brain areas, we simultaneously recorded neuronal activities in M1 and the barrel cortex (BCS). We confirmed that the neuron firing in these brain areas was not decreased by PTA inhibition (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, B</xref></bold>). More interestingly, we saw a “rebound effect”, a sudden increase in PTA neuron firing and facial movement, right after the stimulation is turned off (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C, D</xref></bold>). This “off response” supports the causal relationships between PTA and facial movement. These findings are consistent with the previous report that the PTA is involved in controlling active movements (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Chapman <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Cohen and Andersen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rathelot, Dum and Strick, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Auffret <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lyamzin and Benucci, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). It also underscores that our chronic tetrode implants in combination with optogenetics and optical imaging can be a powerful tool in mapping and identifying novel functional pathways.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>How activities of individual neurons contribute to brain-wide population dynamics remains poorly understood(<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Brecht <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Rancz <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Houweling and Brecht, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Packer <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). It is additionally challenging to study long-range connectivities (e.g. those between subcortical and cortical structures) given the extraordinary complexity of neuronal wiring between brain regions. Non-invasive methods such as fMRI have generated important connectivity models, such as the default mode network (DMN) model, which advanced our understanding of how distinct brain regions communicate with each other during different behavioral contexts(<xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">White <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez-Barragan <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). However, these methods typically lack the spatial and temporal resolution to understand the connectivity patterns of individual neurons. On the other hand, for more invasive techniques such as viral tracing, although they often provide detailed characterizations of the anatomical patterns between brain areas, the nature of the preparation for these techniques precludes gaining insights into the dynamic nature of the connectivity rules. In this study, we developed the Mesotrode that combined chronic tetrode recording with mesoscale Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to characterize mesoscale connectivity patterns of individual neurons. We showed that the functional connectivity patterns of individual neurons are relatively stable in the same behavioral state, and neurons from different brain regions display distinct distributions of these patterns. We further showcased the utility of our procedure by recording from the facial motor nerve and found a distinct cortical activation associated with facial nerve activity. Additionally, Mesotrode provides a wide-field access window for optogenetic stimulations. We showed a causal link between PTA activity and facial movement in mice. These findings established that our multimodal recordings combining chronic electrophysiology, mesoscale imaging, optogenetics, and behavioral characterization can be widely applied to further our understanding of neuronal connectivity and behaviors.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Compared to other chronic recording setups</title>
<p>Our approach adds to the plethora of techniques previously described to characterize long-range functional connectivity by combining single-neuron activity recording and mesoscale cortical imaging. These techniques typically differ in how and where the individual neurons’ activities are recorded. For instance, Barson et.al used two-photon imaging to record individual cortical neurons’ activities, which allows differentiation of different neuronal types through genetic manipulation (Barson <italic>et al</italic>., no date), but it has lower temporal resolution and is restricted to recording cortical neurons. Xiao et.al, Clancy et.al, Peters et.al, and Liu et.al all used either silicon probes or neuropixel probes to record large populations of cortical or subcortical neurons (Xiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Clancy, Orsolic and Mrsic-Flogel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; Peters <italic>et al</italic>., 2021), but it remains difficult to use these setups to track activities of the same neurons over days. In addition to these approaches, we can use our chronic tetrode implantation to track neuronal activities at multiple brain regions over long periods of time to better describe the dynamic nature of global neuronal affiliations; however, the number of neurons that can be recorded per tetrode is limited which does reduce our data acquisition throughput.</p>
<p>Compared to most of the previously reported chronic tetrodes setups with the inclusion of a microdrive, our approach has the unique advantages that setting up the apparatus and implanting the tetrodes is a lot more straightforward, mini-connector enables group housing and it is compatible with overhead cameras which permits simultaneous optical interrogation of neuronal circuits (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Battaglia <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">Voigts <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Billard <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Delcasso <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Voigts and Harnett, 2020</xref>). However, it does come with the price that the tetrode cannot be moved after it is implanted, which means that the implant would fail if the health of the neuron deteriorates too much over time. Albeit, since our goal is to record the activity of the same neurons, we deemed it a worthy tradeoff for our purpose.</p>

<title>Variability of spike-triggered average maps in different brain regions</title>
<p>Activities of cortical pyramidal neurons are known to be coupled to local network activity; as such, STMs of these neurons often display activity motifs localized to the cortical regions they reside, indicating that their functional connections are mostly involved in local networks (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Clancy, Orsolic and Mrsic-Flogel, 2019</xref>). On the other hand, subcortical neurons (i.e. thalamic neurons) can display more diverse and distal connectivity patterns with cortical networks that are less confined by their locations (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Here, we extended these characterizations to more subcortical regions (i.e. striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain), and found that these neurons, similar to thalamic neurons, generate functionally diverse STMs. This can be attributed to the diverse cell types within these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Phillips and Irvine, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Cembrowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, by classifying these STMs, we found that the connectivity patterns of neurons in different subcortical structures are varied. For instance, STMs of midbrain neurons can be primarily categorized into 4 classes, with each class having distinct activity motifs, which is in contrast to the striatum neurons, the STMs of which are grouped into only two main classes. More interestingly, STMs of different subcortical regions display low levels of overlap, suggesting that neurons of different subcortical origins form their own distinct connectivity pattern to the cortex.</p>

<title>The spike-triggered average map associated with specific brain function</title>
<p>The single neuron defined functional maps (STMs) can reveal functional cortical architecture related to the activity of individual cortical and subcortical-cortical neurons (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). The distinct STM patterns indicate that single neuron embedded large-scale subcortico-cortical networks may be associated with specific brain functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pessoa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu, Leopold and Yang, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Amunts <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). To explore this possibility, for the first time, we simultaneously record the output spiking activity of the facial motor nucleus and wide-field calcium dynamics of the cortex, which enable us to investigate the cortico-brainstem motor pathways that directly control facial movements in mice. Interestingly, we found that facial nerve spike-triggered average map functionally associated with active facial movements, and the causal relationship can be tested by optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of the PTA area. Previous studies using anterograde virus tracing have revealed that the motor cortex sends few direct projections to the facial nucleus while the most prominent projections from the motor, somatosensory, and association cortex are polysynaptic, presumably through nuclei in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Grinevich, Brecht and Osten, 2005</xref>; Matyas <italic>et al</italic>., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rathelot, Dum and Strick, 2017</xref>). Studies in humans and monkeys have identified parietal-eye-field and reach-specific areas that involve voluntary control of eye or hand movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lynch, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andersen, 1989</xref>; Sakata <italic>et al</italic>., 1997; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Chapman <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Konen and Kastner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Archambault, Caminiti and Battaglia-Mayer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pouget, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rathelot, Dum and Strick, 2017</xref>).

<p>Animal protocols (A13-0336 and A14-0266) were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee and conformed to the Canadian Council on Animal Care and Use guidelines and animals were housed in a vivarium on a 12 h daylight cycle (7 AM lights on). Most experiments were performed toward the end of the mouse light cycle. Transgenic GCaMP6s mice (males, 2–4 months of age, weighing 20–30g; n=19) were produced by crossing Emx1-cre (B6.129S2-<italic>Emx1</italic><sup><italic>tm1(cre)Krj</italic></sup>/J, Jax #005628), CaMK2-tTA (B6.Cg-Tg(Camk2a-tTA)1Mmay/DboJ, Jax #007004) and TITL-GCaMP6s (Ai94;B6.<italic>Cg-Igs7</italic><sup><italic>tm94</italic>.<italic>1(tetO-GCaMP6s)Hze</italic></sup>/J, Jax #024104) strain. The presence of GCaMP expression was determined by genotyping each animal before each surgical procedure with PCR amplification. These crossings are expected to produce a stable expression of the calcium indicator (T.-W.

<title>Tetrode fabrication</title>
<p>Polyimide insulated, tungsten wire (40 cm long, diameter 25 μm, Stablohm 650, California Fine Wire, USA) was folded into four wires and clamped together with the modified alligator clip. The loop of wires was hung over the horizontal bar. The alligator clip was placed into the motorized stage. Eighty clockwise twists were applied and followed by forty counter clock-wise twists to the wire bundle over the course of approximately three minutes. After tetrode twisting was completed, the wires were fused together by heating from three different angles with a heat gun (420°C or 790°F), using medium-low flow. For each angle, begin 1-2 cm below where the wire bundle splits, the heat gun was held 2 cm away from the wire and moved periodically over the length of the wire for about 5 s. The tetrode was removed from the twisting apparatus by gently lifting the alligator clip to relieve tension on the tetrode, and cutting the tetrode near the alligator clip. At the other end, the loop was cut off such that there were four non-bonded strands of wire of equal length. The tetrode was then soldered to a miniature connector using a fine-tip soldering iron (Thermaltronics M8MF375 Micro Fine 0.25 mm).</p>

<title>Surgical procedures</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance in air). The eyes were covered with eye lubricant (Lacrilube; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.well.ca">www.well.ca</ext-link>) and body temperature was maintained at 37 °C with a heating pad with feedback regulation. Mice were then placed in a stereotaxic frame and received an injection of Lidocaine (0.1ml, 0.2%) under the scalp. Mice also received a 0.5 ml subcutaneous injection of a saline solution containing buprenorphine (2 mg/ml), atropine (3μg/ml), and glucose (20 mM). Respiration rate and response to toe pinch were checked every 10-15 min to maintain the surgical anesthetic plane. A skin flap extending over both hemispheres approximately 8 mm in diameter (3 mm anterior to bregma to the posterior end of the skull and down lateral to eye level) was cut and removed. Fascia or connective tissue is lightly scraped away from the skull and small (&lt; 1 mm diameter) holes are drilled through the skull, using a high-speed dental drill with a sterile bit, over the cortex. Tetrode was directed toward the center of the hole and placed in the target using a motorized micromanipulator (MP-225, Sutter Instrument Company). Miniature connectors (2 x 2 x 2 mm) are cemented to the skull (with dental adhesive) around the imaging window (the total weight is &lt; 1 gm). Ground and reference electrodes are fixed into place on the surface of the posterior skull.</p>
<p>After tetrode implantation, the chronic transcranial window was implanted as previously described (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">Silasi <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Briefly, the skin between the ears and the eyes was properly cleaned with Betadine dissolved in water and ethanol. The skin covering the occipital, parietal and frontal bones was cut away. The fascia and any connective tissue on the skull surface were gently wiped off. C&amp;B-Metabond transparent dental cement (Parkell, Edgewood NY, USA; Product: C&amp;B Metabond) was prepared in a ceramic bowl and used to glue a head-fixing titanium bar to the cerebellar plate or a 4/40 stainless steel setscrew slightly angled posteriorly (∼120∼ relative to skull). With the bar or the setscrew in place, a thick layer of dental adhesive was applied to the skull. A coverglass (Marien-feld, Lauda-Konigshofen, Germany; Cat n: 0111520) previously cut to the size of the final cranial window (∼8 mm diameter), was placed on top of the dental cement before it solidified, preventing the formation of bubbles. The cement remains transparent after it solidifies and the surface vasculature should be readily seen through the final result.</p>

<title>Wide-field calcium imaging</title>
<p>All mice were habituated for 1 week prior to data collection. Awake mice were head-fixed and placed on a wheel in a dark imaging chamber for data collection. A behavioral camera (Raspberry Pi camera) and an infrared light were placed inside the imaging chamber to monitor active behaviors, such as running or whisking. A Pantera 1M60 CCD camera (Dalsa) was equipped with two front-to-front lenses (50 mm, f ¼ 1.4:35 mm, f ¼ 2; Nikon Nikkor) and a bandpass emission filter (525/36 nm, Chroma). The 12-bit images were captured at a frame rate of 120 Hz (exposure time of 7 ms) with 8 × 8 on-chip spatial binning using EPIX XCAP v3.8 imaging software. The cortex was sequentially illuminated with alternating blue and green LEDs (Thorlabs). Blue light (473 nm) with a bandpass filter (467 to 499 nm) was used to excite calcium indicators and green light (525 nm) with a bandpass filter (525/50 nm) was used to observe changes in cerebral blood volume. The blue and green LEDs were sequentially activated and synchronized to the start of each frame’s exposure period with transistor-transistor logic such that each frame collected only fluorescence or reflectance signals at 60 Hz each. This LED strobe frequency of 60 Hz exceeded the critical flicker fusion frequency for mice, which marks the highest temporal frequency that an observer can resolve flicker before it becomes indistinguishable from constant light and was likely imperceptible to the mice. Reflectance signals were subtracted from fluorescence signals to mitigate the contribution of hemodynamics to fluorescence signals.</p>

<title>Optogenetic stimulation protocols</title>
<p>Inhibitory neurons in the cortex were optogenetically manipulated separately in VGAT-ChR2 mice. A 473nm laser (Crystal Laser BCL-473-050, Reno, NV, USA) was connected to a fiber optic patch cable (0.22 NA, 200 μm gauge; Thorlabs FG200UCC, USA). During the experiment, 1 mW (measured from the end of the cable) of optical stimulation was delivered for an overall time of 10 s. For automated Thy1-ChR2-based facial motor mapping, we chose a relatively collimated 473 nm laser targeted through a simple microscope. The laser was moved in random order to each of the predefined stimulation locations (8x8 grid) and delivered a flash of laser light (10 ms, 2.0 mW) to each point while collecting facial motor nerve response.</p>

<title>Spike-triggered average maps (STM) Clustering</title>
<p>We employed an unsupervised clustering algorithm, PhenoGraph (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Levine <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), to categorize STMs. The graph was built in 2 steps: 1) it finds k nearest neighbors for N input vectors (4096 dimensions for 64x64 STMs) using Euclidean distance, resulting in N sets of k nearest neighbors, 2) a weighted graph is built where the edge weight between pairs of nodes depends on the number of neighbors they share. We then perform Louvain community detection (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Blondel <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) on this graph to partition the graph that maximizes modularity. This algorithm only requires one input parameter which is k, the number of nearest neighbors to be found for each input vector, and the resulting number of clusters (10) is relatively insensitive to the k chosen over the range of typically chosen values. We also performed k-means clustering using the same input and compared clustering effectiveness using the Silhouette score and found that 10 clusters were optimal. We then performed a cluster identity refinement step, where an individual STM whose similarity (Pearson correlation value) with the cluster average STM of the assigned cluster was lower than 0.3 was manually reassigned if its similarity with group average STMs of any other clusters was higher than 0.3; otherwise, that STM was excluded. A total of 94 out of 1146 STMs (8.2%) were excluded.</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>At the end of each experiment, animals were killed with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (24 mg). Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by chilled 4% PFA in PBS. Coronal or sagittal brain sections (50 μm thickness) were cut on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S). Images of brain tissues with counter-stained DAPI were acquired using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM510) to reveal the electrode track and help identify the approximate cortical/subcortical location of recorded cells.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, Version 9. Statistical tests and results are reported in the figure legends. More than two groups were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test comparing experimental flies to each control. All graphs represent mean ± SEM. Sample sizes are listed in the figure legends. No explicit power analyses were used to determine sample sizes prior to experimentation. Minimum sample sizes were decided prior to experimentation based on previous experience or pilot experiments revealing how many samples are typically sufficient to detect reasonable effect sizes.</p>

<p>The paper by Dongsheng Xiao, Yuhao Yan and Timothy H Murphy presents a timely approach to record neuronal activity at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Such approaches are at the forefront of system neuroscience and a few examples include, among others, fMRI alongside electrophysiology (Logothetis et al, 2021. Nature) or widefield calcium imaging (Lake et al, 2020. Nat Meth) , or functional ultrasound imaging and multi unit recording (Claron et al, 2023 Cell Reports), The method presented here combines &quot;low resolution&quot; (i.e. cortical regions) widefield calcium imaging across most of the dorsal portions of the murine cortex combined with electrical recording of single neurons in specific cortical and subcortical locations (as a matter of fact, this later components can be used everywhere in the murine brain).</p>
<p>The method presented here is straightforward to implement and very well documented. Examples of novel insights that this approach can generate are well presented and demonstrate the strength of the presented approach, some aspects of the analysis require clarification.</p>
<p>For example, the author reveal Spike-Triggered average cortical activation Maps (STMs) linked to the activity of single neurons (Figs 4 and 5) This allows to directly asses the functional connectivity between cortical and sub-cortical areas. It nevertheless unclear what is the stability of the established relationships. The nature of the &quot;recordings&quot; in Fig 4. is unclear. It looks like these are imaging sessions on the same day, the length of these recordings as well as the interval between them is not stated. It will be fundamental to build a metric to compare STMs variability across sessions/recordings/days; a root-mean-square from an average map across all recordings could provide a starting point.</p>
<p>Also with respect to the STMs analysis, the data-driven choice of 10 clusters might need a bit more explorations. While the silhouette clustering accuracy peaks at 10 (Fig 5A), this metrics comes without a confidence intervals making it difficult to know if a difference of less than 10% (i.e. 11 or 13 clusters) should be deemed different. Maybe a bootstrapping approach could be used here to build such confidence intervals. Another approach to reach the number of cluster to use could be based on &quot;consensus&quot; between different partitioning algorithms (e.g. Strehl, A. &amp; Ghosh, J. itions. J. Mach. Learn. Res. 3, 583-617 (2001). A much stronger argument should be provided to use the 0.3 correlation cutoff value which seems to be arbitrarily low. The main point here is that the authors should show that their conclusions hold within a range of parameter values (number of clusters and correlation threshold).</p>

<p>The article presents 'Mesotrode,' a technique that integrates chronic widefield calcium imaging and electrophysiology recordings using tetrodes in head-fixed mice. This approach allows recording the activity of a few single neurons in multiple cortical/subcortical structures, in which the tetrodes are implanted, in combination with widefield imaging of dorsal cortex activity on the mesoscale level, albeit without cellular resolution. The authors claim that Mesotrode can be used to sample different combinations of cortico-subcortical networks over prolonged periods of time, up to 60 days post-implantation. The results demonstrate that the activity of neurons recorded from distinct cortical and subcortical structures are coupled to diverse but segregated cortical functional maps, suggesting that neurons of different origins participate in distinct cortico-subcortical pathways. The study also extends the capability of Mesotrode by conducting electrophysiological recordings from the facial motor nerve. It demonstrates that facial nerve spiking is functionally associated with several cortical areas( PTA, RSP, and M2), and optogenetic inhibition of the PTA area significantly reduced the facial movement of the mice.</p>
<p>Studying the relationship between widefield cortical activity patterns and the activity of individual neurons in cortical and subcortical areas is very important, and Murphy's lab has been a pioneer in the field. However, the choice of low-yield recording methods (tetrode) instead of more high-yield recording techniques, such as silicon probes, makes the approach presented in this study somewhat less appealing. Also, the authors claim that a tetrode-based approach can allow chronic recordings of single neural activity over days - a topic that is very controversial. In terms of results, I was under the impression that most of the conclusions presented in the bulk of the paper ( Figures 1-5) are very similar to what previous work from Murphy's lab and other labs has shown using acute preparation. In this respect, the paper can benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the heterogeneity of single-neuron functional coupling. The last part of the facial nerve recording is interesting (Figure 6), but I think it can be integrated better into the rest of the paper.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The paper by Dongsheng Xiao, Yuhao Yan and Timothy H Murphy presents a timely approach to record neuronal activity at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Such approaches are at the forefront of system neuroscience and a few examples include, among others, fMRI alongside electrophysiology (Logothetis et al, 2021. Nature) or widefield calcium imaging (Lake et al, 2020. Nat Meth) , or functional ultrasound imaging and multi unit recording (Claron et al, 2023 Cell Reports), The method presented here combines &quot;low resolution&quot; (i.e. cortical regions) widefield calcium imaging across most of the dorsal portions of the murine cortex combined with electrical recording of single neurons in specific cortical and subcortical locations (as a matter of fact, this later components can be used everywhere in the murine brain).</p>
<p>The method presented here is straightforward to implement and very well documented. Examples of novel insights that this approach can generate are well presented and demonstrate the strength of the presented approach, some aspects of the analysis require clarification.</p>
<p>For example, the author reveal Spike-Triggered average cortical activation Maps (STMs) linked to the activity of single neurons (Figs 4 and 5) This allows to directly asses the functional connectivity between cortical and sub-cortical areas. It nevertheless unclear what is the stability of the established relationships. The nature of the &quot;recordings&quot; in Fig 4. is unclear. It looks like these are imaging sessions on the same day, the length of these recordings as well as the interval between them is not stated. It will be fundamental to build a metric to compare STMs variability across sessions/recordings/days; a root-mean-square from an average map across all recordings could provide a starting point.</p>

<p>Our goal was to present a well-documented protocol for implanting electrodes (tetrodes and peripheral nerve) that do not impede cortical mesoscale imaging and support chronic investigation of spike trains. We do provide examples of repeated spiking measurements across days from the same electrodes and animals. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic interrupting data collection and other factors, this dataset does not contain a thorough analysis of response longevity using these electrodes, but we do show examples in the figures. In Figure 1F, G, we showed that the single unit activity was relatively stable during one week, two weeks, and two months of recordings after implantation. In Figure 4B we showed spiking activity in the hippocampus was stable across day 8 and day 9. We also showed that the STM of the hippocampus neuron was consistently associated with the RSP, BCS, and M2 region for 10 recording sessions across days. In Figure 4D, We showed that the STMs of a midbrain neuron were relatively stable over 2 months. The spiking activity of the neuron on different days was consistently correlated with the lower limb, upper limb, and trunk sensorimotor areas on both hemispheres of the cortex.</p>

<p>Also with respect to the STMs analysis, the data-driven choice of 10 clusters might need a bit more explorations. While the silhouette clustering accuracy peaks at 10 (Fig 5A), this metrics comes without a confidence intervals making it difficult to know if a difference of less than 10% (i.e. 11 or 13 clusters) should be deemed different. Maybe a bootstrapping approach could be used here to build such confidence intervals. Another approach to reach the number of cluster to use could be based on &quot;consensus&quot; between different partitioning algorithms (e.g. Strehl, A. &amp; Ghosh, J. itions. J. Mach. Learn. Res. 3, 583-617 (2001). A much stronger argument should be provided to use the 0.3 correlation cutoff value which seems to be arbitrarily low. The main point here is that the authors should show that their conclusions hold within a range of parameter values (number of clusters and correlation threshold).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the interesting suggestions regarding cluster numbers.  We agree that the number (10 clusters) could be taken as an arbitrary value. However, we have done previous work examining cortical connectivity maps in Mohajerani et al.  2013 Nature Neurosci. and found that cortical mesoscale activity has a degree of freedom (number of unique elements) in the range of 10-15.   This number is also supported by major structural networks found by the Allen Brain Connectivity Atlas and within functional imaging data.   In other work using unsupervised methods Xiao et al. 2021 Nature Comm a similar number of clusters were identified so these numbers are without some basis.</p>

<p>I enjoyed very much reading the manuscript!</p>
<p>Minor comments (aesthetics and typos)</p>
<p>Please clarify how the hemodynamic correction was performed. The text refers to &quot;substracted&quot;. This usually involves the computation of a general of per-pixel weight. Is this correction constant along the longitudinal imaging session (i.e. over weeks)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The hemodynamic correction was calculated based on the results of each daily session. Typically these corrections have minimal impact on overall values and are not expected to appreciably change over time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 3, authors might reconsider scaling down the size of panel A and enlarging the data presented in D. Also, with respect to panel D, what does the gray band represent, confidence intervals, standard dev? Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The gray bands correspond to the standard deviation of random trigger average traces.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The article presents 'Mesotrode,' a technique that integrates chronic widefield calcium imaging and electrophysiology recordings using tetrodes in head-fixed mice. This approach allows recording the activity of a few single neurons in multiple cortical/subcortical structures, in which the tetrodes are implanted, in combination with widefield imaging of dorsal cortex activity on the mesoscale level, albeit without cellular resolution. The authors claim that Mesotrode can be used to sample different combinations of cortico-subcortical networks over prolonged periods of time, up to 60 days post-implantation. The results demonstrate that the activity of neurons recorded from distinct cortical and subcortical structures are coupled to diverse but segregated cortical functional maps, suggesting that neurons of different origins participate in distinct cortico-subcortical pathways. The study also extends the capability of Mesotrode by conducting electrophysiological recordings from the facial motor nerve. It demonstrates that facial nerve spiking is functionally associated with several cortical areas( PTA, RSP, and M2), and optogenetic inhibition of the PTA area significantly reduced the facial movement of the mice.</p>
<p>Studying the relationship between widefield cortical activity patterns and the activity of individual neurons in cortical and subcortical areas is very important, and Murphy's lab has been a pioneer in the field. However, the choice of low-yield recording methods (tetrode) instead of more high-yield recording techniques, such as silicon probes, makes the approach presented in this study somewhat less appealing. Also, the authors claim that a tetrode-based approach can allow chronic recordings of single neural activity over days - a topic that is very controversial. In terms of results, I was under the impression that most of the conclusions presented in the bulk of the paper ( Figures 1-5) are very similar to what previous work from Murphy's lab and other labs has shown using acute preparation. In this respect, the paper can benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the heterogeneity of single-neuron functional coupling. The last part of the facial nerve recording is interesting (Figure 6), but I think it can be integrated better into the rest of the paper.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>1. The methodology described in the paper is based on chronic tetrode recordings combined with widefield calcium imaging. The authors emphasize the advantages of using tetrodes in that they are 1) easy to implant 2) have a small footprint, and 3) allow to record the same neurons over days.</p>
<p>I agree regarding the first advantage, however, the ability to reliably record the activity of the same neurons over days using electrophysiological recordings is controversial. The authors claim that:</p>
<p>'We found that the single unit activity was relatively stable, during one week, two weeks, and two months of recordings after implantation (Figure 1F, G)',</p>
<p>The only 'proof' the authors show for recording stability are waveforms of one neuron on one channel (out of presumably four channels), which seem to differ in amplitude over days. Two-dimensional plots of the neuron waveform for all channel combinations could be a more convincing way to make this claim. But, as I already mentioned - the ability to record from the same neurons chronically with electrophysiological methods is rather controversial, especially with tetrodes that don't allow for laminar profiling of neuronal response to account for a potential drift over time.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now make it more clear that examples of mesotrode stability are indicated in the figures. Furthermore, we acknowledge caveats that spike sorting experiments required to more conclusively identify single neurons would be improved with larger format silicon probes.  Our work employs compact tetrode electrodes that permit simultaneous resolution of single units and mesoscale GCAMP activity.  It is conceivable that improvements in spike sorting fidelity could be made by switching to more densely spaced silicon probes. While this is an obvious advantage, these probes do not have a compact footprint and would interfere with regional imaging.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors present little analysis justifying the advantage of conducting chronic electrophysiological recordings instead of acute recordings with their data. In fact, throughout the paper, the authors mention that the results were consistent with their previous work with acute recordings. The only longitudinal analysis in this paper is qualitative and suggests that cortical maps were stable over days. I believe this was also shown in the past already. More in depth analysis of across days dynamics or showcase of an experiment centered on across days dynamics will strengthen the appeal of this approach. Generally speaking, there is very little quantitative analysis of longitudinal maps/functional coupling of single neurons over days. The paper will benefit from at least some quantification of this part.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To our knowledge data showing the persistence of spike-associated maps longer than an acute experiment is novel. However, due to a low yield of recorded single neurons, we have not been able to follow these maps over a longer period in a population that would permit group statistics. We suggest that future experiments could be done using silicon probes with larger yields which would help to better align electrophysiological features with mesoscale GCAMP maps.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Recording with tetrodes gives very low yields compared to silicon probe recordings. While silicon probes have a larger footprint and may occlude the widefield imaging on the side of the silicon probe implant, it is unclear why not to use denser electrode arrays on one side of the brain and image from the other hemispheres, given that the maps are very correlated across hemispheres</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Taking advantage of mirrored activity in the opposite hemisphere is a great idea. Future studies could include experiments that would take advantage of bilateral symmetry by placing high-resolution silicon probes in one hemisphere and then reading out mesoscale maps in the other.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The advantage of the electrophysiological recordings is in providing access to single-neuron activity at high temporal resolution. The authors could add more quantifications regarding individual neuron functional coupling diversity. For instance, in the per-area distributions in Figure 5D -- did all neurons from a given area participate in the same functional maps, or did different neurons show diversity in the functional coupling. Did simultaneous recordings of neurons from the same tetrode show more similar maps, than recordings of other neurons from the same area conducted on different days/in different animals? Did the map differ when the neurons were bursting/were at specific phases of the LFP, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately the yield of neurons was not enough to investigate some of the interesting state-dependent phenomena the reviewer describes. In previous work we have examined heterogeneity between single neuron responses in more detail Xiao et al. 2027 in acute work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Facial nerve stimulation. This part feels detached from the rest of the paper and is not explained/discussed in sufficient detail. For example, there is no description of the surgical procedure or the electrode used for facial nerve recordings in the Methods (in the Results section, the authors mention 'micro-wires', but the Method section only contains information about tetrodes).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing up the issue of surgical details for facial nerve experiments are now in the methods. This information is also available by contacting the authors and below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For facial nerve recordings, peripheral nerve activity was measured by fine wire recording directly from the nerves subserving the whisker. During surgery, mice will be anesthetized and positioned on a warming pad connected to a rectal probe, and the temperature maintained at 37 °C. A skin incision was made, exposing a small part of the buccal branch of the left facial nerve. Magnification of the surgical field with a dissecting microscope allowed a careful dissection of a nerve branch with minimum disruption of the tissues and blood supply surrounding the nerve. The appropriate site of exposure was determined by using two projection lines: a vertical line running downward, posterior from the outer corner of the eye, and a horizontal line running in the caudal direction, starting at the whisker E-row. Then two insulated fine wires (about 25 µm tips) were hooked and placed around the nerve separated about 2 mm from one another. The insulation at the ends of the wires was removed and a knot was made on each wire to prevent it from slipping. The opposite ends of each wire were soldered to a mini connector attached by dental cement to the skull. Finally, 6-0 silk sutures were used to close the skin incisions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The functional maps associated with facial nerve spiking show different patterns from the optogenetic stimulation maps that led to significant facial nerve responses. Specifically, the STM maps show responses in the posterior parts of the cortex, but the photostimulation map showed almost an opposite pattern, where the effects were observed in the anterior parts. The authors do not discuss this mismatch in sufficient detail. Further, the authors refer to area PTA but use partitions based on the Allen Institute, which does not indicate this area.</p>
<p>The posterior parietal area location is based on our previous work Mohajerani et al. 2013 and using the Allen Institute Brain Atlas for guidance.</p>

<p>Minor comments</p>
<p>1. The authors mention that &quot;on average, we obtained 3-5 neurons per tetrode implanted, and this yield was consistent across regions (Figure 2C). &quot; -- for how long, on average, could the authors record single-neuron activity from each tetrode?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The 3-5 neurons obtained per tetrode were recorded 1 week after tetrode implantation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 4B - it is unclear what the labels &quot;recording 1, ...5, &quot; correspond to. Are these different recording sessions within the same day &quot;day 8&quot;?</p>
