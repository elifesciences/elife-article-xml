<title>Abstract</title><p>Invasive cancer is defined by the loss of epithelial cell traits resulting from the ectopic expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related transcription factors such as Snail. Although EMT is known to impart chemoresistance to cancer cells, the precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We found that Snail expression confers chemoresistance by upregulating the cholesterol efflux pump ABCA1 as a countermeasure to the excess of cytotoxic free cholesterol relative to its major interaction partner in cellular membranes, sphingomyelin. This imbalance is introduced by the transcriptional repression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of sphingomyelin by Snail. Inhibiting esterification of cholesterol, which renders it inert, selectively suppresses growth of a xenograft model of Snail-positive kidney cancer. Our findings offer a new perspective on lipid-targeting strategies for invasive cancer therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metastatic cancer, characterized by the spread of tumor cells to distant organs, remains a major challenge in cancer treatment due to its high mortality rate. Metastasis involves a series of biological events, such as acquisition of cancer stem cell characteristics, tumor-microenvironment interactions, alterations in cell metabolism and resistance to chemotherapy, that are mediated by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lambert &amp; Weinberg, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Nieto <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Transcription factors driving EMT (EMT-TFs), including Snail, Slug and Twist, that are ectopically expressed in invasive cancers were initially thought to promote invasion and metastasis by suppressing the expression of adhesion molecules in cancer cells. However, since E-cadherin-mediated adhesion is essential for cell survival after metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Padmanaban <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), invasive cancer cells do not undergo complete EMT but rather sustain a hybrid state with both epithelial and mesenchymal (hybrid E/M) characteristics. In a mouse model of pancreatic carcinoma and breast cancers where key EMT-TFs were deleted, the suppression of EMT did not alter the appearance of systemic dissemination or metastasis but rather contributed to increased sensitivity to anticancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Therefore, in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistance to anti-cancer drugs conferred by EMT-TFs is an essential prerequisite for devising effective therapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Davis <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). It was recently reported that expression of a Rho family GTPase, RHOJ, is upregulated in cancer cells undergoing EMT and that its activation enhances the DNA damage response, which enables tumor cells to efficiently repair chemotherapy-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Debaugnies <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Here, we investigated EMT-dependent acquisition of resistance to more common anticancer drugs that do not directly cause DNA damage, such as those targeting the ERK signaling pathway, and found that expression of EMT-TFs causes metabolic alterations of sphingomyelin, resulting in ectopic induction of drug efflux transporter expression and conferring chemotherapy resistance to cancer cells.</p>

<title>Snail-induced ABCA1 expression confers chemoresistance to hybrid E/M cells</title>
<p>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is notorious for the lack of sensitivity to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Makhov <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms are not elucidated. Nitidine chloride (NC) holds promise as a drug treatment against RCC as it was shown to have a pro-apoptotic effect on RCC and inhibit tumor growth by suppressing the ERK signaling pathway in a xenograft model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cui <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fang <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). However, in human lung adenocarcinoma cells, NC efficacy was inversely correlated with the expression level of the drug transporter ABCA1: cancer cells with downregulated ABCA1 were more sensitive to NC treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Iwasaki <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Therefore, we wondered whether ABCA1 could also confer NC resistance in RCC. We treated five different RCC cell lines with a combination of NC and an ABCA1 inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA). Anti-proliferative effect of NC was significantly enhanced in the presence of CsA for three lines among five, Caki-1, 786-O and A498 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). These cells consistently expressed higher levels of ABCA1 compared to the non-responsive cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting the acquisition of ABCA1-mediated drug resistance. To investigate clinical relevance of ABCA1 upregulation in cancers, we analyzed ABCA1 expression in cancer using the UCSC Xena platform. Comparative ABCA1 expression data of both normal tissue and primary tumors were available for 24 cancer subtypes in the GDC TCGA database. In addition to glioblastoma and head and neck cancer, all three types of renal cancers (clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC), chromophobe carcinoma and papillary cell carcinoma) exhibited significant ABCA1 upregulation in tumor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>), indicating that ABCA1 upregulation frequently occurs in clinical renal cancers.</p>

<p>Regulatory mechanisms of ABCA1 expression in cancer cells is largely unknown. Interestingly, ABCA1 expression was positively correlated with expression of the EMT-TF Snail in the RCC cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To examine whether the enrichment of ABCA1 protein in malignant cancer cells is detectable in clinical cases, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis on surgical specimens taken from patients with primary ccRCC. The findings showed that ABCA1 was upregulated at the lesion site of high-grade ccRCC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This clinical data aligns with our cellular experimental results, as Snail expression is known to be upregulated in high-grade ccRCC. Upon detailed comparison among grades, ABCA1 signal was more prominent in the patients with the high-grade classification (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>), suggesting that ABCA1 could serve as a marker for high-grade ccRCC. Xena analysis also revealed significantly higher expression of Snail in ccRCC, also supporting the idea that ABCA1 upregulation is correlated with exogenous Snail expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to clarify whether Snail expression alone can confer resistance to anti-cancer drugs in epithelial cells, Snail was ectopically expressed in normal epithelial cells and we investigated changes in resistance to anti-cancer drugs. Overexpression of Snail in a mouse mammary gland epithelial cell line EpH4 abolishes transcription of various genes involved in cell-cell adhesion including E-cadherin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Batlle <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cano <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ikenouchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). EpH4-Snail cells exhibited coexistence of the mesenchyme-specific intermediate filament Vimentin and the epithelium-specific Cytokeratin-18 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), which is a typical feature of a hybrid E/M state of cancer cells. The hybrid E/M EpH4-Snail cells were significantly more resistant to NC than parental EpH4 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Consistent with the results of kidney cancer cell lines, this resistance was cancelled by CsA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), and upregulation of ABCA1 expression was also observed in EpH4-Snail cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). We also examined another model with a different cell line. In MDCK II, a canine kidney epithelial cell line, TGF-β treatment induced EMT under the expression of the oncogenic KRAS-G12V mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arner <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). The upregulation of ABCA1 expression was also observed in this transient hybrid E/M model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), suggesting that similar mechanisms to those in EpH4-Snail are also at play in kidney cell EMT. Notably, induction of ABCA1 expression requires a longer period of treatment with TGF-β (day 8) than Snail induction (day 3), indicating that ABCA1 is upregulated in response to cellular alteration by Snail but not induced directly by TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, in comparison between human esophageal cancer cell lines, Snail-positive TE-8 cells exhibited higher expression of ABCA1 than Snail-negative TE-15 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). These results suggest that the induction of ABCA1 by ectopic expression of Snail occurs regardless of cellular background.</p>

<title>Intracellular cholesterol accumulation drives ABCA1 expression in hybrid E/M cells</title>
<p>Then how does Snail induce ABCA1 expression, since as a transcriptional repressor it is incapable of doing so directly? Upregulation of ABCA1 was not observed in either E-cadherin or α-catenin KO cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), indicating that ABCA1 induction is driven as a specific response to a fundamental change in cellular state induced by Snail overexpression, not an ancillary effect of disrupting either cell-cell adhesion or apical-basal polarity. Generally, ABCA1 is a transporter for the efflux of cholesterol out of the cell when there is an excess of cholesterol in the cell and ABCA1 upregulation in response to excess loading of cholesterol is mediated by sterol-activated nuclear receptors, LXRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ignatova <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Aside from the cholesterol-LXRs regulatory axis, it was recently reported that ABCA1 expression in epithelial cells is regulated via FOXO3a and c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frechin <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Activation of FAK/PI3K/Akt signaling depending on cell crowding state downregulates ABCA1 expression via phosphorylation of FOXO3a, a positive transcriptional regulator of ABCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frechin <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). We found that phosphorylation level of FOXO3a at S453 is lower in EpH4-Snail cells than in wild-type EpH4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3A</xref>). However, since downregulation of Akt signaling by treatment with inhibitors of its activators GSK2334470 (PDK1), LY294002 (PI3K) and Wortmannin (PI3K) did not induce ABCA1 expression in wild-type EpH4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3A</xref>), FOXO3a would not be responsible for ABCA1 expression in EpH4-Snail cells. Although ABCA1 expression is also downregulated by c-Myc in breast cancer, no remarkable difference of c-Myc expression was observed between EpH4 and EpH4-Snail cells, indicating that c-Myc is not likely involved in ABCA1 expression in EpH4-Snail cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3B</xref>). Therefore, we next pursued in detail the possibility that LXRs induce ABCA1 in EpH4-Snail cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that LXRs are highly accumulated in the nuclei of EpH4-Snail cells, suggesting that ABCA1 upregulation could be mediated by LXRs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Consistently, treatment with an LXR inhibitor GSK2033 abolished ABCA1 expression to an undetectable level in EpH4-Snail cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Since transcriptional activity of LXRs are regulated by cellular cholesterol level, we examined whether ABCA1 is expressed in response to high cholesterol accumulation in the cells. Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by simvastatin, an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, remarkably decreased ABCA1 expression in EpH4-Snail cells but residual ABCA1 was still detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, normal FBS). In contrast, treatment with simvastatin in the medium supplemented with lipid-free FBS completely abolished ABCA1 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, lipid-free FBS). Together with the finding that incubation in lipid-free FBS medium alone did not markedly decrease ABCA1 expression, these results suggest that cholesterol biosynthesis is the primary source of excess accumulation of cholesterol in EpH4-Snail cells, but cholesterol uptake from media also significantly contribute to the accumulation as a secondary source.</p>

<p>These findings imply dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism in EpH4-Snail. Filipin staining revealed that cholesterol was prominently accumulated in intracellular structures in EpH4-Snail cells, whereas it localized primarily in the plasma membrane of wild-type EpH4 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Since excess cholesterol can be stored in lipid droplets, we stained cells with Lipi-Green to visualize lipid droplets. We found that lipid droplets were significantly enlarged in EpH4-Snail (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2, E and F</xref>). We next compared the total cholesterol levels in EpH4 cells and EpH4-Snail cells; the cellular amount of cholesterol slightly increased in EpH4-Snail cells, although the difference was not significant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). These results suggest that the accumulation of cholesterol in lipid droplets in EpH4-Snail cells was not due to an increase in the amount of cholesterol, but to an abnormality in the subcellular distribution of cholesterol. Collectively, dysregulation of intracellular distribution of cholesterol activates LXR to induce ABCA1 expression in hybrid E/M cells.</p>

<title>Downregulation of VLCFA-SM synthesis induces Chol/SM imbalance in hybrid E/M cells</title>
<p>A large proportion (30-50%) of cellular cholesterol is associated with sphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Das <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Therefore, we next examined the possibility that sphingomyelin levels are altered in EpH4-Snail cells. We found that the sphingomyelin content relative to total phospholipids decreased in EpH4-Snail cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). To investigate the SM profile in detail, we next analyzed the fatty acid composition of SM using LC-MS. In EpH4-Snail cells, the fractions of VLCFA-SMs (22:1, 22:0 and 24:1) were significantly decreased whereas those of LCFA-SMs (14:0, 16:1 and 16:0) were rather increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), resulting in a prominent decrease in the total VLCFA-SM fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3, C and D</xref>).

<p>Fatty acid composition of SM is mainly modulated by substrate specificity of two families of enzymes, Elovls and CerSs, that respectively catalyze the rate-limiting step of the fatty acid elongation cycle and the N-acylation of sphingoid bases to produce ceramides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Levy &amp; Futerman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Sassa &amp; Kihara, 2014</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that transcriptional repression of genes from these families causes the decrease in VLCFA-SM content in EpH4-Snail cells. RT-PCR analyses identified ELOVL7 and CERS3 as genes which are completely repressed specifically in EpH4-Snail cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, Elovl7 and CerS3 control VLCFA-SM production (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Collectively, exogenous expression of Snail represses transcription of VLCFA-SM-producing enzymes and results in a decrease in the amount of VLCFA-SM. Consequently, the ratio of cholesterol to SM (Chol/SM ratio) in the cells significantly increased in EpH4-Snail cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>), suggesting that a substantial amount of cholesterol exist in a sphingomyelin-unbound form in EpH4-Snail.</p>
<p>Since ABCA1 expression is not aligned with either the loss of epithelial state (E-cadherin and α-catenin KO) or a non-epithelial basal state (fibroblasts), upregulation of ABCA1 is characteristic to the hybrid E/M cells expressing ectopic Snail (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). To investigate the mechanism underlying this difference in ABCA1 expression, we again compared Chol/SM ratio in EpH4-Snail and normal fibroblast cell lines L-929 and NIH3T3. Chol/SM ratio of these fibroblasts were slightly but not significantly higher than that of EpH4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). The cholesterol content in NIH-3T3 cells is significantly higher than in EpH4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>). Consequently, normal fibroblast, would synthesize more SMs to counteract the cholesterol load imposed by the decrease in VLCFA-SMs and stabilize the Chol/SM ratio. By contrast, hybrid E/M cells are unable to respond appropriately to the harmful imbalance between cholesterol and SM due to the incomplete activation of the mesenchymal transcriptome.</p>
<p>To examine whether the above findings apply to human cancer cells, we used two esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, TE-15 and TE-8, that exhibit epithelial and hybrid-E/M phenotype, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Nishihira <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). As expected, expressions of ABCA1 and Snail were cooperatively upregulated in TE-8 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>). Consistent with our findings in the EpH4-Snail system, Chol/SM ratio was significantly higher in TE-8 cells than in TE-15 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>). Together with the results of mouse cell lines, normal epithelial and fibroblast cells maintain Chol/SM ratio around 1.0-1.5, and ABCA1 expression as a response to the excess Chol is induced when Chol/SM ratio exceed 1.5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). Notably, the difference in either cholesterol or SM contents between TE-15 and TE-8 cells, and cholesterol content between EpH4 and EpH4-Snail is not significant when each are compared alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>), indicating the importance of considering their functional cooperativity, i.e. to analyze the Chol/SM ratio.</p>

<title>Inhibitor of cholesterol esterification selectively inhibits growth of Snail-positive kidney cancer cells</title>
<p>Finally, we examined the possibility of targeting the imbalance of Chol/SM ratio in Snail-positive cancer cells to selectively inhibit their growth. As discussed above, hybrid E/M cells of high Chol/SM ratio must either export cholesterol out of cells or isolate it within cells in lipid droplets as cholesteryl esters to avoid the cytotoxic effects of free cholesterol. Thus, inhibiting the means of clearing excess cholesterol could specifically target cells in the hybrid E/M state for self-extermination. Cholesterol efflux from cells is mainly dependent on ABCA1, and esterification of cholesterol is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl transferases (ACATs) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Song <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). According to our findings above, hybrid E/M cells activate both cholesterol efflux and isolation system to handle excess cholesterol. Therefore, we examined the effect of ABCA1 inhibitor CsA and ACAT inhibitor TMP-153 on the EpH4-Snail model and renal carcinoma cells. While CsA non-selectively inhibited growth of all cell lines tested (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>), TMP-153 selectively inhibited growth of Snail-positive cells (EpH4-Snail, 786-O, A498 and Caki-1; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). Thus, sequestration of cholesterol via esterification by ACATs is the primary mechanism for handling excess cholesterol to avoid cell death in these cells. Notably, TMP-153 treatment alone did not provide this selectivity between esophageal cancer cell lines, but combination of TMP-153 and cyclosporin A selectively inhibited growth of the Snail-positive TE-8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figs. S5, A-C</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of cholesterol efflux and cholesterol esterification selectively inhibit growth of cells stably in a Snail-induced hybrid E/M state.</p>

<p>We also investigated the potential of ACAT inhibitors as anti-tumor agents in vivo using xenograft models. We successfully transplanted the 786-O line into nude mice among Snail-positive ccRCC cell lines. Using this system, we found that TMP-153 treatment significantly reduced 786-O tumor volume in vivo (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4, F-H</xref>). Moreover, the combination of TMP-153 and cyclosporin A also inhibited the growth of TE-8 tumor xenografts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figs. S5D-F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In recent years, it has been revealed that the expression of EMT-TFs, such as Snail, induces cancer cells to acquire mesenchymal characteristics while retaining epithelial traits, transforming them into so-called hybrid E/M cells. Hybrid E/M cells have been demonstrated to exhibit the highest plasticity and malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aiello <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Pastushenko <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Moreover, Snail expression contributes to cancer stemness and resistance to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lambert &amp; Weinberg, 2021</xref>). To date, molecular mechanisms connecting to EMT-TFs to chemoresistance remain to be established. Here we identify lipid metabolic imbalance-mediated ABCA1 expression as a mechanism of chemoresistance induced by Snail. We found reduced VLCFA-SM biosynthesis in Snail-positive cells with hybrid E/M phenotypes, resulting in high Chol/SM ratio. This should be detrimental in theory since it increases exposure to the toxic effect of free cholesterol but cancer cells deploy countermeasures: upregulating ABCA1 to move cholesterol out of cells and sequestering esterified cholesterol in the form of lipid droplets. Notably, it has been also reported that not only ABCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Iwasaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) but also enhanced lipid droplet formation triggers chemoresistance to various drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cotte <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hultsch <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Schlaepfer <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Therefore, dietary or pharmacological control of cholesterol and also sphingolipids would be a new strategy to overcome resistance to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>The aberrant activation of EMT-TFs is implicated in multiple crucial steps in cancer progression, prompting efforts to explore therapeutic approaches aimed at suppressing EMT-TF functions in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Davis <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). However, as EMT-TFs are predominantly located in the nucleus, no effective treatment methods, including antibody drugs, have been established thus far. Therefore, instead of directly targeting EMT-TFs, focusing on the metabolic network vulnerabilities specific to hybrid E/M cells may prove to be an effective therapeutic strategy. In the present study, we found increased sensitivity of Snail-positive cells to toxicity of free-cholesterol accumulation induced by the ACAT inhibitor TMP-153. Notably, kidney cancer growth could be suppressed by inhibiting cholesterol esterification alone while esophageal cancer required the additional downregulation of ABCA1, indicating varying dependence on free cholesterol clearance strategies among cancers of different primary origin. Other cancers might employ alternative pathways to evade cytotoxic effects of excess cholesterol and identifying these traits will pave the way for the development of novel strategies in targeted molecular therapeutics against hybrid E/M cancers. An intriguing corollary here is the potential utility of ABCA1 expression as a diagnostic marker to identify cancers that would be sensitive to targeting the Chol/SM imbalance.</p>
<p>Although various metabolic changes in cancer cells focusing on energy sources including sugars, amino acids and fatty acids have been intensely studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Pavlova <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), alteration of sphingolipid homeostasis driven by EMT-TFs remains largely unknown. We found both quantitative and qualitative alteration of sphingomyelin profile: decrease in the total SM amount and the VLCFA-SM percentage. This alteration is attributed to transcriptional repression of enzymes for biosynthesis of VLCFA-SMs, CerS3 and Elovl7. Genes whose transcription is repressed by Snail include those encoding proteins directly involved in epithelial adhesive structures, such as E-cadherin and Claudins. Hence, it is not surprising that VLCFA-SMs play important roles cooperatively with the adhesion molecules. Indeed, cholesterol accumulation is required for tight junction formation, and VLCFA-SMs are enriched in the junctional region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Shigetomi <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Shigetomi <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Studies focusing on the VLCFA-synthetic enzymes would provide a new layer of knowledge about mechanisms underlying the establishment of epithelial structures and functions. Such studies would also contribute to understanding how dysfunctions in lipid metabolisms promote cancer malignancy and tissue fibrosis as a consequence of EMT. The regulation of cell adhesion by fine-tuning of lipid composition should be reversible and therefore would explain the two conflicting events: the invasion and metastasis process and the viability process at the metastatic site.</p>

<p>This paper presents the <bold>important</bold> discovery that lipid metabolic imbalance caused by Snail, an EMT-related transcription factor, contributes to the acquisition of chemoresistance in cancer cells. However, the <bold>incomplete</bold> support for the authors' claims is due to concerns about the causal relationship and lack of sufficient quantitative analysis.

<p>The authors focus on the molecular mechanisms by which EMT cells confer resistance to cancer cells. The authors use a wide range of methods to reveal that overexpression of Snail in EMT cells induces cholesterol/sphingomyelin imbalance via transcriptional repression of biosynthetic enzymes involved in sphingomyelin synthesis. The study also revealed that ABCA1 is important for cholesterol efflux and thus for counterbalancing the excess of intracellular free cholesterol in these snail-EMT cells. Inhibition of ACAT, an enzyme catalyzing cholesterol esterification, also seems essential to inhibit the growth of snail-expressing cancer cells.</p>
<p>However, It seems important to analyze the localization of ABCA1, as it is possible that in the event of cholesterol/sphingomyelin imbalance, for example, the intracellular trafficking of the pump may be altered.</p>
<p>
The authors should also analyze ACAT levels and/or activity in snail-EMT cells that should be increased. Overall, the provided data are important to better understand cancer biology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors discovered that the chemoresistance in RCC cell lines correlates with the expression levels of the drug transporter ABCA1 and the EMT-related transcription factor Snail. They demonstrate that Snail induces ABCA1 expression and chemoresistance, and that ABCA1 inhibitors can counteract this resistance. The study also suggests that Snail disrupts the cholesterol-sphingomyelin (Chol/SM) balance by repressing the expression of enzymes involved in very long-chain fatty acid-sphingomyelin synthesis, leading to excess free cholesterol. This imbalance activates the cholesterol-LXR pathway, inducing ABCA1 expression. Moreover, inhibiting cholesterol esterification suppresses Snail-positive cancer cell growth, providing potential lipid-targeting strategies for invasive cancer therapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This research presents a novel mechanism by which the EMT-related transcription factor Snail confers drug resistance by altering the Chol/SM balance, introducing a previously unrecognized role of lipid metabolism in the chemoresistance of cancer cells. The focus on lipid balance, rather than individual lipid levels, is a particularly insightful approach. The potential for targeting cholesterol detoxification pathways in Snail-positive cancer cells is also a significant therapeutic implication.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study's claim that Snail-induced ABCA1 is crucial for chemoresistance relies only on pharmacological inhibition of ABCA1, lacking additional validation. The causal relationship between the disrupted Chol/SM balance and ABCA1 expression or chemoresistance is not directly supported by data. Some data lack quantitative analysis.</p>

<p>Response to Reviewer 1</p>
<p>We will investigate the intracellular localization of ABCA1 in both EpH4 and EpH4-Snail cells. We will also examine the changes in ACAT expression levels within these cell lines.</p>
<p>Response to Reviewer 2</p>
<p>We will first investigate whether the chemoresistance exhibited by EpH4-Snail cells can be abolished not only through pharmacological inhibition of ABCA1 but also by knocking out the ABCA1 gene. Regarding causality, as demonstrated in Figure 2, we have already shown that reducing cholesterol levels in EpH4-Snail cells decreases ABCA1 expression. To further explore this relationship, we will assess whether increasing sphingomyelin levels by adding ceramide to the culture medium, thereby correcting the sphingomyelin-to-cholesterol ratio, would reduce ABCA1 expression. Furthermore, we will evaluate whether lowering cholesterol levels in EpH4-Snail cells via simvastatin treatment, along with normalization of the sphingomyelin-to-cholesterol ratio, attenuates their resistance to the anticancer drug nitidine chloride. Additionally, we will incorporate quantitative analyses for several experiments, as suggested in the reviewers’ comments, to enhance the robustness of our findings.</p>
