<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Defining the cellular factors that drive growth rate and proteome composition is essential for understanding and manipulating cellular systems. In bacteria, ribosome concentration is known to be a constraining factor of cell growth rate, while gene concentration is usually assumed not to be limiting. Here, using single-molecule tracking, quantitative single-cell microscopy, and modeling, we show that genome dilution in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells arrested for DNA replication limits total RNA polymerase activity within physiological cell sizes across tested nutrient conditions. This rapid-onset limitation on bulk transcription results in sub-linear scaling of total active ribosomes with cell size and sub-exponential growth. Such downstream effects on bulk translation and cell growth are near-immediately detectable in a nutrient-rich medium, but delayed in nutrient-poor conditions, presumably due to cellular buffering activities. RNA sequencing and tandem-mass-tag mass spectrometry experiments further reveal that genome dilution remodels the relative abundance of mRNAs and proteins with cell size at a global level. Altogether, our findings indicate that chromosome concentration is a limiting factor of transcription and a global modulator of the transcriptome and proteome composition in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Experiments in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and comparison with eukaryotic cell studies identify broadly conserved DNA concentration-dependent scaling principles of gene expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells regulate the intracellular concentration of various proteins and macromolecules to modulate the rate of essential cellular processes, including growth. In bacteria, cell mass and volume typically double between division cycles. Proportionality between biosynthetic capacity and biomass accumulation results in exponential or near-exponential cell growth during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Campos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schaechter et al., 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Siegal-Gaskins and Crosson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Taheri-Araghi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). What drives exponential growth has been a longstanding question in the microbiology field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Belliveau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Churchward et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ecker and Schaechter, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhurinsky et al., 2010</xref>). Quantitative studies on model bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> place the concentration of ribosomes and their kinetics as the principal rate-limiting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Belliveau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bosdriesz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Koch, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Scott et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">2010</xref>). Most other cellular components essential for growth are estimated to be at least an order of magnitude above the level required for proper enzymatic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Belliveau et al., 2021</xref>), indicating that they are well in excess in terms of metabolic concentrations. Thus, translation is generally seen as the rate-governing process for cellular growth. While the translocation rate of ribosomes poses an inherent limit on the growth rate of the cell, protein concentrations are predominantly set transcriptionally at the promoter level, with tight coordination between transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balakrishnan et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas the importance of ribosome concentration in growth rate determination has been extensively studied, a potential role for genome concentration has received less attention. An early population study on an <italic>E. coli</italic> thymine auxotroph proposed that global transcription is not limited by the concentration of the genome but is instead constrained by the availability of RNA polymerases (RNAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Churchward et al., 1982</xref>). However, the potential impact of DNA concentration on determining the growth rate of <italic>E. coli</italic> or other bacteria has, to our knowledge, not been formally tested. Interestingly, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> have been shown to display small but reproducible deviations from exponential growth during the division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Nordholt et al., 2020</xref>), with the growth rate increasing after the initiation of DNA replication under some conditions. Furthermore, at the population level, these organisms initiate DNA replication at a fixed cell volume (mass) per chromosomal origin of replication (<italic>oriC</italic>) across a wide range of nutrient and genetic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Donachie, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Govers et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Si et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that DNA concentration is an important physiological parameter for these bacteria. In eukaryotes where genome concentration is also tightly controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ginzberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Turner et al., 2012</xref>), a change in DNA-to-cell-volume ratio has recently been demonstrated to remodel the proteome and promote cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Crozier et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Foy et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lanz et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Manohar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wilson et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we combined single-cell and single-molecule microscopy experiments with tandem-mass-tag (TMT) mass spectrometry, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and modeling to investigate the potential physiological role of genome concentration in cell growth and proteome composition in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>

<title>Growth rate correlates with the genome copy number</title>
<p>To examine the potential effect of DNA content on the growth rate of <italic>E. coli</italic>, we used two CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) strains with arabinose-inducible control of expression of dCas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Si et al., 2017</xref>). One strain expressed a single guide RNA (sgRNA) against <italic>oriC</italic> where sequestration by dCas9 binding prevents the initiation of DNA replication to produce cells with a single copy of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Si et al., 2017</xref>). These cells, referred to as “1N cells” below, grew into filaments as a block in DNA replication prevents cell division, but not cell growth, from occurring (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Carl, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Si et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Withers and Bernander, 1998</xref>). The second CRISPRi strain, which served as a comparison, expressed a sgRNA against the cell division protein FtsZ. FtsZ depletion blocks cell division while allowing DNA replication to proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Addinall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Ongoing growth resulted in filamenting cells with multiple replicating chromosomes, hereafter referred to as “multi-N cells” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). For both strains, we used time-lapse microscopy to monitor growth at the single-cell level at 37°C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glycerol, casamino acids, and thiamine (M9glyCAAT). Cell area (<italic>A</italic>) was automatically detected from phase-contrast images using a deep convolutional network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wiktor et al., 2021</xref>), and the absolute growth rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582181v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> was determined by calculating the difference in cell area between frames. The relative growth rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582181v2_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, which is constant for exponential growth, was calculated by dividing the absolute growth rate by the cell area. We used WT cells to verify that the transition from liquid cultures to agarose pads led to stable growth from the start of image acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<p>As the induced CRISPRi <italic>oriC</italic> phenotype is not fully penetrant, we limited our analysis to 1N cells that contained a single DNA object (nucleoid) labeled by a mCherry fusion to the nucleoid-binding protein HupA (referred to as HU below). To confirm this 1N chromosome designation, we used a CRISPRi <italic>oriC</italic> strain that expresses HU-CFP and carries an <italic>oriC</italic>-proximal <italic>parS</italic> site labeled with ParB-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2</xref>), used here to determine the number of nucleoids and chromosomal origins per cell. We found that 96 ± 1% (mean ± standard deviation, SD, three biological replicates) of cells (n = 3378) with a single HU-labeled nucleoid contained no more than one ParB-mCherry focus, indicative of a single <italic>oriC</italic>.</p>
<p>Using this methodology, we observed a significant difference in growth rate between 1N and multi-N cells as shown in representative single-cell growth trajectories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and in aggregated absolute growth rate measurements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In multi-N cells, the absolute growth rate rapidly increased with cell area. In 1N cells, the absolute growth rate only moderately increased with cell area, approaching an apparent plateau at large cell sizes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). As an independent validation, we used an orthogonal system to block DNA replication using the temperature-sensitive mutant <italic>dnaC2</italic>, which encodes a deficient DNA helicase loader at the restrictive temperature of 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Carl, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Withers and Bernander, 1998</xref>). We observed that the relationship between absolute growth rate and cell area in <italic>dnaC2</italic> cells with a single nucleoid was similar to that of 1N cells produced by the CRISPRi <italic>oriC</italic> system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This sub-exponential growth in 1N and <italic>dnaC2</italic> cells resulted in a relative growth rate that decreased with cell area (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). For multi-N cells, the relative growth rate was not perfectly constant but appeared to increase somewhat with cell area (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). It is unclear whether this slight increase is biologically meaningful, as simulations show that a small inaccuracy in cell size from cell segmentation can produce the appearance of super-exponential growth at large cell sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_3">Figure 1 – figure supplement 3</xref>). Regardless, and most importantly, the multi-N cells grew identically to WT within the same cell size range while 1N cells grew significantly slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_4">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4</xref>).</p>
<p>The striking divergence in growth between 1N and multi-N cells of the same size suggested that DNA concentration can affect growth rate. The difference in growth rate between 1N and multi-N cells was already apparent in the physiological range of cell sizes when compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_4">Figure 1 – figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that growth rate reduction occurs soon after DNA replication fails to initiate. We confirmed that the slower growth of 1N cells did not depend on the time that cells spent on agarose pads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_5">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5Α</xref>). We also ruled out that the growth reduction was due to an induction of the SOS response or to an increased level in the nucleotide alarmone (p)ppGpp, as inactivation of either stress pathway (through deletion of <italic>recA</italic> or <italic>spoT</italic>/<italic>relA</italic>, respectively) in 1N cells made little to no difference to their growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_5">Figure 1 – figure supplement 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>We noticed that, even at the restrictive temperature, the <italic>dnaC2</italic> strain produced a sizeable fraction of cells with more than one HU-mCherry-labelled nucleoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_6">Figure 1 – figure supplement 6A-B</xref>), indicating that the temperate-sensitive effect on DNA replication is not fully penetrant. We took advantage of this phenotypic “leakiness” to measure the growth rate of cells with different numbers of nucleoids (and thus chromosomes) within the <italic>dnaC2</italic> population. We observed a notable difference in growth rate between cells of 1, 2, and &gt;2 nucleoids in the population, with each additional nucleoid contributing to higher cellular growth at a given cell size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-G</xref>). This finding is consistent with DNA-limited growth in which cellular growth rate increases with genome concentration. We obtained similar results when we calculated absolute and relative growth rates based on extracted cell volumes instead of areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_7">Figure 1 – figure supplement 7A-F</xref>), as cell width remained largely constant during cell filamentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_7">Figure 1 – figure supplement 7G</xref>).</p>

<p>To exclude the possibility that the msfGFP tag altered the synthesis of RpsB or that this protein behaved differently from other ribosomal proteins, we adapted a TMT mass spectrometry (MS) method recently developed to examine cell size-dependent proteome scaling in yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lanz et al., 2022</xref>). Note that, for the CRISPRi <italic>oriC</italic> strain, a minority (∼10-15%) of cells have more than one nucleoid. These cells were excluded from the analysis of our single-cell microscopy experiments. However, this could not be done for the TMT-MS experiments, which provide population-level measurements. Therefore, for this TMT-MS section, we will refer to the CRISPRi <italic>oriC</italic> cell population as “1N-rich” cells, instead of only “1N” cells. Using the TMT-MS approach, we found that the relative concentration of all (54) high-abundance ribosomal proteins (including untagged RpsB) remained approximately constant across all sizes of 1N-rich cells, and was similar between 1N-rich and multi-N cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Only the relative concentration of the ribosomal protein L31B, a stationary phase paralog of the more prevalent exponential phase ribosomal protein L31A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lilleorg et al., 2019</xref>), significantly decreased in 1N cells (Dataset 1). Thus, the concentration of ribosomal proteins does not explain the difference in growth rate between cells with different ploidy.</p>

<title>The fraction of active ribosomes is reduced in genome-diluted cells</title>
<p>To more specifically probe the translational activity of ribosomes in 1N cells, we performed single-molecule tracking in live cells growing in M9glyCAAT. Ribosomes are expected to exhibit at least two different dynamic states: slow mobility when active (i.e., engaged in translation on the mRNA, often in polyribosome form), and faster mobility when inactive ribosomes (or ribosomal subunits) are diffusing in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mohapatra and Weisshaar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sanamrad et al., 2014</xref>). To track ribosomes, we introduced a HaloTag fusion to RpsB (through genetic modification at the endogenous chromosomal locus) and labeled the HaloTag using the membrane-permeable Janelia Fluor 549 (JF549) fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>). We quantified the apparent diffusion coefficient (D<sub>a</sub>) of single-molecule tracks in WT cells, as well as in 1N and multi-N cells at multiple time points following CRISPRi induction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We found that the distribution of D<sub>a</sub> in multi-N cells of all sizes (∼2-10 µm<sup>2</sup>) was similar to that in WT cells despite the considerable differences in cell sizes. In contrast, 1N cells displayed distributions clearly distinct from WT and multi-N cells, gradually shifting toward faster mobilities (higher D<sub>a</sub>) with increasing cell size. This shift suggests that ribosome activity is altered in 1N cells.</p>
<p>Gaussian fitting of the D<sub>a</sub> logarithmic data in WT cells revealed two predominant dynamic states of ribosomes: a slow-diffusing and a fast-diffusing state, representing 77 ± 1% (mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM)) and 20 ± 1% of the ribosome population, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, we observed a small fraction (3.2 ± 0.5%) of faster-moving molecules with D<sub>a</sub> expected for freely-diffusing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Banaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Elowitz et al., 1999</xref>), likely indicative of a small pool of free RpsB-HaloTag proteins (i.e., not assembled into ribosomes). To confirm that the slow-diffusing fraction corresponded to translationally active ribosomes, we showed that this fraction nearly vanished (down to 1.10 ± 0.02%) when cells were depleted of mRNAs following 30 min treatment with the transcription inhibitor rifampicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_1">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1</xref>). The estimated fraction (∼77%) of active ribosomes in untreated cells was in good agreement with previous single-molecule and biochemical studies under similar growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Forchhammer and Lindahl, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mohapatra and Weisshaar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sanamrad et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Upon fitting the D<sub>a</sub> values of ribosomes in WT and 1N cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), we observed a significant reduction in the slow-diffusing ribosome population in 1N cells of increasing area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_2">Figure 2 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Quantification of the active (slow-diffusing) ribosome fraction per cell revealed that 1N cells have overall lower ribosome activity than WT cells, and that ribosome activity decreases monotonically with increasing cell area (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). In contrast, ribosome activity in multi-N cells remained the same as in WT across different cell sizes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>To estimate the total number of active ribosomes per cell, we multiplied the total amount of ribosomes by the fraction of active ribosomes and plotted the result as a function of cell area (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). We found that the difference in the total number of active ribosomes between 1N and multi-N cells matches the observed difference in growth rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), indicating that cell growth rate is directly proportional to the increase in total active ribosomes. Altogether, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that DNA limitation decreases total ribosome activity, which, in turn, reduces the growth rate.</p>

<title>Genome dilution reduces the activity of RNA polymerases</title>
<p>We reasoned that the observed changes in ribosome activity in 1N cells may reflect the available pool of transcripts. If true, we would expect the total activity of RNAPs to be reduced in 1N cells. The total activity of RNAPs in cells is determined by the concentration of RNAPs multiplied by the fraction of active RNAPs. Therefore, we first determined whether RNAP concentration was lower in 1N cells relative to multi-N cells by quantifying the fluorescence intensity of a functional fusion of YFP to the RNAP β’ subunit (encoded by <italic>rpoC</italic>) expressed from its native chromosomal locus. As expected, RNAP concentration remained constant in multi-N cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In 1N cells, the RNAP concentration increased with cell size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), the opposite of what would be expected to explain the growth rate defect.

<p>To quantify RNAP activity in 1N and multi-N cells, we performed single-molecule tracking in live cells using a functional fusion of HaloTag to the β’ protein subunit RpoC labeled with the JF549 dye. As expected, the D<sub>a</sub> values of RpoC-HaloTag in multi-N cells were distributed similarly to those in WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the distribution in 1N cells changed gradually toward higher D<sub>a</sub> values (faster mobility) with increasing cell size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). As with ribosomes, RNAPs primarily exhibited two major states of diffusivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>): a slower-diffusing fraction (49 ± 4%; mean ± SEM) and a faster-diffusing fraction (49 ± 4%), likely representing transcriptionally active RNAPs and inactive, diffusing RNAPs, respectively. A small fraction of RpoC-HaloTag (2 ± 0.1%) diffused very fast, with D<sub>a</sub> values expected for free proteins, suggesting that it reflects the few β’ proteins not assembled into the RNAP core complex. Using rifampicin treatment, we confirmed that the slowest state corresponds to RNAPs actively engaged in transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1</xref>). In these rifampicin-treated cells, the slow-diffusing fraction was reduced to 13 ± 4%. Rifampicin does not prevent promoter binding or open complex formation and instead blocks transcription elongation following the synthesis of 3-nucleotide-long RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, the observation that slow-moving RNAPs did not completely disappear after rifampicin treatment is consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug, leaving a fraction of RNAPs bound at promoter sites.</p>
<p>Unlike in WT and multi-N cells, the fraction of active RNAPs in 1N cells decreased monotonically with increasing cell area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-G</xref>). However, because the RNAP concentration simultaneously increased in 1N cells, it remained possible that the total amount of active RNAP, which is the relevant metric of transcription activity, remained equal to that of multi-N cells. By calculating the total amount of active RNAPs, we showed that the decrease in the active fraction in 1N cells was not the mere result of the increase in RNAP concentration. Indeed, the total amount of active RNAPs hardly increased with cell size in 1N cells whereas it increased proportionally with cell size in both multi-N and WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent study has shown that the intracellular concentration of Rsd, the anti-sigma factor of σ<sup>70</sup>, increases in WT cells under slower growth conditions, causing a reduction in global mRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balakrishnan et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we verified that the concentration of Rsd remains approximately constant in both 1N-rich and multi-N cells based on our TMT-MS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_2">Figure 3 – figure supplement 2</xref>), eliminating Rsd as a possible source of reduced RNAP activity in 1N cells. Instead, our data supports the notion that substrate (DNA) limitation leads to a reduced transcription rate, which reduces the pool of transcripts available for ribosomes.</p>

<title>Chromosome dilution reduces the concentration of transcripts</title>
<p>To test the idea that genome dilution affects growth rate through transcript limitation, we performed live-cell staining with SYTO RNASelect, a fluorogenic RNA-specific dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). This dye has been proposed to preferentially bind mRNAs based on the observed decay of intracellular RNASelect signal in <italic>E. coli</italic> during rifampicin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bakshi et al., 2014</xref>), which causes mRNA depletion. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) also decrease in rifampicin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hamouche et al., 2021</xref>), though at a slower rate than mRNAs. Therefore, to complement the RNASelect staining experiments and examine the potential effect of genome dilution specifically on rRNAs, we also carried out fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) microscopy on fixed cells using EUB338-Cy3, a DNA probe complementary to an exposed region in the 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amann et al., 1990</xref>). For both experiments, we mixed 1N cells with multi-N cells of similar size ranges prior to incubation with RNASelect or EUB338-Cy3 to mitigate variability in staining. We next imaged the mixed populations and distinguished 1N cells from multi-N cells by examining the difference in nucleoid number (one vs. multiple) per cell using HU-mCherry or DAPI as a DNA marker (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Single cells were sampled to ensure that the cell area distributions of the two populations matched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparison between the two sampled populations revealed a reduced concentration of RNASelect signal by ∼50% in 1N cells relative to multi-N cells for a cell size range of 4 to 10 µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>). For a similar cell area range, the EUB338 signal concentration was reduced by only ∼5%. Furthermore, the RNASelect concentration ratio between 1N and multi-N cells displayed a rapid exponential decay with increasing cell area, whereas the decrease in EUB338 concentration ratio was considerably slower (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>To verify that the decrease in RNASelect signal in 1N cells was not caused by a global change in membrane permeability to small molecules, we performed similar live-cell staining experiments with the HaloTag dye JF549 in CRISPRi strains expressing RpoC-HaloTag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_2">Figure 4 – figure supplement 2A</xref>). We matched the cell distributions between 1N and multi-N cells for fair comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_2">Figure 4 – figure supplement 2B</xref>). Because RpoC concentration increases with cell size in 1N cells relative to multi-N cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>), we expected a similar increase in the ratio of JF549 signal between these two cell types if the membrane permeability to small molecules remained unchanged. This is indeed what we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_2">Figure 4 – figure supplement 2C-E</xref>). In parallel, to examine the ability of our rRNA FISH method to detect a reduction in 16S rRNA concentrations, we compared the EUB338 staining of wildtype cells (MG1655) growing in M9 glycerol with or without casamino acids and thiamine (M9glyCAAT vs M9gly), which results in a difference in growth rate of ∼40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Govers et al., 2024</xref>) due to the expected lower concentration of ribosomes and thus 16S rRNAs in nutrient-poor media. Consistent with this expectation, we found that the EUB338 concentration signal was reduced by ∼50% in M9gly relative to M9glyCAAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_3">Figure 4 – figure supplement 3</xref>). Given these validations, our results in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> suggest that the RNASelect signal primarily reflects the bulk of mRNAs, and that the concentration of mRNAs decreases more rapidly than that of rRNAs upon genome dilution.</p>

<p>We used these models to perform simulations and compared the results to our measurements, starting with parameter values extracted or estimated from the <italic>E. coli</italic> literature (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In 1N cells, the DNA amount was fixed to one genome while it scaled with cell volume in multi-N cells. The parameters were then optimized to fit six experimental datasets simultaneously: cell growth rate, the fraction of active RNAPs, and the fraction of active ribosomes in both 1N and multi-N cells (see Materials and Methods and Appendix 4).</p>

<p>The simulation results of 1N cells suggest the following cascade of events when DNA is limiting. Lower DNA concentration results in fewer substrates for RNAPs, which reduces the transcription rate. This results in a decrease in mRNA concentration. As mRNAs become limiting, the fraction of ribosomes engaged in translation decreases. This, in turn, decreases the rate of bulk protein synthesis, which decreases the relative growth rate. The greater the DNA dilution (through cell growth), the more severe the downstream effects become, explaining the decay in relative growth rate in 1N cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>

<title>Genome dilution rapidly limits RNAP activity under both nutrient-rich and -poor conditions, but the extent of downstream effects on ribosome activity and cell growth can vary with the nutrient condition</title>
<p>In the relatively nutrient-rich M9glyCAAT condition, WT cells at birth are expected to have higher DNA content than 1N cells on average due to overlapping DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fossum et al., 2007</xref>). To examine whether cells are also subject to DNA-limited transcription when multi-fork DNA replication is rare or nonexistent, we examined the total RNAP activity of 1N cells relative to WT cells in two different nutrient-poor media, M9gly and M9 L-alanine (M9ala). Abundance and diffusivity measurements of RpoC-YFP-labeled RNAPs e supplement 1) showed that the scaling between the total amount of active RNAPs (i.e., global transcriptional activity) and cell area was strongly reduced in 1N cells, even within the range of WT cell sizes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref>).

<p>In contrast, abundance and diffusivity measurements of fluorescently labeled ribosomes in cells growing in M9gly and M9ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6_2">Figure 6 – figure supplement 2</xref>) revealed that the total amount of active ribosomes (i.e., bulk translational activity) and the absolute growth rate of 1N cells started to deviate from proportional scaling with cell areas mostly when cells reached large (non-physiological) sizes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>).

<title>Genome dilution changes the composition of the transcriptome and proteome</title>
<p>The fact that the relative concentrations of ribosomal proteins and RNAP subunits scaled differently with cell area in 1N cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A-B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A-B</xref>) indicated that all genes are not equally impacted by DNA dilution. In yeast and mammalian cells, a decrease in the DNA-per-volume ratio has recently been demonstrated to alter the composition of the proteome, with some proteins increasing in relative concentration while others become comparatively more diluted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lanz et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2022</xref>). To examine whether this effect may be conserved across domains of life, we used our proteomic TMT-MS data on the CRISPRi strains to quantify the relative concentration of each detected protein across cell areas following DNA replication or cell division arrest in M9glyCAAT. For each protein, we calculated the relative change in concentration against the relative change in cell size through regression fitting, yielding a slope value. A slope of zero indicates that the concentration of a protein remains constant relative to the proteome whereas a slope of -1 (or 1) means that the relative concentration is decreasing (or increasing) by two-fold with each cell size doubling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We found that the slope distribution was highly reproducible between biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7_1">Figure 7 – figure supplement 1A-B</xref>) but drastically different between 1N-rich cells and multi-N cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, Dataset 1). In the control multi-N cells where the genome concentration does not change with cell growth, the relative concentration of ∼94% of the detected proteins (2217/2360) remained roughly constant, with their relative concentrations decreasing or increasing by less than 20% per cell size doubling (i.e., slopes &gt; -0.2 or &lt; 0.2; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> and Dataset 1). This suggests that protein amounts largely scale with cell size, as generally assumed. However, in 1N-rich cells where the genome dilutes with cell growth, the proportion of detected proteins with slopes near zero (&gt; -0.2 or &lt; 0.2) dropped to ∼37% (859/2360) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> and Dataset 1). A principal component analysis on the relative protein concentration during cell growth confirmed that the relative proteome composition changed proportionally with genome dilution (1N-rich cells), whereas it remained constant when the DNA-to-cell volume ratio was maintained (multi-N cells) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine whether the proteome scaling behavior stems from differential changes in mRNA levels, we performed transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analysis on two biological replicates of 1N-rich cells at different time points after induction of DNA replication arrest. The two replicates were strongly correlated at the transcript level (Spearman ρ = 0.91, p-value &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7_1">Figure 7 – figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also found a strong correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.76, p-value &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>) in scaling behavior with cell area between mRNAs and proteins across the genome of 1N-rich cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref> and Dataset 2), indicating that most of the changes in protein levels observed upon genome dilution take place at the mRNA level.</p>
<p>To investigate whether central processes may contribute to the observed transcriptome remodeling during DNA limitation, we examined whether the RNA slopes correlate with gene-specific rates of transcription initiation or mRNA degradation obtained from a published dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balakrishnan et al., 2022</xref>). Note that the reference dataset was generated from experiments on <italic>E. coli</italic> growing in M9 glucose (M9glu) and not M9glyCAAT. However, both media give similar growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Govers et al., 2024</xref>) and our transcriptome measurements agree well with the reference data in terms of mRNA abundance (Spearman ρ = 0.76, p-value &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7_2">Figure 7 – figure supplement 2A</xref>). We found no significant correlation between the rates of transcription initiation from the reference dataset and RNA or protein slopes across genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7_2">Figure 7 – figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). Consistent with this finding, mRNA abundance was not a predictor of RNA slopes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). This was somewhat surprising as one might anticipate highly transcribed genes to saturate with RNAPs faster than other genes. However, we found that the mRNA degradation rate partly explains the variance in RNA and protein slopes. Specifically, for genes producing short-lived transcripts (decay rate &gt; 0.7 min<sup>-1</sup>), the RNA and protein slopes slightly negatively correlated with the rate of mRNA decay (Spearman correlation coefficient ρ = -0.18, p-value &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7_2">Figure 7 – figure supplement 2D</xref>, Dataset 3). These results suggest that genes that generate short-lived mRNAs are more susceptible to DNA limitation, presumably because their mRNAs are more rapidly diluted with cell growth due to their fast decay.</p>
<p>Next, we examined whether genes reported to be essential for viability in three independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gerdes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Goodall et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yamazaki et al., 2008</xref>) displayed biases in RNA and protein slopes given the importance of their products for cell growth. Remarkably, essential genes, which share similar mRNA decay rates as other genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7_2">Figure 7 – figure supplement 2E</xref>, Mann-Whittney p-value &gt; 0.01), tended to exhibit superscaling behavior in 1N cells as shown by their enrichment in positive RNA slopes regardless of the selected dataset (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>, Mann-Whittney p-value &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>). This suggests that cells have evolved regulatory mechanisms to minimize dilution of mRNAs encoded by essential genes.</p>

<p>Our data suggest that DNA limitation in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells affects cell growth rate through modulation of downstream transcription and translation activities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and associated figure supplements). The fact that DNA limitation for cellular growth was also observed in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_8">Figure 1 – figure supplement 8</xref>) is significant not only because this bacterium is distantly related to <italic>E. coli</italic>, but also because it has a different pattern of cell wall growth and distinct control mechanisms of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aaron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Frandi and Collier, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lasker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Terrana and Newton, 1975</xref>). This suggests that DNA concentration may be a prevalent growth constraint across bacterial species. It also helps explain why the timing of DNA replication in bacteria is so robustly linked to cell volume across environmental and genetic conditions that affect cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Donachie, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Govers et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sauls et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Si et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparison with studies on eukaryotic cells suggests conservation of gene expression principles across domains of life. For instance, in yeast, it has been shown that the global transcription rate in G1-arrested cells is higher in diploids than haploids of similar sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Swaffer et al., 2023</xref>), consistent with DNA concentration being a limiting factor for transcription. Furthermore, in both yeast and mammalian cells, small G1-arrested cells display higher growth rate (or global RNA or protein synthesis rate) per cell volume than large ones that have exceeded a certain volume (Cadart et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref>; Zatulovskiy et al., 2022). This is likely due to a change in genome concentration rather than a change in cell volume, as the relative growth rate is unaffected in very large cells as long as they undergo a proportional increase in ploidy (Mu et al., 2020).</p>
<p>We found that even a relatively small dilution in DNA concentration—as expected in DNA replication-arrested <italic>E. coli</italic> cells that are still within or close to physiological sizes—results in a reduction of total RNAP activity in both rich and poor media (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3H</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6A-B</xref>). Crude estimations suggest that ≤ 40% DNA dilution is sufficient to negatively affect transcription (total RNAP activity) in M9glyCAAT, whereas the same effect was observed after less than ∼10% dilution in poor media (M9gly or M9ala) (see Materials and Methods). Thus, cells appear to live at the cusp of DNA limitation for transcription, especially under slow growth (nutrient-poor) conditions. This suggests that cells make enough—but not too much—DNA, presumably because DNA replication is a costly process that represents a significant fraction (∼6% in minimal media) of the cellular energy budget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Neidhardt et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>What may be the implications of living close to DNA limitation? While <italic>E. coli</italic> carefully controls its genome concentration across various conditions and growth rates at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Donachie, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Govers et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Si et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), there remains variability in DNA concentration at the single-cell level, with some cells initiating DNA replication at smaller or larger cell volumes than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Si et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Witz et al., 2019</xref>). In future studies, it will be interesting to explore whether this variability contributes to the known growth rate heterogeneity across isogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Lin and Jacobs-Wagner, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). It is also tempting to speculate that changes in genome concentration may, at least in part, contribute to the deviations from exponential growth that have been reported during the division cycle of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>E. coli,</italic> and stalked <italic>C. crescentus</italic> progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Nordholt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Reshes et al., 2008</xref>). More substantial forms of DNA dilution may occur under other circumstances. <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells in freshwater lakes often form long filaments during algal blooms in the summer months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Heinrich et al., 2019</xref>). These filament cells are thought to be the result of a DNA replication arrest in response to the combination of an alkaline pH, a depletion in phosphate, and an excess of ammonium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Heinrich et al., 2019</xref>). Another example is illustrated by the Lyme disease agent <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>. This pathogen, which forms long polyploid cells during exponential growth, experiences a progressive decrease in genome concentration (up to eightfold) in stationary phase laboratory cultures through the gradual loss of genome copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Takacs et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In yeast cells, decreased mRNA turnover combined with increased RNAP II gene occupancy helps mitigate DNA dilution on global transcriptional activities up to a certain (non-physiological) cell volume, beyond which the compensation breaks down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Swaffer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhurinsky et al., 2010</xref>). Such buffering activities, which are consistent with model predictions (Figure 4 – figure supplement 5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Swaffer et al., 2023</xref>), may also be at play in <italic>E. coli</italic> in a growth medium-dependent manner. While genome dilution rapidly impacted transcription in all tested media based on total RNAP activity measurements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3H</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6A-B</xref>), we found that the negative impact on downstream processes— total ribosome activity and cell growth—occurred later (i.e., mostly beyond physiological cell sizes) in M9gly and M9ala (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-F</xref>), in contrast to M9glyCAAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B-C</xref> and 2H). This suggests the existence of mechanisms that compensate for DNA-limited transcription under slow growth such as a decrease in mRNA decay, an increase in ribosome loading, and/or an increase in translation elongation rate. Perhaps such buffering activities are not as effective under nutrient-rich conditions due to the rapid mRNA dilution during fast growth. Testing these hypotheses will require future experimentation.</p>
<p>Another remarkable similarity between bacteria and eukaryotes is the effect of genome concentration on proteome composition. While protein abundance is typically assumed to scale with cell size in bacteria, we found that this is true at the proteome level only when ploidy also scales (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This requirement was also recently shown in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lanz et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2022</xref>). This conservation of scaling principle further highlights the importance of genome concentration in controlling protein expression.</p>
<p>What determines the scaling behavior of proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> is not clear. We found that it largely occurs at the mRNA level (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>), and that short-lived mRNAs are slightly more susceptible to subscaling behavior (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7_2">Figure 7 – figure supplement 2D</xref>). Conversely, the majority of essential genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gerdes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Goodall et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yamazaki et al., 2008</xref>) tended to display superscaling behavior relative to the rest of the genome (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>, Dataset 3). This suggests the existence of regulatory mechanisms that prioritize the expression of essential genes over less important ones when genome concentration becomes limiting for cell growth.</p>
<p>While the scaling of proteins in 1N cells is largely driven by that of mRNAs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>), we found that protein slopes, but not RNA slopes, displayed a slight yet significant positive correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.23, p-value &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>) with <italic>oriC</italic> proximity for genes within 1.35 Mb from <italic>oriC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7_3">Figure 7 – figure supplement 3A-B</xref>). Why and how this occurs is unclear, but it suggests that mRNA-independent mechanisms (i.e., independent of mRNA synthesis or decay) also contribute to protein scaling behavior. At the GO term level, we did not identify any specific trends in proteome changes (Dataset 1). In eukaryotic cells, histones are known to scale in proportion with DNA rather than cell size (Claude et al., 2021; Swaffer et al., 2021; Wiśniewski et al., 2014). As a result, their concentration proportionally decreases (i.e., slope = -1) with growth in G1 phase. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the relative abundance of some nucleoid-associated proteins (H-NS, HU and Dps) decreased with genome dilution, while others (IHF and Fis) displayed superscaling (protein slopes &gt; 0) behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7_4">Figure 7 – figure supplement 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the prevalent use of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the biotechnological world, we hope that our findings will be helpful to future bioengineering studies and growth rate optimization efforts. We show that protein content and cellular growth depend on the ploidy-to-cell volume ratio (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). As such, models of protein expression that take into consideration the DNA concentration and the active number of RNAPs and ribosomes could provide a starting point to identify the parameter space that leads to growth rate improvement. Experimentally, it will be important to determine which specific genes exert the largest growth rate-limiting effect. In this context, the few essential genes with strong subscaling behavior (large negative values of RNA and protein slopes) in 1N cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>, Dataset 3) suggest potential candidates for future studies given the rapid dilution of their mRNAs and proteins relative to other genes.</p>

<p><italic>E. coli</italic> strains were grown at 37°C in M9 minimal media with different supplements: 0.2% glycerol, 0.1% casamino acids, and 1 µg/ml thiamine (M9glyCAAT); 0.2% glycerol (M9gly); or 0.2% L-alanine (M9ala). For microscopy, cells were grown in culture tubes to stationary phase, diluted 10,000-fold, and grown until they reached an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) between 0.05 and 0.2. For imaging, cells were then spotted onto a 1% agarose pad on a glass slide prepared with the appropriate M9 medium and covered by a #1.5 thickness coverslip.</p>
<p>For time-lapse microscopy experiments with the CRISPRi strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Li et al., 2016</xref>), the cells were induced by adding L-arabinose (0.2%) to liquid cultures after which a sample (∼1 µl) was immediately collected and spotted on an agarose pad containing the appropriate growth medium supplemented with 0.2% L-arabinose. This was promptly followed by imaging of individual cells. To determine the 1N status of CRISPRi <italic>oriC</italic> cells, we monitored the last division and number of nucleoids based on HU-mCherry fluorescence. In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, the time point “0 min” refers to the time when cells have reached the 1N status.</p>
<p>For population microscopy experiments with the CRISPRi strains, the cells were induced with 0.2% L-arabinose and allowed to grow in normal conditions until a specific time point (depending on the growth medium and strain) was reached, after which the cells were spotted on an agarose pad containing the appropriate growth medium and 0.2% L-arabinose, and imaged (see information for each experiment in the corresponding Figure). Note that the CRISPRi strains do not metabolize arabinose due to the <italic>araBAD</italic> deletion.</p>
<p>For the TMT-MS experiments, CRISPRi <italic>oriC</italic> (SJ_XTL676) cells were supplemented with 0.2% L-arabinose and allowed to grow in liquid M9glyCAAT cultures at 37°C for 0, 120, 180, 240, and 300 min before harvesting, while CRISPRi <italic>ftsZ</italic> (SJ_XTL229) cells were collected after 0, 60, and 120 min after arabinose addition. For RNA-seq experiments, CRISPRi <italic>oriC</italic> (SJ_XTL676) cells were supplemented with 0.2% L-arabinose and allowed to grow in liquid M9glyCAAT cultures 37°C for 60, 120 200, and 240 min before harvesting.</p>
<p>Strains carrying the <italic>dnaC2</italic> mutation were grown at a permissive temperature of 30°C and then shifted to 37°C to block replication initiation. Transcription inhibition and mRNA depletion were achieved by exposing cells to 200 µg/ml rifampicin for 30 min before spotting cells on a 1% agarose pad containing the appropriate M9 medium and rifampicin concentration. The HaloTag was labeled with Janelia Fluor 549 (JF549) ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Banaz et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, cells were incubated with 2.5 μM of the JF549 ligand for 30 min while shaking, washed 5 times with growth medium, and allowed to recover for several generations (while remaining in exponential phase) prior to imaging.</p>
<p><italic>C. crescentus</italic> strains were grown at 22°C in PYE (2 g/L bacto-peptone, 1 g/L yeast extract, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) supplemented with 0.03% xylose to induce production of the essential protein FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wang et al., 2001</xref>) or DnaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gorbatyuk and Marczynski, 2001</xref>). For microscopy, cells were grown in overnight cultures, then diluted at least 1:10,000 in fresh medium and grown to exponential phase (OD<sub>660</sub> nm &lt; 0.3). To induce cell filamentation by depleting FtsZ or DnaA, xylose was removed from the medium by pelleting cells, washing twice with PYE, and resuspending in fresh PYE. Cultures were then allowed to grow for an additional 30 min to allow ongoing cell division cycles to complete before spotting on 1% agarose pads containing PYE but lacking xylose to deplete FtsZ or DnaA. To estimate the concentration of fluorescently-labeled ribosomes and RNAPs by fluorescence microscopy, cultures were sampled at 0, 4, 8, and sometimes 12 h following xylose depletion with 30 min outgrowth to allow late predivisional cells time to divide before spotting. For timelapse microscopy, new pads were spotted with cells from the original culture at 0, 4, 8, and sometimes 12 h following xylose removal with 30 min outgrowth in a liquid PYE medium.</p>

Then, the two populations were mixed at equal optical densities (OD<sub>600</sub>) and fixed prior to staining using previously described protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kim and Jacobs-Wagner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kim and Vaidya, 2020</xref>). Note that wildtype cells growing exponentially in different media (M9gly or M9glyCAAT) were fixed and stained separately (separate tubes and coverslips but using the exact same washing, pre-hybridization and hybridization buffers).</p>
<p>Pre-hybridization was performed for 2 h at 37°C using a solution that contained 40% formamide, 2x saline-sodium citrate (SSC), 1x vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (VRC) and 0.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Staining was performed for 13 h at 37°C using a solution that contained 500nM EUB338-Cy3 Eubacterial probe (Millipore Sigma, MBD0033), 40% formamide, 2x SSC, 1x VRC, 0.4% (w/v) BSA, 0.4mg/mL <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA, and 10% dextran sulfate. The high probe concentration allowed for the saturation of the 16S rRNA as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hoshino et al., 2008</xref>), which made it possible to compare rRNA concentrations between different strains and media. After staining, the fixed cells were washed five times with a wash solution (50% formamide, 2X SSC) and ten times with 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

<title>Image processing and data analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was done in MATLAB (Mathworks) (MAIN_pop_analysis.m script for epifluorescence snapshots, MAIN_timelapse.m script for timelapse movies, and MAIN_mol_tracking.m script for single-molecule tracking experiments), except for segmentation of phase contrast images, which was done in Python (segmentationRun.py) using a convolutional neural network, the Nested-Unet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wiktor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>), and the analysis of the SYTO RNASelect and RpoC-HaloTag-JF549 epifluorescence (snapshots_analysis_UNET_version_ND2.py class) that was also performed in Python 3.9 (DNA_limitation_python_environment.yml). The Nested-Unet network was trained for our microscopy setup using PyTorch 1.7.0 and NumPY 1.19.2 (trainerWrapper.py) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Harris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Paszke et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Cell area masks from segmentation were linked between time-lapse frames based on maximum overlap (trackCells.m). Two masks linked to the same cell area were considered a cell division event. To estimate the absolute growth rate, the cell area over time was smoothed by a sliding-average window of five data points (time interval 5 min) and the difference in the cell area between consecutive frames was calculated. The relative growth rate was calculated by dividing the absolute growth rate by the cell area. Cell areas were converted into volumes using Oufti’s scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Paintdakhi et al., 2016</xref>). To avoid bias from cells reaching sizes too large to support growth, the time-lapse data for filamenting cells was truncated based on their maximum absolute growth rate.</p>
<p>Fluorescent ParB-mCherry spots were detected by fitting a 2D Gaussian function to raw image data (detectSpots.m). First, the fluorescent image was filtered using a bandpass filter to identify the local maxima. Next, the local maxima were fitted by a Gaussian function and a spot quality score was calculated based on spot intensity and quality of a Gaussian fit (𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 · 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦<sub><italic>f</italic>𝑖𝑡</sub> = 𝜎<sub><italic>f</italic>𝑖𝑡</sub>). The spot score threshold was determined by visual inspection of the training data and was set to remove poor-quality spots from analysis.</p>
<p>The number of HU-mCherry-labeled nucleoid areas was determined using Otsu’s thresholding (multithresh.m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Otsu, 1979</xref>). Minimum and maximum area thresholds for an individual nucleoid were determined by measuring the number of fluorescent spots of ParB protein fusion in HU-labeled nucleoid areas of a strain (CJW7517) carrying a <italic>parS</italic> site from plasmid pMT1 at <italic>ori1</italic> (Figure 1 – supplement 3A). Only cells containing a single nucleoid were considered 1N cells. To measure the total fluorescence intensity of a cell, the median intensity of the area outside the cell areas was subtracted from the fluorescence intensity of each pixel of a cell, and the intensity of all pixels was summed together.</p>
<p>For the SYTO RNASelect, RpoC-HaloTag-JF549, and EUB338 epifluorescence snapshot experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and Figure 4 – supplements 1 and 2), the nucleoid objects were segmented using the <italic>segment_nucleoids</italic> function in the <italic>snapshots_analysis_UNET_version_ND2.py</italic> class. This function combines a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter, an adaptive filter, and a hard threshold to detect the nucleoid boundaries and distinguish between 1N and multi-N cells in the mixed populations. The image filters were applied using the scikit-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Van Der Walt et al., 2014</xref>) and NumPy Python libraries. For the SYTO RNASelect-stained cells, the HU-mCherry fluorescence was used to segment the nucleoid objects. In the EUB338 FISH experiments, the nucleoids were stained with DAPI. For the RpoC-HaloTag-JF549-stained cells, the fluorescence of RpoC-HaloTag-JF549 bound to nucleoids was used to segment the nucleoid objects. The number of segmented nucleoid objects was used to distinguish between 1N (one nucleoid object) and multi-N (two or more nucleoid objects) cells. The classification results were curated manually by visual inspection.</p>
<p>The SYTO RNASelect concentration corresponds to the total fluorescence of the fluorogenic dye within the cell boundaries of the cell mask, divided by the area of the cell mask. Similarly, the RpoC-HaloTag-JF549 and EUB338 concentrations were calculated in arbitrary units.</p>
<p>To ensure that the SYTO RNASelect, the RpoC-HaloTag-JF549, or the EUB338-Cy3 fluorescence was compared for the same distributions of cell areas between the 1N and multi-N cells in the mixed populations, random sampling was performed in each cell area bin using a sample size equal to the smaller cell number between the 1N and multi-N cells (Figure 4 – supplements 1 and 2B). For example, if in each cell area bin, there were 100 1N cells and 500 multi-N cells, 100 cells were randomly sampled from the multi-N population to match the sample size of the 1N population. Bins with less than 25 (for the EUB338 experiments) or 50 (for the RNASelect or the RpoC-HaloTag-JF549 experiments) cells per population across biological replicates were removed from the analysis. This sampling was performed one time to compare the distributions of the SYTO RNASelect, EUB338, and RpoC-HaloTag-JF549 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref> and Figure 4 – supplement 2C-D) concentrations between the 1N and multi-N cells. However, to estimate the average 1N/multi-N SYTO RNASelect, EUB338 or RpoC-HaloTag-JF549 ratio during cell growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and Figure 4 – supplement 2E) multiple samplings (with substitution) were performed for each biological replicate and cell area bin. This allowed us to use all the data while still comparing equal numbers of 1N and multi-N cells per biological replicate and cell area bin. Cell area bins with less than 5 (for the EUB338 experiments) or 10 (for the RNASelect or the RpoC-HaloTag-JF549 experiments) cells per biological replicate were removed from the analysis. Also here, the sample size was set by the smallest population size (1N or multi-N population) and the number of iterations was equal to the difference between the populations multiplied by 10.</p>

<title>Single-molecule tracking analysis</title>
<p>Single-molecule tracking data was analyzed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mäkelä and Sherratt, 2020</xref>). Candidate fluorescent spots were detected using band-pass filtering and an intensity threshold for each frame of the time-lapse sequence. These initial localizations were used as starting positions in phasor spot detection for high-precision localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Martens et al., 2018</xref>). Individual molecules were then tracked in each cell area by linking positions to a trajectory if they appeared in consecutive frames within a distance of 0.8 µm. Cell areas were detected from bright-field images using MicrobeTracker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sliusarenko et al., 2011</xref>). In the case of multiple localizations within the tracking radius, these localizations were omitted from the analysis. Tracking allowed for a single frame disappearance of the molecule within a trajectory due to blinking or missed localization. The mobility of each molecule was determined by calculating an apparent diffusion coefficient, <italic>D<sub>a</sub></italic>, from the stepwise mean-squared displacement (MSD) of the trajectory using:
<disp-formula>

where x(<italic>t</italic>) and y(<italic>t</italic>) indicate the coordinates of the molecule at time <italic>t</italic>, Δ<italic>t</italic> is the frame rate of the camera, and <italic>n</italic> is the total number of the steps in the trajectory. Trajectories with less than 9 displacements were omitted due to the higher uncertainty in <italic>D<sub>a</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>The calculated D<sub>a</sub> values are expected to reflect different dynamic states of molecules. To determine the fraction of molecules in each state, log<sub>10</sub> transformed <italic>D<sub>a</sub></italic> data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) was fitted to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using the expectation-maximization algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bishop, Christopher, 2006</xref>). A mixture of 3 Gaussian distributions with free parameters for mean, SD, and weight of each state were fitted for different conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Additionally, for 1N cells, single-molecule tracking data were binned and fitted as a function of cell area (Figure 2D – supplement 3). To determine the active RNAP or ribosome fraction of a single cell, the GMM was used to determine the state of each molecule from the measured <italic>D<sub>a</sub>,</italic> and the fraction of molecules in the slowest (“active”) state was calculated. Only cells with at least 50 trajectories were considered in the analysis for more accurate quantification. The total quantity of active molecules was estimated by multiplying the measured total fluorescence intensity with the measured active fraction as a function of the cell area.</p>

The labeling reaction was quenched with 8 µL of 5% hydroxylamine for 15 min. Labeled peptides were pooled, acidified to a pH of ∼2 using drops of 10% trifluoroacetic acid, and desalted again with a Sep-Pak 50 mg C18 column as described above. TMT-labeled peptides were pre-fractionated using a Pierce™ High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit. Pre-fractionated peptides were dried using a concentrator and re-suspended in 0.1% formic acid.</p>

<title>LC-MS/MS data acquisition</title>
<p>Pre-fractionated TMT-labeled peptides were analyzed on a Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Thermo EASY-nLC 1200 LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated by capillary reverse phase chromatography on a 25 cm column (75 µm inner diameter, packed with 1.6 µm C18 resin, AUR2-25075C18A, Ionopticks). Electrospray ionization voltage was set to 1550 V. Peptides were introduced into the Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer using a 180 min stepped linear gradient at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The steps of the gradient were as follows: 6–33% buffer B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in 80% acetonitrile) for 145 min, 33-45% buffer B for 15 min, 40-95% buffer B for 5 min, and 90% buffer B for 5 min. Column temperature was maintained at 50°C throughout the procedure. Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for the data acquisition and the instrument was operated in data-dependent mode. Advanced peak detection was disabled. Survey scans were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer (centroid mode) over the range of 380 to 1400 m/z with a mass resolution of 120,000 (at m/z 200). For MS1 (the survey scan), the normalized AGC target (%) was set at 250 and the maximum injection time was set to 100 ms. Selected ions were fragmented by the Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) method with normalized collision energies of 34 and the tandem mass spectra were acquired in the ion trap mass analyzer with the scan rate set to “Rapid”. The isolation window was set to 0.7 m/z. For MS2 (the peptide fragmentation scan), the normalized AGC target (%) and the maximum injection time were set to “standard” and 35 ms, respectively. Repeated sequencing of peptides was kept to a minimum by dynamic exclusion of the sequenced peptides for 30 s. The maximum duty cycle length was set to 3 s. Relative changes in peptide concentration were determined at the level of the MS3 (reporter ion fragmentation scan) by isolating and fragmenting the five most dominant MS2 ion peaks.</p>

<p>All raw files were searched using the Andromeda engine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Thomason, Costantino, and Court 2007</xref>) embedded in MaxQuant (v2.3.1.0) (Cox and Mann, 2008). A Reporter ion MS3 search was conducted using 10plex TMT isobaric labels. Variable modifications included oxidation (M) and protein N-terminal acetylation. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was a fixed modification. The number of modifications per peptide was capped at five. Digestion was set to tryptic (proline-blocked). Database search was conducted using the UniProt proteome Ecoli_UP000000625_83333. The minimum peptide length was seven amino acids.

<title>Proteomics data analysis</title>
<p>Normalization and protein slope calculations were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lanz et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, the relative signal difference between the TMT channels for each peptide was plotted against the normalized cell area for each of the bins of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. For protein detection, we used a minimum of three unique peptide measurements per protein as a threshold. To derive the protein slope values shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, individual peptide measurements were consolidated into a protein level measurement using Python’s groupby.median. Peptides with the same amino acid sequence that were identified as different charge states or in different fractions were considered independent measurements. We summarized the size scaling behavior of individual proteins as a slope value derived from a regression. Each protein slope value was based on the behavior of all detected peptides.</p>
<p>For a given protein, we calculated the cell size-dependent slope as follows:</p>
<p>y<sub>i</sub> = relative signal in the i<sup>th</sup> TMT channel (median of all corresponding peptides in this channel)</p>
<p>x<sub>i</sub> = normalized cell size in the i<sup>th</sup> TMT channel (cell area for a given timepoint / mean cell area for the experiment)</p>
<p>The protein slope value was determined from a linear fit to the log-transformed data using the equation:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="582181v2_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Variables were log-transformed so that a slope of 1 corresponds to an increase in protein concentration that is proportional to the increase in cell volume, and a slope of -1 corresponds to 1/volume dilution. Pearson correlation coefficients and p values were calculated using SciPy’s pearsonr module in Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>). The results were reproducible across the two replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5_1">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<p>MS1-level peptide ion intensities from experiment #1 were used to estimate the relative protein abundance. For each protein, all peptide intensities were summed together using the “Intensity” column of MaxQuant’s evidence.txt file. To adjust for the fact that larger proteins produce more tryptic peptides, the summed ion intensity for each protein was divided by its amino acid sequence length.</p>

<title>Calculation of distance from <italic>oriC</italic></title>
<p>Gene coordinates were downloaded from EcoCyc database. The midpoint of each coding sequence was used to determine the circular distance (in base pairs) from <italic>oriC</italic> (base pair 3925859 of the total length of 4641652). A script was written to make three distance calculations. First, the direct distance (the midpoint of each gene minus 3,925,859 bp (<italic>oriC</italic>)) was determined. Next, the midpoint coordinate of each gene was subtracted by the total genome length (4,641,652 bp) and then subtracted again by the coordinate of <italic>oriC</italic> (3,925,859 bp). Finally, the midpoint coordinate of each gene was added to the total genome length (4,641,652 bp) and then subtracted by the coordinate of <italic>oriC</italic> (3,925,859 bp). The absolute values of these three calculations were then taken and the minimal values represent the circular distances between <italic>oriC</italic> and each gene.</p>

<p>CRISPRi <italic>oriC</italic> strain (SJ_XTL676) was grown in M9glyCAAT at 37°C and cells were collected 60, 120, 200, and 240 min after addition of 0.2% L-arabinose. Images of cells were acquired at each timepoint to determine cell area, as described above. For each timepoint, the aliquot was spun down, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was flash-frozen<italic>. E. coli</italic> pellets were resuspended in ice cold PBS and mixed with <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells in approximately a 1-to-1 ratio based on OD<sub>600</sub>. <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells were originally included with the intent of using them as a spike-in reference. However, the fraction of final reads obtained from <italic>C. crescentus</italic> transcripts was inconsistent with the initial mixing ratios. In addition, without knowing the exact DNA concentration in each 1N-rich cell sample, this spike-in became purposeless and thus was ignored for analysis. Cells (50 µL) in PBS were mixed with 250 µl TRI Reagent (Zymo Research) and lysed by bead beating on a Fastprep 24 (MPbio). Cell debris were pelleted (14k rpm, 2 min) and the supernatant was recovered. RNA was then extracted using the direct-zol RNA microprep kit (Zymo Research). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was then depleted using the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit for Bacteria (NEB, #E7850) and NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, #E7760) was then used to prepare libraries for paired-end (2x150bp) Illumina sequencing (Novogene).</p>

<p>The RNA slope (i.e., relative transcript concentration vs. cell area) was calculated for each gene as follows.

<title>Estimation of the minimum genome dilution that limits transcription per nutrient condition</title>
<p>The cell area at which the total active RNAPs deviates from the wildtype scaling behavior was estimated to approximate the minimal genome dilution required to limit bulk transcription in cells growing in different media. Deviation in scaling behavior was found to occur at ∼2 μm<sup>2</sup> during fast growth (M9glyCAAT, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>) or at ∼1 μm<sup>2</sup> during slow growth (M9gly or M9ala, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref>). Given such deviations in scaling behavior were observed in cells with a single chromosome copy (i.e., in 1N cells), the minimal limiting concentration is estimated to be, on average, 0.5 chromosome copies per μm<sup>2</sup> in M9glyCAAT or 1 chromosome copy per μm<sup>2</sup> in M9gly or M9ala. Based on estimates described in Appendix 1 (Appendix 1 – Table 1), the average chromosome concentration in wildtype cells is 0.85 chromosome copies per μm<sup>2</sup> for M9glyCAAT, 1.09 chromosome copies per μm<sup>2</sup> for M9gly, and 1.01 chromosome copies per μm<sup>2</sup> for M9ala. This suggests that the genome is already limiting or close to be limiting (within a few percents) in cells growing in M9gly and M9ala while its concentration is ∼40% above the limiting concentration in cells growing M9glyCAAT.</p>

<title>Mathematical model and simulations</title>
<p>Phenomenological model: We developed a phenomenological model to illustrate cell growth dynamics. In our models, the number of mRNAs (<italic>X</italic>) and the number of proteins (<italic>Y</italic>) in the cell are described by the differential equations:
<disp-formula id="eqn1_1">
<graphic xlink:href="582181v2_eqn1_1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<disp-formula id="eqn2_1">

</disp-formula>
<p>In this model, the parameters <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>2</sub> are coefficients defined as
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="582181v2_ueqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Here, <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>RNAP</italic></sub>(<italic>X</italic>, <italic>Y</italic>) is the fraction of active RNA polymerases, <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>𝑖𝑏𝑜</sub>(<italic>X</italic>, <italic>Y</italic>) is the fraction of active ribosomes, and 𝛿 is the mRNA degradation rate. We assumed that the protein degradation is negligible because most bacterial proteins are stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balakrishnan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lin and Amir, 2018</xref>). For the fraction of active RNAPs, we considered two different models (models A and B). In model A, the fraction of active RNAPs was modeled by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582181v2_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. In model B, where we included different states of RNAP and promoter, the expression of <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>RNAP</italic></sub> is more complicated and is described in Appendix 3. Instead of considering a type of Michaelis-Menten (MM) reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Klumpp and Hwa, 2008</xref>), model B is based on the mass action law. For both models A and B, the ribosomes were modeled by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582181v2_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. We used [𝑍] and [<italic>X</italic>] to represent the genome and mRNA concentrations, respectively. We assumed that the cell volume (<italic>V</italic>) and cell area (<italic>A</italic>) are proportional to the protein number <italic>Y</italic>, which is a good approximation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Basan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kubitschek et al., 1984</xref>). While this assumption has not been verified in 1N cells, the concentration of ribosomes, which constitute most of the protein mass, were found to remain constant in these cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Namely, in our model, 𝑉 = 𝑐<italic>Y</italic> and <italic>A</italic> = 𝑐′<italic>Y</italic> with constants 𝑐, 𝑐′. Under balanced growth conditions, [𝑍] was assumed to be constant. For the DNA-limited growth condition (as in 1N cells), we assumed that the genome does not duplicate and is kept at a single copy per cell (𝑍(𝑡) = 1) while the cell volume continue to increase. The details for parameters used in this model are described in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Numerical simulations: To simulate the model for balanced and DNA-limited growths, we first fixed a parameter set based on the literature (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and simulated <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 1</xref> and <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 2</xref> to reach the regime of balanced growth. Under balanced growth, we obtained the balanced growth vector (<italic>X</italic><sup>∗</sup>, <italic>Y</italic><sup>∗</sup>) where <italic>Y</italic><sup>∗</sup> matches the initial protein number reported in the literature (see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Then, using the balanced growth vector as the initial condition, we simulated the balanced growth and DNA-limited growth using different assumptions of genome content 𝑍(𝑡) (described in the previous paragraph). The simulation was performed using the MATLAB built-in function <italic>ode23</italic> with relative and absolute errors of the numerical values to be 10<sup>-4</sup> and 10<sup>-5</sup>, respectively. For each growth condition, we obtained growth trajectories (<italic>X</italic>(𝑡), <italic>Y</italic>(𝑡)), and from <italic>Y</italic>(𝑡), we calculated the cell volume 𝑉(𝑡) and area <italic>A</italic>(𝑡) as described above. For model A, the fraction of active RNAPs was calculated by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582181v2_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, while for model B, it is calculated using a more complicated formula that takes into account RNAP kinetics (see Appendix 3). For both models, the fraction of active ribosomes was calculated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="582181v2_inline8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Parameter fitting: For either model A or B, we fitted our simulation results to all the experimental data including growth curves, the fraction of active RNAPs, and the fraction of active ribosomes for 1N and WT or multi-N cells (six datasets in total); see Appendix 2 for the initial parameter estimation and Appendix 4 for the optimization procedure details. The optimized parameter sets (see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were used for the numerical simulations shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. Note that the optimized parameter set remained within the realistic range for cellular physiology (see Appendix 4 — figure 1 for comparison between original and optimized parameters).</p>

<p>The simulated relative growth rate for increasing cell area considering different levels of cell area over-estimation (0 to 0.2 μm<sup>2</sup>) and a constant relative growth rate of 0.0014 1/min. In the absence of an area overestimation (0 μm<sup>2</sup>), the theoretical relative growth rate remains constant as the cell area increases, consistent with exponential growth. When a constant overestimated area is added the relative growth rate scales non-linearly with the cell area. This non-linear increase in the relative growth rate estimation may be confused with super-exponential growth, but it is in fact the result of cell area overestimation during cell segmentation in the phase contrast channel.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> work by Mäkelä et al. presents <bold>compelling</bold> experimental evidence supported by a theoretical model that the amount of chromosomal DNA can become limiting for the total rate of mRNA transcription and consequently protein production in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. The work is based on a mutant that allows inhibition of DNA replication while following growth at the single-cell level due to cell filamentation. The work significantly advances our understanding of growth and of the central dogma, and will be of considerable interest within both systems biology and microbial physiology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Mäkelä et al. presents compelling experimental evidence that the amount of chromosomal DNA can become limiting for the total rate of mRNA transcription and consequently protein production in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that upon inhibition of DNA replication the rate of RNA transcription and the single-cell growth rate continuously decrease, the latter in direct proportion to the concentration of active ribosomes, as measured indirectly by single-particle tracking. The decrease of ribosomal activity with filamentation is likely caused by a decrease of the concentration of mRNAs, as suggested by an observed plateau of the total number of active RNA polymerases. These observations are compatible with the hypothesis that DNA limits the total rate of transcription and thus, indirectly, translation.</p>
<p>The authors also demonstrate that the decrease of RNAp activity is independent of two candidate stress response pathways, the SOS stress response and the stringent response, as well as an anti-sigma factor previously implicated in variations of RNAp activity upon variations of nutrient sources.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the reduction of growth rate is observed soon after the inhibition of DNA replication, suggesting that the amount of DNA in wild-type cells is tuned to provide just as much substrate for RNA polymerase as needed to saturate most ribosomes with mRNAs. While previous studies of bacterial growth have most often focused on ribosomes and metabolic proteins, this study provides important evidence that chromosomal DNA has a previously underestimated important and potentially rate-limiting role for growth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This article links the growth of single cells to the amount of DNA, the number of active ribosomes and to the number of RNA polymerases, combining quantitative experiments with theory. The correlations observed during depletion of DNA, notably in M9gluCAA medium, are compelling and point towards a limiting role of DNA for transcription and subsequently for protein production soon after reduction of the amount of DNA in the cell. The article also contains a theoretical model of transcription-translation that contains a Michaelis-Menten type dependency of transcription on DNA availability and is fit to the data.</p>
<p>At a technical level, single-cell growth experiments and single-particle tracking experiments are well described, suggesting that different diffusive states of molecules represent different states of RNAp/ribosome activities, which reflect the reduction of growth.</p>
<p>Apart from correlations in DNA-deplete cells, the article also investigates the role of candidate stress response pathways for reduced transcription, demonstrating that neither the SOS nor the stringent response are responsible for the reduced rate of growth. Equally, the anti-sigma factor Rsd recently described for its role in controlling RNA polymerase activity in nutrient-poor growth media, seems also not involved according to mass-spec data. While other (unknown) pathways might still be involved in reducing the number of active RNA polymerases, the proposed hypothesis of the DNA substrate itself being limiting for the total rate of transcription is appealing.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors confirm the reduction of growth in the distant Caulobacter crescentus, which lacks overlapping rounds of replication and could thus have shown a different dependency on DNA concentration.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study has no apparent weaknesses after review.</p>

<p>In this work, the authors uncovered the effects of DNA dilution on E. coli, including a decrease in growth rate and a significant change in proteome composition. The authors demonstrated that the decline in growth rate is due to the reduction of active ribosomes and active RNA polymerases because of the limited DNA copy numbers. They further showed that the change in the DNA-to-volume ratio leads to concentration changes in almost 60% of proteins, and these changes mainly stem from the change in the mRNA levels.</p>

<p>Mäkelä et al. here investigate genome concentration as a limiting factor on growth. Previous work has identified key roles for transcription (RNA polymerase) and translation (ribosomes) as limiting factors on growth, which enable an exponential increase in cell mass. While a potential limiting role of genome concentration under certain conditions has been explored theoretically, Mäkelä et al. here present direct evidence that when replication is inhibited, genome concentration emerges as a limiting factor.</p>
<p>A major strength of this paper is the diligent and compelling combination of experiment and modeling used to address this core question. The use of origin- and ftsZ-targeted CRISPRi is a very nice approach that enables dissection of the specific effects of limiting genome dosage in the context of a growing cytoplasm. While it might be expected that genome concentration eventually becomes a limiting factor, what is surprising and novel here is that this happens very rapidly, with growth transitioning even for cells within the normal length distribution for E. coli. Fundamentally, it demonstrates the fine balance of bacterial physiology, where the concentration of the genome itself (at least under rapid growth conditions) is no higher than it needs to be. A further surprising finding of this study is that susceptibility to this genome-limiting effect is felt differently by different genes, with unstable transcripts more affected and rRNA and many essential genes being more robust to it.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the authors do not identify a &quot;smoking gun&quot; - a gene or small number of genes that mediate the effects of genome concentration-dependent growth limitation. However, what they do achieve is to develop plausible criteria for identifying such a gene - through investigating essential genes that decrease in their abundance more rapidly than others.</p>
<p>Overall, this study provides a fundamental contribution to bacterial physiology by illuminating the relationship between DNA, mRNA, and protein in determining growth rate. While coarse-grained, the work invites exciting questions about how the composition of major cellular components is fine-tuned to a cell's needs and which specific gene products mediate this connection. The work also suggests the presence of buffering mechanisms that allow essential proteins such as RNA polymerase to be robust to fluctuations in genome concentration, which is an exciting area for future exploration. This work has implications not only for biotechnology, as the authors discuss, but potentially also for our understanding of how DNA-targeted antibiotics limit bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>Nothing left to add - the authors did a fantastic job addressing my points. In some ways doing so opened up even more interesting questions, but I happily accept that those are best left to future investigations.</p>

<p>Thank you for the excellent summary of our work.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This article links the growth of single cells to the amount of DNA, the number of active ribosomes and to the number of RNA polymerases, combining quantitative experiments with theory. The correlations observed during depletion of DNA, notably in M9gluCAA medium, are compelling and point towards a limiting role of DNA for transcription and subsequently for protein production soon after reduction of the amount of DNA in the cell. The article also contains a theoretical model of transcription-translation that contains a Michaelis-Menten type dependency of transcription on DNA availability and is fit to the data. While the model fits well with the continuous reduction of relative growth rate in rich medium (M9gluCAA), the behavior in minimal media without casamino acids is a bit less clear (see comments below).</p>
<p>At a technical level, single-cell growth experiments and single-particle tracking experiments are well described, suggesting that different diffusive states of molecules represent different states of RNAp/ribosome activities, which reflect the reduction of growth. However, I still have a few points about the interpretation of the data and the measured fractions of active ribosomes (see below).</p>
<p>Apart from correlations in DNA-deplete cells, the article also investigates the role of candidate stress response pathways for reduced transcription, demonstrating that neither the SOS nor the stringent response are responsible for the reduced rate of growth.

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a range of points that should be clarified or addressed, either by additional experiments/analyses or by explanations or clear disclaimers.</p>
<p>First, the continuous reduction of growth rate upon arrest of DNA replication initiation observed in rich growth medium (M9gluCAA) is not equally observed in poor media. Instead, the relative growth rate is immediately/quickly reduced by about 10-20% and then maintained for long times, as if the arrest of replication initiation had an immediate effect but would then not lead to saturation of the DNA substrate. In particular, the long plateau of a constant relative growth rate in M9ala is difficult to reconcile with the model fit in Fig 4S2. Is it possible that DNA is not limiting in poor media (at least not for the cell sizes studied here) while replication arrest still elicits a reduction of growth rate in a different way? Might this have something to do with the naturally much higher oscillations of DNA concentration in minimal medium?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that there are interesting differences between nutrient-rich and -poor conditions. They were originally noted in the discussion, but we understand how our original presentation made it confusing. We reorganized the text and figures to better explain our results and interpretations. In the revised manuscript, the data related to the poor media are now presented separately (new Figure 6) from the data related to the rich medium (Figures 1-3).  The total RNAP activity (abundance x active fraction) is significantly reduced in poor media (Figure 6A-B) similarly to rich medium (Figure 3H). Thus, DNA is limiting for transcription across conditions. However, the total ribosome activity in poor media (Figure 6C-D) and thus the growth rate (Figure 6EF) was less affected in comparison to rich media (Figure 2H and 1C). Our interpretation of these results is that while DNA is limiting for transcription in all tested nutrient conditions (as shown by the total active RNAP data), post-transcriptional buffering activities compensate for the reduction in transcription in poor media, thereby maintaining a better scaling of growth rates under DNA limitation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors argue that DNA becomes limiting in the range of physiological cell sizes, in particular for M9glCAA (Fig. 1BC). It would be helpful to know by how much (fold-change) the DNA concentration is reduced below wild-type (or multi-N) levels at t=0 in Fig 1B and how DNA concentration decays with time or cell area, to get a sense by how many-fold DNA is essentially 'overexpressed/overprovided' in wild-type cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide crude estimates in the Discussion section. The revised text reads: “Crude estimations suggest that ≤ 40% DNA dilution is sufficient to negatively affect transcription (total RNAP activity) in M9glyCAAT, whereas the same effect was observed after less than 10% dilution in nutrient-poor media (M9gly or M9ala) (see Materials and Methods).” We obtained these numbers based on calculations and estimates described in the Materials and Methods section and Appendix 1 (Appendix 1 – Table 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fig. 2: The distribution of diffusion coefficients of RpsB is fit to Gaussians on the log scale. Is this based on a model or on previous work or simply an empirical fit to the data? An exact analytical model for the distribution of diffusion constants can be found in the tool anaDDA by Vink, ..., Hohlbein Biophys J 2020. Alternatively, distributions of displacements are expressed analytically in other tools (e.g., in SpotOn).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We use an empirical fit of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of three states to the data and extract the fractions of molecules in each state. This avoids making too many assumptions on the underlying processes, e.g. a Markovian system with Brownian diffusion. The model in anaDDA (Vink et al.) is currently limited to two-transitioning states with a maximal step number of 8 steps per track for a computationally efficient solution (longer tracks are truncated). Using a short subset of the trajectories is less accurate than using the entire trajectory and because of this, we consider full tracks with at least 9 displacements. Meanwhile, Spot-On supports a three-state model but it is still based on a semi-analytical model with a pre-calculated library of parameters created by fitting of simulated data. Neither of these models considers the effect of cell confinement, which plays a major role in single-molecule diffusion in small-sized cells such as bacteria. For these reasons, we opted to use an empirical fit to the data. We note that the fractions of active ribosomes in WT cells, which we extracted from these diffusion measurements, are consistent with the range of estimates obtained by others using similar or different approaches (Forchhammer and Lindhal 1971; Mohapatra and Weisshaar, 2018; Sanamrad et al., 2014).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The estimated fraction of active ribosomes in wild-type cells shows a very strong reduction with decreasing growth rate (down from 75% to 30%), twice as strong as measured in bulk experiments (Dai et al Nat Microbiology 2016; decrease from 90% to 60% for the same growth rate range) and probably incompatible with measurements of growth rate, ribosome concentrations, and almost constant translation elongation rate in this regime of growth rates. Might the different diffusive fractions of RpsB not represent active/inactive ribosomes? See also the problem of quantification above. The authors should explain and compare their results to previous work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our measured range is somewhat larger than the estimated range from Dai et al, 2016. However, they use different media, strains, and growth conditions. We also note that Dai et al did not make actual measurements of the active ribosome fraction. Instead, they calculate the “active ribosome equivalent” based on a model that includes growth rate, protein synthesis rate, RNA/protein abundance, and the total number of amino acids in all proteins in the cell. Importantly, our measurements show the same overall trend (a ~30% decrease) as Dai et al, 2016. Furthermore, our results are within the range of previous experimental estimates from ribosome profiling (Forchhammer and Lindhal 1971) or single-ribosome tracking (Mohapatra and Weisshaar, 2018; Sanamrad et al., 2014). We clarified this point in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To measure the reduction of mRNA transcripts in the cell, the authors rely on the fluorescent dye SYTO RNAselect. They argue that 70% of the dye signal represents mRNA. The argument is based on the previously observed reduction of the total signal by 70% upon treatment with rifampicin, an RNA polymerase inhibitor (Bakshi et al 2014). The idea here is presumably that mRNA should undergo rapid degradation upon rif treatment while rRNA or tRNA are stable. However, work from Hamouche et al. RNA (2021) 27:946 demonstrates that rifampicin treatment also leads to a rapid degradation of rRNA. Furthermore, the timescale of fluorescent-signal decay in the paper by Bakshi et al. (half life about 10min) is not compatible with the previously reported rapid decay of mRNA (24min) but rather compatible with the slower, still somewhat rapid, decay of rRNA reported by Hamouche et al.. A bulk method to measure total mRNA as in the cited Balakrishnan et al. (Science 2022) would thus be a preferred method to quantify mRNA. Alternatively, the authors could also test whether the mass contribution of total RNA remains constant, which would suggest that rRNA decay does not contribute to signal loss. However, since rRNA dominates total RNA, this measurement requires high accuracy. The authors might thus tone down their conclusions on mRNA concentration changes while still highlighting the compelling data on RNAp diffusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing the Hamouche et al 2021 paper to our attention. To address this potential issue, we have performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) microscopy using a 16S rRNA probe (EUB338) to quantify rRNA concentration in 1N cells. We found that the rRNA signal only slightly decreases with cell size (i.e., genome dilution) compared to the RNASelect signal (e.g., a ~5% decrease for rRNA signal vs. 50% for RNASelect for a cell size range of 4 to 10 µm2). We have revised the text and added a figure to include the new rRNA FISH data (Figure 4). In addition, as a control, we validated our rRNA FISH method by comparing the intracellular concentration of 16S rRNA in poor vs. rich media (new Figure 4 – Figure supplement 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The proteomics experiments are a great addition to the single-cell studies, and the correlations between distance from ori and protein abundance is compelling. However, I was missing a different test, the authors might have already done but not put in the manuscript: If DNA is indeed limiting the initiation of transcription, genes that are already highly transcribed in non-perturbed conditions might saturate fastest upon replication inhibition, while genes rarely transcribed should have no problem to accommodate additional RNA polymerases. One might thus want to test, whether the (unperturbed) transcription initiation rate is a predictor of changes in protein composition. This is just a suggestion the authors may also ignore, but since it is an easy analysis, I chose to mention it here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not find any correlation when we examined the potential relation between RNA slopes and mRNA abundance (from our first CRISPRi <italic>oriC</italic> time point) or the transcription initiation rate (from Balakrishnan et al., 2022, PMID: 36480614) across genes. These new plots are presented in Figure 7 – Figure supplement 2B. In contrast, we found a small but significant correlation between RNA slopes and mRNA decay rates (from Balakrishnan et al., 2022, PMID: 36480614), specifically for genes with short mRNA lifetimes (new Figure 7F). This effect is consistent with our model prediction (Figure 5 – Figure supplement 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Related to the proteomics, in l. 380 the authors write that the reduced expression close to the ori might reflect a gene-dosage compensatory mechanism. I don't understand this argument. Can the authors add a sentence to explain their hypothesis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. While performing additional analyses for the revisions, we realized that while the proteins encoded by genes close to <italic>oriC</italic> tend to display subscaling behavior, this is not true at the mRNA level (new Figure 7 – Figure supplement 3B). In light of this result, we no longer have a hypothesis for the observed negative correlation at the protein level (originally Figure 5D, now Figure 7 – Figure supplement 3A). The text was revised accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Fig. 1E the authors show evidence that growth rate increases with cell length/area. While this is not a main point of the paper it might be cited by others in the future. There are two possible artifacts that could influence this experiment: a) segmentation: an overestimation of the physical length of the cell based on phase-contrast images (e.g., 200 nm would cause a 10% error in the relative rate of 2 um cells, but not of longer cells). b) timedependent changes of growth rate, e.g., due to change from liquid to solid or other perturbations. To test for the latter, one could measure growth rate as a function of time, restricting the analysis to short or long cells, or measuring growth rate for short/long cells at selected time points. For the former, I recommend comparison of phase-contrast segmentation with FM4-64-stained cell boundaries.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer notes, the small increase in relative growth was just a minor observation that does not affect our story whether it is biologically meaningful or the result of a technical artefact. But we agree with the reviewer that others might cite it in future works and thus should be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>An artefact associated with time-dependent changes (e.g. changing from liquid cultures to more solid agarose pads) is unlikely for two reasons. 1. We show that varying the time that cells spend on agarose pads relative to liquid cultures does not affect the cell size-dependent growth rate results (Figure 1 – supplement 5A). 2. We show that the growth rate is stable from the beginning of the time-lapse with no transient effects upon cell placement on agarose pads for imaging (Figure 1 – supplement 1). These results were described in the Methods section where they could easily be missed. We revised the text to discuss these controls more prominently in the Results section.</p>
<p>As for cell segmentation, we have run simulations and agree with the reviewer that a small overestimation of cell area (which is possible with any cell segmentation methods including ours) could lead to a small increase in relative growth with increasing cell areas (new Figure 1 – Figure supplement 3). Since the finding is not important to our story, we simply revised the text and added the simulation results to alert the readers to the possibility that the observation may be due to a small cell segmentation bias.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One limitation of the study is that genome concentration is largely treated as a single commodity. While this facilitates their modeling approach, one would expect that the growth phenotypes observed arise due to copy number limitation in a relatively small number of rate-limiting genes. The authors do report shifts in the composition of both the proteome and the transcriptome in response to replication inhibition, but while they report a positional effect of distance from the replication origin (reflecting loss of high-copy, origin-proximal genes), other factors shaping compositional shifts and their functional effects on growth are not extensively explored. This is particularly true for ribosomal RNA itself, which the authors assume to grow proportionately with protein. More generally, understanding which genes exert the greatest copy number-dependent influence on growth may aid both efforts to enhance (biotechnology) and inhibit (infection) bacterial growth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree but feel that identifying the specific limiting genes is beyond the scope of the study. This said, we carried out additional experiments and analyses to address the reviewer’s comment and identify potential contributing factors and limiting gene candidates. First, we examined the intracellular concentration of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) by rRNA FISH microscopy and found that it decays much slower than the bulk of mRNAs as measured using RNASelect staining (new Figure 4 and Figure 4 – Figure supplements 1 and 3). We found that the rRNA signal is far more stable in 1N cells than the RNASelect signal, the former decreasing by only ~5% versus ~50% for the later in response to the same range of genome dilution (Figure 4C).  Second,  we carried out new correlation analyses between our proteomic/transcriptomic datasets and published genome-wide datasets that report various variables under unperturbed conditions (e.g., mRNA abundance, mRNA degradation rates, fitness cost, transcription initiation rates, essentiality for viability); see new Figure 7E-G and Figure 7 – Figure supplement 2. In the process, we found that genes essential for viability tend, on average, to display superscaling behavior (Figure 7G). This suggests that cells have evolved mechanisms that prioritize expression of essential genes over nonessential ones during DNA-limited growth. Furthermore, this analysis identified a small number of essential genes that display strong negative RNA slopes (Figure 7C, Datasets 1 and 2), indicating that the concentration of their mRNA decreases rapidly relative to the rest of the transcriptome upon genome dilution. These essential genes with strong subscaling behavior are candidates for being growth-limiting.</p>

<p>Overall, this study provides a fundamental contribution to bacterial physiology by illuminating the relationship between DNA, mRNA, and protein in determining growth rate. While coarse-grained, the work invites exciting questions about how the composition of major cellular components is fine-tuned to a cell's needs and which specific gene products mediate this connection. This work has implications not only for biotechnology, as the authors discuss, but potentially also for our understanding of how DNA-targeted antibiotics limit bacterial growth.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Below are my comments.</p>
<p>(1) I noticed that a paper by Li et al. on biorxiv has found similar results as this work (&quot;Scaling between DNA and cell size governs bacterial growth homeostasis and resource allocation,&quot; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.12.468234">https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.12.468234)</ext-link>, including the linear growth of E. coli when the DNA concentration is low. This relevant reference was not cited or discussed in the current manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that authors should cite and discuss relevant peer-reviewed literature. But broadly speaking, we feel that extending this responsibility to all preprints (and by extension any online material) that have not been reviewed is a bit dangerous. It would effectively legitimize unreviewed claims and risk their propagation in future publications. We think that while imperfect, the peer-reviewing process still plays an important role.</p>
<p>Regarding the specific 2021 preprint that the reviewer pointed out, we think that the presented growth rate data are quite noisy and that the experiments lack a critical control (multi-N cells), making interpretation difficult. Their report that plasmid-borne expression is enhanced when DNA is severely diluted is certainly interesting and makes sense in light of our measurements that the activities, but not the concentrations, of RNA polymerases and ribosomes are reduced in 1N cells. However, we do not know why this preprint has not yet been published since 2021. There could be many possible reasons for this. Therefore, we feel that it is safer to limit our discussion to peer-reviewed literature.</p>

<p>(2) I think the kinetic Model B in the Appendix has been studied in previous works, such as Klump &amp; Hwa, PNAS 2008, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0804953105">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0804953105</ext-link></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, Klumpp &amp; Hwa 2008 modeled the kinetics of RNA polymerase and promoter association prior to our study. But there is a difference between their model and ours. Their model is based on Michaelis Menten-type (MM) functions in which the RNAP is analogous to the “substrate” and the promoter to the “enzyme” in the MM equation. In contrast, our model uses functions based on the law of mass action (instead of MMtype of function). We have revised the text, included the Klumpp &amp; Hwa 2008 reference, and revised the Materials &amp; Methods section to clarify these points.</p>

<p>(3) On lines 284-285, if I understand correctly, the fractions of active RNAPs and active ribosomes are relative to the total protein number. It would be helpful if the authors could mention this explicitly to avoid confusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The fractions of active RNAPs and active ribosomes are expressed as the percentage of the total RNAPs and ribosomes. We have revised the text to be more explicit. Thank you.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) On line 835, I am not sure what the bulk transcription/translation rate means. I guess it is the maximum transcription/translation rate if all RNAPs/ribosomes are working according to Eq. (1,2). It would be helpful if the authors could explain the meaning of r_1 and r_2 more explicitly.</p>

<p>Our apology for the lack of clarity. We have added the following equations:</p>

<p>(5) Regarding the changes in protein concentrations due to genome dilution, a recent theoretical paper showed that it may come from the heterogeneity in promoter strengths (Wang &amp; Lin, Nature Communications 2021).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the Wang and Lin model, the heterogeneity in promoter strength predicts that the “mRNA production rate equivalent”, which is the mRNA abundance multiplied by the mRNA decay rate, will correlate the RNA slopes. However, we found these two variables to be uncorrelated (see below, The Spearman correlation coefficient ρ was 0.02 with a p-value of 0.24, indicating non-significance (NS).</p>

<p>, 2022, PMID: 36480614, expressed in transcript counts per minute) does not correlate (Spearman correlation’s p-value = 0.24) with the RNA slope in 1N-rich cells.  Data from 2570 genes are shown (grey markers, Gaussian kernel density estimation - KDE), and their binned statistics (mean +/- SEM, ~280 genes per bin, orange markers).</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition, we found no significant correlation between RNA slopes and mRNA abundance or transcription initiation rate. These plots are now included in Figure 7E and Figure 7 –Figure supplement 2B. Thus, the promoter strength does not appear to be a predictor of the RNA (and protein) scaling behavior under DNA limitation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>One general area that could be developed further is analysis of changes in the proteome/transcriptome composition, given that there may be specific clues here as to the phenotypic effects of genome concentration limitation. Specifically:</p>
<p>• In Figure 5D, the authors demonstrate an effect of origin distance on sensitivity to replication inhibition, presumably as a copy number effect. However, the authors note that the effect was only slight and postulated a compensatory mechanism. Due to the stability of proteins, one should expect relatively small effects - even if synthesis of a protein stopped completely, its concentration would only decrease twofold with a doubling of cell area (slope = -1, if I'm interpreting things correctly). It would be helpful to display the same information shown in Figure 5D at the mRNA level, since I would anticipate that higher mRNA turnover rates mean that effects on transcription rate should be felt more rapidly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To our surprise, we found that there is no correlation between gene location relative to the origin and RNA slope across genes. This suggests that the observed correlation between gene location and protein slopes does not occur at the mRNA level. Given that we do not have an explanation for the underlying mechanism, we decided to present these data (the original data in Figure 5D and the new data for the RNA slope) in a supplementary figure (Figure 7 – Figure supplement 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Related to this, did the authors see any other general trends? For example, do highly expressed genes hit saturation faster, making them more sensitive to limited genome concentration?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We found that the RNA slopes do not correlate with mRNA abundance or transcription initiation rates. However, they do correlate with mRNA decay. That is, short-lived mRNAs tend to have negative RNA slopes. The new analyses have been added as Figure 7E-F and Figure 7 – Figure supplement 2B. The text has been revised to incorporate this information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Presumably loss of growth is primarily driven by a subset of genes whose copy number becomes limiting. Previously, it has been reported that there is a wide variety among &quot;essential&quot; genes in their expression-fitness relationship - i.e. how much of a reduction in expression you need before growth is reduced (e.g. PMID 33080209). It would be interesting to explore the shifts in proteome/transcriptome composition to see whether any genes particularly affected by restricted genome concentration are also especially sensitive to reduced expression - overlap in these datasets may reveal which genes drive the loss of growth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very interesting idea – thank you! We did not find a correlation between the protein/RNA slope and the relative gene fitness as previously calculated (PMID 33080209), as shown below.</p>

<p>, 2020, PMID: 33080209, median fitness from the highest sgRNA activity bin) plotted versus the gene-specific RNA and protein slopes that we measured in 1Nrich cells after CRISPRi <italic>oriC</italic> induction. More than 260 essential genes are shown (262 RNA slopes and 270 protein slopes, grey markers), and their binned statistics (mean +/- SEM, 43-45 essential genes per bin, orange markers). The spearman correlations (ρ) with p-values above 10-3 are considered not significant (NS). In our analyses, we only considered correlations significant if they have a Spearman correlation p-value below 10-10.</p>

<p>However, while doing this suggested analysis, we noticed that the essential genes that were included in the forementioned study have RNA slopes above zero on average. This led us to compare the RNA slope distributions of essential genes relative to all genes (now included in Figure 7G). We found that they tend to display superscaling behavior (positive RNA slopes), suggesting the existence of regulatory mechanisms that prioritize the expression of essential genes over less important ones when genome concentration becomes limiting for growth.  The text has been revised to include this new information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Other suggestions:</p>
<p>• In Figure 3 the authors report that total RNAP concentration increases with increasing cytoplasmic volume. This is in itself an interesting finding as it may imply a compensatory mechanism - can the authors offer an explanation for this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not have a straightforward explanation. But we agree that it is very interesting and should be investigated in future studies given that this superscaling behavior is common among essential genes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• The explanation of the modeling within the main text could be improved. Specifically, equations 1 and 2, as well as a discussion of models A and B (lines 290-301), do not explicitly relate DNA concentration to downstream effects. The authors provide the key information in Appendix 1, but for a general reader, it would be helpful to provide some intuition within the main text about how genome concentration influences transcription rate (i.e. via 𝛼RNAP).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. We have added information that hopefully improves clarity.</p>
