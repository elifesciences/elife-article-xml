<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Microglia are brain-resident macrophages playing pivotal roles in CNS development and homeostasis. Yet, the cellular and molecular basis governing microglia maintenance remains largely unknown. Here, via utilizing a visible conditional knockout allele of <italic>pu.1</italic> gene (the master regulator for microglia/macrophage lineage development) to generate mosaic microglia populations in adult zebrafish, we show that while <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia are immediate viable, they are less competitive and chronically eliminated through Tp53-mediated cell competition. Interestingly, when conditionally inactivating Pu.1 in adult <italic>spi-b</italic> (the orthologue of mouse <italic>Spi-b</italic>) null mutants, microglia are rapidly depleted via apoptosis, suggesting that Pu.1 and Spi-b regulate microglia maintenance in a dosage-dependent manner. The dosage-dependent regulation of microglia maintenance by PU.1 is evolutionarily conserved in mice, as shown by conditionally inactivating single and both <italic>Pu.1</italic> alleles in microglia respectively. Collectively, our study reveals the conserved cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling microglia turnover and maintenance in teleost and mammals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microglia, the crucial immune cells residing in the central nervous system (CNS), have a profound impact on the maintenance of CNS homeostasis, as they not only function as scavengers to facilitate the removal of invading pathogens or damaged tissues, but also actively regulate neurogenesis, synaptic pruning and neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Colonna &amp; Butovsky, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gomez-Nicola &amp; Perry, 2015</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that the dysfunction of microglia is closely linked with the occurrence and progression of many neurodegenerative disorders (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Glass, Saijo et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Li, Du et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Prinz, Priller et al., 2011</xref>), thus making it a promising therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of these diseases.</p>
<p>In mice, fate-mapping methods revealed that unlike other glia cells with neuroectoderm origin, microglia in adult originate from yolk-sac (YS) derived primitive macrophages, which colonize the developing brain rudiment during early embryogenesis (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Ginhoux, Greter et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Schulz, Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2012</xref>). Whether microglia in adult mammals were contributed by monocyte-derived microglia precursors had long been a debate until the establishment of parabiosis assay (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Ajami, Bennett et al., 2007</xref>). It is now well-accepted that under physiological condition microglia in mice are maintained locally by self-renewal throughout the lifespan. In accordance with this concept, microglia population was found to be rapidly reconstituted by resident cells after genetic or pharmacological ablation of microglia (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Bruttger, Karram et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Elmore, Najafi et al., 2014</xref>). However, when estimating the physiological turnover rate of microglia via different methods such as <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine/BrdU/EdU incorporation, Ki67 staining or two photon live imaging, different studies yielded distinct or even contradictory results i.e., the estimated microglia turnover rate ranging from 0.13 to 0.8% (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Askew, Li et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Füger, Hefendehl et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Lawson, Perry et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Tay, Mai et al., 2017</xref>), which indicated that microglia in adult mice (∼2 years lifespan) were either long-lived without replenishment or replenished for several times during the whole lifespan of the animals. Nonetheless, these studies have reached the consensus that in adult mice all microglia have the proliferation capability and there are no putative microglia precursors existing to proliferate asymmetrically and continuously to contribute to microglia pool. Moreover, microglia proliferation had been shown to be spatially and temporally coupled with apoptosis to maintain the homeostasis of their population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Askew et al., 2017</xref>): which indicates that not only proliferating microglia locate near the dying microglia, but also newborn microglia manifest a higher frequency of apoptosis. However, whether this phenomenon is for the quality control of microglia or has any other physiological relevance remained unclear. In addition, as a fraction of newborn microglia underwent apoptosis and did not contribute to microglia homeostasis, previously calculated proliferation rate might potentially over-estimate the true turnover rate of microglia. Collectively, although these studies give some insights into the understanding of microglia turnover and maintenance, our knowledge about the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still limited.</p>
<p>PU.1/SPI1, the founding member of the spleen focus forming virus proviral integration oncogene (SPI) subfamily of the E-twenty six (ETS) family transcription factor, is one of the best-characterized gene governing the development of macrophage lineage (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">McKercher, Torbett et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Scott, Simon et al., 1994</xref>). Disruption of PU.1 in mice causes early lethality of the embryos and complete absence of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McKercher et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 1994</xref>), including microglia in brain (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Kierdorf, Erny et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>PU.1</italic> expression level was found to remain at a high level in microglia after their terminal differentiation (<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">Walton, Gibbons et al., 2000</xref>), implying that PU.1 also regulates the cellular behaviors and functions of microglia in the sophisticated CNS environment. Indeed, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-Seq analysis with microglia cell line BV2 cells revealed thousands of PU.1 targets (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">Satoh, Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, silencing of PU.1 by siRNA in mixed human glial culture led to the reduced viability of microglia and decreased phagocytosis of amyloid-beta (Aβ42) (<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Smith, Gibbons et al., 2013</xref>). However, as a previous study reported that inactivating either 1 copy or 2 copies of PU.1 by fusing PU.1 with cytoplasm-retaining estrogen receptor (ER) had no effect on the viability of alveolar macrophages (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Karpurapu, Wang et al., 2011</xref>), whether PU.1 indeed regulated the survival and maintenance of microglia in the in-vivo conditions remained to be further investigated. Moreover, human SNPs that altered <italic>PU.1</italic> expression level were reported to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Cao, Zhou et al., 2022</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Huang, Marcora et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study showed that conditional inactivation or pharmacological inhibition of PU.1 in AD mouse model ameliorated neuroinflammation, prevented microgliosis and improved cognitive performance (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Ralvenius, Mungenast et al., 2023</xref>). Although reduction of microglia number was considered as a result of the amelioration of neuroinflammation, whether PU.1 directly regulated microglia survival and maintenance to prevent the propagation of neuroinflammation in diseased condition deserved to be carefully revisited. SPI-B, another member in the mammalian SPI subfamily, has been shown to be dispensable for the development of the macrophage lineage (<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Su, Chen et al., 1997</xref>). Yet, its involvement in the regulation of microglia turnover and maintenance remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Owing to the genetic amenability and the feasibility for live-imaging and lineage tracing, zebrafish has been adopted as an ideal model for the study of microglia development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hughes &amp; Appel, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Iyer, Shen et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Peri &amp; Nüsslein-Volhard, 2008</xref>). Zebrafish microglia are highly conserved with their mammalian counterparts in terms of morphology, molecular signatures, development-regulatory genetic networks as well as functions (<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">Xu, Zhu et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">Yu, Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Different from the single origin of mouse microglia, zebrafish microglia were shown to arise from two distinct sources i.e., the rostral blood island (RBI), equivalent of mouse YS for primitive myelopoiesis, and the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) initiation. The RBI microglia colonize the developing brain during early embryogenesis, but are gradually replenished by AGM adult microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Further study revealed that this dynamic shift of microglia pool is controlled by Il34-Csf1ra signaling-dictated cell competition (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">Yu, Kuang et al., 2023</xref>). Yet, when the microglia pool is established in adult zebrafish, the molecular mechanisms underlying their turnover and maintenance remain incompletely understood. Moreover, although Pu.1 (also called Spi1b, Ensembl:ENSDARG00000000767) and its paralogue Spi-b (also called Spi1a, Ensembl:ENSDARG00000067797), the zebrafish orthologues of mammalian PU.1 and SPI-B, were shown to be indispensable for microglia early development of both origins in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Xu et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yu et al., 2017</xref>), their functions in the survival and maintenance of microglia in adult animals have not been established.</p>
<p>In the present study, via the condition knockout strategy to generate mosaic microglia population in adult zebrafish and mice, we revealed that the turnover and maintenance of microglia is evolutionarily conserved and regulated by Pu.1/Spi1 dosage from teleost to mammals.</p>

<title>Adult microglia in zebrafish undergo rapid turnover and random proliferation to replenish and maintain their pool</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that there are two major subtypes of myeloid cells, i.e., <italic>ccl34b.1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> microglia and <italic>ccl34b.1</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup><italic>ccl19a.1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> brain-resident dendritic cells (DCs) in adult zebrafish brain (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Wu, Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">Zhou, Zhao et al., 2023</xref>). To monitor the turnover and maintenance of microglia in adult zebrafish brain, we employed microglia-specific <italic>TgBAC(ccl34b.1:eGFP)</italic> transgenic reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) and performed EdU pulse-chase experiment, a similar strategy with that in mouse to determine microglia turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Askew et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tay et al., 2017</xref>). As a single dose of EdU injection might under-estimate the microglia turnover rate, we intraperitoneally injected EdU into adult <italic>TgBAC(ccl34b.1:eGFP)</italic> fish for either 1, 3 or 5 consecutive days. We then collected the fish brain at 1 day post injection (dpi) for cryosection and co-staining of eGFP, Lcp1 (a pan leukocyte marker expressed in both microglia and DCs), EdU and DAPI, in which ccl34b.1-eGFP<sup>+</sup>Lcp1<sup>+</sup> cells are microglia and ccl34b.1-eGFP<sup>-</sup>Lcp1<sup>+</sup> cells represent DCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Quantification results showed that, while a single dose of EdU pulse labeled 1.892±0.234% microglia, the EdU incorporation rate for microglia after 3 or 5 doses of EdU pulses increased almost linearly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, green bars). Based on these data, the estimated microglia turnover rate (daily) is ∼2.6% (total EdU incorporation rate divided by the times of EdU-pulses) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, green bars). On the other hand, the EdU incorporation rate for the DCs was much lower (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>, red bars), suggesting that the DCs in the brain are relatively steady with a very low turnover rate.</p>

<p>Previously, via the EdU/BrdU dual-pulse assay, Tay et al. have shown that microglia in adult mouse brain proliferate randomly during homeostasis and no putative microglia precursors have been identified accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tay et al., 2017</xref>). To clarify whether there might be putative microglial precursors that continuously proliferate to contribute to microglia turnover in zebrafish, we employed a similar strategy, in which adult wild-type (WT) fish were injected with a single dose of EdU followed with five daily BrdU pulses to determine the BrdU proliferation rate of EdU<sup>+</sup> and EdU<sup>-</sup> microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, upper panel). Quantification result showed that the BrdU incorporation rates were comparable between EdU<sup>+</sup> and EdU<sup>-</sup> microglia pools (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-E</xref>). These data strongly suggest that, similar to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tay et al., 2017</xref>), microglia in adult zebrafish randomly undergo proliferation and there are no well-defined microglial precursors that continuously proliferate to replenish and maintain the microglia pool.</p>

<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying microglia turnover and maintenance, we focused on the Ets family transcription factor PU.1/SPI1, which had been shown to be a master regulator for macrophage/microglia development in fish and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McKercher et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). Because macrophages/microglia development is completely blocked at early development in <italic>pu.1</italic>-null zebrafish mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yu et al., 2017</xref>), we decided to generate a visible <italic>pu.1</italic> conditional knockout allele <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> to study the role of Pu.1 in microglia maintenance via the Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated knock-in method (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and Fig. S1A) (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Li, Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, the knock-in DNA fragment consisted of loxP, <italic>pu.1</italic> exon 4 to 6 followed by the self-cleaving P2A sequence-conjugated eGFP, and a splicing-acceptor site SpA2 followed by the P2A-DsRed. In addition, the 3’ downstream sequence of <italic>pu.1</italic> gene (gray box) was added to the 3’ end of each fluorescent protein to ensure efficient termination of RNA transcription and proper expression of the fluorescent proteins.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic diagrams show the generation of <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele and the principle for <italic>pu.1</italic> visible conditional knockout. Briefly, the donor plasmid, which contains: (1) the sgRNA target sequence in <italic>pu.1</italic> intron 3∼4; (2) the loxP-flanked <italic>pu.1</italic> coding sequence (exon4-6) followed by P2A-eGFP; (3) the splicing acceptor site followed by P2A-DsRed sequence was knocked into the endogenous <italic>pu.1</italic> locus via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to generate <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup>. In principle, the splicing event occurring between E3 and E4 In <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> would produce intact Pu.1 and eGFP concurrently. After Cre-mediated recombination, removal of <italic>pu.1</italic> E4-6 and splicing of P2A-DsRed sequence in <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> allele leads to the disruption of Pu.1 and fluorescent color change. <bold>(B)</bold> Co-staining of anti-eGFP and anti-Pu.1 antibodies on the yolk sac (YS) of 21-hpf <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> embryos. <bold>(C)</bold> Fluorescent imaging of the optic tectum (OT) region of 3-dpf <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(mpeg1:LRLG)</italic> embryos. <bold>(D)</bold> Co-staining of anti-eGFP and anti-Lcp1 antibodies on the midbrain cross section of adult <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> fish. <bold>(E)</bold> Neutral red staining of <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/+</italic></sup> and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup> embryos at 3 dpf. <bold>(F)</bold> Quantification of NR<sup>+</sup> microglia in <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/+</italic></sup> (n=13) and <italic>pu.1</italic> <sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup> (n=9) embryos at 3 dpf. <bold>(G)</bold> Fluorescent imaging of the YS region of 30-hpf <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/CKO</italic></sup> embryos. <bold>(H)</bold> Chromogram of cDNA sequence from wildtype and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> embryos shows the precise splicing of <italic>pu.1</italic> E4 and <italic>P2A-DsRed</italic> cassette to <italic>pu.1</italic> E3. <bold>(I)</bold> Neutral red staining of <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO/+</italic></sup> and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup> embryos at 3 dpf. <bold>(J)</bold> Quantification of NR<sup>+</sup> microglia in <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO/+</italic></sup> (n=8) and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup> embryos at 3 dpf (n=14). n.s. = not significant, p&gt;0.05; ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></caption>

<p>Three different founders were obtained. PCR and deep sequencing analysis of F1 embryos confirmed the correct integration of donor DNA fragment in the <italic>pu.1</italic> locus (Fig. S1B-C). Since the knock-in <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele would generate intact Pu.1 and eGFP concurrently (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), we predicted the expression pattern of eGFP, which presumably represents the expression of the knock-in Pu.1, should completely overlap with the endogenous Pu.1. Indeed, co-staining of eGFP and Pu.1 antibodies revealed a perfect overlap of the eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells and Pu.1<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>+</sup> embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele recapitulates the expression of endogenous <italic>pu.1</italic>. Further studies suggested that <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup><italic>-eGFP</italic> efficiently labels embryonic microglia, and both microglia and DCs in adult, as revealed by the co-localization of <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup><italic>-eGFP</italic> and macrophage-specific reporter line <italic>Tg(mpeg1:LRLG)</italic> at 3 dpf, and by the co-staining of eGFP and Lcp1 antibodies on the brain sections of adult <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/+</italic></sup> fish respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). To further confirm functional intactness of the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele, we crossed the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> fish with the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup> mutants to examine if the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele is capable of rescuing the microglia phenotype. Indeed, quantification of microglia number revealed no difference between the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839/KI</italic></sup> and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839/+</italic></sup> embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), indicating that the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele functionally recapitulates the endogenous <italic>pu.1</italic>.</p>
<p>To test whether the Cre mediated excision occurs correctly in the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele, we injected Cre mRNA into the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> embryos at one-cell stage. The injected embryos were raised to adulthood (<italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> fish) and crossed with the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> fish to generate <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO/KI</italic></sup> fish. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, the Cre-mediated excision should remove the E4-6-P2A-eGFP cassette and allow the proper splicing of the splicing-acceptor site SpA2 and joining of the P2A-DsRed with exon 3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), leading to the induction of DsRed expression. Indeed, fluorescent imaging of the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO/KI</italic></sup> embryos revealed robust DsRed (<italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> allele) signals perfectly overlapping with the eGFP (<italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele) signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>), suggesting the correct DNA excision and RNA splicing in the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> allele. This conclusion was further validated by sequencing analysis of the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> transcripts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Since the endogenous <italic>pu.1</italic> exons were not replaced, but instead they were separated far away from the upstream exons by donor plasmid, we performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis of <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO/CKO</italic></sup> embryos to determine the possible expression of the endogenous <italic>pu.1</italic> exons in <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> allele. The result showed that the relative expression of endogenous <italic>pu.1</italic> exons is around 1∼2% in comparison with that of DsRed expression (Fig. S1D), suggesting that expression of <italic>pu.1</italic> is largely abolished in <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> allele. To phenotypically characterize <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> allele, and to avoid incomplete inactivation of Pu.1 function in downstream microglia tracing experiments, which may occur when using two <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> alleles due to the lower CreER recombination efficiency in zebrafish compared to mice, we outcrossed the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> fish with the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup> null mutants. As anticipated, the development of embryonic microglia was completely blocked in the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>CKO/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup> embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">J</xref>), a phenotype recapitulating the defect of the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup> homozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). These data demonstrate that the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele works very well and serves as a useful tool to explore the role of Pu.1 in adult microglia survival and maintenance.</p>

<title>Pu.1 and Spi-b regulate the turnover and maintenance of microglia in a dosage-dependent manner</title>
<p>To investigate the role of Pu.1 in the survival and maintenance of microglia in adult zebrafish, we crossed the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> fish with the leukocyte-specific <italic>Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> line and the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup> mutants to generate <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/+</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish. We then intraperitoneally injected 3 doses of 4-OHT into these adult fish and collected the brain samples at 2 dpi and 8 dpi for the quantification of microglia number after cryo-section and eGFP/DsRed immuno-staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, upper panel). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> (lower panel), DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells were readily detected in the brains of both <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/+</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish at 8 dpi. Quantification of the number and proportion of DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells at 2 dpi and 8 dpi revealed no difference between <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic></sup>Δ<sup><italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> mutant fish and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/+</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> control siblings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). Similarly, conditional knockout of <italic>pu.1</italic> in embryonic microglia also showed no effect on microglial survival (Figure S2), which contrasts to the elimination of microglia during early development by global knockout of <italic>pu.1</italic> due to Pu.1’s essential role in myeloid lineage specification. In addition, we also found that the number and proportion of microglia (ccl34b.1-eGFP<sup>+</sup> Lcp1<sup>+</sup>) and DCs (ccl34b.1-eGFP<sup>-</sup>Lcp1<sup>+</sup>) were comparable between <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;TgBAC(ccl34b.1:eGFP)</italic> null mutants and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839/+</italic></sup><italic>;TgBAC(ccl34b.1:eGFP)</italic> siblings (Fig. S3). These data suggest that Pu.1 is not required for the survival of microglia and DCs. We reasoned that the survival of <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia is likely attributed to the presence of <italic>spi-b</italic> (the paralogue of <italic>pu.1</italic> in zebrafish, also called <italic>spi1a</italic>), which has been shown to play a compensatory role for Pu.1 in microglia early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, conditional inactivation of Pu.1 in the <italic>spi-b</italic><sup>Δ<italic>232</italic>/Δ<italic>232</italic></sup> null mutants led to a rapid depletion of microglia by apoptosis within several days (Fig. S4 and Fig. S5), indicating that Pu.1 and Spi-b act redundantly to regulate the survival of microglia.</p>

<p>To further investigate whether Pu.1-deficiency might have a long-term effect on the turnover and maintenance of microglia, we traced <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells to 1 month post injection (mpi), and 3 mpi after conditionally inactivating Pu.1 in adult <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/+</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, upper panel). Intriguingly, we found that the number and proportion of DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells in the midbrains of the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish began to decline at 1 mpi and were further reduced, becoming significantly lower than that in <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/+</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish by 3 mpi (Fig.3E-F). Likewise, the number and proportion of DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells in the retina and spinal cord were also significantly reduced in the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish by 3 mpi (Fig. S6). Since microglia are the major population of the <italic>coro1a</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells in the brain and spinal cord and the exclusive population in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), the reduction of DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells in the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish at 1 mpi and 3 mpi are mainly attributed to the loss of microglia. Based on the amoeboid and ramified morphology, microglia and DCs could be distinguished with about 90% accuracy (Fig. S7A-B). Thus, to further confirm above conclusion, we quantified microglia and DCs separately in 3-mpi <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/+</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish.

<title><italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia in mosaic condition were eliminated by cell competition</title>
<p>Given the fact that <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia are gradually eliminated in mosaic condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-F</xref>), but their number remains relatively normal in <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup> null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yu et al., 2017</xref>), we reasoned that the elimination of the <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia in mosaic condition is likely attributed to the cell competition between <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient DsRed<sup>+</sup> microglia and their neighboring eGFP<sup>+</sup> sibling cells harboring WT <italic>pu.1</italic>. To test this hypothesis, we compared the cell death and proliferation rates of microglia by TUNEL and BrdU incorporation assays in both conditions respectively. To determine the cell death and proliferation rates of <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia in mosaic condition, we treated the adult <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish with 4-OHT to inactivate Pu.1. At 26 dpi, the 4-OHT-treated fish were then injected 5 doses (one dose daily) of BrdU and the brain samples were collected 1 day later for TUNEL and BrdU staining respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Quantification results showed that the percentage of TUNEL<sup>+</sup>DsRed<sup>+</sup> microglia (<italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient cells) in the brains of the <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish was significantly higher than that of TUNEL<sup>+</sup>eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In this assay, the 4-OHT-treated <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/+</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish were included as the control, and as expected, the percentages of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells in the DsRed<sup>+</sup> and eGFP<sup>+</sup> microglia pools in control fish were comparable (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In parallel, we also found that the BrdU incorporation rates of <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia (DsRed<sup>+</sup>) in the 4-OHT-treated <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish was significantly lower than that of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), while the BrdU incorporation rates of DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells and eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the control <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/+</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish was comparable (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These results indicate that conditional inactivation of Pu.1 in adult zebrafish leads to the impairment of cell proliferation and accelerated cell death of microglia in mosaic condition. To estimate the cell death and proliferation rates of microglia in <italic>pu.1</italic>-null mutants, we utilized a similar strategy via pulsing the adult <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839/+</italic></sup><italic>;TgBAC(ccl34b.1:eGFP) or pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;TgBAC(ccl34b.1:eGFP)</italic> fish with 5 doses of BrdU (daily) and collecting the brains samples at 1 day later for TUNEL and BrdU staining respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, the percentage of TUNEL<sup>+</sup>ccl34b.1-eGFP<sup>+</sup> microglia showed no difference between <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup> mutants and <italic>pu.1</italic><sup>Δ<italic>839/+</italic></sup> siblings, demonstrating that the intrinsic viability of <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia in the null mutants was largely unaffected. Similarly, the proliferation capability (as indicated by BrdU incorporation rate) of <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia in the null mutants remained normal as well in comparison with control siblings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that the chronic elimination of <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient DsRed<sup>+</sup> microglia is indeed caused by cell competition, which only occurs in the mosaic condition when the eGFP<sup>+</sup> microglia harboring a single copy of <italic>pu.1</italic> are present.</p>

<p>To uncover the key downstream targets that mediate the out-competition of <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient DsRed<sup>+</sup> microglia in mosaic condition, we manually picked DsRed<sup>+</sup> and eGFP<sup>+</sup> microglia from the 4-OHT-treated <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish at 3 mpi and performed transcriptomic analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). To minimize the contamination of DCs, we manually picked 3∼5 DsRed<sup>+</sup> or GFP<sup>+</sup> cells from the brain suspension of 3-mpi <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI/</italic>Δ<italic>839</italic></sup><italic>;Tg(coro1a:CreER)</italic> fish in each tube for cDNA library construction and RNAseq. Samples with strong expression of microglia-related genes and faint DC-related genes were chosen for further analysis (Fig. S8A). Among the differential expressed genes (DEGs), the tumor suppressor gene <italic>tp53</italic> was one of the top targeted genes robustly upregulated in <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient DsRed<sup>+</sup> microglia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-C</xref>, Fig. S8B). Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that, in addition to regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ou &amp; Schumacher, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vaddavalli &amp; Schumacher, 2022</xref>), Tp53 is also involved in cell competition regulation in both hematopoietic and non-hemopoietic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bondar &amp; Medzhitov, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhang, Xie et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, we speculated that the cell competition-mediated chronic elimination of <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia was likely dependent on Tp53. To support this hypothesis, we conditional inactivated Pu.1 to generate mosaic microglia populations in the <italic>tp53-</italic>deficient mutant background and asked if loss of Tp53 could rescue the microglia phenotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, upper panel).

Collectively, these results demonstrate that the chronic elimination of <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia in mosaic condition is mediated, at least in part, by the elevation of Tp53 activity, which leads to the reduced proliferation and excessive death of these microglia.</p>

<title>Dosage-dependent regulation of microglia maintenance by PU.1 is evolutionarily conserved from zebrafish to mice</title>
<p>The above data have demonstrated that the long-term maintenance of microglia in adult zebrafish is regulated by Pu.1 in a dosage-dependent manner. We next wondered whether this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved from teleost to mammals. To address this issue, we first examined the expression of <italic>Pu.1</italic> (Ensembl: ENSMUSG00000002111) and <italic>Spi-b</italic> (Ensembl: ENSMUSG00000008193) in adult murine microglia. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that in contrast to the robust expression of <italic>Pu.1, Spi-b</italic> was barely detectable in microglia (Fig. S9A). It appears that <italic>Spi-b</italic> has acquired lineage specific roles during evolution and becomes absent in murine microglia. We therefore only focused on <italic>Pu.1</italic> and generated a <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl</italic></sup> allele, in which the exon 2 of <italic>Pu.1</italic> gene is flanked by loxP (Fig. S9B-C). The <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl</italic></sup> mice were then crossed with the <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER-YFP</italic></sup> strain (referred to as to <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> hereafter) (<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">Yona, Kim et al., 2013</xref>) to generate <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/+</italic></sup><italic>;Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> and <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/Fl</italic></sup><italic>;Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> mice for conditional PU.1 inactivation study (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate whether microglia maintenance in adult mice requires PU.1, we intraperitoneally injected tamoxifen (TAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Askew et al., 2017</xref>) into the <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/+</italic></sup><italic>;Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> <italic>and Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/Fl</italic></sup><italic>;Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> mice, and collected the brain samples at 7 dpi for cryo-section and IBA1 staining (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, upper panel). As expected, without TAM, the number of the IBA1<sup>+</sup> microglia showed no difference in the brain of <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/+</italic></sup><italic>;Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> <italic>and Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/Fl</italic></sup><italic>;Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> mice (Fig. S9D-E). However, after TAM injection, the number of the IBA1<sup>+</sup> microglia in <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/Fl</italic></sup><italic>;Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> mice were drastically reduced compared to that in <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/+</italic></sup><italic>;Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-C</xref>), suggesting that PU.1 is indeed required for the survival of adult microglia, which is similar to the double depletion of <italic>pu.1</italic> and <italic>spi-b</italic> in zebrafish (Fig. S5). To further explore whether partial loss of PU.1 activity could reduce the competitiveness of microglia and impairs the long-term maintenance of microglia in mice, we intraperitoneally injected sub-dosage of TAM into adult <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/+</italic></sup><italic>;Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> mice to generate mosaic microglia populations for long-term tracing. To quantify the proportion of <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KO/+</italic></sup> microglia and <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/+</italic></sup> microglia, we sorted YFP<sup>+</sup> microglia from TAM-injected <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/+</italic></sup><italic>;Cx3cr1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> mice at 3 dpi and 3.5 mpi, the timeline similar to previous research in zebrafish. Then we amplified <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> and <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl</italic></sup> alleles in the gDNA pool by PCR for T-clone quantification (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-F</xref>, while the percentage of <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KO/+</italic></sup> microglia was comparable to <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/+</italic></sup> microglia at 3 dpi, it was dramatically reduced by 3.5 mpi, suggesting that removal of a single copy of <italic>Pu.1</italic> leads to the chronic elimination of <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KO/+</italic></sup> microglia, which appears to occur only in the presence of the WT <italic>Pu.1</italic><sup><italic>Fl/+</italic></sup> microglia, as PU.1 heterozygous mice show no difference in the viability of tissue resident macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Karpurapu et al., 2011</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the dosage-dependent cell competition-mediated regulation of microglia maintenance by SPI1/PU.1 is evolutionarily conserved from teleost to mammals.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, to explore the role of Pu.1 in microglia survival and maintenance, we established a visible conditional knockout <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele in zebrafish via the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated knock-in method. Although conditional inactivation of targeted genes has been reported by several independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Li, Zhang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Shin, Yin et al., 2023</xref>), it has not been widely applied in zebrafish, possibly due to the difficulty or low efficiency to generate loxP-flanked alleles. Compared to homologous recombination (HR), NHEJ-mediated knock-in of reporter gene has been shown to display 10-fold higher efficiency (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Auer, Duroure et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In our case, the germline transmission to F1 generation for <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele is around 15% (Fig. S1). Meanwhile, in our investigation, we noted that the efficiency of Cre-mediated excision of loxP sites at the <italic>pu.1</italic> locus in zebrafish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) appears much lower than that in mouse (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Although it remains to be further validated whether this observation is a general phenomenon, it does highlight the necessity and significance of chimera study of interested genes. In our <italic>pu.1</italic><sup><italic>KI</italic></sup> allele, the expression of DsRed directly indicates Cre-mediated excision and helps us distinguish the mutant cells from their sibling cells, which serves as a good example for chimera study in the future. Moreover, our knock-in allele can also be simply regarded as a loxP-flanked fluorescent reporter line, which not only facilitates the labeling of cells that express gene of interest, but also can be used in combination with the LEGO-IR system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) to trace the fate of these cells. Thus, due to the high integration efficiency of donor DNA fragment and the multifaceted applications of the labeling strategy, we anticipated that our knock-in system would be a powerful tool and broadly adopted in the fields of genetics, developmental biology and cell biology for the chimeric study of interested genes and fate mapping of interested cells in the future.</p>
<p>Via EdU pulse-chase labelling assay, we found that the daily turnover rate of microglia in adult zebrafish is about 2.5%, much higher than that reported in mice and human (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Atalaya, Askew et al., 2018</xref>). These disparities might be explained by several reasons. First, in our calculation of microglia turnover rate, we did not factor the unknown cell cycle length of zebrafish microglia. It is possible that the duration of microglia proliferation in zebrafish is much shorter than that in mice. If microglia proliferation takes less than 24 hours in zebrafish, then the calculated daily turnover rate of 2.5% may be overestimated. Second, it is well recognized that zebrafish manifest much stronger regeneration capability than mammals. As such, differentiated cells, like cardiomyocytes and hair cells in zebrafish are in general more proliferative than those in mammals (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Chen, Zhang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Marques, Lupi et al., 2019</xref>). In this regard, microglia in zebrafish might be pre-coded both genetically and epigenetically to be more proliferative. Finally, microglia turnover could potentially be affected by the distinct efferocytotic burdens via the lysosome pathway, as lysosome has been known to be a convergent point for many biological process, including metabolism, cellular senescence, DNA repair, ER stress and even apoptosis (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Franco-Juárez, Coronel-Cruz et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Perera &amp; Zoncu, 2016</xref>). Indeed, efferocytosis of apoptotic cells has previously been shown to elicit NOX2 assembly and promote ROS production (<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">Yvan-Charvet, Pagler et al., 2010</xref>), which in turn triggers cell death via induction of lysosome damage (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Patra, Patil et al., 2023</xref>, <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Gómez-Sintes et al., 2018</xref>). The more regenerative environment in zebrafish might be accompanied by higher frequency of cell death, which could lead to the increase of efferocytotic burdens of microglia, thereby accelerating the turnover of microglia. Further studies will be required to clarify this issue.</p>
<p>Our results revealed that the survival and maintenance microglia are highly sensitive to the dosage of PU.1/SPI1 in both teleost and mammals. Interestingly, a previous study reported that hetero- or homozygosity of PU/ER(T) allele, in which the estrogen receptor (ER) ligand binding domain-G525R is fused with the full-length PU.1 to block its nuclear translocation, showed no effect on the viability of alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Karpurapu et al., 2011</xref>). This contradictory result might potentially result from the leakiness of ER, which was incapable to fully retain PU.1 in cytoplasm. A recent work found that conditional inactivation of PU.1 by feeding the animals with tamoxifen-containing diet in the Alzheimer’s disease model CK-p25 mice led to a 33% reduction in microglia number at their young ages. Although the authors considered prevention of microgliosis as a result of the amelioration of neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ralvenius et al., 2023</xref>), our data implies that reduction in microglia could also been interpreted by the direct involvement of PU.1 in microglia survival and maintenance, as our data clearly demonstrate that conditional ablation of the PU.1 in mice or Pu.1/Spi-b in zebrafish leads to the rapid depletion of microglia in the brain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>; Fig. S5). As PU.1 is a master regulator that controls the expression of series of genes required for macrophage/microglia development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Satoh et al., 2014</xref>), rapid death of <italic>Pu.1</italic>-null microglia might probably be caused by the orchestration of multiplex factors, including the downregulation of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (<italic>Csf1r</italic>) (the essential regulator controlling the survival and maintenance of microglia in both mice and zebrafish) (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yu et al., 2023</xref>), the loss of anti-apoptotic genes, such as BCL2A1 (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Jenal, Batliner et al., 2010</xref>), and absence of other genes that maintain the integrity of cells. Intriguingly, differing from the rapid death of microglia after complete inactivation of PU.1 or Pu.1/Spi-b, microglia with a partial loss of PU.1 or Pu.1 are chronically eliminated only in the mosaic condition via cell competition, in which the microglia with WT <italic>Pu.1</italic> or a single copy of <italic>pu.1</italic> are present (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Moreover, we further showed that the chronic elimination of <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficent microglia in zebrafish is mediated by Tp53-dependent cell competition, which has been shown to depend on the relative level of Tp53 in competing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bondar &amp; Medzhitov, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). A previous study by Tschan et al has shown that PU.1 attenuates the transcriptional activity of the <italic>p53</italic> tumor suppressor family through direct binding to the DNA-binding and/or the oligomerization domains of p53/p73 proteins (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Tschan, Reddy et al., 2008</xref>). Via in-silico analysis of <italic>tp53</italic> promoter region in zebrafish, we also found three PU.1 binding sequences (GAGGAA) located on antisense strand from position -1047 to -1042, - 1098 to -1093 and -1423 to -1418 relative to the transcriptional start site of the <italic>tp53</italic> promoter (Fig. S10). These observations indicate that Pu.1 might regulate the activity of P53 through direct protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions. Previously, we have shown that the level of <italic>csf1ra</italic>, the zebrafish orthologue of mammalian <italic>Csf1r</italic>, is highly associated with the fitness of microglia and regulates the turnover and maintenance of microglia via cell-competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yu et al., 2023</xref>). During the process of investigation, we also wondered whether the cell competition between <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia and <italic>pu.1</italic>-sufficient microglia relied on Csf1ra. However, in contrast to the robust upregulation of <italic>p53</italic> in <italic>pu.1</italic>-deficient microglia, the decrease of <italic>csf1ra</italic> was not observed (Fig. S11). In summary, our findings suggest that the dosage of PU.1/Pu.1 may serve as a checkpoint to determine the fitness of microglia. It will be of great interest to explore the upstream events that modulate <italic>PU.1</italic>/<italic>pu.1</italic> expression during microglia turnover.</p>

<title>cDNA preparation and RNA-seq</title>
<p>Cell suspensions were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). Cells of interest were manually picked under the fluorescent microscope (Nikon Ti-S) equipped with the micro-manipulator (NT-88-V3, Nikon). Subsequently, picked cells were transferred by the glass needle to lysis buffer (mainly including Triton X-100 and RNase inhibitor) for thorough vertex. Then the cell lysate was used for reverse-transcription and amplification with the Smart-Seq2 method (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Picelli, Faridani et al., 2014</xref>) to generate the cDNA library. cDNA was sent to Novogene Company for Illumina sequencing with an average depth of 6×10<sup>6</sup> raw reads per sample. Reads were aligned to the Zebrafish Genome Assembly GRCz11 using the STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference). Original counts were calculated with featureCounts package. Differential expression genes (DEGs) were identified with the DESeq2 package. TPM (transcripts per million) are used to measure gene expression levels by normalization of counts. Samples with strong expression of microglia-related genes and faint DC-related genes were chosen for further analysis. TPM of top 50 up and down regulated genes were used to generate a heat map. TPM values in the heatmap were centered and scaled in the row direction. Noted that across all experimental groups subjected to RNA-seq analysis, the <italic>ccl34b.1/ccl19a.1</italic> expression ratios exceeded 5. Although residual DC contamination in the RNA-seq data cannot be entirely ruled out, we believed that microglia were the major population we analyzed in the RNA-seq.</p>

<title>Quantification and Statistics</title>
<p>The number microglia in embryos were quantified manually, and then genotyped to prevent bias. For the experiment with adults, fish were genotyped first and then numbered without gender bias for downstream 4-OHT injection, brain sample collection, cryo-section and immunostaining experiments. For microglia number quantification, 3 representative slices from anterior, middle and posterior of the midbrain of numbered fish were chosen for further manual counting with the same criterial. For EdU/BrdU or TUNEL experiments, at least 6 representative slices from anterior, middle and posterior of the midbrain were chosen for calculation. The number of EdU/BrdU<sup>+</sup> or TUNEL<sup>+</sup> microglia/DCs from the slices were counted and then divided by the total number of microglia/DCs to calculate the ratio.</p>
<p>Adult mice were genotyped first and then only males were chosen for the downstream experiments. Female mice were excluded to avoid variability associated with estrous cycle-dependent hormonal changes, which are known to influence microglial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Habib &amp; Beyer, 2015</xref>). For statistics, cortex, hippocampus and thalamus on the slices of mouse brain were chosen for microglia density quantification. The number of microglia and region of interest were calculated with Imaris 9.9 software to determine the density.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses are performed with Graphpad Prism 9.5.1. F test was first used to check the variances of two groups. If the variances of two groups were not significantly different (P&gt;0.05), Student’s t test was performed. If the variances of the two groups were significantly different (P&lt;0.05), t test with Welch’s correction was performed. A result was considered significant if P &lt;0.05. Values represent mean ± standard deviation of the mean.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the presented work by Wu et al. the authors investigate the role of the transcription factor Pu.1 in the survival and maintenance of microglia, the tissue resident macrophage population in the brain. To this end they generated a sophisticated new conditional pu.1 allele in zebrafish using CRISPR mediated genome editing which allows visual detection of expression of the mutant allele through a switch from GFP to dsRed after Cre-mediated recombination. Using EdU pulse-chase labelling, they first estimate the daily turnover rate of microglia in the adult zebrafish brain which was found to be higher than rates previously estimated for mice and humans. After conditional deletion of pu.1 in coro1a positive cells, they do not find a difference in microglia number at 2 and 8 days or 1 month post injection of Tamoxifen. However, at 3 month post injection, a strong decrease in mutant microglia could be detected. While no change in microglia number was detected at 1mpi, an increase in apoptotic cells and decreased proliferation as observed. RNA-seq analysis of WT and mutant microglia revealed an upregulation of tp53, which was shown to play a role in the depletion of pu.1 mutant microglia as deletion in tp53-/- mutants did not lead to a decrease in microglia number at 3mpi. Through analysis of microglia number in pU.1 mutants, the authors further show that the depletion of microglia in the conditional mutants is dependent on the presence of WT microglia. To show that the phenomenon is conserved between species, similar experiments were also performed in mice.</p>
<p>This work expands on previous in vitro studies using primary human microglia. The majority of conclusions are well supported by the data, addition of controls and experimental details would strengthen the conclusions and rigor of the paper.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Generation of an elegantly designed conditional pu.1 allele in zebrafish that allows for the visual detection of expression of the knockout allele.</p>
<p>
The combination of analysis of pu.1 function in two model systems, zebrafish and mouse, strengthens the conclusions of the paper.</p>
<p>
Confirmation of the functional significance of the observed upregulation of tp53 in mutant microglia through double mutant analysis provides some mechanistic insight.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The presented RNA-Seq analysis of mutant microglia is underpowered and details on how the data was analyzed is missing. Only 9-15 cells were analyzed in total (3 pools of 3-5 cells each). Further the variability in relative gene expression of ccl35b.1, which was used as a quality control and inclusion criterion to define pools consisting of microglia, is extremely high (between ~4 and ~1600, Fig. S7A).</p>
<p>(2) The authors conclude that the reduction of microglia observed in the adult brain after cKO of pu.1 in the spi-b mutant background is due to apoptosis (Lines 213-215). However, they only provide evidence of apoptosis in 3-5 dpf embryos, a stage at which loss of pu.1 alone does lead to a complete loss of microglia (Fig.2E). A control of pu.1 KI/d839 mutants treated with 4-OHT should be added to show that this effect is indeed dependent on the loss of spi-b. In addition, experiments should be performed to show apoptosis in the adult brain after cKO of pu.1 in spi-b mutants as there seems to be a difference in requirement of pu.1 in embryonic and adult stages.</p>
<p>Comments on Revised Version (from BRE):</p>
<p>The authors have elaborated on the details of the RNA-Seq procedure and clarified the distinct phenotypes observed with global versus condition pu.1 knockout.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The article entitled &quot;Pu.1/Spi1 dosage controls the turnover and maintenance of microglia in zebrafish and mammals&quot; by Wu et al., identifies a role for the master myeloid developmental regulator Pu.1 in the maintenance of microglial populations in the adult. Using a non-homologous end joining knock-in strategy, the authors generated a pu.1 conditional allele in zebrafish, which reports wildtype expression of pu.1 with EGFP and truncated expression of pu.1 with DsRed after Cre mediated recombination. When crossed to existing pu.1 and spi-b mutants, this approach allowed the authors to target a single allele for recombination and induce homozygous loss-of-function microglia in adults. This identified that although there is no short-term consequence to loss of pu.1, microglia lacking any functional copy of pu.1 are depleted over the course of months, even when spi-b is fully functional. The authors go on to identify reduced proliferation, increased cell death, and higher expression of tp53 in the pu.1 deficient microglia, as compared to the wildtype EGFP+ microglia. To extend these findings to mammals, the authors generated a conditional Pu.1 allele in mice and performed similar analyses, finding that loss of a single copy of Pu.1 resulted in similar long-term loss of Pu.1-deficient microglia. The conclusions of this paper are overall well supported by the data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The genetic approaches here for visualizing recombination status of an endogenous allele are very clever, and by comparing the turnover of wildtype and mutant cells in the same animal the authors can make very convincing arguments about the effect of chronic loss of pu.1. Likely this phenotype would be either very subtle or non-existent without the point of comparison and competition with the wildtype cells.</p>
<p>Using multiple species allows for more generalizable results, and shows conservation of the phenomena at play.</p>
<p>The demonstration of changes to proliferation and cell death in concert with higher expression of tp53 is compelling evidence for the authors argument.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
This paper is very strong. It would benefit from further investigating the specific relationship between pu.1 and tp53 specifically. Does pu.1 interact with the tp53 locus? Specific molecular analysis of this interaction would strengthen the mechanistic findings.</p>
<p>
Recommendations for the authors It would be useful to investigate the relationship between pu.1 and tp53. The data presented here show that pu.1 deficient cells have higher expression of tp53, but this could be an indirect effect. However, since pu.1 has known DNA binding motifs, it would be worthwhile to investigate if there are any direct interactions between pu.1 and the tp53 locus -- does pu.1 directly bind and repress tp53 expression? This could be directly investigated with Cut &amp; Run or an EMSA.</p>
<p>The paper would likely also benefit from more in-depth discussion of the relationship of the zebrafish alleles and their relationship to mammalian Pu.1 -- as presented here, the authors are implicitly arguing that zebrafish pu.1 and spi-b are both more closely related to mammalian Pu.1 than to mammalian Spi-b. Clear argument, perhaps backed up by sequence alignment and homology matching, would help readers, especially those less familiar with zebrafish genome duplications.</p>
<p>Comments on Revised Version (from BRE):</p>
<p>The authors performed in silico analyses to support a regulatory relationship between Pu.1 and Tp53. They identified three putative Pu.1 binding sites within the zebrafish tp53 promoter region. Furthermore, they cite prior evidence demonstrating a similar interaction between PU.1 and members of the P53 family through direct DNA binding.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s assessment regarding the significance of the relationship between PU.1 and TP53. To investigate the potential interaction between Pu.1 and Tp53 in zebrafish, we analyzed the promoter region of zebrafish <italic>tp53</italic>. Indeed, we found three PU.1 binding sites (GAGGAA) on <italic>tp53</italic> promoter, which locate on the antisense strand from position -1047 to -1042, -1098 to -1093 and -1423 to -1418 relative to the transcriptional start site (Fig. S10). These potential Pu.1 binding sites indicate a direct interaction between Pu.1 and <italic>tp53</italic> locus. Furthermore, a previous study by Tschan et al. (2008) elucidated the mechanism by which PU.1 attenuates the transcriptional activity of the P53 tumor suppressor family through direct binding to the DNA-binding and/or oligomerization domains of p53/p73 proteins. We have also cited this study (Line 399-401) and included all above information in the discussion of the revised manuscript (Line 399-405).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We feel sorry for the unclearness of RNAseq procedures and have accordingly added the details about RNA-seq data analysis in the “Material and methods” section (Line 491-501). Briefly, reads were aligned to the zebrafish genome using the STAR package. Original counts were calculated with featureCounts package. Differential expression genes (DEGs) were identified with the DESeq2 package. Owing to the technical challenge of unambiguously distinguishing microglia from dendritic cells (DCs) in brain cell suspensions, we employed a strategy of isolating 3-5 cells per pool and quantifying the relative expression of the microglia-specific marker <italic>ccl34b.1</italic> normalized to the DC-specific marker <italic>ccl19a.1</italic>. This approach aimed to reduce DC contamination in downstream analyses. Across all experimental groups subjected to RNA-seq analysis, the <italic>ccl34b.1</italic>/<italic>ccl19a.1</italic> expression ratios exceeded 5, confirming microglia as the dominant cell population. Nonetheless, residual DC contamination in the RNA-seq data cannot be entirely ruled out. We have discussed this technical constraint in the revised manuscript to ensure methodological transparency (Line 498-501).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors conclude that the reduction of microglia observed in the adult brain after cKO of pu.1 in the spi-b mutant background is due to apoptosis (Lines 213-215). However, they only provide evidence of apoptosis in 3-5 dpf embryos, a stage at which loss of pu.1 alone does lead to a complete loss of microglia (Figure 2E). A control of pu.1 KI/d839 mutants treated with 4-OHT should be added to show that this effect is indeed dependent on the loss of spi-b. In addition, experiments should be performed to show apoptosis in the adult brain after cKO of pu.1 in spi-b mutants as there seems to be a difference in the requirement of pu.1 in embryonic and adult stages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the omission of data regarding conditional <italic>pu.1</italic> knockout alone in the embryos in our manuscript, which may have led to ambiguity. We would like to clarify that conditional <italic>pu.1</italic> knockout alone at the embryonic stage does not induce microglial death (Fig S2). Microglial death occurs only in both embryonic and adult brains when Pu.1 is disrupted in the <italic>spi-b</italic> mutant background. The blebbing morphology of some microglia after <italic>pu.1</italic> conditional knockout in adult <italic>spi-b</italic> mutant indicated microglia undergo apoptosis at both embryonic and adult stages (Figure S4 and Fig. S5). The reviewer’s concern likely arises from the distinct outcomes of global <italic>pu.1</italic> knockout (Fig. 2) versus conditional <italic>pu.1</italic> ablation (Fig. S2). Global knockout eliminates microglia during early development due to Pu.1’s essential role in myeloid lineage specification. We have included this clarification in the revised manuscript (Line 208-211).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The number of microglia after pu.1 knockout in zebrafish did only show a significant decrease 3 months after 4-OHT injection, whereas microglia were almost completely depleted already 7 days after injection in mice. This major difference is not discussed in the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We propose that zebrafish Pu.1 and Spi-b function cooperatively to regulate microglial maintenance, analogous to the role of PU.1 alone in mice. This cooperative mechanism likely explains the observed difference in microglial depletion kinetics between zebrafish and mice following <italic>pu.1</italic> conditional knockout. Specifically, the compensatory activity of Spi-b in zebrafish may buffer the immediate loss of Pu.1, whereas in mice, the absence of <italic>Spi-b</italic> expression in microglia eliminates this redundancy, resulting in rapid microglial depletion. Furthermore, during evolution, <italic>SPI-B</italic> appears to have acquired lineage-specific roles, becoming absent in microglia. We have included the clarification in the revised manuscript (Line 302-305).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p>
<p>To further strengthen the manuscript, we ask the authors to address the reviewers' comments through additional experiments where necessary. In cases where certain experiments may be challenging, we encourage the authors to address these concerns within the text, such as by referencing any prior evidence of pu.1 and tp53 interactions or incorporating in silico analyses that support such interaction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we have performed in-silico analysis of Pu.1 binding sites in zebrafish tp53 promoter and also cited previous paper showing how PU.1 attenuates the transcriptional activity of the P53 tumor suppressor family (Line 399-405).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have conducted detailed sequence alignment in our previous work (Yu et al., 2017, Blood) and found zebrafish Spi-b shares the highest similarity with the mammalian SPI-B among Ets family transcription factors in zebrafish. A unique P/S/T-rich region known to be essential for mammalian SPI-B transactivation activity is present in zebrafish Spi-b. Our data do not support the interpretation that <italic>Spi-b</italic> is more closely related to mammalian <italic>Pu.1</italic> than to <italic>Spi-b</italic>. Instead, functional compensation between <italic>pu.1</italic> and <italic>spi-b</italic> in microglia maintenance likely reflects their shared role as Ets-family transcriptional regulators, rather than ortholog-driven redundancy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The nomenclature of the genes in the SPI family in zebrafish is somewhat confusing as genes were renamed several times. It would make it easier for the reader to understand if in the abstract and the main text, spi-b would be referred to as the zebrafish orthologue of mouse SPI-B (as determined by the authors in previous work) rather than the paralogue of zebrafish pu.1. To clarify which genes were analyzed in both zebrafish and mouse, Gene accession numbers should be added.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the recommendations. We have changed “the paralogue of zebrafish pu.1” to “the orthologue of mouse <italic>Spi-b</italic>” in the abstract (Line 22) and added gene accession numbers for both zebrafish and mouse gene (Line 105-106 and 301-302).</p>
