<title>Abstract</title><p>Short-term facilitation of recurrent excitatory synapses within the cortical network has been proposed to support persistent activity during working memory tasks, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We characterized short-term plasticity at the local excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 of the rat medial prefrontal cortex and studied its presynaptic mechanisms. Low-frequency stimulation induced slowly developing facilitation, whereas high-frequency stimulation initially induced strong depression followed by rapid facilitation. This non-monotonic delayed facilitation after a brief depression resulted from a high vesicular fusion probability and slow activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent vesicle replenishment, which led to the overfilling of release sites beyond their basal occupancy. Pharmacological and gene knockdown (KD) experiments revealed that the facilitation was mediated by phospholipase C/diacylglycerol signaling and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7). Notably, Syt7 KD abolished facilitation and slowed the refilling rate of vesicles with high fusion probability. Furthermore, Syt7 deficiency in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos activity. In conclusion, Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Syt7-dependent overfilling of release sites mediates synaptic facilitation at layer 2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses and contributes to temporal associative learning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Synapses in the mammalian central nervous system undergo activity-dependent modulation of synaptic weight during repetitive stimulation, known as short-term synaptic plasticity (STP). STP is mediated by presynaptic mechanisms that regulate the release probability (p<sub>r</sub>), size of the readily releasable pool (RRP), and kinetics of vesicle replenishment of RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). Short-term depression has been observed at synapses with a high baseline p<sub>r</sub>, primarily because of the rapid depletion of releasable vesicles during high-frequency stimulation (HFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, vesicle depletion is less pronounced at synapses with a low baseline p<sub>r</sub>, and cumulative increases in p<sub>r</sub> during HFS are considered to mediate short-term facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rozov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pan and Zucker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aldahabi et al., 2024</xref>). Central synapses exhibit a wide spectrum of STP depending on different combinations of presynaptic factors mediating short-term depression and facilitation.</p>
<p>Previously, facilitation was modeled as an increase in p<sub>r</sub> after an action potential (AP) and its slow decay during the inter-spike interval (ISI), resulting in a cumulative increase in p<sub>r</sub> during HFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Markram et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dittman et al., 2000</xref>). Recent studies have suggested that the number of docking (or release) sites in an active zone is limited and only partially occupied by releasable vesicles in the resting states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pulido and Marty, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, p<sub>r</sub> is determined by the vesicular fusion probability (p<sub>v</sub>) and release site occupancy (p<sub>occ</sub>). However, distinguishing the individual contributions of p<sub>v</sub> and p<sub>occ</sub> to p<sub>r</sub> is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Silva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Neher, 2024</xref>). It is also unclear whether facilitation is mediated by activity-dependent increases in the p<sub>v</sub>, p<sub>occ</sub>, or both.</p>
<p>Two recent models for vesicle priming and release view the ‘priming’ as a two-step reversible process that leads to a release-ready state. The release-ready vesicles could be vesicles in a tightly docked state (TS) or those occupying specialized docking sites (DS), and are supplied from vesicles in a loosely docked state (LS) or those occupying a distinct replacement sites (RS), which are called LS/TS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aldahabi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Neher, 2024</xref>) and RS/DS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Silva et al., 2021</xref>), respectively. Common to both models is the assumption that release-ready vesicles constitute only a fraction of all docked vesicles under resting conditions and that this fraction is up- and down-regulated by synaptic activity.</p>
<p>Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) was recently found to play a crucial role in facilitation at different types of central synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jackman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Martinetti et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to its role in facilitation, Syt7 accelerates refilling of the RRP after depletion and mediates asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jackman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tawfik et al., 2021</xref>). Syt7-dependent synaptic facilitation is interpreted as an activity-dependent increase in p<sub>v</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Turecek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Norman et al., 2023</xref>). However, it is unclear whether Syt7 contributes to facilitation through a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in p<sub>occ</sub> (i.e., overfilling). Overfilling has been proposed as a mechanism supporting facilitation at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kobbersmed et al., 2020</xref>), yet whether this process also occurs at the mammalian central synapses mediated by Syt7 has not been studied.</p>
<p>Each of layer 2/3 (L2/3) and layer 5 (L5) of neocortex displays intralaminar excitatory synapses between pyramidal cells comprising a recurrent network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Holmgren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Thomson and Lamy, 2007</xref>). Short-term facilitation at recurrent excitatory synapses in a cortical network may play a crucial role in maintaining working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mongillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hansel and Mato, 2013</xref>). Although L2/3 pyramidal cells (PCs) represent task-relevant information during a delay period in working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ozdemir et al., 2020</xref>), most studies on local excitatory recurrent synapses in the neocortex have focused on L5 exhibiting short-term depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Reyes and Sakmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hempel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>). Further, the synaptic properties of excitatory synapses in L2/3 remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>In the present study, we found that HFS of local excitatory synapses in L2/3 of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) induced initial strong depression followed by delayed facilitation, whereas low-frequency stimulation induced slow monotonous facilitation. This unique form of STP could be explained by 1) high p<sub>v</sub> of RRP vesicles at rest and throughout a train stimulation; 2) the low resting vesicular occupancy of RRP and its activity-dependent increase. These conditions led to delayed facilitation through progressive overfilling of release sites during HFS with high p<sub>v</sub> vesicles beyond the resting occupancy. Syt7 knockdown (KD) in L2/3 PCs completely abolished these synaptic enhancements by inhibiting the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in release site occupancy. Finally, behavioral tests for trace fear conditioning showed that Syt7 KD impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos expression in the mPFC. Collectively, these results support that Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Syt7-dependent overfilling of release sites mediates synaptic facilitation at L2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses and contributes to temporal associative learning.</p>

<title>Frequency dependence of STP at local excitatory synapses in L2/3 of the prelimbic cortex</title>
<p>We examined STP profiles at recurrent excitatory synapses between L2/3 PCs and at synapses from L2/3-PCs to fast-spiking interneurons (FSINs) in the prelimbic area of the rat mPFC. The PCs and FSINs were identified based on their distinct intrinsic properties and morphologies (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1</italic></xref>).

<p>Given that IUE transfected approximately 10-20% of L2/3 PCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref>), we made a whole-cell patch on a non-transfected L2/3 PC or an FSIN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref>). To stimulate a minimal number of excitatory axon fibers, EPSCs were evoked using minimal optical stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>— figure supplement 3A</italic>; 470 nm, 3-4 μm in radius and 3-5 ms in duration). EPSCs evoked by minimal stimulation were examined to determine the uniformity of the kinetic properties (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 3B-C</italic></xref>). Moreover, we reassessed the kinetics of EPSCs during trains <italic>post hoc</italic> to ensure uniformity. EPSCs were evoked by 20-pulse trains at 4 different frequencies (5, 10, 20, and 40 Hz) to cover the range of firing rates of PCs observed <italic>in vivo</italic> during working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baeg et al., 2003</xref>). Excitatory synapses from PCs onto both other PCs and FSINs (PC–PC and PC–FSIN) showed strong (∼2-fold enhancement) and lasting (several seconds) short-term facilitation at 20 Hz and lower frequencies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1D-E</italic></xref>). The PC-PC synapses exhibited stronger facilitation than did the PC-FSIN synapses.</p>
<p>Steady-state EPSCs at the PC-PC synapses were not significantly different from 5 to 20 Hz (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1F</italic></xref>). Frequency invariance at the PC-PC synapses suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent synaptic facilitation may counteract vesicle depletion in a frequency-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Turecek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Despite facilitation at all frequencies, the paired pulse ratio (PPR) rapidly decreased as the ISI decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref><italic>, I</italic>). At 40 Hz stimulation, both PC-PC and PC-FSIN synapses initially underwent strong depression then followed by facilitation in a few stimuli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Dd, Ed</xref>). Such delayed facilitation after paired pulse depression (PPD) has not been previously observed in central synapses except for a slight increase in EPSC at the cerebellar synapses under artificially depolarized conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pulido and Marty, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We confirmed that optically evoked EPSCs were strictly dependent on AP generation (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</italic></xref>), suggesting that EPSCs are evoked by optical stimulation of presynaptic axon fibers rather than by direct depolarization of presynaptic boutons. Additionally, dual patch-clamp techniques showed that the STP of optically evoked EPSCs did not differ from the electrically evoked STP of EPSCs at the PC-FSIN synapses (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</italic></xref>). Finally, we confirmed that AMPA receptor (AMPAR) desensitization was not responsible for PPD at 40 Hz, ruling out the possible effects of postsynaptic factors on STP (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</italic></xref>), and that AMPAR saturation was not significant during facilitation (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</italic></xref>).</p>

<title>Delayed facilitation results from slow activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent vesicle replenishment at a constantly high vesicular fusion probability</title>
<p>The strong PPD at 40 Hz suggests a high vesicular fusion probability (p<sub>v</sub>) and likely tight coupling of the releasable vesicles to a Ca<sup>2+</sup> source. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of EGTA, a slow calcium chelator, on synaptic transmission at the PC-PC synapses. The baseline EPSC amplitude (EPSC<sub>1</sub>) was not affected by incubation of the slice in the bath solution containing 50 μM EGTA-AM for longer than 20 min, supporting tight coupling. Moreover, the PPR was decreased to 0.19, and subsequent facilitation slowed but was still distinct (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2A-B</italic></xref>). These findings indicate that the initial p<sub>v</sub> should be higher than 0.81 considering vesicle recruitment during ISI. The effects of EGTA-AM were confirmed in the same cell by measuring the baseline EPSC and PPR before and after applying EGTA-AM to the bath. EPSC<sub>1</sub> remained unchanged, while PPR was reduced by half (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2—figure supplement 1</italic></xref>).</p>

<p>Notably, the application of EGTA-AM markedly slowed facilitation at 40 Hz (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref><italic>, C</italic>).

Moreover, facilitation was accelerated at higher stimulation frequencies. The plot of the rate constant for the increase in EPSCs (denoted as <bold>k</bold><sub>STF</sub>, the rate constant for the development of short-term facilitation) as a function of the stimulation frequency (<italic>f<sub>stim</sub></italic>) revealed a linear relationship (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref>). <bold>k</bold><sub>STF</sub> in the presence of EGTA-AM was distinctly below this relationship, supporting the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent acceleration of facilitation.</p>
<p><bold>k</bold><sub>STF</sub> was also accelerated when the stimulation frequency was increased from 5 Hz to 40 Hz (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref>; 1.27 ± 0.18/s to 24.27 ± 3.44/s). Notably, the second 40-Hz train stimulation led to strong PPD, followed by accelerated facilitation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D-E</italic></xref>). The strong PPD suggests that the vesicular fusion probability kept high during the 5-Hz stimulation, arguing against the possibility for an increase in p<sub>v</sub>. Both two-step sequential priming models, LS/TS and RS/DS models, are suitable to interpret our data and we will refer to the different populations of vesicles as TS and LS vesicles, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Taschenberger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Neher, 2024</xref>). Within this framework, vesicles are released from TS with high p<sub>v</sub> both in the resting state and during facilitation, and the delayed facilitation is seen as a result of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent progressive increase in the occupancy of TS vesicles on docking sites.</p>

<title>Release sites have low baseline occupancy and these are increased during facilitation and post-tetanic augmentation</title>
<p>Given that p<sub>v</sub> was greater than 0.8, the two-fold increase in EPSC during 20 pulse train stimulations could not be explained by an increase in p<sub>v</sub>. Recent studies have shown that vesicle release sites (N) are limited in number and are partially occupied at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pulido and Marty, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Malagon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Under such a high p<sub>v</sub>, two-fold synaptic facilitation should be attributed to an increase in p<sub>occ</sub>. The vesicle replenishment rate is accelerated during HFS in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2A-C</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hosoi et al., 2007</xref>). This may lead to the overfilling of release sites beyond their basal vesicular occupancy, which in turn may increase EPSC under high p<sub>v</sub>. To test this hypothesis, we determined the quantal parameters at the L2/3 local excitatory synapses. We first measured the quantal size from asynchronous release events after replacing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Sr<sup>2+</sup>, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B</italic></xref>). The mean and coefficient of variance of the quantal sizes were 24 pA and 0.25 at PC-PC synapses, respectively, and were 30 pA and 0.31 at PC-FSIN synapses (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</italic></xref>). Next, we performed a variance-mean (V-M) analysis of phasic EPSCs at excitatory synapses during train stimulation at 5 Hz and 40 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scheuss et al., 2002</xref>). Applying multiple-probability fluctuation analysis (MPFA) using intra-site quantal variability of 0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Valera et al., 2012</xref>), the V-M plot was best fitted by the number of release sites (N) of 5.3 and the quantal size (q) of 25 pA at the PC-PC synapses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref>). The p<sub>r</sub> for EPSC<sub>1</sub> was calculated as 0.32.

<p>The p<sub>r</sub> estimate was clearly smaller than the possible minimum value for p<sub>v</sub> (0.81) estimated from the PPR data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref>). Given that p<sub>r</sub> is a product of p<sub>occ</sub> and p<sub>v</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Neher, 2024</xref>), a p<sub>r</sub> smaller than p<sub>v</sub> indicates the partial occupancy of release sites in the resting state. If synaptic facilitation were mediated by the recruitment of new release sites, it would be accompanied by an increase in the variance of augmented EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Valera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kobbersmed et al., 2020</xref>). However, the augmented EPSCs during facilitation followed the same parabola in the V-M plot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3A-B</italic></xref>). Therefore, facilitation appears to be mediated by the progressive overfilling of a finite number of release sites beyond the basal occupancy. In the next section, we show that p<sub>v</sub> is close to unity based on a synaptic failure analysis (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2</italic></xref>). Assuming this, the baseline p<sub>r</sub> at the first pulse estimated from the fitted parabolic curve can be largely regarded as a baseline p<sub>occ</sub> (c.a. 30%), and the two-fold increase in EPSCs during facilitation can be attributed to an increase of up to 60% in p<sub>occ</sub>.</p>
<p>We investigated the time course of recovery from facilitation and post-tetanic augmentation (PTA) by applying dual-train stimulations (30 pulses at 40 Hz) separated by different inter-burst intervals (IBIs; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3C-D</italic></xref>). The initial EPSCs in the second train were enhanced by more than twofold, and followed by a strong PPD, suggesting that fusion probability stays high in the IBIs and thus synaptic transmission is carried by TS vesicles. The decay time course of PTA was characterized by two phases (initially fast and later slow; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3E</italic></xref>), which may reflect a two-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup> decay or two distinct recovery processes that occur sequentially. The variance of potentiated EPSCs measured at IBIs of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 s was not different from that of EPSCs at the peak of facilitation (filled circles, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3A-B</italic></xref>). Given that the same RRP mediates both facilitation and augmentation and that post-tetanic EPSCs is carried by TS vesicles similar to the baseline EPSCs, this plot suggests that PTA, similar to short-term facilitation, is mediated by an increase in the TS vesicle occupancy.</p>

<title>Failure rate analysis suggests that vesicular fusion probability is close to one</title>
<p>The vesicle dynamics of STP has been explained using a simple refilling model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hosoi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). This model assumes that the vesicles are reversibly docked to a limited number of release sites (N) with forward and reverse rate constants (denoted as k<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>, respectively). Under the framework of the simple refilling model (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>), the rate constant for the refilling of the RRP after depletion by the first pulse is the sum of the baseline k<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>. This is estimated as 23/s from the plot of PPR as a function of ISIs (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</italic></xref>). From the baseline occupancy of 0.3 and p<sub>occ</sub> = k<sub>1</sub> / (k<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>), we estimated k<sub>1</sub> to be 6.9/s.</p>
<p>When paired APs were applied with an ISI of 20 ms, the failure rate at 1<sup>st</sup> pulse, P(F<sub>1</sub>), was 10.6%, and the probability of two consecutive failures, P(F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>), was 6.2% (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</italic></xref>). From the equation P(F<sub>1</sub>) = (1 – p<sub>r</sub>)<sup>N</sup>, p<sub>r</sub> was calculated as 0.312 when N = 6, comparable to p<sub>r</sub> (= 0.32) estimated from the V-M analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref>). We calculated P(F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>) under the framework of a simple refilling model, with p<sub>v</sub> and k<sub>1</sub> set as free parameters and other parameters set according to the following relationships: P(F<sub>1</sub>) = (1 – p<sub>r</sub>)<sup>N</sup>, p<sub>r</sub> = p<sub>v</sub> ×p<sub>occ</sub>, and p<sub>occ</sub> = k<sub>1</sub> / (k<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>). The calculated values for P(F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>) and their difference from the observed value (6.2%) are shown in the plane of k<sub>1</sub> <italic>vs</italic>. p<sub>v</sub> in <xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-C</italic></xref>.

<p>To find optimal values for k<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>v</sub> that best explain observed probabilities shown in <xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2Ac</italic></xref>, a cost function was implemented as the sum of squared errors between observed and predicted probability values for the four combinations of success and failure of 1st and 2nd EPSCs as described in <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>.

<title>Pharmacological manipulations reveal specific molecular identities underlying vesicle loading processes</title>
<p>Our results suggest that the baseline occupancy of TS vesicles is low and that the activity-dependent progressive overfilling of docking sites with TS vesicles is responsible for short-term facilitation and augmentation. To elucidate the specific molecular link between synaptic enhancement and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent overfilling, we examined the effects of several drugs known to affect vesicle dynamics. We first examined the roles of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by applying 5 μM U73122, a PLC inhibitor, or 20 μM 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), a DAG analog. The STP at 40 Hz and PTA at 0.5-s interval were examined before and after applying each drug to the bath. For both drugs, the facilitation and augmentation were reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4A-B</italic></xref>). U73122 did not affect the basal EPSC amplitude (EPSC<sub>1</sub>) but resulted in a stronger PPD, slower facilitation, and lower augmentation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref>). These effects of U73122 suggest the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced PLC activation in progressive overfilling. In contrast, OAG increased EPSC<sub>1</sub> while maintaining a pronounced PPD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref>), indicating an increase in the TS vesicle pool size. Meanwhile, OAG slowed <bold>k</bold><sub>STF</sub> and reduced augmentation, indicating occlusion of activity-dependent synaptic facilitation. Phorbol esters and DAG are thought to accelerate priming through Munc13 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Taschenberger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aldahabi et al., 2022</xref>); they also shorten the bridges that interlink docked vesicles with the active zone (AZ) membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Papantoniou et al., 2023</xref>). Collectively, these suggest that PLC- and DAG-mediated signaling play a role in the overfilling of docking sites underlying short-term facilitation and augmentation.</p>

<p>Although the acceleration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent vesicle refilling supports rapid facilitation at 40 Hz, the later part of the delayed facilitation underwent a slight depression, which was more pronounced during the second burst (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref>). Sustained synaptic transmission is limited by the spatial availability of docking sites because it is undermined by accumulation of exocytic remainings in the presynaptic AZ during HFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Neher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Haucke et al., 2011</xref>). To verify this, we examined the effects of dynasore (100 μM), a specific inhibitor of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Macia et al., 2006</xref>). The treatment with dynasore did not influence EPSC<sub>1</sub> or the early phase of facilitation, but it exacerbated depression during the later phase and attenuated PTA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref>). This suggests that late synaptic transmission during the 40-Hz train is limited by site clearance.</p>
<p>Given the involvement of actin polymerization in the multiple steps of vesicle docking and recycling, we examined the effects of 20 μM latrunculin B (LatB), an inhibitor of actin polymerization. The effects of LatB were complicated: (1) EPSC<sub>1</sub> was decreased, whereas PPR was increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Da</xref>) and (2) facilitation and augmentation were reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Db</xref>). The latter effect may result from defects in vesicle replenishment rates, either through the impaired physical movement of vesicles or disrupted site clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sakaba and Neher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hallermann and Silver, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miki et al., 2016</xref>), as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent vesicle refilling mediates facilitation and augmentation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref>).

<p>To examine whether Syt7 KD had any nonautonomous effects on postsynaptic cells, we measured the quantal size (q) from asynchronous events in the presence of Sr<sup>2+</sup> and found that the mean quantal size remained unaltered at Syt7 KD synapses (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</italic></xref>). This indicated that Syt7 did not influence postsynaptic parameters, including the density and kinetic properties of AMPARs. To test the specificity of shSyt7, we examined whether co-expression of the shRNA-resistant form of Syt7 restored synaptic facilitation in both excitatory synapse types. Presynaptic overexpression of shRNA-resistant Syt7 under the CAG promoter rescued the effect of shRNA at both PC-PC and PC-FSIN synapses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>— figure supplement 2</italic>). These results underscore the crucial role of presynaptic Syt7 in mediating short-term facilitation at local excitatory synapses in L2/3 of the mPFC.</p>

<title>TS vesicle recovery following depletion is accelerated by Syt7</title>
<p>Syt7 is recognized not only for its crucial role in facilitation, but also for mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup>- dependent replenishment of releasable vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tawfik et al., 2021</xref>). Given that facilitation at L2/3 excitatory synapses is driven by progressive overfilling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref>), the loss of facilitation at Syt7 KD synapses in the present study implies that Syt7 plays a key role in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent acceleration of refilling and overfilling of the docking sites with TS vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we examined the recovery kinetics of EPSCs after TS vesicles were depleted by 3 pulses at 40 Hz in wild-type (WT) and Syt7 KD synapses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref>). Strong PPD was observed not only in the first burst, but also in the second burst. This suggested that EPSCs in the second burst were mediated by TS vesicles, similar to those in the first burst (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref><italic>, D</italic>). Therefore, EPSC<sub>1</sub> in the second burst can be interpreted as a release from TS vesicles recovering during a given IBI. The recovery time course of EPSC<sub>1</sub> in the second burst indicated full recovery of TS vesicles within 100 ms in both excitatory synapse types in WT rats (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7C</italic></xref><italic>, F</italic>). However, this recovery was remarkably slower in Syt7 KD synapses, requiring 5 s for full recovery, indicating that TS vesicle recovery was greatly accelerated by Syt7. Overall, synaptic facilitation and augmentation at local excitatory synapses in L2/3 can be ascribed to progressive activity-dependent increases in the occupancy of TS vesicles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref>), in which Syt7 plays a key role.</p>

<title>Behavioral consequences of Syt7 KD in L2/3 PCs of the mPFC</title>
<p>We previously proposed that the disparity in STP between the PC-PC and PC-IN synapses results in activity-dependent changes in the ratio of synaptic weights at the PC-PC and PC-IN synapses (J<sub>ee</sub>/J<sub>ie</sub>). This may in turn have a profound influence on persistent activity in a recurrent network by biasing the E-I balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>). Syt7 KD not only eliminated facilitation, but also the activity-dependent increase in the J<sub>ee</sub>/J<sub>ie</sub> ratio in the L2/3 network (<xref rid="figs8a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 8—figure supplement 1</italic></xref>). This suggests the possibility that Syt7 contributes to the persistent activity during working memory tasks in the L2/3 recurrent network. Trace fear conditioning (tFC) requires associative learning between an auditory cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) and temporally separate aversive events (unconditioned stimulus, US). The formation of trace fear memory requires the prelimbic area of the mPFC and hippocampus. mPFC activity during the trace interval is thought to temporarily hold CS information, enabling the network to associate temporally discontinuous events (i.e., temporal associative learning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gilmartin et al., 2013</xref>). Synaptic facilitation and augmentation are implicated in temporary memory retention in recurrent networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mongillo et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that Syt7 is crucial for synaptic facilitation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref>) and augmentation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref>) in prelimbic L2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses, we tested whether trace fear memory formation was impaired in rats with depleted Syt7 transcripts, specifically in the L2/3 PCs of the mPFC. Syt7-targeted shRNA (shSyt7) or scrambled shRNA (Scr) constructs were transfected bilaterally into the L2/3 PCs of the mPFC using IUE (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 8A</italic></xref>). Both the Scr-transfected control and shSyt7-transfected rats underwent tFC training (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 8B</italic></xref>). Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gilmartin et al. (2013)</xref>, in which prefrontal persistent firing was optogenetically inhibited, WT and KD animals exhibited similar freezing behavior during this acquisition phase. The following day, the rats were subjected to a tone test in which trace fear memory formation was assessed from the freezing response to a tone alone in a distinct context. Compared to the control group, the shSyt7-transfected group exhibited significantly lower levels of freezing behavior in response to auditory cues during the first four trials, suggesting an impairment in trace memory formation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 8C</italic></xref>).</p>

<p>The tone test was repeated the following day to test for extinction memory formation. Syt7 KD animals exhibited much less freezing to the CS (+1d) than did WT animals. Considering the Rescorla-Wagner model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yau and McNally, 2023</xref>), our results suggest that the strength of CS-US associative memory was weaker in KD animals than in WT animals; thus, the acquisition of trace fear memory was impaired by Syt7 KD in the L2/3 PCs of the mPFC.</p>
<p>Next, we assessed the locomotor activity and anxiety levels of rats using the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze test (EPM). Scr controls and Syt7 KD rats showed similar exploratory patterns, displaying comparable total distance moved and time spent in the periphery of the OFT or the open/closed arms of the EPM (<xref rid="figs8a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 8—figure supplement 2</italic></xref>). Previous studies have suggested that the acquisition of trace fear memory requires elevated trace activity in prelimbic PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gilmartin et al., 2013</xref>). Given that c-Fos, an immediate early gene, is upregulated following patterned activities in neurons, its expression is considered a reliable indicator of recent neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fields et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guzowski et al., 2005</xref>). To investigate the effect of Syt7 on neuronal activity <italic>in vivo</italic> during tFC, animals were sacrificed at the time of peak c-Fos protein expression, approximately 90 min after completion of the behavioral task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arime and Akiyama, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>To elucidate the activation patterns of specific neuronal populations, we performed immunohistochemical co-labeling of c-Fos and GAD67 (a GABAergic interneuron marker) upon tFC acquisition. The density of c-Fos(+) cells and the percentage of c-Fos(+) cells among GAD67(+) cells in all prelimbic layers were significantly lower in Syt7 KD rats than in control rats (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 8F-G</italic></xref>). Additionally, analysis of the proportion of active cells among transfected L2/3 PCs (c-Fos+/GFP+) revealed that Syt7 KD L2/3 PCs were significantly more active than Scr-transfected PCs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 8H</italic></xref>). This unexpected hyperactivity of Syt7 KD PCs may be attributed to the high reciprocal connectivity between PCs and FSINs in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Holmgren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Otsuka and Kawaguchi, 2009</xref>), as PCs with short-term depression would transmit less input to FSINs, which in turn would exert less feedback inhibition on reciprocally connected PCs. Collectively, these findings show that the slow activation of vesicle refilling supports various forms of facilitation at excitatory synapses in PFC L2/3, which is essential for neuronal activity during temporal associative learning.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study characterized STP at local excitatory synapses in the L2/3 network of the rat mPFC at physiological extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. These synapses displayed initial strong depression and then delayed facilitation at 40 Hz, while monotonous slowly developing facilitation was observed at lower frequencies. Our study suggests that such delayed facilitation after a brief depression results from a high p<sub>v</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2</italic></xref>), along with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent delayed acceleration of vesicle refilling and overfilling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref>). The two-fold increase in EPSC during 20 pulse train stimulations under the condition of such a high p<sub>v</sub> suggests a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in the vesicle replenishment rate during a train; this then leads to overfilling of release sites beyond their incomplete basal occupancy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3A-B</italic></xref>). The high p<sub>v</sub> and strong PPD did not result from artificial bouton stimulation, AMPAR desensitization, or any potential distortion caused by optogenetic methods (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>—figure supplements 4 and 5</italic>). Additionally, similar to short-term facilitation, PTA could be explained by an increase in the TS vesicle occupancy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3C-E</italic></xref>), consistent with previous studies showing post-tetanic increases in the p<sub>occ</sub> and/or vesicle pool size at various types of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Vandael et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Tran et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Silva et al., 2024</xref>). These findings suggest that release sites are partially occupied at rest and that a progressive overfilling of release sites with TS vesicles underlies facilitation and augmentation at intracortical L2/3 excitatory synapses.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Definition of vesicular release probability in the present and previous studies</title>
<p>Previous studies suggested that an increase in p<sub>v</sub> is responsible for post-tetanic augmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stevens and Wesseling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008</xref>) by observing invariance of the RRP size after tetanic stimulation. In these studies, the RRP size was estimated by hypertonic sucrose solution or as the sum of EPSCs evoked 20 Hz/60 pulses train (denoted as ‘RRP<sub>hyper</sub>’). Because reluctant vesicles (called LS vesicles) can be quickly converted to TS vesicles (16/s) and are released during a train (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), it is likely that the RRP size measured by these methods encompasses both LS and TS vesicles. In contrast, we assert high p<sub>v</sub> based on the observation of strong PPD and failure rates upon paired stimulations at ISI of 20 ms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2</italic></xref>). Given that single AP-induced vesicular release occurs from TS vesicles but not from LS vesicles, p<sub>v</sub> in the present study indicates the fusion probability of TS vesicles. From the same reasons, p<sub>occ</sub> denotes the occupancy of release sites by TS vesicles. Note that our study does not provide direct clue whether release sites are occupied by LS vesicles that are not tapped by a single AP, although an increase in the LS vesicle number may accelerate the recovery of TS vesicles. As suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Neher (2024)</xref>, even if the number of LS plus TS vesicles are kept constant, an increase in p<sub>occ</sub> (occupancy by TS vesicles) would be interpreted as an increase in ‘vesicular release probability’ as in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stevens and Wesseling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008</xref>) as long as it was measured based on RRP<sub>hyper</sub>.</p>

<title>Progressive overfilling of docking sites</title>
<p>Conventional models for facilitation assume an increase in p<sub>v</sub> after an AP of RRP vesicles, which had been in a low p<sub>v</sub> or reluctant state at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dittman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>). This facilitation model is unlikely to explain our results, because TS vesicles are predominantly released not only at rest but also in the facilitated state during or after train stimulation, as evidenced by the strong PPD (ISI, 25 ms) during a 5-Hz train (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D-E</italic></xref>) and at different intervals after a 40-Hz/30 pulse trains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref>). Moreover, the PPD (ISI, 25 ms) remained pronounced during the early phase of facilitation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref>), arguing against the possibility of slowly increasing the p<sub>v</sub> of reluctant vesicles. These results suggested that facilitation was mediated by an activity-dependent progressive increase in occupancy of TS vesicles (TS occupancy). Facilitation through an increase in TS occupancy has been termed frequency facilitation, differentiating it from paired pulse facilitation that relies on a residual calcium-dependent transient increase in the p<sub>v</sub> of releasable vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Neher, 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Assuming an increase in TS occupancy, to attain a two-fold increase in EPSC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref>), the baseline occupancy of the docking sites by TS vesicles should be low, as estimated from the V-M plot (c.a. 30% in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref>). However, it is unclear whether the remaining docking sites that are not occupied by TS vesicles are truly vacant or are occupied by reluctant LS vesicles that are not released by the AP or AP trains. TS vesicles can be supplied by the transformation of LS to TS vesicles, both of which reside at the same docking site (LS/TS model; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Neher, 2024</xref>). Alternatively, TS vesicles can be supplied from a distinct replacement pool (RS/DS model; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Silva et al., 2021</xref>). Further studies, including ultrastructural analyses of active zones, are required to address this issue.</p>
<p>Given the crucial role of Syt7 in facilitation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref>), the facilitation mechanisms are closely related to how Syt7 mediates synaptic facilitation. Based on the slow kinetics of Syt7, previous computational modeling studies have proposed that Syt7 may mediate short-term facilitation through an activity-dependent increase in p<sub>v</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Turecek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Norman et al., 2023</xref>). The present study, however, found that both facilitation and augmentation were mediated by overfilling of the release sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref>). Moreover, Syt7-KD synapses displayed slower recovery of TS vesicles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref>). These results suggest that Syt7 is essential for activity-dependent overfilling of docking sites with TS vesicles. Whereas the baseline EPSC was not altered (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 3</italic></xref>), and complementary changes in the number of docking sites and their baseline occupancy were observed in Syt7 KD synapses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref>). These results raise a possibility that Syt7 may play a role in providing additional vacant docking sites that can be overfilled during facilitation. It remains to be elucidated whether the decrease in the number of docking sites at Syt7 KD synapses is related to the subcellular localization of Syt7 to the plasma membrane of the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sugita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Vevea et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>STP model in light of known Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding kinetics of Syt7</title>
<p>Syt7 acts as an upstream Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that facilitates activity-dependent replenishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bacaj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tawfik et al., 2021</xref>). The present study shows that EPSCs are mediated by TS vesicles both at rest and during activity-dependent facilitation. Releasable vesicles are homogeneous, and Syt7-dependent overfilling is responsible for the activity-dependent enhancement of EPSCs. Thus, we tested whether slowly developing facilitation could be replicated within the framework of a simple refilling model based on the known Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding kinetics of Syt7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>). To this end, we made following assumptions: (1) a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in the forward refilling rate (k<sub>1</sub>) requires a full Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound form of Syt7, to which multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions can bind (two or three Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions on each C2A and/or C2B domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Voleti et al., 2017</xref>); (2) sequential Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding steps are synergistic through a cooperativity factor, <italic>b</italic>; (3) Syt7 senses AP-induced local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] similar to that estimated at the calyx of Held (a Gaussian function with a full width at half maximum value of 0.2 ms and a peak of 40 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wang et al., 2008</xref>); and (4) residual [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] follows a mono-exponential function with an amplitude of 1 μM and decay time constant of 50 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jackson and Redman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Under these assumptions and the framework of the simple refilling model, slow and delayed facilitation could be replicated by modeling k<sub>1</sub> as k<sub>1</sub> = k<sub>1,b</sub> + K<sub>1,max</sub> ξ [Syt7: n Ca<sup>2+</sup>], where [Syt7: n Ca<sup>2+</sup>] represents the fraction of fully Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound Syt7 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 9A-C</italic></xref>). Syt7 was slowly activated over the course of the stimulus train, suggesting that the cooperative binding of multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions progressively increased the putative active form of Syt7 because of its slow membrane binding/unbinding kinetics. Nevertheless, the late phase of facilitation at high frequencies was predicted to be higher in the simulation than in the experiment. As expected, based on the notion that sustained release during HFS is limited by site clearance in the active zone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref>), the model/data discrepancy became more pronounced at higher frequencies. Incorporating endocytic terms into the model may mitigate late-phase discrepancies. Moreover, removal of the catalytic function of Syt7 in the model effectively accounted for the complete loss of facilitation observed in Syt7 KD (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 9D</italic></xref>).</p>

<title>Conventional STF models involving cumulative increase in p<sub>v</sub> of reluctant vesicles</title>
<p>Conventional models for facilitation assume a post-AP residual Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent step increase in p<sub>v</sub> of RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dittman et al., 2000</xref>) or reluctant vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>). Given that p<sub>v</sub> of TS vesicles is close to one in the present study, an increase in p<sub>v</sub> of TS vesicles cannot account for facilitation. The possibility for activity-dependent increase in fusion probability of LS vesicles (denoted as p<sub>v,LS</sub>) should be considered in two ways depending on whether LS and TS vesicles reside in distinct pools or in the same pool. Notably, strong PPD at short ISI implies that p<sub>v,LS</sub> is near zero at the resting state. Whereas LS vesicles do not contribute to baseline transmission, short-term facilitation (STF) may be mediated by cumulative increase in p<sub>v</sub> of LS vesicles that reside in a distinct pool. Because the increase in p<sub>v,LS</sub> during facilitation recruits new release sites (increase in N), the variance of EPSCs should become larger as stimulation frequency increases, resulting in upward deviation from a parabola in the V-M plane, as shown in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Valera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kobbersmed et al., 2020</xref>). This prediction is not compatible with our results of V-M analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref>), showing that EPSCs during STF fell on the same parabola regardless of stimulation frequencies. Therefore, it is unlikely that an increase in fusion probability of reluctant vesicles residing in a distinct release pool mediates STF in the present study. For the latter case, in which LS and TS vesicles occupy in the same release sites, it is hard to distinguish a step increase in fusion probability of LS vesicles from a conversion of LS vesicles to TS. Nevertheless, our results do not support the possibility for a gradual increase in p<sub>v,LS</sub> that occurs in parallel with STF. Strong PPD, indicative of high p<sub>v</sub>, was consistently found not only in the baseline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2—figure supplement 1</italic></xref>) but also during post-tetanic augmentation phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref>) and even during the early development of facilitation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D-E</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref>), arguing against the gradual increase in p<sub>v,LS</sub>. One may argue that STF may be mediated by a drastic step increase of p<sub>v,LS</sub> from zero to one, but it is not distinguishable from conversion of LS to TS vesicles.</p>

<title>Possible mechanisms underlying the depression-facilitation sequence</title>
<p>Cooperative binding of multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to Syt7 predicts delayed activation and a progressive increase in vesicle refilling during train stimulations, resulting in delayed facilitation. Combining this with a high p<sub>v</sub> could replicate not only the slow facilitation at 5 Hz, but also the unique depression-facilitation sequence observed at 40 Hz (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref>). As simulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pulido and Marty (2018)</xref>, delayed facilitation can be reproduced by a high p<sub>v</sub> in combination with a low baseline occupancy of replacement sites and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent refilling. However, whether this model is also able to replicate slow facilitation at low frequencies remains to be tested. An alternative, but not exclusive, possibility for delayed facilitation is that the presynaptic global Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself may undergo a slow buildup during a train due to the saturation of endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins.</p>

<title>Facilitation requires not only Syt7, but also activation of PLC-DAG signaling</title>
<p>To gain insight into the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the vesicle-loading processes, we examined the effects of pharmacological inhibitors targeting PLC and DAG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref>). Both a PLC inhibitor and a DAG analog reduced facilitation and augmentation. This suggests that the progressive overfilling of docking sites with TS vesicles is supported by the PLC-DAG signaling pathway and probably downstream Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lou et al., 2008</xref>). Phorbol esters have been recently shown to increase the TS fraction of docked vesicles by enhancing vesicle priming without affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients or p<sub>v</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Taschenberger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aldahabi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Papantoniou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aldahabi et al., 2024</xref>).

<title>Roles of facilitation and augmentation in working memory and related tasks</title>
<p>Previous theoretical studies have proposed that working memory in a recurrent network can be maintained in the form of augmentation at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>) and/or persistent activity of neurons in a memory ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mongillo et al., 2012</xref>). The latter can be supported by short-term facilitation of recurrent excitatory synapses or disparity in STP between excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mongillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>). However, whether these short-term enhancements in synaptic efficacy contribute to working memory-related behaviors has not been examined. tFC is a temporal associative learning task requiring temporary retention of CS information during a trace period. The mPFC and hippocampus are crucial for tFC, and tFC is interfered with by a load of working memory and attention distraction, implying that the tFC shares the same neural substrate with other working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Raybuck and Lattal, 2014</xref>). In the present study, tFC in WT and Syt7 KD animals revealed that Syt7 deficiency in the L2/3 PCs of the mPFC impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos expression associated with tFC training (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>The acquisition of trace fear memory was impaired by inhibition of persistent activity in mPFC during trace period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gilmartin et al., 2013</xref>). The similar deficit observed in Syt7 KD animals is consistent with the hypothesis that STF provides bi-stable ensemble activity in a recurrent network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mongillo et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, alternative mechanisms may be responsible for the behavioral deficit. Not only recurrent network but also long-range loop between the mPFC and the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus play a critical role in maintaining persistent activity within the mPFC especially for a delay period longer than 10 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bolkan et al., 2017</xref>). Prefrontal L2/3 is heavily innervated by MD thalamus, and L2/3-PCs subsequently relay signals to L5 cortico-thalamic (CT) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Collins et al., 2018</xref>). Given that L2/3 is an essential component of the PFC-thalamic loop, loss of STF at recurrent synapses between L2/3 PCs may lead to insufficient L2/3 inputs to L5 CT neurons and failure in the reverberant PFC-MD thalamic feedback loop. Therefore, not only L2/3 recurrent network but also its output to downstream network should be considered as a possible network mechanism underlying behavioral deficit caused by Syt7 KD L2/3.</p>
<p>In summary, activity-dependent synaptic facilitation and augmentation at prelimbic L2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses can be attributed to overfilling of release sites with TS vesicles. Given that the lack of short-term facilitation in L2/3 PCs impairs trace fear memory acquisition, temporary maintenance of CS information during trace period may be supported by an increase in the TS occupancy in presynaptic terminals of CS-representing neuronal ensembles.</p>

<title>In utero electroporation (IUE)</title>
<p>Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats on embryonic day (E) 17.5 were deeply anesthetized with 5% (v/v) isoflurane for the duration of surgery. The uterine horns were exposed by laparotomy and wet with warm sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The plasmids (0.5-2 µg/µl) together with the 0.01% fast green dye were injected into either the left or the right lateral ventricle or bilateral ventricles of embryos through a thin glass capillary (Narishige PC-10). The embryo’s head was carefully held between the forceps-shaped electrodes of 10 mm diameter (CUY65010; NEPAGENE, Japan). Electroporation pulses (50 V for 50 ms) were delivered five times at intervals of 150 ms using a square-wave generator (ECM830; BEX, United States). The uterine horns were placed back into the abdominal cavity and abdominal muscles and skin were sutured. After the surgery, the animals were recovered under the infrared lamp. For knockdown experiments in slice electrophysiology, the shRNA constructs were co-electroporated with the pCAG-oChIEF-tdTomato, because of the consistent co-expression of the two constructs in a significant proportion of the transfected cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bony et al., 2013</xref>).

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed from pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons in layer 2/3 of the prelimbic mPFC. Neuronal subtypes were initially selected based on morphology under visual guidance by using an upright microscope equipped with infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) optics (BX51WI, Olympus), and were further identified by their electrophysiological properties (see <xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">van Aerde and Feldmeyer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). To analyze these intrinsic properties in current-clamp experiments, we measured the following parameters: (1) resting membrane potential (RMP), (2) input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>), (3) sag ratio, and (4) the F-I curve, which plots firing frequencies (F) against the amplitude of injected currents (I). Both cell types exhibited a low sag ratio below 0.1, consistent with findings from other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">van Aerde and Feldmeyer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>). PCs and FSINs were easily distinguished by their unique firing frequency, Rin, spike adaptation, RMP and morphological characteristics including the shape of soma and the thickness of apical dendrites. For experiments involving oChIEF-expressing neurons in WT or Syt7 KD rats, whole-cell recordings were performed from the fluorescently labeled pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of the prelimbic cortex using suitable filter sets. Patch pipettes (tip resistance of 2–3 MΩ) were pulled from borosilicate glass and filled with (in mM) 130 K-gluconate, 8 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 20 Na<sub>2</sub>Pcr, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 4 MgATP.

<title>Synaptic stimulation</title>
<p>IUE resulted in sparse expression of channelrhodopsin (10-20%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref>). Exploiting the sparse expression, we employed a minimal optical stimulation method to activate a single or very few excitatory synapses in layer 2/3. The optic minimal stimulation was performed by our published protocol with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>). This approach aimed to minimize the risk of synaptic contamination, which could arise from engaging extra terminals that were initially inactive (depolarized below threshold) but became active by temporal summation during high-frequency trains. It also helped prevent the buildup of depolarization at the synaptic terminals, which might influence the probability of release, as noted by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jackman et al., 2014</xref> ). To achieve this, we employed a collimated digital micromirror device (DMD)-coupled LED (Polygon400; Mightex Systems) to confine 470 nm blue light to a small area with a radius of approximately 3–8 μm (typically 3–4 μm), as measured at the focal plane of a 60× water immersion objective [numerical aperture (NA) = 1.0; LUMPlanFL, Olympus] (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</italic></xref>). To find the minimal stimulation area, the radius of illumination area was increased from 2 μm by 50% at each step (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</italic></xref>), and selected the smallest illumination area that elicited EPSCs. Setting the duration of illumination between 3 and 5 ms (typically 5 ms), photostimulation onto oChIEF-expressing cells reliably induced action potentials (APs) during 600-pulse trains (see <xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 2</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>STP at various stimulus frequencies (5, 10, 20, and 40 Hz) was examined using 20-pulse trains. Trials of train stimulation were repeated with a prolonged interval of 30 s to avoid change in baseline properties. We observed no systematic changes in the amplitudes of the first EPSC of each train, nor did we find significant differences in the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) across stimulation trials in the same cell. For each stimulus frequency, approximately ten to twenty consecutive traces were collected and then averaged across trials to yield a mean EPSC trace. For recovery experiments, two consecutive trains of 3 or 30 stimuli at 40 Hz, with varying time intervals (0.1-10 s), were applied every 10 s or 60 s, respectively, at both excitatory synapses. For 600-stimulus trains at 10Hz, the trial was delivered only once for each cell to avoid possible after-effects caused by prolonged synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hirsch and Crepel, 1990</xref>). Prior to the stimulus trains, the EPSCs were normalized to the mean amplitude of the baseline. For the baseline measurements, paired pulses with various ISIs (20-200 ms) were delivered every 3 s (1/3 Hz) at least 20 times.</p>
<p>For all recordings, picrotoxin (PTX, 10 μM) was included in the recording solution to isolate glutamatergic responses. mPFC PC terminals were entirely glutamatergic as the application of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 20 μM), an AMPA receptor antagonist, completely abolished the monosynaptic events evoked by photostimulation. A low concentration of PTX was employed to minimize the relieving effects on spike suppression caused by blockade of GABAa receptors. We confirmed that no synaptic response was elicited by electrical stimulation in the presence of both 10 μM PTX and 20 μM CNQX.</p>

In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>— figure supplement 5A</italic>, 50 µM of cyclothiazide, a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptors, was included to minimize rapid desensitization of the postsynaptic receptors.

<p>Cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at single axonal boutons was estimated by employing the two-dye, dual-excitation wavelength technique as described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Oheim et al., 1998</xref>). This method involves measuring the fluorescence ratio of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dye to that of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive dye to correct for dye concentrations. We used Fluo-5F at concentrations of 150, 250, or 500 μM (dissociation constant, K<sub>d</sub> = 2.3 μM) as the calcium indicator dye and Alexa Flour 555 (50 μM) as the reference dye. The fluorophores were from Invitrogen. Both dyes were co-loaded into presynaptic terminals of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in mPFC through whole-cell patch clamp. Before data acquisition, the dyes were allowed to diffuse to terminal boutons for at least 30 minutes after the patch break-in, a duration sufficient for the equilibrium of dye concentrations between the soma and its axonal terminals.</p>
<p>Calcium imaging was performed by sequentially exciting Fluo-5F and AF555 at wavelengths of 473 and 559 nm, respectively, using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (FV1200; Olympus, Japan) equipped with a 60× water immersion objective (NA, 0.9; LUMPlanFl; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Once a single axonal bouton was identified, lines for scanning were drawn across boutons, oriented perpendicular to the axon (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-B</italic></xref>). After baseline fluorescence was measured, line scanning was proceeded while a single or train APs were induced by applying current pulses. Upon stimulation, green fluorescence but not red one increased along the vertical array of lines across the bouton (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2—figure supplement 2B-C</italic></xref>). Measurements were obtained under current-clamp conditions, with the resting potential regularly monitored. The scanning speed was adjusted to 600-700 Hz by controlling the line length. Line scan for measuring fluorescent transients in a bouton was repeated at least 3 times, and then averaged to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. To mitigate photobleaching, minimal intensity of the laser power and maximal pinhole size were used. Emitted light was filtered through 490/590 or 575/675 bandpass filters before detection by photomultiplier tubes for green or red fluorescence, respectively.</p>

<title>Trace fear conditioning</title>
<p>For trace fear conditioning (tFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gilmartin et al., 2013</xref>), individual rats were placed in the training chamber (30.5 x 25.4 x 30.5 cm; Coulbourn Instruments) consisting of metal grid floor connected to an electrical stimulator (H10-11R-TC-SF, Coulbourn Instruments) for delivery of a footshock. After a 5 min habituation period, rats received five pairings of a 20 s tone conditioned stimulus (CS, 2.5 kHz, 75 dB), followed by empty 20s trace period and a unconditioned stimulus (US; 1 s, 0.7 mA footshock) with a pseudorandom inter-trial interval (ITI) of 240 ± 20 s. During this training session, rats learned to associate the auditory CS with the shock US. The next day, the rats were tested for memory of CS-US trace association (called tone test). The acquisition of fear learning, often indicated by the extent of freezing to the CS, was assessed in a novel chamber (a white hexagonal enclosure) in a dimly lit room. During this tone (or retrieval) test, rats were first allowed to explore the new context for 5 min (habituation), followed by twelve 20 s CS presentations with a variable ITI of 120 ± 20 s. This entire session was repeated on the next day for assessment of extinction learning. Identities of the chambers were also determined with the presence of distinct odors; the training and testing chambers were cleaned with 70% ethanol and 1% acetic acid respectively before and after each session. For all experimental sessions, the activity of animals in the chambers was recorded at 30 frames per second using the EthoVision XT (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands), and stored as a video file. The freezing behavior, defined as behavioral immobility other than respiratory movement, was assessed using an open-source video analysis pipeline ezTrack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pennington et al., 2019</xref>). The percentage of freezing was calculated as a total duration of freezing divided by the total duration of observation.</p>

<title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>At the end of the behavioral experiments, rats were anesthetized using isoflurane inhalation and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, T&amp;I, Korea). Brains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% PFA solution for 24 h. Perfused brains were sliced at 100 μm for estimation of GFP expression or 50 μm for immunohistochemistry. For analysis of c-Fos expression, rats were returned to their home cages immediately after the training session and perfused approximately 90 minutes later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arime and Akiyama, 2017</xref>). Brains were then cryopreserved, frozen, and sectioned coronally. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted on free-floating slices using a rabbit monoclonal anti c-fos (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, cat# 2250s) and mouse monoclonal anti-GAD67 (1:500, Millipore, cat# mab5406). Fluorescent secondary antibodies included Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Abcam, cat# ab97077) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Abcam, cat# ab97035). Brain slices were permeabilized and blocked with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum (NGS) for 1h at room temperature. Slices were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, followed by 4 h incubation with secondary antibodies at room temperature. Slices were then mounted with Antifading Mounting medium (Abcam, cat# ab104139). Confocal images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP8 microscope set to the same laser intensity and acquisition parameters to compare the immunosignals in sections from Scr and Syt7 KD groups.

<caption><title>Validation of STP of optically evoked EPSCs</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The high p<sub>v</sub> at PC-PC synapses may result from direct photo-stimulation of axon boutons. To test if optically evoked EPSCs depend on APs, the effect of 1 µM tetrodotoxin (TTX) was tested. Applying 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and additionally 0.1 mM 4-aminopyridine, a D-type K channel blocker abolished optically evoked EPSCs (n = 8). Even when repolarization was hindered by subsequent addition of 100 µM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a potassium channel blocker, EPSCs were not rescued. These findings suggest that the light-evoked responses are dependent on APs of presynaptic axon fibers rather than photo-induced depolarization of presynaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Little and Carter, 2013</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) It has been shown that multi-vesicular release occurs at recurrent excitatory synapses in neocortical L2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Holler et al., 2021</xref>). Whereas a single vesicle release is insufficient to saturate postsynaptic AMPARs, an increase in the number of vesicular release during facilitation may saturate AMPAR resulting in underestimation of facilitation.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> work explores how synaptic activity encodes information during memory tasks. All reviewers agree that the work is of very high quality and that the methodological approach is praiseworthy. Although the experimental data support the possibility that phospholipase diacylglycerol signaling and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) dynamically regulate the vesicle pool required for presynaptic release, concerns remain that the central finding of paired-pulse depression at very short intervals may be more likely due to Ca²⁺ channel inactivation rather than vesicle pool depletion. Overall, this is a <bold>solid</bold> study although the results warrant consideration of alternative interpretations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Shin et al aim to identify in a very extensive piece of work a mechanism that contributes to dynamic regulation of synaptic output in the rat cortex at the second time scale. This mechanism is related to a new powerful model and is well versed to test if the pool of SV ready for fusion is dynamically scaled to adjust supply demand aspects. The methods applied are state-of-the-art and both address quantitative aspects with high signal to noise. In addition, the authors examine both excitatory output onto glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, which provides important information on how general the observed signals are in neural networks. The results are compellingly clear and show that pool regulation may be predominantly responsible. Their results suggests that a regulation of release probability, the alternative contender for regulation, is unlikely to be involved in the observed short term plasticity behavior (but see below). Besides providing a clear analysis pof the underlying physiology, they test two molecular contenders for the observed mechanism by showing that loss of Synaptotagmin7 function and the role of the Ca dependent phospholipase activity seems critical for the short term plasticity behavior. The authors go on to test the in vivo role of the mechanism by modulating Syt7 function and examining working memory tasks as well as overall changes in network activity using immediate early gene activity. Finally, they model their data, providing strong support for their interpretation of TS pool occupancy regulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very thorough study, addressing the research question from many different angles and the experimental execution is superb. The impact of the work is high, as it applies recent models of short term plasticity behavior to in vivo circuits further providing insights how synapses provide dynamic control to enable working memory related behavior through non-permanent changes in synaptic output.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While this work is carefully examined and the results are presented and discussed in a detailed manner, the reviewer is still not fully convinced that regulation of release probability is not a putative contributor to the observed behavior. No additional work is needed, but in the moment, I am not convinced that changes in release probability are not in play. One solution may be to extend the discussion of changes in rules probability as an alternative.</p>
<p>Fig 3. I am confused about the interpretation of the Mean Variance analysis outcome. Since the data points follow the curve during induction of short term plasticity, doesn't these suggests that release probability and not the pool size increases? Related, to measure the absolute release probability and failure rate using the optogenetic stimulation technique is not trivial as the experimental paradigm bias the experiment to a given output strength, and therefore a change in release probability cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>Fig. 4B interprets the phorbol ester stimulation to be the result of pool overfilling, however, phorbol ester stimulation has also been shown to increase release probability without changing the size of the readily releasable pool. The high frequency of stimulation may occlude a increased paired pulse depression in presence of OAG, that others have interpreted in mammalian synapses as an increase in release probability.</p>
<p>The literature on Syt7 function is still quite controversial. An observation in the literature that loss of Syt7 function in the fly synapse leads to an increase of release probability. Thus the observed changes in short term plasticity characteristics in the Syt7 KD experiments may contain a release probability component. Can the authors really exclude this possibility? Figure 5 shows for the Syt7 KD group a very prominent depression of the EPSC/IPSC with the second stimulus, particularly for the short interpulse intervals, usually a strong sign of increased release probability, as lack of pool refilling can unlikely explain the strong drop in synaptic output.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I am satisfied with the reply of the authors and I do not have any further points of concern.</p>

<p>The results are consistent with the main claim that facilitation is caused by overfilling a readily releasable pool, but alternative interpretations continue to seem more likely, especially when the current results are taken together with previous studies. Key doubts could be resolved with a single straightforward experiment (see below).</p>
<p>The central issue is the interpretation of paired pulse depression that occurs when the interval between action potentials is 25 ms, but not when 50. To summarize: a similar phenomenon was observed at Schaffer collateral synapses (Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997), but was interpreted as evidence for a decrease in pv. Ca2+-channel inactivation was proposed as the mechanism, but this was not proven. The key point for evaluating the current study is that Dobrunz and Stevens specifically ruled out the kind of decrease in pocc that is the keystone premise of the current study because the depression occurred independently of whether or not the first action potential elicited exocytosis. Of course, the mechanism might be different at layer 2/3 cortical synapses. But, it seems reasonable to hope that the older hypothesis would be ruled out for the cortical synapses before concluding that the new hypothesis must be correct.</p>
<p>The old and new hypotheses could be distinguished from each other cleanly with a straightforward experiment. Most/maybe all central synapses strengthen a great amount when extracellular Ca2+ is increased from 1.3 to 2 mM, even when intracellular Ca2+ is buffered with EGTA. According to the authors' model, this is only possible when pv is low, and so could not occur at synapses between layer 2/3 neurons. Because of this, confirmation that increasing extracellular Ca2+ does not change synaptic strength would support the hypothesis that baseline pv is high, as the authors claim, and the support would be impressive because large changes have been seen at every other type of synapse where this has been studied (to my knowledge at least). In contrast, the Ca2+ imaging experiment that has been added to the new version of the manuscript does not address the central issue because a wide range of mechanisms could, in principle, decrease release without involving prior exocytosis or altering bulk Ca2+ signals, including: a small decrease in nano-domain Ca2+, which wouldn't be detected because nano-domains contribute a minuscule amount to the bulk signal during Ca2+-imaging; or even very fast activity-dependent undocking of synaptic vesicles, which was reported in the same Kusick et al, 2020 study that is central to the LS/TS terminology adopted by the authors.</p>
<p>Additional points:</p>
<p>(1) A new section in the Discussion (lines 458-475) suggests that previous techniques employed to show that augmentation and facilitation are caused by increases in pv did not have the resolution to distinguish between pv and pocc, but this is misleading. The confusion might be because the terminology has changed, but this is all the more reason to clarify this section. The previous evidence for increases in pv - and against increases in pocc - is as follows: The residual Ca2+ that drives augmentation decreases the latency between the onset of hypertonic solution and onset of the postsynaptic response by about 150 ms, which is large compared to the rise time of the response. The decrease indicates that the residual Ca2+ drives a decrease in the energy barrier that must be overcome before readily releasable vesicles can undergo exocytosis, which is precisely the type of mechanism that would enhance pv. In contrast, an increase in pocc could change the rise time, but not the latency. There is a small change in the rise time, but this could be caused by changes in either pv or pocc, and one of the studies (Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008) showed that augmentation occluded facilitation, even at times when pocc was reduced by a factor of 3, which would seem to argue against parallel increases in both pv and pocc.</p>
<p>(2) Similar evidence from hypertonic stimulation indicates that Phorbol esters increase pv, but I am not aware of evidence ruling out a parallel increase in pocc.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>There are at least two straightforward ways to address the main concern.</p>
<p>The first would be experiments analogous to those in Dobrunz and Stevens that show that - unlike at Schaffer collateral synapses - paired pulse depression at L2/3 synapses requires neurotransmitter release. I proposed this in the first round, but realized since that a simpler and more powerful strategy would be to test directly that pv is/is-not near 1.0 in 1.2 mM Ca2+ simply by increasing to 2 mM Ca2+ (and showing that synaptic strength does-not/does change). This would be powerful because the increase in Ca2+ greatly increases synaptic strength at Schaffer collaterals by about 2.5-fold. Concerns about a confounding elevation in the basal intracellular Ca2+ concentration could be easily neutralized by pre-treating with EGTA-AM, which the authors have already done for other experiments.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This valuable work explores how synaptic activity encodes information during memory tasks. All reviewers agree that the quality of the work is high. Although experimental data do support the possibility that phospholipase diacylglycerol signaling and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) dynamically regulate the vesicle pool required for presynaptic release, concerns remain that the central finding of paired pulse depression at very short intervals was more likely caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation than pool depletion. Overall, this is a solid study with valuable findings, but the results warrant consideration of alternative interpretations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate invaluable and constructive comments from Editors and Reviewers. We also thank for their time and patience. We are pleased for our manuscript to have been assessed valuable and solid.</p>
<p>One of the most critical concerns was a possible involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation in the strong paired pulse depression (PPD). Meanwhile, we have measured total (free plus buffered) calcium increments induced by each of first four APs in 40 Hz trains at axonal boutons of prelimbic layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. We found that first four Ca<sup>2+</sup> increments were not different from one another, arguing against possible contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation to PPD. Please see our reply to the 2nd issue in the Weakness section of Reviewer #3.</p>
<p>The second critical issue was on the definition of ‘vesicular probability’. Previously, vesicular probability (p<sub>v</sub>) has been used with reference to the releasable vesicle pool which includes not only tightly docked vesicles but also reluctant vesicles. On the other hand, the meaning of p<sub>v</sub> in the present study is the release probability of tightly docked vesicles. We clarified this point in our replies to the 1st issues in the Weakness sections of Reviewer #2 and Reviewer #3.</p>
<p>We below described our point-by-point replies to the Reviewers’ comments.</p>

<p>Quantal content (m) depends on n * p<sub>v</sub>, where n = RRP size and p<sub>v</sub> =vesicular release probability. The value for p<sub>v</sub> critically depends on the definition of RRP size. Recent studies revealed that docked vesicles have differential priming states: loosely or tightly docked state (LS or TS, respectively). Because the RRP size estimated by hypertonic solution or long presynaptic depolarization is larger than that by back extrapolation of a cumulative EPSC plot (Moulder &amp; Mennerick, 2005; Sakaba, 2006) in glutamatergic synapses, the former RRP (denoted as RRP<sub>hyper</sub>) may encompass not only AP-evoked fast-releasing vesicles (TS vesicle) but also reluctant vesicles (LS vesicles). Because we measured p<sub>v</sub> based on AP-evoked EPSCs such as strong paired pulse depression (PPD) and associated failure rates, p<sub>v</sub> in the present study denotes vesicular fusion probability of TS vesicles, not that of LS plus TS vesicles.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest that release sites are not fully occupied by TS vesicles in the baseline (Miki et al., 2016; Pulido and Marty, 2018; Malagon et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2022). Instead, the occupancy (p<sub>occ</sub>) by TS vesicles is subject to dynamic regulation by reversible rate constants (denoted by k<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>, respectively). The number of TS vesicles (n) can be factored into the number of release sites (N) and p<sub>occ</sub>, among which N is a fixed parameter but p<sub>occ</sub> depends on k<sub>1</sub>/(k<sub>1</sub>+b<sub>1</sub>) under the framework of the simple refilling model (see Methods). Because these refilling rate constants are regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Hosoi, et al., 2008), p<sub>occ</sub> is not a fixed parameter. Therefore, release probability should be re-defined as p<sub>occ</sub> * p<sub>v</sub>. Given that N is fixed, the increase in release probability is a major player in STF. Our study asserts that STF by 2.3 times can be attributed to an increase in p<sub>occ</sub> rather than p<sub>v</sub>, because p<sub>v</sub> is close to unity (Fig. S8). Moreover, strong PPD was observed not only in the baseline but also at the early and in the middle of a train (Fig. 2 and 7) and during the recovery phase (Fig. 3), arguing against a gradual increase in p<sub>v</sub> of reluctant vesicles.</p>
<p>We imagine that the Reviewer meant vesicular release or fusion probability (p<sub>v</sub>) by ‘release probability’. If so, p<sub>v</sub> (of TS vesicles) cannot be a major player in STF, because the baseline p<sub>v</sub> is already higher than 0.8 even if it is most parsimoniously estimated (Fig. 2). Moreover, considering very high refilling rate (23/s), the high double failure rate cannot be explained without assuming that p<sub>v</sub> is close to unity (Fig. S8).</p>
<p>Conventional models for facilitation assume a post-AP residual Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent step increase in p<sub>v</sub> of RRP (Dittman et al., 2000) or reluctant vesicles (Turecek et al., 2016). Given that p<sub>v</sub> of TS vesicles is close to one, an increase in p<sub>v</sub> of TS vesicles cannot account for facilitation. The possibility for activity-dependent increase in fusion probability of LS vesicles (denoted as p<sub>v,LS</sub>) should be considered in two ways depending on whether LS and TS vesicles reside in distinct pools or in the same pool. Notably, strong PPD at short ISI implies that p<sub>v,LS</sub> is near zero at the resting state. Whereas LS vesicles do not contribute to baseline transmission, short-term facilitation (STF) may be mediated by cumulative increase in p<sub>v v,LS </sub> that reside in a distinct pool. Because the increase in p<sub>v,LS</sub> during facilitation recruits new release sites (increase in N), the variance of EPSCs should become larger as stimulation frequency increases, resulting in upward deviation from a parabola in the V-M plane, as shown in recent studies (Valera et al., 2012; Kobbersmed et al., 2020). This prediction is not compatible with our results of V-M analysis (Fig. 3), showing that EPSCs during STF fell on the same parabola regardless of stimulation frequencies. Therefore, it is unlikely that an increase in fusion probability of reluctant vesicles residing in a distinct release pool mediates STF in the present study.</p>
<p>For the latter case, in which LS and TS vesicles occupy in the same release sites, it is hard to distinguish a step increase in fusion probability of LS vesicles from a conversion of LS vesicles to TS. Nevertheless, our results do not support the possibility for gradual increase in p<sub>v,LS</sub> that occurs in parallel with STF. Strong PPD, indicative of high p<sub>v</sub>, was consistently found not only in the baseline (Fig. 2 and Fig. S6) but also during post-tetanic augmentation phase (Fig. 3D) and even during the early development of facilitation (Fig. 2D-E and Fig. 7), arguing against gradual increase in p<sub>v,LS</sub>. One may argue that STF may be mediated by a drastic step increase of p<sub>v,LS</sub> from zero to one, but it is not distinguishable from conversion of LS to TS vesicles.</p>
<p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we incorporated these perspectives into Discussion and further clarified the reasoning behind our conclusions.</p>

<p>(2) Fig 3 I am confused about the interpretation of the Mean Variance analysis outcome. Since the data points follow the curve during induction of short term plasticity, aren't these suggesting that release probability and not the pool size increases? Related, to measure the absolute release probability and failure rate using the optogenetic stimulation technique is not trivial as the experimental paradigm bias the experiment to a given output strength, and therefore a change in release probability cannot be excluded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Under the recent definition of release probability, it can be factored into p<sub>v</sub> and p<sub>occ</sub>, which are fusion probability of TS vesicles and the occupancy of release sites by TS vesicles, respectively. With this regard, our interpretation of the Variance-Mean results is consistent with conventional one: different data points along a parabola represent a change in release probability (= p<sub>occ</sub> x p<sub>v</sub>). Our novel finding is that the increase in release probability should be attributed to an increase in p<sub>occ</sub>, not to that in p<sub>v</sub>.</p>

<p>(3) Fig4B interprets the phorbol ester stimulation to be the result of pool overfilling, however, phorbol ester stimulation has also been shown to increase release probability without changing the size of the readily releasable pool. The high frequency of stimulation may occlude an increased paired pulse depression in presence of OAG, which others have interpreted in mammalian synapses as an increase in release probability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To our experience in the calyx of Held synapses, OAG, a DAG analogue, increased the fast releasing vesicle pool (FRP) size (Lee JS et al., 2013), consistent with our interpretation (pool overfilling). Once the release sites are overfilled in the presence of OAG, it is expected that the maximal STF (ratio of facilitated to baseline EPSCs) becomes lower as long as the number of release sites (N) are limited. As aforementioned, the baseline p<sub>v</sub> is already close to one, and thus it cannot be further increased by OAG. Instead, the baseline p<sub>occ</sub> seems to be increased by OAG.</p>

<p>(4) The literature on Syt7 function is still quite controversial. An observation in the literature that loss of Syt7 function in the fly synapse leads to an increase of release probability. Thus the observed changes in short term plasticity characteristics in the Syt7 KD experiments may contain a release probability component. Can the authors really exclude this possibility? Figure 5 shows for the Syt7 KD group a very prominent depression of the EPSC/IPSC with the second stimulus, particularly for the short interpulse intervals, usually a strong sign of increased release probability, as lack of pool refilling can unlikely explain the strong drop in synaptic output.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an interesting point regarding the potential link between Syt7 KD and increased initial p<sub>v</sub>, particularly in light of observations in Drosophila synapses (Guan et al., 2020; Fujii et al., 2021), in which Syt7 mutants exhibited elevated initial p<sub>v</sub>. However, it is important to note that these findings markedly differ from those in mammalian systems, where the role of Syt7 in regulating initial p<sub>v</sub> has been extensively studied. In rodents, consistent evidence indicates that Syt7 does not significantly affect initial p<sub>v</sub>, as demonstrated in several studies (Jackman et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Turecek and Regehr, 2018). Furthermore, in our study of excitatory synapses in the mPFC layer 2/3, we observed an initial p<sub>v</sub> already near its maximal level, approaching a value of 1. Consequently, it is unlikely that the loss of Syt7 could further elevate the initial p<sub>v</sub>. Instead, such effects are more plausibly explained by alternative mechanisms, such as alterations in vesicle replenishment dynamics, rather than a direct influence on p<sub>v</sub>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The report by Shin, Lee, Kim, and Lee entitled &quot;Progressive overfilling of readily releasable pool underlies short-term facilitation at recurrent excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 of the rat prefrontal cortex&quot; describes electrophysiological experiments of short-term synaptic plasticity during repetitive presynaptic stimulation at synapses between layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and nearby target neurons. Manipulations include pharmacological inhibition of PLC and actin polymerization, activation of DAG receptors, and shRNA knockdown of Syt7. The results are interpreted as support for the hypothesis that synaptic vesicle release sites are vacant most of the time at resting synapses (i.e., p_occ is low) and that facilitation (and augmentation) components of short-term enhancement are caused by an increase in occupancy, presumably because of acceleration of the transition from not-occupied to occupied. The report additionally describes behavioural experiments where trace fear conditioning is degraded by knocking down syt7 in the same synapses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of the study is in the new information about short-term plasticity at local synapses in layer 2/3, and the major disruption of a memory task after eliminating short-term enhancement at only 15% of excitatory synapses in a single layer of a small brain region. The local synapses in layer 2/3 were previously difficult to study, but the authors have overcome a number of challenges by combining channel rhodopsins with in vitro electroporation, which is an impressive technical advance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The question of whether or not short-term enhancement causes an increase in p_occ (i.e., &quot;readily releasable pool overfilling&quot;) is important because it cuts to the heart of the ongoing debate about how to model short term synaptic plasticity in general. However, my opinion is that, in their current form, the results do not constitute strong support for an increase in p_occ, even though this is presented as the main conclusion. Instead, there are at least two alternative explanations for the results that both seem more likely. Neither alternative is acknowledged in the present version of the report.</p>
<p>The evidence presented to support overfilling is essentially two-fold. The first is strong paired pulse depression of synaptic strength when the interval between action potentials is 20 or 25 ms, but not when the interval is 50 ms. Subsequent stimuli at frequencies between 5 and 40 Hz then drive enhancement. The second is the observation that a slow component of recovery from depression after trains of action potentials is unveiled after eliminating enhancement by knocking down syt7. Of the two, the second is predicted by essentially all models where enhancement mechanisms operate independently of release site depletion - i.e., transient increases in p_occ, p_v, or even N - so isn't the sort of support that would distinguish the hypothesis from alternatives (Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.01348.2007">https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.01348.2007</ext-link>).</p>

<p>The apparent discrepancy in interpretation of post-tetanic augmentation between the present and previous papers [Sevens Wesseling (1999), Garcia-Perez and Wesseling (2008)] is an important issue that should be clarified. We noted that different meanings of ‘vesicular release probability’ in these papers are responsible for the discrepancy. We added an explanation to Discussion on the difference in the meaning of ‘vesicular release probability’ between the present study and previous studies [Sevens Wesseling (1999), Garcia-Perez and Wesseling (2008)]. In summary, the p<sub>v</sub> in the present study was used for vesicular release probability of TS vesicles, while previous studies used it as vesicular release probability of vesicles in the RRP, which include LS and TS vesicles. Accordingly, p<sub>occ</sub> in the present study is the occupancy of release sites by TS vesicles.</p>
<p>Not only double failure rate but also other failure rates upon paired pulse stimulation were best fitted at p<sub>v</sub> close to 1 (Fig. S8 and associated text). Moreover, strong PPD, indicating release of vesicles with high p<sub>v</sub>, was observed not only at the beginning of a train but also in the middle of a 5 Hz train (Fig. 2D), during the augmentation phase after a 40 Hz train (Fig 3D), and in the recovery phase after three pulse bursts (Fig. 7). Given that p<sub>v</sub> is close to 1 throughout the EPSC trains and that N does not increase during a train (Fig. 3), synaptic facilitation can be attained only by the increase in p<sub>occ</sub> (occupancy of release sites by TS vesicles). In addition, it should be noted that Fig. 7 demonstrates strong PPD during the recovery phase after depletion of TS vesicles by three pulse bursts, indicating that recovered vesicles after depletion display high p<sub>v</sub> too. Knock-down of Syt7 slowed the recovery of TS vesicles after depletion of TS vesicles, highlighting that Syt7 accelerates the recovery of TS vesicles following their depletion.</p>
<p>As addressed in our reply to the first issue raised by Reviewer #2 and the third issue raised by Reviewer #3, our results do not support possibilities for recruitment of new release sites (increase in N) having low p<sub>v</sub> or for a gradual increase in p<sub>v</sub> of reluctant vesicles during short-term facilitation.</p>
<p>Following statement was added to Discussion in the revised manuscript</p>
<p>“Previous studies suggested that an increase in p<sub>v</sub> is responsible for post-tetanic augmentation (Stevens and Wesseling, 1999; Garcia-Perez and Wesseling, 2008) by observing invariance of the RRP size after tetanic stimulation. In these studies, the RRP size was estimated by hypertonic sucrose solution or as the sum of EPSCs evoked 20 Hz/60 pulses train (denoted as ‘RRP<sub>hyper</sub>’). Because reluctant vesicles (called LS vesicles) can be quickly converted to TS vesicles (16/s) and are released during a train (Lee et al., 2012), it is likely that the RRP size measured by these methods encompasses both LS and TS vesicles. In contrast, we assert high p<sub>v</sub> based on the observation of strong PPD and failure rates upon paired stimulations at ISI of 20 ms (Fig. 2 and Fig. S8). Given that single AP-induced vesicular release occurs from TS vesicles but not from LS vesicles, p<sub>v</sub> in the present study indicates the fusion probability of TS vesicles. From the same reasons, p<sub>occ</sub> denotes the occupancy of release sites by TS vesicles. Note that our study does not provide direct clue whether release sites are occupied by LS vesicles that are not tapped by a single AP, although an increase in the LS vesicle number may accelerate the recovery of TS vesicles. As suggested in Neher (2024), even if the number of LS plus TS vesicles are kept constant, an increase in p<sub>occ</sub> (occupancy by TS vesicles) would be interpreted as an increase in ‘vesicular release probability’ as in the previous studies (Stevens and Wesseling (1999); Garcia-Perez and Wesseling (2008)) as long as it was measured based on RRP<sub>hyper</sub>.”</p>

<p>(2) Regarding the paired pulse depression: The authors ascribe this to depletion of a homogeneous population of release sites, all with similar p_v. However, the details fit better with the alternative hypothesis that the depression is instead caused by quickly reversing inactivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels near release sites, as proposed by Dobrunz and Stevens to explain a similar phenomenon at a different type of synapse (1997, PNAS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.26.14843">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.26.14843</ext-link>). The details that fit better with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation include the combination of the sigmoid time course of the recovery from depression (plotted backwards in Fig1G,I) and observations that EGTA (Fig2B) increases the paired-pulse depression seen after 25 ms intervals. That is, the authors ascribe the sigmoid recovery to a delay in the activation of the facilitation mechanism, but the increased paired pulse depression after loading EGTA indicates, instead, that the facilitation mechanism has already caused p_r to double within the first 25 ms (relative to the value if the facilitation mechanism was not active). Meanwhile, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation would be expected to cause a sigmoidal recovery of synaptic strength because of the sigmoidal relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx and exocytosis (Dodge and Rahamimoff, 1967, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1967.sp008367">https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1967.sp008367</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel inactivation hypothesis could probably be ruled in or out with experiments analogous to the 1997 Dobrunz study, except after lowering extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the point where synaptic transmission failures are frequent. However, a possible complication might be a large increase in facilitation in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Fig2B of Stevens and Wesseling, 1999, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80685-6">https://doi.org/10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80685-6</ext-link>).</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer's thoughtful comment regarding the potential role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation in the observed paired-pulse depression (PPD). As noted by the Reviewer, the Dobrunz and Stevens (1997) suggested that the high double failure rate at short ISIs in synapses exhibiting PPD can be attributed to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation. This interpretation seems to be based on a premise that the number of RRP vesicles are not varied trial-by-trial. The number of TS vesicles, however, can be dynamically regulated depending on the parameters k<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>, as shown in Fig. S8, implying that the high double failure rate at short ISIs cannot be solely attributed to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the possibility that Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation may contribute to PPD, and therefore, we have further investigated this possibility. Specifically, we measured action potential (AP)-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at individual axonal boutons of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the mPFC using two-dye ratiometry techniques. Our analysis revealed no evidence for Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation during a 40 Hz train of APs. This finding indicates that voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation is unlikely to contribute to the pronounced PPD.</p>
<p>Figure 2—figure supplement 2 shows how we measured the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> increments at axonal boutons. First we estimated endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding ratio from analyses of single AP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at different concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye (panels A to E). And then, using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer properties, we converted free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] amplitudes to total calcium increments for the first four AP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in a 40 Hz train (panels G-I). We incorporated these results into the revised version of our manuscript to provide evidence against the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inactivation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) On the other hand, even if the paired pulse depression is caused by depletion of release sites rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel inactivation, there does not seem to be any support for the critical assumption that all of the release sites have similar p_v. And indeed, there seems to be substantial emerging evidence from other studies for multiple types of release sites with 5 to 20-fold differences in p_v at a wide variety of synapse types (Maschi and Klyachko, eLife, 2020, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.55210">https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.55210</ext-link>; Rodriguez Gotor et al, eLife, 2024, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.88212">https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.88212</ext-link> and refs. therein). If so, the paired pulse depression could be caused by depletion of release sites with high p_v, whereas the facilitation could occur at sites with much lower p_v that are still occupied. It might be possible to address this by eliminating assumptions about the distribution of p_v across release sites from the variance-mean analysis, but this seems difficult; simply showing how a few selected distributions wouldn't work - such as in standard multiple probability fluctuation analyses - wouldn't add much.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments regarding the potential increase in p<sub>fusion</sub> of reluctant vesicles. It should be noted, however, that Maschi and Klyachko (2020) showed a distribution of release probability (p<sub>r</sub>) within a single active zone rather than a heterogeneity in p<sub>fusion</sub> of individual docked vesicles. Therefore both p<sub>occ</sub> and p<sub>v</sub> of TS vesicles would contribute to the p<sub>r</sub> distribution shown in Maschi and Klyachko (2020).</p>
<p>The Reviewer’s concern aligns closely with the first issue raised by Reviewer #2, to which we addressed in detail. Briefly, new release site may not be recruited during facilitation or post-tetanic augmentation, because variance of EPSCs during and after a train fell on the same parabola (Fig. 3). Secondly, strong PPD was observed not only in the baseline but also during early and late phases of facilitation, indicating that vesicles with very high p<sub>v</sub> contribute to EPSC throughout train stimulations (Fig. 2, 3, and 7). These findings argue against the possibilities for recruitment of new release sites harboring low p<sub>v</sub> vesicles and for a gradual increase in fusion probability of reluctant vesicles.</p>
<p>To address the reviewers’ concern, we incorporated the perspectives into Discussion and further clarified the reasoning behind our conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In any case, the large increase - often 10-fold or more - in enhancement seen after lowering Ca<sup>2+</sup> below 0.25 mM at a broad range of synapses and neuro-muscular junctions noted above is a potent reason to be cautious about the LS/TS model. There is morphological evidence that the transitions from a loose to tight docking state (LS to TS) occur, and even that the timing is accelerated by activity. However, 10-fold enhancement would imply that at least 90 % of vesicles start off in the LS state, and this has not been reported. In addition, my understanding is that the reverse transition (TS to LS) is thought to occur within 10s of ms of the action potential, which is 10-fold too fast to account for the reversal of facilitation seen at the same synapses (Kusick et al, 2020, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00716-1">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00716-1</ext-link>).</p>

<p>As the Reviewer suggested, low external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration can lower release probability (p<sub>r</sub>). Given that both p<sub>v</sub> and p<sub>occ</sub> are regulated by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, low external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] may affect not only p<sub>v</sub> but also p<sub>occ</sub>, both of which would contribute to low p<sub>r</sub>. Under such conditions, it would be plausible that the baseline p<sub>r</sub> becomes much lower than 0.1 due to low p<sub>v</sub> and p<sub>occ</sub> (for instance, p<sub>v</sub> decreases from 1 to 0.5, and p<sub>occ</sub> from 0.3 to 0.1, then p<sub>r</sub> = 0.05), and then p<sub>r</sub> (= p<sub>v</sub> x p<sub>occ</sub>) has a room for an increase by a factor of ten (0.5, for example) by short-term facilitation as cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] accumulates during a train.</p>
<p>If p<sub>v</sub> is close to one, p<sub>r</sub> depends p<sub>occ</sub>, and thus facilitation depends on the number of TS vesicles just before arrival of each AP of a train. Thus, post-train recovery from facilitation would depend on restoration of equilibrium between TS and LS vesicles to the baseline. Even if transition between LS and TS vesicles is very fast (tens of ms), the equilibrium involved in <italic>de novo</italic> priming (reversible transitions between recycling vesicle pool and partially docked LS vesicles) seems to be much slower (13 s in Fig. 5A of Wu and Borst 1999). Thus, we can consider a two-step priming model (recycling pool -&gt; LS -&gt; TS), which is comprised of a slow 1st step (-&gt; LS) and a fast 2nd step (-&gt; TS). Under the framework of the two-step model, the slow 1st step (<italic>de novo</italic> priming step) is the rate limiting step regulating the development and recovery kinetics of facilitation. Given that on and off rate for Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to Syt7 is slow, it is plausible that Syt7 may contribute to short-term facilitation (STF) by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent acceleration of the 1st step (as shown in Fig. 9). During train stimulation, the number of LS vesicles would slowly accumulate in a Syt7 and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, and this increase in LS vesicles would shift LS/TS equilibrium towards TS, resulting in STF. After tetanic stimulation, the recovery kinetics from facilitation would be limited by slow recovery of LS vesicles.</p>

<p>Individual points:</p>
<p>(1) An additional problem with the overfilling hypothesis is that syt7 knockdown increases the estimate of p_occ extracted from the variance-mean analysis, which would imply a faster transition from unoccupied to occupied, and would consequently predict faster recovery from depression. However, recovery from depression seen in experiments was slower, not faster. Meanwhile, the apparent decrease in the estimate of N extracted from the mean-variance analysis is not anticipated by the authors' model, but fits well with alternatives where p_v varies extensively among release sites because release sites with low p_v would essentially be silent in the absence of facilitation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Slower recovery from depression observed in the Syt7 knockdown (KD) synapses (Fig. 7) may results from a deficiency in activity-dependent acceleration of TS vesicle recovery. Although basal occupancy was higher in the Syt7 KD synapses, this does not indicate a faster activity-dependent recovery.</p>
<p>Higher baseline occupancy does not always imply faster recovery of PPR too. Actually PPR recovery was slower in Syt7 KD synapses than WT one (18.5 vs. 23/s). Under the framework of the simple refilling model (Fig. S8Aa), the baseline occupancy and PPR recovery rate are calculated as k<sub>1</sub> / (k<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>) and (k<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>), respectively. The baseline occupancy depends on k<sub>1</sub>/b<sub>1</sub>, while the PPR recovery on absolute values of k<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>. Based on p<sub>occ</sub> and PPR recovery time constant of WT and KD synapses, we expect higher k<sub>1</sub>/b<sub>1</sub> but lower values for (k<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>) in Syt7 KD synapses compared to WT ones.</p>
<p>Lower release sites (N) in Syt7-KD synapses was not anticipated. As you suggested, such low N might be ascribed to little recruitment of release sites during a train in KD synapses. But our results do not support this model. If silent release sites are recruited during a train, the variance should upwardly deviate from the parabola predicted under a fixed N (Valera et al., 2012; Kobbersmed et al. 2020). Our result was not the case (Fig. 3). In the first version of the manuscript, we have argued against this possibility in line 203-208.</p>
<p>As discussed in both the Results and Discussion sections, the baseline EPSC was unchanged by KD (Fig. S3) because of complementary changes in the number of docking sites and their baseline occupancy (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that Syt7 may be involved in maintaining additional vacant docking sites, which could be overfilled during facilitation. It remains to be determined whether the decrease in docking sites in Syt7 KD synapses is related to its specific localization of Syt7 at the plasma membrane of active zones, as proposed in previous studies (Sugita et al., 2001; Vevea et al., 2021).</p>

<p>The reason why we used 4-AP in the presence of TTX was to increase the length constant of axon fibers and to facilitate the conduction of local depolarization in the illumination area to axon terminals. The lack of EPSC in the presence of 4-AP and TTX indicates that illumination area is distant from axon terminals enough for optic stimulation-induced local depolarization not to evoke synaptic transmission.

<p>(Reply to #3 and #4) We selected the target molecules as candidates based on their well-characterized roles in vesicle dynamics, and aimed to investigate what aspects of STP are affected by these molecules in our experimental context. For example, we could find that the baseline p<sub>occ</sub> and short-term facilitation (STF) are enhanced by the baseline DAG level and train stimulation-induced PLC activation, respectively. Notably, the effect of dynasore informed us that slow site clearing is responsible for the late depression of 40 Hz train EPSC. The knock-down experiments also provided us with information on the critical role of Syt7 in replenishment of TS vesicles. These approaches do not deviate from standard scientific reasoning but rather builds upon prior knowledge to formulate and test hypotheses.</p>
<p>Importantly, our conclusions do not rely solely on the assumption that altering the target molecule impacts synaptic transmission. Instead, our conclusions are derived from a comprehensive analysis of diverse outcomes obtained through both pharmacological and genetic manipulations. These interpretations align closely with prior literature, further validating our conclusions.</p>
<p>Therefore, the use of established studies to guide candidate selection and the consistency of our findings with existing knowledge do not represent a logical circularity but rather a reinforcement of the proposed mechanism through converging lines of evidence.</p>

<p>Comments:</p>
<p>(1) While the authors claim that Syt7-mediated facilitation is connected to the behavioral deficits they observed, this link is still somewhat speculative. This manuscript could benefit from further discussions of other alternative mechanisms to consider.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added following statement to Discussion of the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>“The acquisition of trace fear memory was impaired by inhibition of persistent activity in mPFC during trace period (Gilmartin et al., 2013). The similar deficit observed in Syt7 KD animals is consistent with the hypothesis that STF provides bi-stable ensemble activity in a recurrent network (Mongillo et al., 2012). Nevertheless, alternative mechanisms may be responsible for the behavioral deficit. Not only recurrent network but also long-range loop between the mPFC and the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus play a critical role in maintaining persistent activity within the mPFC especially for a delay period longer than 10 s (Bolkan et al., 2017). Prefrontal L2/3 is heavily innervated by MD thalamus, and L2/3-PCs subsequently relay signals to L5 cortico-thalamic (CT) neurons (Collins et al., 2018). Given that L2/3 is an essential component of the PFC-thalamic loop, loss of STF at recurrent synapses between L2/3 PCs may lead to insufficient L2/3 inputs to L5 CT neurons and failure in the reverberant PFC-MD thalamic feedback loop. Therefore, not only L2/3 recurrent network but also its output to downstream network should be considered as a possible network mechanism underlying behavioral deficit caused by Syt7 KD L2/3.”</p>

<p>(2) The authors mention that Syt7 contributes to persistent activity during working memory tasks but focus on using only a trace fear conditioning task. However, it would be interesting to see if their results are generalizable to other working memory tasks (i.e. a delayed alternation task).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank to Reviewer for the insightful suggestion. Trace fear conditioning (tFC) shares behavioral properties with working memory (WM) tasks in that tFC is vulnerable to attentional distraction and to the load of WM task. In general WM tasks including delayed alternation tasks such as a T-maze task need persistent activity of ensemble neurons representing target-specific information among multiple choices. Different from such WM tasks, tFC is not appropriate to examine target-specific ensemble activity. Because it is not trivial to examine in vivo recordings in KD animals during delayed alternation tasks, it will be appropriate to study the effect of Syt7 KD in a separate study.</p>

<p>(1) Line 44: Define release probability (p_r) more clearly. Authors use it to mean p<sub>v</sub>*p<sub>occ</sub>, but others routinely use it to mean p<sub>v</sub>*p<sub>occ</sub>*N.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand that the Reviewer meant “others routinely use it to mean p<sub>v</sub>”. At this statement, we meant conventional definition of release probability, which is release probability among vesicles of RRP. We think that it is not appropriate to re-define release probability as p<sub>v</sub> * p<sub>occ</sub> in this first paragraph of Introduction. Therefore we clarified this issue in Discussion as we mentioned in our reply to the 1st weakness issue raised by Reviewer #3.</p>

<p>(2) Line 82: For clarity, define better what recurrent excitatory synapses are. It seems that synapses between L2/3 PCs and local targets may all be recurrent?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Each of L2/3 and L5 of the prefrontal cortical layers harbors intralaminar recurrent excitatory synapses between pyramidal cells, called a recurrent network. Previous theoretical studies have proposed that a single layer recurrent network model can have bi-stable E/I balanced states (up- and down-states) if recurrent excitatory synapses display short-term facilitation (STF), and thus is able to temporally hold an information once external input shifts the network to the up-state. In this theory, synapses to local targets across layers are not considered and specific roles of L2/3 and L5 in working memory tasks are still elusive. For clarity, we added a statement at the beginning of the paragraph (line 82): “Each of layer 2/3 (L2/3) and layer 5 (L5) of neocortex displays intralaminar excitatory synapses between pyramidal cells comprising a recurrent network (Holmgren et al., 2003; Thomson and Lamy, 2007)”</p>

<p>(3) Cite earlier studies of short-term synaptic plasticity at synapses between L2/3 pyramidal neurons and local targets in mPFC. If there are none, take more explicit credit for being first.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we mentioned in Introduction, previous studies on short-term plasticity (STP) at neocortical excitatory recurrent synapses have focused on synapses between L5 pyramidal cells (PCs) (Hemple et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2006; Morishima et al., 2011; Yoon et al., 2020). The local connectivity between L2/3 PCs in the somatosensory cortex has been elucidated by Homgren et al. (2003) and Ko et al. (2011). Although these study showed STP of EPSPs, it was at a fixed frequency or stimulus pattern at high external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (2 mM). There is a study on the frequency-dependence of STP of EPSP between L2/3-PCs (Feldmyer et al., 2006). Different from our study, Feldmyer et al., (2006) observed monotonous STD at all frequencies less than 50 Hz, but this study was done in the somatosensory cortex and at high external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (2 mM). To our knowledge, no previous study have investigated STP at recurrent excitatory synapses of L2/3 pyramidal cells of the mPFC especially at physiological external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. The present study, therefore, represents the first extensive investigation of STP at recurrent excitatory synapses in L2/3 of the mPFC under physiologically relevant external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].</p>

<p>Optical minimal stimulation methods have not been previously documented in detail. This figure illustrates what parameters we should carefully examine in order to attain optical minimal stimulation, which hopefully stimulates a single afferent fiber. A single fiber stimulation by optical minimal stimulation is supported by the similarity of our estimate for the number of release sites (N) as the previous morphological estimate (Holler et al., 2021). For minimal stimulation, we used a collimated DMD-coupled LED was employed to restrict 470 nm illumination to a small and well-defined region within layer 2/3 of the prelimbic mPFC, and carefully adjusted the illumination radius such that one step smaller (by 1 μm) illumination results in failure to evoke EPSCs. Our typical illumination area ranged between 3–4 μm, as shown in Figure S3A. Under this minimal illumination area, we confirmed unimodal distributions for the EPSC parameters (amplitude, rise time, decay time and time to peak; Figure 3B-E). Otherwise, we excluded the recordings from analysis. We hope this explanation provides a clearer understanding of the figure's significance.</p>

<p>(5) Note that CTZ seems to alter p_r at some synapses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that CTZ can increase release probability by blocking presynaptic K<sup>+</sup> currents. Indeed, Ishikawa and Takahashi (2001) reported that CTZ slowed the repolarizing phase of presynaptic action potentials and the frequency of miniature EPSCs in the calyx synapses. Consistently, we observed a slight increase in the baseline EPSC amplitude, from 33.3 pA to 41.9 pA (p=0.045) following the application of 50 µM CTZ. However, given that vesicular release probability (p<sub>v</sub>) is already close to 1 at the synapse of our interest, we believe that the observed effect is more likely attributed to an increase in release sites occupancy (p<sub>occ</sub>), which would be reflected as an increase in miniature EPSC frequency in Ishikawa and Takahashi (2001). Given that PPR depends on p<sub>v</sub> rather than p<sub>occ</sub>, this increase in p<sub>occ</sub> would not critically change our conclusion that AMPA receptor desensitization is not responsible for the strong PPD.</p>

<p>(6) Figure 8B. The result in Figure 8C seems important, but I couldn't figure out why behaviour was not altered during the acquisition phase summarized in Figure 8B. Perhaps this could be explained more clearly for non-experts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Little difference in freezing behavior during acquisition has been also observed when prelimbic persistent firing was optogenetically inhibited (Gilmartin, 2013). Not only CS (tone) but also other sensory inputs (visual and olfactory etc.) and the spatial context could be a cue predicting US (shock). Moreover, during the acquisition phase, the presence of the electric shock inherently induces a freezing response as a natural defensive behavior, which may obscure specific behavioral changes related to the associative learning process. Therefore, the freezing behavior during acquisition cannot be regarded as a sign for specific association of CS and US. Instead, on the next day, we specifically evaluated the CS-US association of the conditioned animals by measuring freezing behavior in response to CS in a distinct context. We explicitly documented little difference between WT and KD animals during the acquisition phase in the relevant paragraph (line 397).</p>
