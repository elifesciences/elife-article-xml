<title>Abstract</title><p>Cell competition in epithelial tissue eliminates transformed cells expressing activated oncoproteins to maintain epithelial homeostasis. Although the process is now understood to be of mechanochemical origin, direct mechanical characterization and associated biochemical underpinnings are lacking. Here, we employ tissue-scale stress and compressibility measurements and theoretical modeling to unveil a mechanical imbalance between normal and transformed cells, which drives cell competition. In the mouse intestinal epithelium and epithelial monolayer, transformed cells get compacted during competition. Stress microscopy reveals an emergent compressive stress at the transformed loci leading to this compaction. A cell-based self-propelled Voronoi model predicts that this compressive stress originates from a difference in the collective compressibility of the competing populations. A new collective compressibility measurement technique named gel compression microscopy then elucidates a two-fold higher compressibility of the transformed population than the normal population. Mechanistically, weakened cell-cell adhesions due to reduced junctional abundance of E-cadherin in the transformed cells render them collectively more compressible than normal cells. Taken together, our findings unveil a mechanical basis for epithelial homeostasis against oncogenic transformations with implications in epithelial defense against cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epithelial homeostasis is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and function, and it is achieved through a balance of cell proliferation, differentiation, and extrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Epithelial cells actively extrude unfit cells that may compromise the epithelial barrier and tissue integrity. For example, cells under metabolic stress or exhibiting DNA damage are identified and expelled by their neighbors, preserving overall tissue health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Additionally, cells with disrupted polarity or adhesion properties are removed via a similar extrusion process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. This selective extrusion is regulated by signals from surrounding healthy cells, ensuring the elimination of potentially disruptive cells and maintaining epithelial homeostasis. Furthermore, the process is not only limited to cells with apparent damage but also includes cells that are simply older or less fit compared to their neighbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. These mechanisms collectively ensure that the epithelial layer remains robust and functional, capable of serving as a barrier and interface between the external environment and the body’s internal milieu. Through these processes, epithelial tissues also protect themselves from potential damage, prevent the onset of disease, and ensure long-term functionality and resilience.</p>
<p>Importantly, there is a broad class of non-cell autonomous cell-elimination processes called cell competition, which maintains epithelial homeostasis during organ development and ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In addition, cell competition mediates a non-cell autonomous removal of transformed mutant cells expressing constitutively active forms of oncoproteins such as HRas<sup>V12</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], thus maintaining epithelial tissue homeostasis and integrity against oncogenic transformations. This process is often referred to as epithelial defense against cancer (EDAC). In this process, the transformed cells that are surrounded by normal epithelial cells, get eliminated from the tissue by apical extrusion or by basal delamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Despite some recent progress, the mechanisms underlying how normal cells recognize and eliminate the transformed cells remain largely elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The competitive removal of transformed cells requires extensive reorganization of force-bearing cytoskeletal elements in the surrounding normal cells, particularly at the interface between normal and transformed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The process additionally depends on the mechanics of the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], collectively indicating possible modulations of cellular mechanical forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Mechanical forces play critical roles during cell competition in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. For example, a differential in cell proliferation potential between two competing populations can drive out the population with a lower proliferation potential by compaction. Also, cells carrying distinct genetic lesions can have varying sensitivities to compaction, which might lead to their elimination. These observations explain how a fast-growing population bearing higher resistance to deformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and elimination can have a competitive advantage over a slow-growing population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, it is not clear how cell elimination occurs when the proliferative differential is trivial. For example, in the competitive elimination of epithelial cells expressing oncoprotein HRas<sup>V12</sup> by normal wildtype epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], the proliferation differential might not be a critical factor. Here, we probed the growth potential of these populations by quantitating their number expansion in time, starting from a similar number density (Supplementary Figs. 1A-B). We also directly measured the proliferation rate using ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling (Supplementary Figs. 1C-D). These experiments revealed that the difference in growth potential between transformed and wildtype populations is not significant. If anything, HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing transformed cells show slightly higher proliferation post-48 hours of growth. Thus, in this model for cell competition, despite having a slightly higher growth rate, the transformed cells get eliminated in the presence of normal cells. The mechanisms underlying this competitive elimination of the transformed cells by normal cells remain poorly understood. While tissue and cell mechanics might play a crucial role here, in the absence of direct measurement of forces during cell competition, it is unclear how tissue mechanics regulate non-proliferative cell competition between normal and transformed cells in epithelia.</p>
<p>To understand how epithelial tissue eliminates HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing transformed cells, two inducible models have been pivotal – an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse intestinal epithelium model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] and an <italic>in vitro</italic> Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell culture model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. The mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] involves a recombinant mouse strain viz. villin-HRas<sup>V12</sup>-GFP (villin-<italic>Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup></italic>; <italic>LSL-HRas<sup>V12</sup>-IRES-EGFP</italic>), wherein intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen leads to Cre recombinase-mediated induction of HRas<sup>V12</sup> genetic recombination in select cells which then constitutively express HRas<sup>V12</sup> in the intestinal epithelium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). At the same time these transformed cells express EGFP and hence, can be tracked. In the cell culture model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], wildtype and HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing MDCK epithelial cells are co-cultured (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2A) leading up to a mosaic occurrence of transformed colonies surrounded by wildtype cells and thus, mimic competition. In this case, HRas<sup>V12</sup> is tagged with GFP to mark the transformed cells. In this model, HRas<sup>V12</sup> expression is dependent on a Tet-on system and induced by adding a tetracycline derivative, doxycycline to the culture medium. Here, we co-cultured wildtype and HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing transformed cells in a 40:1 ratio (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2A) so that in the absence of doxycycline, as expected, transformed cells would form small colonies (2-10 cells), surrounded by wildtype cells. We then exposed this heterogeneous epithelial monolayer to a medium containing doxycycline, which induced HRas<sup>V12</sup> expression in the transformed cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Additionally, we employed 4 kPa polyacrylamide gels as the substrate for this model to mimic physiological stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. While the mouse model of cell competition is more physiologically relevant than the cell culture model, the latter is more controllable than the former and amenable to mechanical measurements. In both models, HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing transformed cells were apically extruded out of the monolayer only when they were in contact with the surrounding normal cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C-D</xref>), as has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], implying that the extrusion of HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells from heterogeneous epithelial tissue is a non-cell autonomous process driven by cell competition. From here onwards, we sort out to characterize the pre-extrusion mechano-phenotypes associated with cell competition during epithelial defense against cancer.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Non-cell autonomous, competition-driven compaction of HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells</title>
<p>We initially observed that, in both models, the yet-to-be-extruded transformed cells appeared compacted when they were in competition with normal cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1E-F</xref>). First, in the intestinal epithelium of the mouse model, we compared the thickness of the HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells in the area where all cells expressed HRas<sup>V12</sup> against the thickness of HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells in the area where these cells are sparsely distributed amongst normal cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). This comparison revealed that the thickness of HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells was reduced by more than 1.7-fold when they were surrounded by wildtype cells. These observations pointed towards a selective, competition-dependent compaction of HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing transformed cells but not control cells, in the intestinal villi of mice. Next, in the cell culture model, we compared the cell area of the HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells in homogeneous cultures versus in co-cultured systems where these cells were surrounded by wildtype cells. We found that in the homogeneous culture, surrounded by their own kind, HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells exhibited higher cell areas than even wildtype cells in a homogeneous normal epithelium. However, in the co-cultured system, in the presence of wildtype cells, the area of the HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells was reduced by more than 2.5 folds, as compared to their area under homogeneous conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Together these results established the generality of a competition-associated non-cell autonomous compaction of HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells, which might be driven by mechanobiological factors.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Competition-induced compressive stress at the transformed mutant locus</title>
<p>Although, the mechanobiology of competition between wildtype and transformed cells remains elusive, there are indications that the core mechanoresponsive elements influencing cell and tissue mechanics could be involved in the competition-mediated extrusion of transformed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. For example, at the locus where transformed cells interfaced wildtype cells in their vicinity, an active remodeling of the actomyosin occurred towards the transformed-wildtype interface, as highlighted by distinct phosphorylated myosin II light chain (pMLC2, active form of myosin II motor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]) surrounding transformed cells (Supplementary Fig. 2B). However, how cellular forces change during cell competition remains unknown. We, therefore, elucidated the temporal evolution of mechanical force field in the cell culture model, by combining traction force microscopy with Bayesian inverse stress microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A-C</xref>). We also used Bayesian force inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2D-F</xref>) in another independent set of experiments. From traction force microscopy experiments, we observed that upon induction of HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expression, traction forces increased along the interface between wildtype and transformed populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2E). Simultaneously, stress microscopy revealed local compressive stress appearing in the regions occupied by transformed cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2E). We concluded that this compressive stress is a unique mechanical signature of cell competition since in a homogeneous population of either normal or transformed cells, stresses remained predominantly tensile (Supplementary Figs. 2C-D), as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. While the complete extrusion of transformed cells took at least six hours after doxycycline induction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2E), compressive stresses appeared around two hours post-doxycycline exposure (Supplementary Fig. 2E), indicating that compressive stress precedes cell rounding up and extrusion (Supplementary video 1). In addition, compressive stress appeared to be restricted only to transformed cells as the background tissue comprising normal cells presented a predominantly tensile stress field (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Supplementary Figs. 2C-D). To capture the cellular-level effect of the coarse-grained compressive stress obtained from the stress microscopy, we then used Bayesian force inference to compute relative interfacial tension at the cellular scale and relative intracellular pressure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2E-G</xref>). This analysis revealed lower interfacial tension (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) and higher intracellular pressure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2F-G</xref>) in transformed cells as compared to surrounding normal cells at the time when multicellular compressive stress appeared. Together these experiments revealed that while epithelial tissues are generally tensile systems, during the competition between normal and transformed cells, compressive stress arises. This compressive stress precedes the extrusion of transformed mutant cells and is a unique mechanical signature of cell competition.</p>

<p>We estimated the competition-associated compaction relative to the homeostatic density by calculating relative compaction as Δρ = (<italic>ρ<sub>c</sub> − ρ<sub>h</sub>)/ρ<sub>h</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>, Eq. SI-6). We then hypothesized that this compaction could be a consequence of compressive stress and hence, compaction should increase with the increasing compressive stress. To test this hypothesis, we varied the concentration of doxycycline, which led to different levels of HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expression. Consequently, the compressive stress also changed, increasing with increasing doxycycline concentration (Supplementary Fig. 2E). Next, plotting the relative compaction with the maximum compressive stress obtained for HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing colonies revealed a nearly linear relationship between the compressive stress and the relative compaction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>), indicating a critical consequence of compressive stress on competition-associated compaction of the transformed cells.</p>

<title>Destabilized adherens junctions in transformed mutant cells</title>
<p>We had previously elucidated one of the mechano-phenotypes pertaining to epithelial cell competition, which is the homeostatic preferred area (inverse of homeostatic density, the peak density of a confluent monolayer at which the cell division rate becomes negligible). To study the general effect of transformation on epithelial mechanics, we next resorted to adherens junctions in transformed cells both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, since the integrity of cell-cell junctions is key to epithelial function and physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>].</p>
<p>We henceforth looked at the integrity of cell-cell junctions in normal and transformed mutant cells. When we probed for endogenous E-cadherin in the <italic>in vivo</italic> mice intestinal epithelium harboring ubiquitous HRas<sup>V12</sup> mutation, we found marked disruption in the junctional patterning of E-cadherin only in these mutants and not the control epithelium, supporting the phenotype that upon <italic>hras</italic> transformation, the homotypic adhesions are aberrant and occurs in physiology (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A-D</xref>). We further characterized homotypic cell-cell adhesions in MDCK wildtype and transformed populations by immunostaining for E-cadherin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3E</xref>-H). We found that in the transformed cells, as seen in the mice intestinal epithelium, E-cadherin was aberrantly localized to cell-cell junctions in addition to the vesicular distribution within the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3F</xref>, H). This cytoplasmic vesicular E-cadherin pool was not observed in the wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E, G</xref>), indicating an instability in cell-cell junctions in the transformed cells. We further corroborated this observation by performing super-resolution spinning-disk confocal microscopy using optical photon reassignment (SoRa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] with E-cadherin (stained by an antibody), both <italic>in vivo</italic> in the mice model of cell competition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C</xref>, D) and <italic>in vitro</italic> in MDCK cultures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3I,J</xref>), to show that junctional E-cadherin was significantly deteriorated in the transformed cells as compared to the junctions of wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C-D</xref>,I-J). Alongside, a marker protein for stable cell-cell junctions, alpha-catenin, showed a distinct cytoplasmic distribution pattern owing to the reduction in mature adherens junctions, only in the transformed cells (Supplementary Figs. 3A-D). This result reaffirmed the fact that stable cell-cell junctions were compromised in the transformed cells.</p>

<p>Furthermore, live-cell imaging of junctional membranes in a monolayer of transformed cells displayed remarkably dynamic and continuous short-time-scale ruffling whilst junctional membranes in wildtype cells were stable at such short timescales and did not show this peculiar phenotype (Supplementary Figs. 3E-G). These results revealed instability in cell-cell junctions specifically in the transformed cells, while the normal cells showed relatively stable cell-cell adhesions. Surprisingly, we did not observe any significant difference in cell-matrix adhesions, as marked by endogenous paxillin in the two cell types (Supplementary Figs. 3H-J). Taken together, these results elucidate the characteristic differences between wildtype and transformed cell populations, which we subsequently feed into our computational model.</p>
<p>Having discovered fundamental mechanobiological differences that transformation incurs, we worked towards understanding why transformed cells experience compressive stress specifically during competition with the wildtype cells. To this end, we proposed a physical modeling of a tissue containing heterogeneous mixture of transformed and wildtype cells using the Self-Propelled Voronoi model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], to accurately capture this heterogeneity in key differential attributes between wildtype and transformed populations.</p>

<title>The computational Self-Propelled Voronoi model explains the origin of compressive stress</title>
<p>To gain a deeper understanding of the emergent mechanics resulting from competition, we used a well-known physical model for confluent tissue, the Self-Propelled Voronoi model (SPV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], to simulate a heterogeneous monolayer. In this model, the heterogeneities in cell types were represented by differences in the single cell-level mechanical parameters that governed each cell (details of the model are outlined in the SI text). These parameters include the single-cell area and perimeter elastic moduli 𝐾<sub>𝐴</sub> and 𝐾<sub>𝑃</sub>, and homeostatic preferred cell area and perimeter 𝐴<sub>0</sub> and 𝑃<sub>0</sub> respectively. We simulated a co-culture of two types of cells in the SPV, in which a circular island of transformed mutant cells (M) was surrounded by wildtype cells (WT) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In this study, we specifically investigated the emergent behaviour when these properties differed between transformed and wildtype cells, focusing on the differences in 𝐾<sub>𝐴</sub>, 𝐴<sub>0</sub>, and 𝑃<sub>0</sub> values. In our simulations we therefore set 𝐾<sub>𝑃</sub> = 1 for all cells and use <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup><sub>0</sub> as the unit of length. Therefore, the sum total nondimensionalized mechanical energy function for the cell layer (derived from Eq. SI-1 in SI Section) is given by:

    <p>Based on our experimental findings that wildtype cells maintained their cell-cell junctions and established a durable, quiescent epithelial layer under ordinary circumstances (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A,C</xref>,E,G,I and Supplementary Figs. 3A-B,E-G), we assigned a <italic>P<sup>WT</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> value of 3.65 to these cells, which corresponded generically to a rigid jammed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Simultaneously, the observation from experiments that HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing transformed cells exhibited less stable cell-cell junctions than wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3B,D</xref>,F,H,J and Supplementary Figs. 3C-G) implies that the transformed cells should have a larger value of 𝑃<sub>0</sub>, corresponding to softer unjammed cells. Furthermore, the larger homeostatic regions observed in transformed cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1E-F</xref>) implied a larger value of 𝐴<sub>0</sub>. Taken together, we propose that the competition of cellular junctional properties between M and WT cells can be encoded by a dimensionless cell shape index <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559723v3_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. We first investigated the mechanical properties of the model cell layer by computing the hydrostatic pressure (𝛱) and interaction normal stress (𝜎<sub>𝑛</sub>) for the transformed and wildtype populations and the mechanical tension (𝑇<sub>𝑖</sub>) at cell-cell junctions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] (Eq. SI-3-5 in SI Section). We observed that regardless of the size of the circular island, transformed cells exhibited lower junctional tension than wildtype cells when 𝑞<sup>𝑀</sup><sub>0</sub> &gt; <italic>q<sup>WT</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 4A). Meanwhile, transformed cells experienced higher homeostatic pressure than wildtype cells when <italic>A<sup>M</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> &gt; <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup><sub>0</sub> and <italic>P<sup>M</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> &gt; <italic>P<sup>WT</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Further, we found that wildtype cells exerted compressive stress on transformed cells (𝜎<sub>𝑀</sub> &lt; 𝜎<sub>𝑊</sub>) (Supplementary Fig. 4B), with the stress gradient consistently oriented from high in wildtype cells to low in transformed cells. These phenotypic differences at the individual cell level provide the wildtype cells with a significant advantage in exerting compressive stress on the transformed population.</p>
<p>Consistent with the findings from our experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1E-F</xref>), the model was able to accurately capture the density compaction observed in the transformed population within a competitive environment. Specifically, using the same compaction parameter 𝛥 (Eq. SI-6 in SI Section), which exhibited positive values when transformed cells were under compressive stress or elevated pressure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), the simulations revealed an interesting finding that the increased compaction observed in transformed population is primarily influenced by the ratio of single cell area elasticities 𝑘 = <italic>K<sup>M</sup><sub>A</sub>/K<sup>WT</sup><sub>A</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). To quantify the effect, we calculated 𝐴 𝐴 the compressibility, C = 𝜕Δ⁄𝜕Π (carried out in the linear response regime, see SI Section for details). From the results shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, we observed that when is 𝑘 &lt; 1, the transformed cells exhibit greater compressibility compared to the wildtype cells, whereas for 𝑘 &gt; 1, the compressibility of the wildtype cells exceeds that of the transformed cells. This provides compelling evidence for the crucial role of the elastic properties of tissue in determining its susceptibility to elimination by cell competition, which originates from mechanical imbalances at the microscopic cellular level.</p>

<title>Gel compression microscopy (GCM) to measure collective compressibility</title>
<p>We then assessed whether the wildtype and transformed populations indeed differed in compressibility, as predicted by our theoretical modeling. To be able to reliably measure collective compressibility, we invented a novel biophysical technique termed as Gel Compression Microscopy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4E-F</xref> and Supplementary Figs. 5A-B; for details see methods) or GCM.</p>
<p>Existing methods to study epithelial tissue mechanics rely either on atomic force microscopy-based indentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], which only measures individual cell cortical stiffness but fails to sample bulk tissue mechanical properties, or on free-hanging monolayer compression, which requires cell-cell junction fidelity to sustain a suspended monolayer of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. As we had observed previously, HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells have weak cell-cell junctions. Hence, we ruled out the free-hanging monolayer setup. We were, therefore, motivated to devise a unique technique where one can leverage live-imaging a compressing monolayer of cells in real-time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4F-H</xref>) and quantitate its compressibility at the multicellular scale (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>), while the given monolayer rests on a physiologically relevant substrate (Supplementary Figs. 5A-B).</p>
<p>The gel compression microscopy set-up consists of a cell growth-conducive polyacrylamide hydrogel of defined stiffness interfacing with an acrylic acid-based pH-responsive hydrogel (Supplementary Fig. 5A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The pH-responsive hydrogel expands at a buffer pH above 6 and contracts at a buffer pH below 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. For better control of the separation between the polyacrylamide gel and the pH-responsive gel and for reproducibility, we utilized soft lithography (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 5B) to micropattern molds of defined shape and size. Next, to carry out compressibility measurements, we cultured wildtype or HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing transformed cells to confluency on top of the polyacrylamide gel and subsequently immerse the interfacing pH-responsive gel with normal growth medium (pH ∼ 7.4) (Supplementary Fig. 5A).</p>
<p>Henceforth, the pH-responsive gel expands at a constant rate exerting a constant multicell-scale compressive stress on the wildtype or HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing monolayer grown over the polyacrylamide gel (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). Although, the empirical volume of substrate is much larger than the cells resting atop, we reasoned that any difference in cell behavior we might see between wildtype and transformed mutants will be comparable in the broad paradigm of the definitive parameters of our setup, Therefore, we computed relative compressibility of transformed monolayer and wildtype monolayer relative to that of polyacrylamide substrate alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). In our initial experiments, we used the polyacrylamide gel with Young’s modulus of 4 kPa, which is a physiologically relevant tissue stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. On 4 kPa gel, the wildtype cell monolayer showed a significant and distinctly lower compressibility modulus relative to gel alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4G,J</xref> and Supplementary videos 2, 3), as indicated by our calculations of the relative compressibility modulus of 1.00±0.17 for gel alone compared to 0.49±0.07 for wildtype cell monolayer culture on the gel (Supplementary Fig. 5D). In contrast, the transformed cell monolayer with a relative compressibility modulus of 0.99±0.08 showed no difference in compressibility as compared to the gel-alone control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G,J</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 5D, and Supplementary video 4).</p>
<p>Based on these assessments, we wondered whether transformed cells possess a distinct but relatively smaller compressibility modulus than a 4 kPa gel. To this end, we performed the compressibility experiments with a softer polyacrylamide gel with Young’s modulus of 0.87 kPa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref> and Supplementary videos 5, 6, 7). Here, we found that the transformed monolayer showed a lower relative compressibility modulus of 0.63±0.05 compared to the gel alone scenario of 1.00±0.13 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 5D), pointing towards a small but distinct mechanical elasticity contributed by the transformed population. Interestingly, whilst transformed monolayer is less compressible than the soft gel but, at least, it still is relatively two-fold more compressible than the wildtype monolayer, which amounts to a relative compressibility modulus of 0.31±0.03 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 5D).</p>
<p>Taken together, as had been predicted by our simulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), the compressibility measurements with gel compression microscopy suggested that there exists a distinctively higher collective compressibility of the transformed population as compared to their wildtype counterpart and that in line with our predictions, forms the basis of competition driven compressive stress during epithelial defense against cancer.</p>

<title>Different regimes of mechanical phenotypes in cell competition</title>
<p>Our experiments on active compression revealed that the transformed mutant (M) cells exhibit higher collective tissue compressibility than their wildtype (WT) counterparts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4J,L</xref>), consistent with our previous linear-response measurements (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). This difference in collective tissue elasticity between the competing populations represents a key mechanical cue driving non-proliferative cell competition. To further understand the underlying factors that contribute to this competition, we incorporated active compression into the SPV. This was achieved by allowing the wildtype cells to exert an active self-propelled force on the transformed island (Eq. SI-7,8, see SI Section for a detailed discussion), thereby generating collective elastic response. When an active force was applied, the transformed cells experienced compression. By quantifying the relative change in the total area occupied by the transformed cells, we derived the compressive areal strain using Eq. SI-9. This enabled us to calculate the bulk modulus B (Eq. SI-10), which represents the material’s response to isotropic compressions (also done in the linear response regime, see SI Section for a detailed discussion). In essence, the bulk modulus of a material is inversely related to its compressibility. We measured B for a small magnitude of the active force (see SI Section) and a wide range of values of 𝑘, <italic>A<sup>M</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> and 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub> = 𝑞<sup>𝑀</sup> − <italic>q<sup>WT</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> with <italic>q<sup>WT</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> = 3.65 as reported in the SPV modeling section of this work. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> illustrates that the differential bulk modulus (𝛥 = 𝛥<sub>𝑀</sub> − 𝛥<sub>𝑊</sub>) between wildtype and transformed cells are controlled by both 𝑘 and 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub>. Notably, 𝛥 increases linearly with 𝑘 <italic>A<sup>M</sup></italic><sub>0</sub>, where the slope is independent of 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). After subtracting by an offset that depends on 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub>, the data collapsed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> inset, see SI Section for details) to a simpler functional relationship between 𝛥, 𝑘 <italic>A<sup>M</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> and 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub>, given by:

<p>In the computational simulations, we assessed both the bulk and shear moduli of the cell colonies. The bulk modulus provided insights into a tissue’s mechanical response to isotropic compression, while the shear modulus was essential for evaluating the tissue’s reaction to shear forces. These mechanical properties were analyzed for a wide range of parameters 𝑘, <italic>A<sup>M</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> and 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub>. Here, 𝑘 encoded competition in cell area elasticities between the cell types. When 𝑘 &lt; 1, the transformed mutant (M) colony was more compressible than the wildtype (WT) cells surrounding them. On the other hand, 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub>encoded the competition in cellular junctional properties; when 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub> &gt; 0, the transformed cells had weakened cellular junctions compared to the WT cells. <bold>A.</bold> Behavior of the differential bulk modulus 𝛥 between WT and M cells in the 𝑘 − 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub> plane for <italic>A<sup>M</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup><sub>0</sub> = 1.

Specifically, a colony of cells with lower 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub>and higher 𝑘 <italic>A<sup>M</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> will have a competitive advantage, as they exhibit lower compressibility and higher rigidity. The predicted phase diagram serves as a useful tool for identifying such mechanical phenotypes.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>These results indicate that competition in <italic>cell area elasticity</italic> plays a central role in driving the differences in bulk modulus between M and WT cells. Conversely, the parameter 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub>, which represents competition in cellular junctional properties, exerts a more subordinate influence.</p>
<p>While the bulk modulus provides insights into a tissue’s mechanical response to isotropic compression, the shear modulus is essential for evaluating the tissue’s reaction to shear forces. Notably, both solid and fluid materials possess a bulk modulus, whereas the shear modulus is a characteristic exclusive to solids. As a material transitions from a solid state to a flow state, its shear modulus diminishes to zero. Here instead of calculating the shear modulus explicitly for M and WT colonies, we used the mean edge tension (Eq. SI-11) as an approximation for the shear modulus (see SI Section for details). Previous research has demonstrated a linear relation between these two quantities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-D</xref>, we observe that the differential tension (Δ𝜏 = 𝜏<sub>𝑀</sub> − 𝜏<sub>𝑊</sub>) decreases as 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub> increases, this occurs for all values of 𝑘, which only sets the rate of decrease. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> inset demonstrates that the functional relationship between Δ𝜏, 𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub>, and 𝑘 for <italic>A<sup>M</sup></italic><sub>0</sub> = 1 exhibits a universal scaling collapse (see SI Section for details) described by:

These results indicate that the competition in cellular junctional properties (𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub>) plays a central role in driving the differences in shear modulus between M and WT cells. Conversely, competition in cell area elasticity (𝑘) exerts a more secondary influence.</p>
<p>Our simulations show that, in addition to differences in homeostatic cell area (𝐴<sub>0</sub>), cells can compete via differences in their area elasticity (𝑘) and junctional properties (𝛿𝑞<sub>0</sub>). Taken together, in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref> we propose a phase diagram that identifies four possible regimes of mechanical competition (see SI Section for details). Given that transformed cells exhibit weaker cellular junctions than their wild-type counterparts, our theoretical model predicts a reduced shear modulus for these cells. Simultaneously, their increased compressibility results in lower cell area elasticity, leading to a diminished bulk modulus compared to WT cells. These findings lead to the conjecture that successful elimination of transformed cells by cell competition requires the competing populations to emerge as winners in Region II and losers in Region IV (shaded red in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>) of this mechano-phenotypic phase diagram.</p>

<title>Role of destabilized cell-cell junctions in transformed cells</title>
<p>Finally, we attempted to understand the mechanistic basis for this difference in collective compressibility between the transformed and normal cell populations. At the single-cell level, atomic force microscopy experiments have delineated that HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing transformed cells are stiffer than wildtype cells when in an adherent state, whilst they are softer when in loosely attached or suspended form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. In contrast, we found higher collective compressibility in transformed cells. One possible explanation for these two apparently discrepant observations is the weaker cell-cell adhesions in the transformed cells as compared to the wildtype cells. Indeed, junctional E-cadherin mislocalization leading up to weaker cell-cell adhesions, upon Ras transformation, has been shown before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that weak cell-cell adhesions make a collective of transformed cells more compressible than a collective of wildtype cells. Relevantly, it is known that a matrix metalloproteinase-dependent cleavage of the extracellular domain of the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin drives epithelial extrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>
<p>We, therefore, hypothesized that cell-cell adhesions in the HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing mutants could be compromised due to the cleavage of the extracellular domain of E-cadherin. To test this hypothesis, we used DECMA-1 antibody which binds to the extracellular domain of E-cadherin. Upon mild detergent pretreatment, which permeabilizes cell membrane as well as partially disrupts the interaction between two E-cadherin molecules from the adjacent cells, DECMA-1 detects both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound E-cadherin, provided their extracellular domains are intact. Without the detergent, DECMA-1 detects only those E-cadherin molecules that are not bound to other E-cadherin molecules and have their extracellular domains intact. We stained both wildtype and transformed cells with this antibody with or without the detergent pretreatment. With detergent pretreatment, we found that E-cadherin remains intact at the junctions of the transformed cells and wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, without membrane permeabilization, DECMA-1 showed staining only at the junctions of the transformed cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). These results revealed that E-cadherin molecules in transformed mutants remains intact but not bound to E-cadherin molecules of the adjacent cells.</p>

<p>To understand the reason behind improper E-cadherin coupling, we then studied the dynamics of E-cadherin in live cells expressing a E-cadherin-GFP construct. We observed an enhanced transport of E-cadherin in transformed cells but not in wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and Supplementary video 8), where E-cadherin molecules showed distinct vesicular fingerprints. Interestingly, this enhanced transport was not due to the endocytic awakening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] since none of the endocytic compartments, including Rab5 for early endosomes, Rab11 for recycling endosomes, Rab7 for late endosomes and LAMP1 for lysosomes, showed any preferential co-localization with E-cadherin in transformed cells (Supplementary Figs. 6A-E).</p>
<p>In addition, using SoRa super-resolution imaging, we had found that junctional E-cadherin significantly deteriorated in the junctions of transformed cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3B,D</xref>,F,H,J). To recover the junctional E-cadherin pool in the transformed cells, we overexpressed E-cadherin-GFP in transformed cells. We assumed that E-cadherin overexpression would lead to the recovery of junctional E-cadherin concentration, and because of increased concentration, it would also lead to enhanced coupling of E-cadherin molecules, effectively “gluing” the transformed cells. Super-resolution imaging with SoRa revealed that junctional E-cadherin pool was indeed recovered within wildtype range upon E-cadherin overexpression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Further, when we performed traction force microscopy coupled with stress microscopy in the competition setup with wildtype cells and these E-cadherin-GFP overexpressing cells, there appeared to be no compressive stress at the transformed loci (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>) unlike what we had observed before with the transformed cells alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In fact, just by enriching junctional E-cadherin pool, we could rescue the competition dependent compressive stress which the transformed mutants would experience otherwise, when surrounded by wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Finally, we performed gel compression microscopy to evaluate the collective compressibility of the E-cadherin-GFP overexpressing HRas<sup>V12</sup>-transformed cells (Supplementary Fig. 7A and Supplementary video 9). Indeed, collective compressibility of these transformed mutants was now rescued to the range of wildtype population (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>) and thus explains the rescue in compressive stress when these transformed cells encounter wildtype cells in their vicinity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we combined experimental investigation at the wildtype-vs-transformed cell competition regime in the small intestinal epithelia of mice as well as in cultured MDCK epithelia, along with robust <italic>in silico</italic> modeling, to provide direct mechanobiological evidence towards epithelial homeostasis. We, therefore, attempted to define the mechanistic and mechanical basis of epithelial homeostasis mediated by cell competition. We present <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence to define transformation-induced mechano-phenotypes pertaining to distinct biophysical aspects of cells once they incur HRas<sup>V12</sup> mutation load. These phenotypes include higher preferred homoeostatic area, and compromised adherens-based cell-cell junctions, which are characterized also by transformed MDCK cells in culture. Further, we discovered pre-elimination compressive stress, which is unique to cell competition and henceforth, may be called <underline>c</underline>ompetition-induced <underline>c</underline>ompressive <underline>s</underline>tress (CICS).</p>
<p>Our work interestingly shows that a growth rate difference between the competing populations, which is classically considered to be the driver of cell competition and oncogenesis, does not seem to be a critical factor for cell competition against HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing transformed cells. Instead, we hypothesize that, the general mechanobiological aspects pertaining to epithelial cells which we show to be perturbed upon transformation, might be the drivers of competition. To reconcile these observations in a single framework, we utilized a computational Self-Propelled Voronoi model and show that a collective compressibility differential might explain the emergence of compressive stress during cell competition. While the existing tools to quantitate collective compressibility are either too complex, too customized to be implemented, or rely entirely on the impending cellular strength to suspend freely, we developed an inexpensive, physiologically compatible technique called gel compression microscopy (GCM). GCM includes a compliant substrate for monolayer adhesion, whose stiffness can be modulated, and enables real-time measurements of collective compressibility. Using GCM, we showed that the transformed cell population is indeed more compliant to in-plane compression. GCM measurements thus revealed an oncogenic transformation in the epithelial cells leading to a multicellular length-scale change in its material property. Taken together, we present a mechanical picture where the oncogenic transformation of a group of cells in an otherwise normal epithelium modulates their cellular biophysical properties making them more compressible as a collective. Subsequently, during cell competition, a local compressive stress emerges at the transformed loci, which leads to a successful epithelial homeostasis and possibly, a fundamental defense against cancer.</p>
<p>In this regard, a recent study parameterized differences in cellular-scale measurements during cell competition between wildtype and transformed cells lacking a tumor suppressor protein, Scribble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. They used an agent-based model to show that the homeostatic density of the competing cell types primarily governs mechanical cell competition, while the local tissue organization influences the outcome and kinetics of biochemical competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. However, in the absence of direct measurement of forces, a comprehensive understanding of the causal mechanism driving the mechanical cell competition remained missing. In contrast, we first used stress microscopy techniques to discover CICS. Subsequently, our efforts to understand the mechanistic origin of CICS led to the discovery of differential compressibility via computational modeling and the invention of GCM. Hence, our study went much beyond the previous geometric representation of cell competition and elucidated how individual cell mechanics integrate at the multi-cell scale to bring about oncogenic cell elimination through competition. Together, it is tempting to speculate that the transformed cells struggle to achieve their desired, higher cellular area while being resisted by the surrounding normal cells, giving rise to CICS.</p>
<p>In the context of stable epithelial monolayers both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, the factors that trigger cell competition, including the Ras family of proteins, Myc, Toll, and apicobasal polarity proteins, are also involved in modulating junctional tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Consistent with these observations, we demonstrate that junctional fidelity in HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing transformed cells is indeed aberrant in culture and physiology. The most important epithelial cell-cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin, loses its junctional localization upon oncogenic transformation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The membrane-anchored E-cadherin molecules get actively displaced from the junctions of the transformed cells, trafficked through the cytoplasm and are not turned over back to the junctions in time, compromising junctional stability (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary video 8). This instability is corroborated by the diffused cytoplasmic occurrence of another protein associated with cell-cell junctional maturation, alpha-catenin (Supplementary Fig. 3). Remarkably, just by enriching the overall pool of available E-cadherin in the mutants, we observed a significant recovery in their collective compressibility, and the CICS disappeared (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6E-F</xref>).</p>
<p>In the paradigm of cell competition, what still remains to be explored is the cellular phenotypes that fundamentally perturb the bulk mechanical elasticity of epithelial cells as they undergo transformation. How cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous features arise in normal as well as transformed cells to guide mechanobiological patterns of cell competition, remains poorly understood. Finally, it will be interesting to investigate whether compressive stress also appears during competition against mutations in other Ras family proteins and whether the underlying mechanism can be generalized beyond HRas<sup>V12</sup>. Nevertheless, using physiologically relevant model systems, our comprehensive study has unveiled the previously enigmatic physical principle and molecular mechanism that underlie cell competition in epithelial homeostasis. This breakthrough not only provides crucial insights into the fundamental dynamics of this process but also opens exciting avenues for the emerging field of mechano-medicine. By understanding how mechanical forces and tissue compressibility play a pivotal role in cell competition, we have set the stage for innovative therapeutic strategies that leverage these principles to target and potentially mitigate the spread of cancerous cells within tissues.</p>

<p>Gel compression microscopy (GCM) is an inexpensive and novel biophysical technique described in this work, which utilizes a monotonically expanding pH-responsive gel to compress a polyacrylamide (PAA) gel at its interface.

Furthermore, since the technique involves live cell collectives, it allows for capturing the evolution of compressive stress in real time.

The stamps were then mounted ‘pillar side down’ on the glass coverslip of a 35mm glass bottom dish (Ibidi) in order to leave a donut-shaped gap of defined height (∼150 um) between PDMS and glass. This setup was then moved into a degassing chamber (Tarsons) which was connected to a Vacuum-Argon dual line. Three sequential rounds of vacuuming (15 mins at high pressure until the chamber pressure reaches 0.2-0.5 torr) and gassing with argon (until the chamber pressure is relieved). Finally, under constant argon flow, a prepared PAA gel mix (referred to in Supplementary table 1) was injected into the gap between PDMS and glass. The setup is left in the closed gas chamber under constant argon flow for 1 hour to allow ample time for PAA gel polymerization. After the polymerization step, PDMS stamps are gently peeled off from the glass.

For Super-Resolution via Optical Reassignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] or SoRa imaging, images were acquired with a x60 water immersion objective (Plan Apo VC 60XA, N.A =1.20, Nikon) mounted on a Nikon inverted microscope supplied with Yokogawa CSU-W1 (SoRa Disk) scanner. Images were further processed via the ‘clarify’ module in-built to the NIS elements imaging software (v5.42.01) provided with the system. Wide-field images to measure proliferation rates were acquired using ×20 objective (0.40 HC PL FLUOTAR L) on a Leica DMI8 inverted microscope using Leica Application Suite X (LAX, v3.7.0.20979).</p>

<title>Soft photolithography-based micropatterning</title>
<p>Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stencils with pillars of defined shapes were created using soft photolithography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Briefly, 150 um thick SU-8 2075 (Kayaku advanced materials, Y111074) was coated on a silicon wafer followed by soft baking at 65° C for 5 minutes and 95° C for 20 minutes. SU-8 was exposed in the desired pattern using the MicroWriter ML 3 Pro (Durham Optics Magneto Ltd) followed by post-exposure baking at 65° C for 7 minutes and 95° C for 15 minutes. The unexposed photoresist was removed by immersing the wafers in the SU-8 developer (Kayaku advanced materials, Y020100) for 8-10 minutes. Patterned SU-8 wafers were then hard-baked at 170° C for 45 minutes. PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) was mixed in a ratio of 1:10, degassed, and poured over the patterned wafers. After curing at 65° C for 4 h, stencils were cut out and were peeled off. Since polyacrylamide (PAA) preparations do not polymerize in a PDMS cast and there is no protocol available in the literature, we standardized a way of preparing PAA gels in a PDMS environment. First, the prepared PDMS stencils were dipped in excess absolute isopropanol and sonicated at 37 kHz for 1 hour in a sonicator bath (Fisherbrand, FB11203) and left dipped in isopropanol until required.</p>

<title>Image Analysis</title>
<p>Image analysis for this study was performed using Fiji [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] except traction force microscopy, monolayer stress microscopy and bayesian force inference analysis, which was performed in MATLAB (MathWorks). To measure proliferation rates, number expansion for MDCK-wildtype (WT) or -HRas<sup>V12</sup> transformed (MT) live samples cultured on 4 kPa polyacrylamide (PAA) gels, starting from a similar seeding density and imaged after indicated time-points. Similarly, EdU stained fixed samples for the indicated time points, counterstained with DAPI, were imaged to quantitate the fraction of EdU<sup>+</sup> (EdU<sup>+</sup> DAPI<sup>+</sup>) to the total number of cells (EdU<sup>+</sup> DAPI<sup>+</sup> and EdU<sup>-</sup> DAPI<sup>+</sup>). Cellpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] was used to segment and count the number of cells or the number of nuclei, respectively as well as to create segmented masks for mouse intestinal epithelium cross-sections. Paxillin puncta were counted using the Analyze particle tool in Fiji, averaged over respective cell area, and plotted. Temporal color-coded panels were prepared using the hyperstack module in Fiji.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were carried out in GraphPad Prism 9. Statistical significance was calculated by Unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction. Scatter-bar plots were displayed as mean ± s.e.m or mentioned in the respective figure legends. p-values greater than 0.05 were considered to be statistically not significant. No statistical methods were used to set the sample size. Quantification was done using data from at least three independent biological replicates. For analysis involving live-imaging experiments, data were collected from three independent experiments. All the experiments with representative images were repeated at least three times.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this article, Gupta and colleagues explore the parameters that could promote the elimination of active Ras cells when surrounded by WT cells. The elimination of active Ras cells by surrounding WT cells was previously described extensively and associated with a process named cell competition, a context dependant elimination of cells. Several mechanisms have been associated with competition, including more recently elimination processes based on mechanical stress. This was explored theoretically and experimentally and was either associated with differential growth and sensitivity to pressure and/or differences in homeostatic density/pressure. This was extensively validated for the case of Scribble mutant cells which are eliminated by WT MDCK cells due to their higher homeostatic density. However, there has been so far very little systematic characterisation of the mechanical parameters and properties of these different cell types and how this could contribute to mechanical competition.</p>
<p>Here, the authors used the context of active Ras cells in MDCK cells (with some observations in vivo in mice gut which are a bit more anecdotal) to explore the parameters causal to Ras cell elimination. Using for the first time traction force microscopy, stress microscopy combined with Bayesian inference, they first show that clusters of active Ras cells experience higher pressure compared to WT. Interestingly, this occurs in absence of differences in growth rate, and while Ras cells seems to have lower homeostatic density, in contractions with the previous models associated with mechanical cell competition. Using a self-propelled Voronoi model, they explored more systematically the conditions that will promote the compression of transformed cells, showing globally that higher Area compressibility and/or lower junctional tension are associated with higher compressibility. Using then an original and novel experimental method to measure bulk compressibility of cell populations, they confirmed that active Ras cells are globally twice more compressible than WT cells. This compressibility correlates with a disruption of adherens junctions. Accordingly, the higher pressure near transformed Ras cells can be completely rescued by increasing cell-cell adhesion through E-cad overexpression, which also reduces the compressibility of the transformed cells. Altogether, these results go along the lines of a previous theoretical work (Gradeci et al. eLife 2021) which was suggesting that reduced stiffness/higher compressibility was essential to promote loser cell elimination. Here, the authors provide for the first time a very convincing experimental measurement and validation of this prediction. Moreover, their modelling approach goes far beyond what was performed before in terms of exploration of conditions promoting compressibility, and their experimental data point at alternative mechanisms that may contribute to mechanical competition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Original methodologies to perform systematic characterisation of mechanical properties of Ras cells during cell competition, which include a novel method to measure bulk compressibility.</p>
<p>
- A very extensive theoretical exploration of the parameters promoting cell compaction in the context of competition.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Most of the theoretical focus is centred on the bulk compressibility, but so far does not really explain the final fate of the transformed cells. Classic cell competition scenario (including the one involving active Ras cells) lead to the elimination of one cell population either by cell extrusion/cell death or global delamination. This aspect is absolutely not explored in this article, experimentally or theoretically, and as such it is difficult to connect all the observables with the final outcome of cell competition. For instance, higher compressibility may not lead to loser status if the cells can withstand high density without extruding compared to the WT cells (and could even completely invert the final outcome of the competition). Down the line, and as suggested in most of the previous models/experiments, the relationship between pressure/density and extrusion/death will be the key factor that determine the final outcome of competition. However, there is absolutely no characterisation of cell death/cell extrusion in the article so far.</p>
<p>- While the compressibility measurement are very original and interesting, this bulk measurement could be explained by very different cellular processes, from modulation of cell shape, to cell extrusion and tissue multilayering (which by the way was already observed for active Ras cells, see for instance <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34644109/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34644109/</ext-link>). This could change a lot the interpretation of this measurement and to which extend it can explain the compression observed in mixed culture. This compressibility measurement could be much more informative if coupled with an estimation of the change of cell aspect ratio and the rough evaluation of the contribution of cell shape changes versus alternative mechanisms.</p>
<p>- So far, there is no clear explanation of why transformed Ras cells get more compacted in the context of mixed culture compared to pure Ras culture. Previously, the compaction of mutant Scribble cells could be explained by the higher homeostatic density of WT cells which impose their prefered higher density to Scribble mutant (see Wagstaff et al. 2016 or Gradeci et al 2021), however that is not the case of the Ras cells (which have even slightly higher density at confluency). If I understood properly, the Voronoid model assumes some directional movement of WT cell toward transformed which will actively compact the Ras cells through self-propelled forces (see supplementary methods), but this is never clearly discussed/described in the results section, while potentially being one essential ingredient for observing compaction of transformed cells. In fact, this was already described experimentally in the case of Scribble competition and associated with chemoattractant secretion from the mutant cells promoting directed migration of the WT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33357449/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33357449/</ext-link>). It would be essential to show what happens in absence of directional propelled movement in the model and validate experimentally whether there is indeed directional movement of the WT toward the transformed cells. Without this, the current data does not really explain the competition process.</p>
<p>- Some of the data lack a bit of information on statistic, especially for all the stress microscopy and traction forces where we do no really know how representative at the stress patterns (how many experiment, are they average of several movies ? integrated on which temporal window ?)</p>

For instance, higher compressibility may not lead to loser status if the cells can withstand high density without extruding compared to the WT cells (and could even completely invert the final outcome of the competition). Down the line, and as suggested in most of the previous models/experiments, the relationship between pressure/density and extrusion/death will be the key factor that determine the final outcome of competition. However, there is absolutely no characterisation of cell death/cell extrusion in the article so far.</p>
<p>- While the compressibility measurement are very original and interesting, this bulk measurement could be explained by very different cellular processes, from modulation of cell shape, to cell extrusion and tissue multilayering (which by the way was already observed for active Ras cells, see for instance <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34644109/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34644109/</ext-link>). This could change a lot the interpretation of this measurement and to which extend it can explain the compression observed in mixed culture. This compressibility measurement could be much more informative if coupled with an estimation of the change of cell aspect ratio and the rough evaluation of the contribution of cell shape changes versus alternative mechanisms.</p>
<p>- So far, there is no clear explanation of why transformed Ras cells get more compacted in the context of mixed culture compared to pure Ras culture. Previously, the compaction of mutant Scribble cells could be explained by the higher homeostatic density of WT cells which impose their prefered higher density to Scribble mutant (see Wagstaff et al. 2016 or Gradeci et al 2021), however that is not the case of the Ras cells (which have even slightly higher density at confluency). If I understood properly, the Voronoid model assumes some directional movement of WT cell toward transformed which will actively compact the Ras cells through self-propelled forces (see supplementary methods), but this is never clearly discussed/described in the results section, while potentially being one essential ingredient for observing compaction of transformed cells. In fact, this was already described experimentally in the case of Scribble competition and associated with chemoattractant secretion from the mutant cells promoting directed migration of the WT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33357449/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33357449/</ext-link>). It would be essential to show what happens in absence of directional propelled movement in the model and validate experimentally whether there is indeed directional movement of the WT toward the transformed cells. Without this, the current data does not really explain the competition process.</p>
<p>- Some of the data lack a bit of information on statistic, especially for all the stress microscopy and traction forces where we do no really know how representative at the stress patterns (how many experiment, are they average of several movies ? integrated on which temporal window ?)</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment:</bold></p>
<p>In this important study, the authors combine innovative experimental approaches, including direct compressibility measurements and traction force analyses, with theoretical modeling to propose that wild-type cells exert compressive forces on softer HRasV12-transformed cells, influencing competition outcomes. The data generally provide solid evidence that transformed epithelial cells exhibit higher compressibility than wild-type cells, a property linked to their compaction during mechanical cell competition. However, the study would benefit from further characterization of how compression affects the behavior of HRasV12 cells and clearer causal links between compressibility and competition outcomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers and the editor for their thoughtful and encouraging feedback on our study and for appreciating the innovation in our experimental and theoretical approaches. We acknowledge the importance of further clarifying the mechanistic links between the compressibility of HRas<sup>V12</sup>-transformed cells, their compaction, and the outcomes of mechanical cell competition. In the revised manuscript, we will include additional experiments and analyses to assess how compression influences the cellular behavior and fate of HRas<sup>V12</sup>-transformed cells during competition. In addition, to strengthen the connection between collective compressibility and competition outcomes, we will integrate quantitative analyses of cell dynamics and additional modeling to explicitly correlate the mechanical properties with the spatial and temporal aspects of cell elimination. These additions will address the reviewer’s concerns comprehensively, further enriching the mechanistic understanding presented in the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this article, Gupta and colleagues explore the parameters that could promote the elimination of active Ras cells when surrounded by WT cells. The elimination of active Ras cells by surrounding WT cells was previously described extensively and associated with a process named cell competition, a context dependant elimination of cells. Several mechanisms have been associated with competition, including more recently elimination processes based on mechanical stress. This was explored theoretically and experimentally and was either associated with differential growth and sensitivity to pressure and/or differences in homeostatic density/pressure. This was extensively validated for the case of Scribble mutant cells which are eliminated by WT MDCK cells due to their higher homeostatic density. However, there has been so far very little systematic characterisation of the mechanical parameters and properties of these different cell types and how this could contribute to mechanical competition.</p>
<p>Here, the authors used the context of active Ras cells in MDCK cells (with some observations in vivo in mice gut which are a bit more anecdotal) to explore the parameters causal to Ras cell elimination. Using for the first time traction force microscopy, stress microscopy combined with Bayesian inference, they first show that clusters of active Ras cells experience higher pressure compared to WT. Interestingly, this occurs in absence of differences in growth rate, and while Ras cells seems to have lower homeostatic density, in contractions with the previous models associated with mechanical cell competition. Using a self-propelled Voronoi model, they explored more systematically the conditions that will promote the compression of transformed cells, showing globally that higher Area compressibility and/or lower junctional tension are associated with higher compressibility. Using then an original and novel experimental method to measure bulk compressibility of cell populations, they confirmed that active Ras cells are globally twice more compressible than WT cells. This compressibility correlates with a disruption of adherens junctions. Accordingly, the higher pressure near transformed Ras cells can be completely rescued by increasing cell-cell adhesion through E-cad overexpression, which also reduces the compressibility of the transformed cells. Altogether, these results go along the lines of a previous theoretical work (Gradeci et al. eLife 2021) which was suggesting that reduced stiffness/higher compressibility was essential to promote loser cell elimination. Here, the authors provide for the first time a very convincing experimental measurement and validation of this prediction. Moreover, their modelling approach goes far beyond what was performed before in terms of exploration of conditions promoting compressibility, and their experimental data point at alternative mechanisms that may contribute to mechanical competition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Original methodologies to perform systematic characterisation of mechanical properties of Ras cells during cell competition, which include a novel method to measure bulk compressibility.</p>
<p>
- A very extensive theoretical exploration of the parameters promoting cell compaction in the context of competition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their detailed and thoughtful assessment of our study and for recognizing the originality of our methodologies, including the novel bulk compressibility measurement technique and the extensive theoretical exploration of parameters influencing mechanical competition. We are pleased that the reviewer finds our experimental validation and modeling approach convincing and acknowledges the relevance of our findings in advancing the understanding of mechanical cell competition. We will carefully address all the points raised to further clarify and strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Most of the theoretical focus is centred on the bulk compressibility, but so far does not really explain the final fate of the transformed cells. Classic cell competition scenario (including the one involving active Ras cells) lead to the elimination of one cell population either by cell extrusion/cell death or global delamination. This aspect is absolutely not explored in this article, experimentally or theoretically, and as such it is difficult to connect all the observables with the final outcome of cell competition. For instance, higher compressibility may not lead to loser status if the cells can withstand high density without extruding compared to the WT cells (and could even completely invert the final outcome of the competition). Down the line, and as suggested in most of the previous models/experiments, the relationship between pressure/density and extrusion/death will be the key factor that determine the final outcome of competition. However, there is absolutely no characterisation of cell death/cell extrusion in the article so far.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important point. We agree that understanding the relationship between pressure, density, and the final outcomes of cell competition, such as extrusion and cell death, is crucial to connecting the mechanical properties to competition outcomes. While extrusion and cell death have been extensively characterized in previous works (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27896-z">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27896-z</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb1853">https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb1853</ext-link>), we nevertheless recognize the need to address this aspect more explicitly in our study. To this end, we have indeed performed experiments to characterize cell extrusion and cell death under varying conditions of pressure and density. We will incorporate these data into the revised manuscript. These additions will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how mechanical imbalance drives cell competition and determine the final fate of transformed cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- While the compressibility measurement are very original and interesting, this bulk measurement could be explained by very different cellular processes, from modulation of cell shape, to cell extrusion and tissue multilayering (which by the way was already observed for active Ras cells, see for instance <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34644109/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34644109/</ext-link>). This could change a lot the interpretation of this measurement and to which extend it can explain the compression observed in mixed culture. This compressibility measurement could be much more informative if coupled with an estimation of the change of cell aspect ratio and the rough evaluation of the contribution of cell shape changes versus alternative mechanisms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important concern. In our model system and within the experimental timescale of our studies involving gel compression microscopy (GCM) experiments, we do not observe tissue multilayering and cell extrusion, as these measurements are performed on homogeneous populations (pure wild-type or pure transformed cell monolayer). However, to address the reviewer’s suggestion, we will include measurements of cell aspect ratio as well as images eliminating the possibility of multilayering/extrusion in the revised manuscript. These results will provide additional insights into the plausible contributions of cell shape changes. Furthermore, our newer results indicate that the compressibility differences arise from variations in the intracellular organization (changed in nuclear and cytoskeletal organization) between wild-type and transformed cells. While a detailed molecular characterization of these underlying mechanisms is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, we acknowledge its importance and plan to explore it in a future study. These revisions will clarify and strengthen the interpretation of our findings.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We introduced directional movement of wild-type cells towards neighbouring transformed cells (and a form of active force to be exerted by them), motivated by the tissue compressibility measurements from the Gel Compression Microscopy experiments (Fig. 4E-L). This allowed us to devise an equivalent method of measuring the material response to isotropic compression within the SPV model framework. While the role of directional propelled movement is an area of ongoing investigation and has not been explored extensively within the current study, we emphasize that even without directional propulsion in the model, our results demonstrate compressive stress or elevated pressure, and increased compaction within the transformed population under suitable conditions reported in this work (when k&lt;1), exhibiting a greater tissue-level compressibility in the transformed cells compared to WT cells (Figs. 4C-D), thereby laying the ground for competition. To clarify these concerns, we will provide additional results as well as detailed discussions on the effect of cell movements in compression.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the need for additional details regarding the statistical representation of our stress microscopy and traction force data. We will address these concerns in the revised manuscript by providing clear descriptions of the number of experiments, the averaging methodology, and the temporal windows used for analysis. Currently, Figs. 2A and 2C represent data from single time points, as the traction and stress landscapes evolve dynamically as transformed cells begin extruding (as shown in Supplementary movie 1). In contrast, Fig. 2H represents data collected from several samples across three independent experiments, all measured at the 3-hour time point following doxycycline induction. This specific time point is critical because it captures the emergence of compressive stresses before extrusion begins, simplifying the analysis and ensuring consistency. We will ensure these details are clearly articulated in the revised text and figure legends.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The work by Gupta et al. addresses the role of tissue compressibility as a driver of cell competition. The authors use a planar epithelial monolayer system to study cell competition between wild type and transformed epithelial cells expressing HRasV12. They combine imaging and traction force measurements from which the authors propose that wild type cells generate compressive forces on transformed epithelial cells. The authors further present a novel setup to directly measure the compressibility of adherent epithelial tissues. These measurements suggest a higher compressibility of transformed epithelial cells, which is causally linked to a reduction in cell-cell adhesion in transformed cells. The authors support their conclusions by theoretical modelling using a self-Propelled Voronoi model that supports differences in tissue compressibility can lead to compression of the softer tissue type.</p>
<p>The experimental framework to measure tissue compressibility of adherent epithelial monolayers establishes a novel tool, however additional controls of this measurement appear required. Moreover, the experimental support of this study is mostly based on single representative images and would greatly benefit from additional data and their quantitative analysis to support the authors' conclusions. Specific comments are also listed in the following:</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>It is not evident in Fig2A that traction forces increase along the interface between wild type and transformed populations and stresses in Fig2C also seem to be similar at the interface and surrounding cell layer. Only representative examples are provided and a quantification of sigma_m needs to be provided.</p>
<p>In Figure 1-3 only panel 2G and 2H provide a quantitative analysis, but it is not clear how many regions of interest and clusters of transform cells were quantified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their detailed comments and for highlighting the importance of additional quantitative analyses to support our conclusions. We appreciate their recognition of our novel experimental framework to measure tissue compressibility and the overall approach of our study. Regarding Fig. 2A and Fig. 2C, we acknowledge the need for further clarity. While the traction forces and stress patterns may not appear uniformly distinct at the interface in the representative images, these differences are more evident at specific time points before extrusion begins. Please note that the traction and stress landscapes evolve dynamically as transformed cells begin extruding (as shown in Supplementary movie 1). We will include a quantification of <italic>σ<sub>m</sub>​</italic> and additional data from multiple experiments to substantiate the observations and address this concern in the revised manuscript. Currently, the data in Fig. 2G and Fig. 2H represent several regions of interest and transformed cell clusters collected from three independent experiments, all analyzed at the 3-hour time point after doxycycline induction. This time point was chosen because it captures the compressive stress emergence without interference from extrusion processes, simplifying the analysis. We will expand these sections with detailed descriptions of the sample sizes and statistical analyses to ensure greater transparency and reproducibility. These revisions will provide a stronger quantitative foundation for our findings and address the reviewer's concerns.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need for more supportive data to justify several statements in the manuscript. Specifically, the observation regarding the reduction in the thickness of HRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells by more than 1.7-fold when surrounded by wild-type cells, and the statement about a 2.7-fold change in cell area, will be supported by detailed measurements. In the revised manuscript, we will include quantitative analyses with additional figures that clearly document these changes. These figures will provide representative images, statistical summaries, and detailed descriptions of the measurements to substantiate these claims. We appreciate the reviewer highlighting these areas and will ensure that all statements are robustly backed by data.</p>

<p>What is the rationale for setting 𝐾p = 1 in the model assumptions if clear differences in junctional membranes of transformed versus wild type cells occur, including dynamic ruffling? This assumption does not seem to be in line with biological observations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the specific role of <italic>K<sub>p</sub></italic> in the differences observed in the junctional membranes of transformed versus WT cells, including dynamical ruffling, is not directly studied in this work, our findings indicate that the lower junctional tension (weaker and less stable cellular junctions) in mutant cells is influenced primarily by competition in the dimensionless cell shape index within the model. This also suggests a larger preferred cell perimeter (<italic>P<sub>0</sub></italic>) for mutant cells, corresponding to their softer, unjammed state. Huang <italic>et al.</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d3sm00327b">https://doi.org/10.1039/d3sm00327b</ext-link>) have previously argued that a high <italic>P<sub>0</sub></italic> may, in some cases, result from elevated cortical tension along cell edges, or reflect weak membrane elasticity, implying a smaller <italic>K<sub>p</sub></italic>.

<p>The novel approach to measure tissue compressibility is based on pH dependent hydrogels. As the pH responsive hydrogel pillar is placed into a culture medium with different conditions, an important control would be if the insertion of this hydrogel itself would change the pH or conditions of the culture assays and whether this alters tissue compressibility or cell adhesion. The authors could for example insert a hydrogel pillar of a smaller diameter that would not lead to compression or culture cells in a larger ring to assess the influence of the pillar itself.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment regarding the potential effects of the pH-responsive hydrogel pillar on the culture conditions and tissue compressibility. In our experiments, the expandable hydrogels are kept separate from the cells until the pH of the hydrogel is elevated to 7.4, ensuring that the hydrogel does not impact the culture environment. However, we acknowledge the concern and will include additional controls in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we will insert a hydrogel pillar with a smaller diameter that would not induce compression on culture cells in a larger ring to assess any potential influence of the hydrogel pillar itself. This will help to further validate our experimental setup.</p>

<p>The authors focus on the study of cell compaction of the transformed cells, but how does this ultimately lead to a competitive benefit of wild type cells? Is a higher rate of extrusion observed and associated with the compaction of transformed cells or is their cell death rate increased? While transformed cells seem to maintain a proliferative advantage it is not clear which consequences of tissue compression ultimately drive cell competition between wild type and transformed cells.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important point. We agree that understanding how tissue compression leads to a competitive advantage for wild type cells is crucial. While our current study focuses on the mechanical properties of transformed cells leading to the compaction and subsequent extrusion of the transformed cells, we recognize the need to explicitly connect these properties to the final outcomes of cell competition, such as extrusion or cell death. Although extrusion and cell death have been extensively characterized in previous studies (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27896-z">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27896-z</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb1853">https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb1853</ext-link>), we have indeed performed additional experiments to investigate the relationship between pressure, density, and these processes in our system. In the revised manuscript, we will include these new data, which will help to clarify how mechanical stress, driven by tissue compression, contributes to the competition between wild type and transformed cells and influences their eventual fate.</p>

<p>The argumentation that softer tissues would be more easily compressed is plausible. However, which mechanism do the authors suggest is generating the actual compressive stress to drive the compaction of transformed cells? They exclude a proliferative advantage of wild type cells, which other mechanisms will generate the compressive forces by wild type cells?</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important question. As rightly pointed out by the reviewer indeed in our model system, we do not observe a proliferative advantage for the wild-type cells, and the compressive forces exerted by the wild-type cells are due to their intrinsic mechanical properties, such as lesser compressibility compared to the transformed cells. This difference in compressibility results in wild-type cells generating compressive stress at the interface with the transformed cells. Regarding the mechanism underlying the increased compressibility of the transformed cells, our newer findings indicate that the differences in compressibility arise from variations in the intracellular organization, specifically changes in nuclear and cytoskeletal organization between wild-type and transformed cells. While a detailed molecular characterization of these mechanisms is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, we acknowledge its significance and plan to investigate it in future work. We will, nevertheless, include a detailed discussion on the mechanism underlying the differential compressibility of wild-type and transformed cells in the revised manuscript.</p>
