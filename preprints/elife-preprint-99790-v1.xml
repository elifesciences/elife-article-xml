<title>Abstract</title><p>Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) can serve as a nutritional intervention to regulate quality, function and fat infiltration in skeletal muscles but the specific cytological mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we applied single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the cytological mechanism of CLAs regulates fat infiltration in skeletal muscles based on pig models. We investigated the regulatory effects of CLAs on cell populations and molecular characteristics in pig muscles and found CLAs could promote the transformation of fast glycolytic myofibers into slow oxidative myofibers. We also observed three subpopulations including SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup>, FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup>, and PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> subclusters in adipocytes and CLAs could increase the percentage of SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. RNA velocity analysis showed FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> and PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes could differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. We further verified the differentiated trajectory of mature adipocytes and identified PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes could differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> and FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes by using high IMF content Laiwu pig models. The cell-cell communication analysis identified the interaction network between adipocytes and other subclusters such as fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Pseudotemporal trajectory analysis and RNA velocity analysis also showed FAPs could differentiate into PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> preadipocytes and we discovered the differentiated trajectory of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. Besides, we found CLAs could promote FAPs differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes via inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathway <italic>in vitro</italic>. This study provides a foundation for regulating fat infiltration in skeletal muscles by using nutritional strategies and provides potential opportunities to serve pig as an animal model to study human fat infiltrated diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Meat is one of the most important sources of animal protein for humans, and its quality is associated with human health. Recently, due to the development of economic levels and the improvement of living standards, people are seeking for ‘less but better’ meat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sahlin &amp; Trewern, 2022</xref>). Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition is a key factor positively related to meat quality traits and lipo-nutritional values of meat, such as flavor, tenderness, and juiciness(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hausman, Basu, Du, Fernyhough-Culver, &amp; Dodson, 2014</xref>; W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yi, Huang, Wang, &amp; Shan, 2023</xref>). Besides, fat infiltration in skeletal muscle (also known as myosteatosis) is the pathologic fat accumulation in skeletal muscle with poor metabolic and musculoskeletal health, it always accompanied by the decline of muscle quality and function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Biltz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jiang, Marriott, &amp; Maly, 2019</xref>). Myosteatosis is now considered as a common feature of ageing and is also related to some diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wang, Valencak, &amp; Shan, 2024</xref>). However, the occurrence mechanism and cell sources of fat accumulation in skeletal muscle is very complicated. Recently, with the rapid development of multi-omics including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)(Tabula Muris et al., 2018), single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>), and spatial transcriptomics (ST)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin et al., 2021</xref>), more and more cell types have been found to contribute to lipid deposition in skeletal muscle including myogenic cells (e.g., satellite cells (SCs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Asakura, Komaki, &amp; Rudnicki, 2001</xref>) and myogenic factor 5 (Myf5)<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yin et al., 2013</xref>)) and non-myogenic cells (e.g., fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Uezumi, Fukada, Yamamoto, Takeda, &amp; Tsuchida, 2010</xref>), fibroblasts, myeloid-derived cells(Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), pericytes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Farrington-Rock et al., 2004</xref>), endothelial cells (ECs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lang et al., 2008</xref>), PW1<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>-</sup> interstitial cells (PICs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>), and side population cells (SPs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tamaki et al., 2002</xref>)) based on animal models. Hence, more and more researches have been focusing on exploring the regulatory mechanism of myosteatosis at the cytological levels. Besides, fat infiltration in skeletal muscle is regulated by many influential triggers, including ageing, metabolic and nonmetabolic diseases, disuse and inactivity, and muscle injury(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). Many genes and signaling pathways participate in the formation and regulation of fat infiltration in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Biferali et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wosczyna et al., 2021</xref>). However, the specific mechanism of nutrients regulates fat infiltration in muscle is still unknown.</p>
<p>Nutritional regulation strategy is one of the most vital strategies to regulate lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle based on some animal models and clinic trials, including vitamins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gilsanz, Kremer, Mo, Wren, &amp; Kremer, 2010</xref>; L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>), conjugated linoleic acid (CLAs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">van Vliet, Fappi, Reeds, &amp; Mittendorfer, 2020</xref>), linseed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wei et al., 2016</xref>), plant extract(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">You et al., 2023</xref>), and so on. Hence, exploring the potential nutritional strategies to regulate fat accumulation in skeletal muscle is valuable for animal production and human health. Pigs are not only an important source of animal protein in the human diet but also serve as a valuable model for human medical biology due to their similar physiological structure in terms of size, metabolic characteristics, and cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Groenen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lunney et al., 2021</xref>). Chinese local pig species could be used as excellent animal models to study the mechanism of lipid deposition due to they have better meat quality and high IMF content. There are different myogenesis potential in neonatal skeletal muscle between Laiwu pigs and Duroc pigs(D. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Our previous study has revealed the cell heterogeneity and transcriptional dynamics of lipid deposition in skeletal muscle of Laiwu pigs(Wang, Zhao, et al., 2023). Heigai pig is a model of Chinese indigenous pig breeds, which has advantages including high farrowing rate, good pork quality, and strong disease resistance(Liyi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Specially, we have found CLAs can improve IMF content both in lean type pig breeds and fat type pig breeds(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang, Huang, Wang, &amp; Shan, 2021</xref>; L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). However, although many studies have discussed the effects of CLA on IMF deposition, there are still gaps in the cytological mechanism of CLAs in regulating lipid deposition in skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>Here, we present a snRNA-seq dataset collected from <italic>longissimus dorsi muscle</italic> (LDM) of Heigai pigs after feeding CLAs supplement to allow for analysing heterogeneity of transcriptional states in muscles. We investigated the regulatory effects of CLAs on the muscle fiber type transformation and IMF deposition. We also identified the differentiation trajectories of three subclusters in adipocytes based on Heigai pig models and high IMF content Laiwu pig models. Based on the pseudotemporal trajectories analysis, we found CLAs could promote FAPs differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes via regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway. This study paves a way to regulate lipid accumulation in muscles by using nutritional strategies and provides theoretical basis on using pig as an animal model to study human muscle-related diseases.</p>

<title>CLAs changed cell populations and transcriptional dynamics in LDM</title>
<p>Our previous study discovered CLAs improved IMF content in LDM of Heigai pigs(L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), here, we also found CLAs significantly increased TG content but significantly decreased TC content in LDM of pigs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1A</xref>). Meanwhile, immunofluorescence staining results showed more lipid droplets in the LDM of the CLAs group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1B</xref>). To investigate the changes of cell heterogeneity in pig muscles after CLAs treatment at the cellular level, we performed snRNA-seq from LDM tissue of Heigai pigs using the 10× Genomics Chromium platform (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1C</xref>). First, after Cell Ranger analyses, the estimated number of cells, fraction of reads in cells, mean reads per cell, median genes per cell and median UMI counts per cell in LDM were showed in Supplementary Fig. S1a. We obtained 25507 cells from 2 individual libraries, comprising 10835 cells from CON group and 11705 cells from CLA group for the downstream analysis after the quality control of snRNA-seq data (Figure. S1B). Based on the Seurat package, we used Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plots to show the different subclusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1D</xref>). We identified 8 different clusters in two groups of pig muscles, including myofibers (<italic>CAPN3</italic>), FAPs/fibroblasts (<italic>PDGFRA</italic>), ECs (<italic>CD34</italic>), adipocytes (<italic>PPARG</italic>), immune cells (<italic>PTPRC</italic>), muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) (<italic>PAX7</italic>), myeloid derived cells (<italic>MRC1</italic>) and pericytes (<italic>RGS5</italic>) using the expression of marker genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1E</xref>). Next, the percentage of these cell types showed differences in different group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1F</xref>). Compared with the CON group, the FAPs/fibroblasts (3.39% <italic>vs.</italic> 8.31%), ECs (1.26% <italic>vs.</italic> 2.94%), adipocytes (1.74% <italic>vs.</italic> 2.37%), myeloid derived cells (0.93% <italic>vs.</italic> 2.17%) and pericytes (0.45% <italic>vs.</italic> 0.7%) had a higher proportion in the CLA group. However, CLA decreased the proportion of myofibers (90.46% vs. 81.1%). The top 10 most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were showed in the heatmap and the bar plot showed the top 3 KEGG enrichment of DEGs between the 8 different cell types in LDM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1G</xref>). Besides, violin plots displayed CLAs upregulated the expression of mature adipocyte master genes including <italic>ADIPOQ</italic>, <italic>FABP4</italic>, <italic>PLIN1</italic>, and <italic>LIPE</italic>, adipogenic marker genes including <italic>PPARG</italic>, <italic>PPARA</italic>, <italic>CEBPA</italic>, and <italic>CEBPB</italic>, and lipid metabolism-related genes including <italic>LPL</italic>, <italic>ELOVL4</italic>, <italic>ACAA2</italic> and <italic>HACD2</italic> in pig muscles (Figures. S1C-E). These results indicated the cell types in LDM of Heigai pigs had significant differences after feeding CLAs which might induce the alterations in lipid deposition.</p>

<title>Characterization of myofibers after CLAs treatment through clustering analysis</title>
<p>To explore the changes of myofibers after CLA treatment, we next carried out a subcluster analysis and investigated the cell heterogeneity of myofibers. UMAP plots displayed the distribution in different subsets of myofibers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2A</xref>). Based on our previous study(Wang, Zhao, et al., 2023) and different gene expression in myofibers, we also characterized 6 different cell types in myofibers, including I myofibers (<italic>MYH7</italic>), IIA myofibers (<italic>MYH2</italic>), IIX myofibers (<italic>MYH1</italic>), IIB myofibers (<italic>MYH4</italic>), myotendinous junctions (MTJ, <italic>ANKRD1</italic>), and neuromuscular junction (NMJ, <italic>ABLIM2</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2B</xref>). The bar plot showed the proportion of type I myofibers (17.54% <italic>vs.</italic> 22.01%) and IIA myofibers (3.64% <italic>vs.</italic> 7.52%) had an increased tendency while the proportion of IIX myofibers (10.09% <italic>vs.</italic> 3.87%), IIB myofibers (63.88% <italic>vs.</italic> 59.35%), MTJ (6.41% <italic>vs.</italic> 0.28%) and NMJ (5.32% <italic>vs.</italic> 0.09%) had a reduced tendency in CLA group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2C</xref>). Besides, violin plot displayed CLAs increased the expression of myofiber type marker genes (<italic>MYH7</italic>, <italic>MYH2</italic>, <italic>MYH1</italic>, and <italic>MYH4</italic>), myofiber type transformation-related genes (<italic>PPARGC1A</italic>, <italic>STK11</italic>, and <italic>HDAC1</italic>) and oxidation-related genes (<italic>COX5A</italic>, <italic>COX5B</italic>, and <italic>COX8A</italic>) but decreased glycolysis-related genes (<italic>PFKM</italic>, <italic>HK2</italic>, and <italic>LDHC</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2D</xref>). Additionally, the expression of <italic>MYHCI</italic> and <italic>COX5B</italic> in LDM of Heigai pigs was also significantly increased after CLA treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2E</xref>). The top 10 DEGs between the 6 cell types in myofibers were showed in heatmap (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2F</xref>). Functional enrichment analyses revealed the enrichment of metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, and thermogenesis in I myofibers and calcium, cGMP-PKG, and MAPK signalling pathway in IIB myofibers by using KEGG pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2G</xref>). These data discovered the significantly heterogeneity in myofibers between two groups and CLAs could promote slow oxidative myofibers switch into fast glycolic myofibers in pig muscles.</p>

<title>Clustering and RNA velocity analysis revealed subpopulations and cellular dynamics of adipocytes after CLAs treatment</title>
<p>To investigate the regulatory mechanism of CLAs in IMF deposition, we next performed a subset analysis on adipocytes. Our previous study had discovered there are three subclusters in adipocytes nuclei of Laiwu pigs(Wang, Zhao, et al., 2023). In this study, we also characterized 3 subpopulations including SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, and PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes according to the most DEGs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures. 3A</xref> and S2A). Interestingly, we discovered CLAs increased the amounts of SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure. 3B</xref>) and the proportion of SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes (79.37% <italic>vs.</italic> 82.31%) but decreased the proportion of PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes (14.81% <italic>vs.</italic> 11.19%) (Figure.

<title>The verification of differentiated trajectories of adipocytes by using Laiwu pig models</title>
<p>To further verify the differentiated trajectory of adipocytes, we next carried out a pseudotemporal trajectory analysis and RNA velocity analysis of adipocytes by using our previous high IMF content pig models based on Monocle 2 and scVelo (Wang, Zhao, et al., 2023) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure. 4A</xref>).

<title>Characterization of FAPs after CLAs treatment through clustering and pseudotime analysis</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that FAPs could differentiate into mature adipocytes and are the main cell sources of IMF cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Joe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Uezumi et al., 2010</xref>). To further investigate the effects of CLAs on occurrence mechanism of IMF deposition, we then performed subcluster and pseudotemporal trajectory analysis on FAPs/fibroblasts. First, UMAP plots displayed the cell distribution in different subpopulations of FAPs/fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6A</xref>) and we identified 3 subpopulations in FAPs/fibroblasts based on the expression of marker genes, including FAPs (<italic>PDGFRA</italic>), Fibroblasts (<italic>COL1A1</italic>), and PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> subclusters (<italic>PDE4D</italic> and <italic>PDE7B</italic>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6B</xref>). In CLA group, we found the proportion of FAPs (70.40% <italic>vs.</italic> 37.06%) and PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> (4.11% <italic>vs.</italic> 2.18%) was higher than that in CON group but the proportion of in Fibroblasts (60. 76% <italic>vs.</italic> 25.49%) was lower (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6C</xref>). The top 10 most DEGs between the 3 subpopulations were showed in the heatmap and the bar plot displayed the significant enrichment of the signalling pathways in muscles by using KEGG enrichment analyses and we also found calcium and cGMP-PKG signalling pathway were enriched in PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> subclusters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6D</xref>). Besides, dot plot showed CLAs upregulated the expression of preadipocytes-related genes including <italic>CD38</italic> and <italic>CD34</italic>, adipogenic master genes including <italic>ADIPOQ</italic>, <italic>FABP4</italic>, <italic>PLIN1</italic>, and <italic>LIPE</italic>, mature adipocyte marker genes including <italic>CEBPA</italic>, and lipid metabolism-related genes including <italic>LPL</italic>, <italic>ELOVL4</italic>, <italic>ACAA2</italic> and <italic>HACD2</italic> in FAPs/Fibroblasts (Figure.

According to the results, we found FAPs could differentiate into PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> and Fibroblasts subpopulations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures. 6E</xref> and S5C). The pseudotemporal heatmap also displayed transcriptional dynamics including <italic>TIMP3</italic> and <italic>THBS1</italic> at Point 1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6F</xref>).

<title>CLAs promoted FAPs directed differentiation into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> subclusters</title>
<p>To further explore the cytological mechanism of CLAs regulating IMF deposition, we next investigated the regulatory effects of CLAs on the differentiation trajectory of FAPs differentiate into adipocytes. First, to explore the role of CLAs in the adipogenic differentiation of FAPs, we isolated primary FAPs from piglets and induced these adipogenic differentiation. Nile Red staining and OD490 results revealed CLAs can promote the adipogenic differentiation of FAPs after adipogenic differentiation for 8 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures. 7A-B</xref>).

The protein levels of FABP4 and SCD1 were significantly upregulated and PDE4D were significantly downregulated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure. 7D</xref>).

Interestingly, we next found MAPK signaling pathway were enriched in adipocytes nuclei especially SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> subcluster (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure. 7E</xref>). The expression of MAPK signaling pathway including ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 signaling pathway related genes were changed in muscle nuclei (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures. 7F</xref> and S6B-C). Furthermore, we observed that the protein levels of JNK phosphorylation were significantly decreased after CLA treatment during FAPs adipogenic differentiation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure. 7G</xref>). Hence, we next used JNK activator Anisomysin to explore the regulatory mechanism (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure. 7H</xref>). Oil Red O staining result showed that after 24h 20 nM Anisomysin treatment, the increased adipogenic differentiation of FAPs by CLA were significantly inhibited (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure. 7I</xref>). Also, CLA + Anisomysin group had the lower OD 490 value compared with CLA group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure. 7J</xref>). Nile Red staining result also showed that Anisomysin significantly inhibited the enhanced lipid droplets in FAPs after CLA treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure. 7K</xref>). MAP2K4 expression significantly upregulated and the expression of <italic>FABP4</italic> and <italic>SCD</italic> significantly decrease after Anisomysin treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure. 7L</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CLAs can serve as a nutritional intervention to regulate lipid deposition in skeletal muscle of human according to clinic trials(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">van Vliet et al., 2020</xref>). In animal production, CLAs could regulate meat quality in pigs and cattle, especially improve IMF content (L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). These studies pointed out that the CLAs plays a vital role in regulating fat infiltration in skeletal muscle. However, to date, the cellular mechanism of CLAs regulates lipid deposition has not been studied. Here, we utilized the 10x Genomics platform to identify the cell heterogeneity and transcriptional changes in muscles after CLAs treatment based on pig models. This study revealed the effects of CLAs on cell populations and molecular characteristics of muscles and highlighted the cytological mechanism of CLAs regulates pork quality in skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>CLAs is always found in ruminant animals and dairy products, it is a class of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acids with a conjugated double bond. CLAs not only has anti-cancer, anti-hypertension, anti-adipogenic, and anti-diabetic effects, but also can improve muscle function and decrease body fat percentage. For example, adding 3.2 g/day CLAs significantly increased muscle mass in higher body fat percentage Chinese adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). After 0.9 g/day CLAs supplementation, body weight variation and muscle mass significantly increased and body fat percentage variation decreased in student athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Terasawa, Okamoto, Nakada, &amp; Masuda, 2017</xref>). LC-MS metabolomics results discovered CLAs changed 57 metabolites which enriched in lipids/lipid-like molecules in plasma of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">He et al., 2022</xref>). However, another study found that for sedentary older adults, CLAs had no significant influence on muscle anabolic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">van Vliet et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the specific influences of CLAs on skeletal muscle is still disputed and the function on lipid deposition in human skeletal muscle needs further investigation. In animal models, many studies have demonstrated the important effects of CLAs on regulating fat accumulation in skeletal muscles. In porcine models, our foregoing studies have discovered that adding CLAs into the pig diet could significantly increase IMF contents in LDM of lean pig breeds and Heigai pigs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Zhang <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>)found 2% dietary CLAs significantly increased IMF deposition and reduced subcutaneous fat deposition in cattle. However, in mouse model, 0.5% mixed isomer CLAs did not lead to lipid accumulation in muscle of mice(M, S, &amp; M, 2013). Hence, CLAs supplementation positively affect IMF deposition in muscles of pigs and ruminants but the effects of CLAs may have species-specific. In our study, we found CLAs improved TG content and increased the percentage of adipocytes nuclei in LDM. Previous study demonstrated there are three subclusters in adipocytes and the formation and deposition of IMF mainly relied on DGAT2<sup>+</sup>/SCD<sup>+</sup> adipocytes and FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes(Wang, Zhao, et al., 2023). Specially, we found CLAs enhanced the percentage of SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> subclusters. These indicated CLAs improve IMF deposition might through increasing SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup>subpopulations of adipocytes. However, the specific function of CLAs on fat infiltration and deposition of skeletal muscle in people and rodents needs further study.</p>
<p>Skeletal muscle contains slow and fast muscle fibers and there are four major muscle fiber types in mice, including slow muscle fibers with type I muscle fibers (<italic>Myh7</italic>), fast muscle fibers with type IIA muscle fibers (<italic>Myh2</italic>), type IIX muscle fibers (<italic>Myh1</italic>), and type IIB muscle fibers (<italic>Myh4</italic>)(Dos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Santos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>). In pigs, illustrated there are three myofiber composition including type I, type IIA, and type IIB in skeletal muscles by ST technology(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we identified six different subpopulations in myofibers including I myofibers, IIA myofibers, IIX myofibers, IIB myofibers, MTJ, and NMJ and IIB myofibers had the highest percentage in pig muscles. Besides, slow muscle fibers always called slow-twitch oxidative muscle fibers like I myofibers have higher activities in mitochondrial oxidative metabolic enzymes and myoglobin while fast muscle fibers always called fast-twitch glycolytic muscle fibers like II myofibers have higher levels of glycolytic enzymes and glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Schiaffino &amp; Reggiani, 2011</xref>). Similarly, we also found I myofibers enriched in metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, and thermogenesis. In recent years, studies have focused on exploring the influences of CLAs on regulating muscle fiber type. In commercial pigs, the MyHC I mRNA abundance were improved in LDM of the CLAs group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Men, Deng, Xu, Tao, &amp; Qi, 2013</xref>). In mice, t10, c12-CLAs, but not c9, t11-CLAs can increase oxidative skeletal muscle fiber type in gastrocnemius muscle and C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Duan et al., 2021</xref>). CLAs have been found to prevent sarcopenia by maintaining redox balance during aging, actively regulating mitochondrial adaptation, improve muscle metabolism, and inducing hypertrophy of type IIX myofibers after endurance exercise(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen, Yang, &amp; Park, 2018</xref>). Also, we discovered CLAs enhanced the percentage of I and IIA myofibers but reduced the percentage of IIB myofibers. Previous study has found PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α) serves a valuable role in skeletal muscle metabolism and is a master regulator of oxidative phosphorylation genes and could regulate muscle fiber type transformation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Handschin &amp; Spiegelman, 2011</xref>). In our study, the PGC1α expression was also increased after CLA treatment in myofiber. These results suggested CLAs can promote glycolytic skeletal muscle fiber types switching into oxidative skeletal muscle fiber types through upregulating PGC1α expression.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have discovered that the cell sources of IMF cells and found several cell subsets lead to the ectopic IMF formation and deposition including SCs, Myf5<sup>+</sup> MSCs, FAPs, ECs, pericytes, Fibroblasts, myeloid-derived cells, SPs, and PICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sciorati, Clementi, Manfredi, &amp; Rovere-Querini, 2015</xref>; Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we found CLAs increased the percentage of preadipocytes such as FAPs, ECs, myeloid-derived cells, and pericytes. Importantly, FAPs are the major source of IMF cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Joe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Uezumi et al., 2010</xref>) and our previous study also verified the adipogenic capacity of FAPs in 2D and 3D culture models(Wang, Zhao, et al., 2023). Xu <italic>et al</italic>. found that FAPs serve as a cellular interaction hub in skeletal muscle of pigs(D. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). We used pseudotemporal trajectory and RNA velocity analysis combined with <italic>in vitro</italic> study to investigate that FAPs could first differentiate into PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes and then differentiate into DGAT2<sup>+</sup>/ SCD<sup>+</sup> and FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. However, the regulatory mechanism of FAPs directional differentiation still needs to be further explored. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrated trans-10, cis-12 CLAs inhibited skeletal muscle differentiation in C2C12 cells and inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hommelberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yeganeh, Taylor, Poole, Tworek, &amp; Zahradka, 2016</xref>). However, the influences of CLAs on regulating the adipogenic differentiation of FAPs are still unclear. In this study, we found CLAs facilitated FAPs differentiating into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. Previous studies have found mice orally treated with CLAs mixture upregulated <italic>Scd1</italic> expression in muscle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Parra, Serra, &amp; Palou, 2012</xref>). Besides, SCD1 expression is modulated by mTOR signaling pathway in cancer cells(J. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yi, Zhu, Wu, Thompson, &amp; Jiang, 2020</xref>; S. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, MAPK signaling pathway were enriched in adipogenic differentiation of FAPs after CLAs treatment. Previous studies have discovered JNK had negative effects on regulating the adipogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jang et al., 2015</xref>) and FAPs could prevent skeletal muscle regeneration after muscle injury by ST2/JNK signaling pathways(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yamakawa et al., 2023</xref>). In this study, we found CLAs may promote FAPs directed differentiation into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes via inhibiting JNK signaling pathway. However, the downstream transcriptional regulators need further discovery.</p>
<p>In a word, we provide detailed insights into the cytological mechanism of CLAs regulates fat infiltration in skeletal muscles based on pig models via using snRNA-seq. We analysed the effects of CLAs on the cell heterogeneity and transcriptional dynamics in pig muscles and discovered CLAs could promote glycolytic muscle fiber types switching into oxidative muscle fiber types through regulating PGC1α. We also identified the differentiation trajectories of adipocytes and FAPs. Our data also demonstrated CLAs could promote FAPs differentiate into DGAT2<sup>+</sup>/SCD<sup>+</sup> adipocytes via inhibiting JNK signalling pathway. This study provides a new way of developing nutritional strategies to combat myosteatosis and other muscle-related diseases and also offers potential opportunities to promote the utilization of pigs as animal models to study human diseases.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to elucidate the cytological mechanisms by which conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) influence intramuscular fat deposition and muscle fiber transformation in pig models. Utilizing single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), the study explores how CLA supplementation alters cell populations, muscle fiber types, and adipocyte differentiation pathways in pig skeletal muscles.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Innovative approach: The use of snRNA-seq provides a high-resolution insight into the cellular heterogeneity of pig skeletal muscle, enhancing our understanding of the intricate cellular dynamics influenced by nutritional regulation strategy.</p>
<p>Robust validation: The study utilizes multiple pig models, including Heigai and Laiwu pigs, to validate the differentiation trajectories of adipocytes and the effects of CLA on muscle fiber type transformation. The reproducibility of these findings across different (nutritional vs genetic) models enhances the reliability of the results.</p>
<p>Advanced data analysis: The integration of pseudotemporal trajectory analysis and cell-cell communication analysis allows for a comprehensive understanding of the functional implications of the cellular changes observed.</p>
<p>Practical relevance: The findings have significant implications for improving meat quality, which is valuable for both the agricultural and food industry.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Model generalizability: While pigs are excellent models for human physiology, the translation of these findings to human health, especially in diverse populations, needs careful consideration.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study comprehensively presents data from single nuclei sequencing of Heigai pig skeletal muscle in response to conjugated linoleic acid supplementation. The authors identify changes in myofiber type and adipocyte subpopulations induced by linoleic acid at depth previously unobserved. The authors show that linoleic acid supplementation decreased the total myofiber count, specifically reducing type II muscle fiber types (IIB), myotendinous junctions, and neuromuscular junctions, whereas type I muscle fibers are increased. Moreover, the authors identify changes in adipocyte pools, specifically in a population marked by SCD1/DGAT2. To validate the skeletal muscle remodeling in response to linoleic acid supplementation, the authors compare transcriptomics data from Laiwu pigs, a model of high intramuscular fat, to Heigai pigs. The results verify changes in adipocyte subpopulations when pigs have higher intramuscular fat, either genetically or diet-induced. Targeted examination using cell-cell communication network analysis revealed associations with high intramuscular fat with fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs).  The authors then conclude that conjugated linoleic acid induces FAPs towards adipogenic commitment. Specifically, they show that linoleic acid stimulates FAPs to become SCD1/DGAT2+ adipocytes via JNK signaling. The authors conclude that their findings demonstrate the effects of conjugated linoleic acid on skeletal muscle fat formation in pigs, which could serve as a model for studying human skeletal muscle diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The comprehensive data analysis provides information on conjugated linoleic acid effects on pig skeletal muscle and organ function. The notion that linoleic acid induces skeletal muscle composition and fat accumulation is considered a strength and demonstrates the effect of dietary interactions on organ remodeling. This could have implications for the pig farming industry to promote muscle marbling. Additionally, these data may inform the remodeling of human skeletal muscle under dietary behaviors, such as elimination and supplementation diets and chronic overnutrition of nutrient-poor diets. However, the biggest strength resides in thorough data collection at the single nuclei level, which was extrapolated to other types of Chinese pigs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors generated a sizeable comprehensive dataset, cellular and molecular validation needed to be improved. For example, the single nuclei data suggest changes in myofiber type after linoleic acid supplementation, yet these data are not validated by other methodologies. Similarly, the authors suggest that linoleic acid alters adipocyte populations, FAPs, and preadipocytes; however, no cellular and molecular analysis was performed to reveal if these trajectories indeed apply. Attempts to identify JNK signaling pathways appear superficial and do not delve deeper into mechanistic action or transcriptional regulation. Notably, a variety of single cell studies have been performed on mouse/human skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. Yet, the authors need to discuss how the populations they have identified support the existing literature on cell-type populations in skeletal muscle. Moreover, the authors nicely incorporate the two pig models into their results, but the authors only examine one muscle group. It would be interesting if other muscle groups respond similarly or differently in response to linoleic acid supplementation. Further, it was unclear whether Heigai and Laiwu pigs were both fed conjugated linoleic acid or whether the comparison between Heigai-fed linoleic acid and Laiwu pigs (as a model of high intramuscular fat). With this in mind, the authors do not discuss how their results could be implicated in human and pig nutrition, such as desirability and cost-effectiveness for pig farmers and human diets high in linoleic acid. Notably, while single nuclei data is comprehensive, there needs to be a statement on data deposition and code availability, allowing others access to these datasets. Moreover, the experimental designs do not denote the conjugated linoleic acid supplementation duration. Several immunostainings performed could be quantified to validate statements. This reviewer also found the Nile Red staining hard to interpret visually and did not appear to support the conclusions convincingly. Within Figure 7, several letters (assuming they represent statistical significance) are present on the graphs but are not denoted within the figure legend.</p>
