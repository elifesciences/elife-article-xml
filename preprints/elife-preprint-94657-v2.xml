<title>Abstract</title><p>The spatial and temporal linear expression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes establishes a regional <italic>Hox</italic> code, which is crucial for the antero-posterior (A-P) patterning, segmentation, and neuronal circuit development of the hindbrain. RNF220, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is widely involved in neural development <italic>via</italic> targeting of multiple substrates. Here, we found that the expression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the pons was markedly up-regulated at the late developmental stage (post-embryonic day E15.5) in <italic>Rnf220<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic>mouse embryos. Single-nucleus RNA-seq analysis revealed different <italic>Hox</italic> de-repression profiles in different groups of neurons, including the pontine nuclei (PN). The <italic>Hox</italic> pattern was disrupted and the neural circuits were affected in the PN of <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice. We showed that this phenomenon was mediated by WDR5, a key component of the TrxG complex, which can be polyubiquitinated and degraded by RNF220. Intrauterine injection of WDR5 inhibitor (WDR5-IN-4) and genetic ablation of <italic>Wdr5</italic> in <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice largely recovered the de-repressed <italic>Hox</italic> expression pattern in the hindbrain. In P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, the retinoic acid induced <italic>Hox</italic> expression was further stimulated by <italic>Rnf220</italic> knockdown, which can also be rescued by <italic>Wdr5</italic> knockdown. In short, our data suggest a new role of RNF220/WDR5 in <italic>Hox</italic> pattern maintenance and pons development in mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The coordinated expression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes clusters is critical for axial patterning to determine the positional identities during the development of many tissues, including the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Frank et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Parker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Parker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pöpperl et al., 1993</xref>). In mammals, there are 39 <italic>Hox</italic> genes organized in four clusters (<italic>HoxA</italic>, <italic>HoxB</italic>, <italic>HoxC</italic>, and <italic>HoxD</italic>) and divided into 1-13 paralog groups (PG). During vertebrate development, the hindbrain forms eight metameric segmented units along the antero-posterior (A-P) axis known as rhombomeres (r), which give rise to the cerebellum, pons and medulla later on (Ghosh et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Parker et al., 2020</xref>). In the embryonic hindbrain, <italic>Hox</italic>1-5 genes are expressed in a nested overlapping pattern with rhombomere-specific boundaries. This <italic>Hox</italic> code is critical for the establishment of rhombomeric territories and the determination of cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barsh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Parker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Parker et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>At later embryonic stages, <italic>Hox</italic> genes also play vital roles in neuronal migration and circuit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hockman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratochwil et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). For example, neurons in the pontine nuclei (PN), which acts as an information integration station between the cortex and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratochwil et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Maheshwari et al., 2020</xref>), originate at the posterior rhombic lip of r6-r8, migrate tangentially to the rostral ventral hindbrain, and then receive different inputs from the cortex, in which the specific expression pattern of <italic>Hox3-5</italic> genes determines the migration routines, cellular organization, and neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Geisen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratochwil et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Maheshwari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Di Meglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lizen et al., 2017</xref>). Note that <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression is maintained up to postnatal and even adult stages in the hindbrain derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Farago et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kratochwil et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Hox</italic> pattern maintenance is generally governed by epigenetic regulators, especially the polycomb-group (PcG) and trithorax-group (trxG) complexes, which repress and activate <italic>Hox</italic> genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bahrampour et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chopra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Papp et al., 2006</xref>). In mammals, different SET/MLL proteins, and a common multi-subunit core module consisting of WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30 (WRAD) constitute the COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1) family of TrxG complexes, which acts as a methyltransferase generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cenik et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jambhekar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>). Among them, WDR5 plays a central scaffolding role and has been shown to act as a key regulator of <italic>Hox</italic> maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wysocka et al., 2005</xref>). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), WDR5 is responsible for MLL-mediated <italic>HoxA9</italic> activation and is a potential drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, WDR5 facilitates <italic>HOTTIP,</italic> a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), to recruit the MLL complex and thus stimulate <italic>HoxA9</italic> and <italic>HoxA13</italic> expression during the progression of prostate and liver tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Malek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Quagliata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wong et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF220 is widely involved in neural development through targeting a range of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Although our previous reports have shown that <italic>Rnf220<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice is neonatal lethal and the survived <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice develop severe motor impairments; the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, a markedly up-regulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes is observed in the pons of both <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Rnf220<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice during late embryonic development. In consequence, the topographic input connectivity of the PN neurons with cortex is disturbed in <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, we identified WDR5 as a direct target of RNF220 for K48-linked ubiquitination and thus degradation, a mechanism critical for <italic>Hox</italic> de-repression by <italic>Rnf220</italic> knockout. Together, these findings reveal a novel role for RNF220 in the regulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes and pons development in mice.</p>

<title><italic>Rnf220</italic> insufficiency leads to dysregulation of <italic>Hox</italic> expression in late embryonic pons</title>
<p><italic>Rnf220</italic> is strongly expressed in the embryonic mouse mid/hind brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Based on microarray analysis, we explored changes in expression profiles in E18.5 <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Rnf220<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse brains, which breed floxed <italic>Rnf220</italic> to Vasa-Cre mice. Interestingly, several <italic>Hox</italic> genes were up-regulated in the mouse brain of both genotypes (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Considering that <italic>Hox</italic> expression in forebrain is too low (data not shown), we focus on the hindbrain and found that this phenomenon was observed only in late embryonic stages after E15.5 (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). Since <italic>Rnf220<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice is neonatal lethal and there is not significant diference in the upregulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes between <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Rnf220<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice were used in subsequent assays in this study. To determine the specific brain regions with aberrant <italic>Hox</italic> expression, we examined the expression levels of <italic>HoxA9</italic> and <italic>HoxB9</italic>, two of the most significantly up-regulated genes, in different brain and spinal regions (Figure 1-figure supplement 2A-D). Notably, both <italic>HoxA9</italic> and <italic>HoxB9</italic> were exclusively up-regulated in the brainstem of <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice (Figure 1-figure supplement 2C and D). The brainstem comprises the midbrain, pons, and medulla (Figure 1-figure supplement 2E). Further, we confirmed that the upregulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes was restricted to the pons in the <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice (Figure 1-figure supplement 2F). In addition, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the pons also revealed an overall increase in <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression in adult <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

In total, 125956 and 122266 cell transcriptomes with an average of approximately ≥700 genes for the WT and <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic>mice respectively were further analyzed. 15 cell clusters were identified by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) in both the WT and <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and C</xref>). When we annotate these cell clusters by their uniquely and highly expressed markers (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), we found that most of the clusters were identified as distinct neuronal groups (cluster_1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13), in addition to astrocyte (cluster_5), oligodendrocyte (cluster_3), oligodendrocyte precursor (cluster_14), ependymal cell (cluster_9), and a group not corresponding to any known cell types (cluster_0) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Then the <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression levels for each cell clusters were analyzed and found that up-regulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes was most pronounced in three of these clusters (cluster_2, 7, and 10) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), albeit with distinct profiles. <italic>Hox7–10</italic> genes were up-regulated genes in cluster_2, while <italic>Hox3–5</italic> and <italic>Hox1–3</italic> genes were activated in cluster_7 and 10, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).

<p>When we refer to the transcriptomic profiles of each cluster in the pons, we found that the cluster_10 likely represents cells derived from rhombomeres 2–5, given their expression of endogenous anterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes (<italic>Hox1–3</italic>), while the cluster_7 likely represents cells derived from rhombomeres 6–8, as evidenced by the expression of <italic>Hox3–5</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).

<title>RNF220 targets WDR5 for K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation</title>
<p>The up-regulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice suggested a role for RNF220 in the maintenance of <italic>Hox</italic> expression pattern. Generally, the <italic>Hox</italic> expression pattern is maintained epigenetically by the PcG and trxG complexes, which regulate the silencing and activation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bahrampour et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chopra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Papp et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, we did observe the local epigenetic modification changes, <italic>i.e.</italic> the downregulated H3K27me3 signals and upregulated H3K4me3 signals, in some <italic>Hox</italic> cluster in hindbrain of <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice by ChIP-qPCR assays (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A and B). Therefore, protein levels of the core components of PcG and TrxG complexes in the mouse hindbrain were examined and the results showed that although the protein levels of the core components of PcG we examined were comparable between WT and <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic>, a clear increase in the protein level of WDR5, a key component of the trxG complex, was observed in the hindbrain of both <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup>and Rnf220<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse embryos at E18.5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; Figure 3-figure supplement 2A and B), the phenomenon was also observed at E16.5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We next tested the expression of WDR5 in the mouse pons, cortex, and cerebellum at adult and found that the increase in the protein level of WDR5 was only observed in the pons, but not in the cortex or cerebellum, in <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>; Figure 3-figure supplement 2C and D), which is consistent with the pons-specific up-regulation in <italic>Hox</italic> genes expression.

<p>The above data suggest that WDR5 might be a direct target of RNF220 for polyubiquitination and thus degradation. Indeed, in HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected with Flag-tagged RNF220 and myc-tagged WDR5, WDR5 coimmunoprecipitated with RNF220 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In the reverse experiment, RNF220 also coimmunoprecipitated with WDR5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, when WDR5 was immunoprecipitated from the mouse brainstem using an anti-WDR5 antibody, endogenous RNF220 was also detected in the immunoprecipitated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Then we examined if the WDR5 protein level was regulated by RNF220. The results showed that co-expression of wild-type RNF220, but not the ligase-dead mutant (W539A) or the RING domain deletion (△Ring) form, clearly reduced the protein level of WDR5 in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, the reduction in the protein level of WDR5 by RNF220 overexpression was blocked by MG132, suggesting a role for the proteasome in this regulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>

<p>We further carried out polyubiquitination assays to examine if WDR5 may be a target for RNF220. It was found that co-expression of RNF220 strongly enhanced the polyubiquitination of WDR5 protein, and this regulation depends on the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF220 because RNF220 △ Ring failed to promote the polyubiquitinaion of WDR5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Moreover, when the endogenous WDR5 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the mouse pons, its polyubiquitination level in <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice was markedly decreased compared to WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>Different types of ubiquitination linkages have distinct regulatory effects on the stability or activity of protein targets, and K48-linked polyubiquitination usually leads to proteasomal degradation of protein targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grice et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, WDR5 were only ubiquitinated by RNF220 when K48-type ubiquitin was present (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Consistent with this, when the K48R mutated ubiquitin was co-expressed, the RNF220 induced polyubiquitination level of WDR5 protein was fully diminished (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). To determine the exact lysines ubiquitinated by RNF220, we first tested the effects of RNF220 on the stability of different WDR5 truncates and found that the truncate remaining 1-127aa was enough to be degraded by RNF220, suggesting the corresponding lysines were included in this region (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A). We individually mutated all these conserved lysines into arginines and then examined RNF220-mediated ubiquitination of each mutant. It was found that K109, K112, and K120 were required for the polyubiquitination of WDR5 (Figure 4-figure supplement 1B). Furthermore, when these lysine residues were simultaneously mutated into arginines, RNF220 failed to enhance the polyubiquitination levels of the resulted WDR5-3KR mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>), suggesting that these lysine residues are direct ubiquitination sites. Together, these results indicate that RNF220 regulates WDR5 ubiquitination by adding K48-linked polyubiquitin chains at the lysine sites of K109, K112, and K120.</p>

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Philippidou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Miller et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bonito et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to their roles in progenitor cell specification, cell survival, neuronal migration, axon guidance, and dendrite morphogenesis during early development stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Smith et al., 2024</xref>), <italic>Hox</italic> genes also play key roles in the regulation of synapse formation, neuronal terminal identity and neural circuit assembly at late stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Philippidou et al., 2013</xref>). Our study revealed a dose-dependent role of RNF220 and WDR5 in the maintenance of <italic>Hox</italic> expression in the hindbrain, which might have a functional role in the neural circuit organization of the pons in mice.</p>
<p>In mammals, WDR5, a key component of the COMPASS-related complexes, has been reported to be absolutely required for the regulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes expression during mammalian embryo development and cancer progression <italic>via</italic> different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wysocka et al., 2005</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we report a WDR5 protein stability controlling mechanism by RNF220-mediated polyubiquitination and illustrate the role of this regulation on the maintenance of <italic>Hox</italic> genes expression in the mouse hindbrain. The stabilization of WDR5 and stimulation of <italic>Hox</italic> expression upon RNF220 knockdown was also recapitulated in RA treated P19 cells, a cellular model for <italic>Hox</italic> regulation study.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when examined at single cell level, different <italic>Hox</italic> stimulation profiles were detected in different neuronal groups, so that <italic>Hox 1-3</italic> were up-regulated in cluster 10, while <italic>Hox3-5</italic> and <italic>Hox7-10</italic> upregulation appeared in cluster 7 and cluster 2 respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Cluster 10 and 7 express endogenous <italic>Hox1-3</italic> and <italic>Hox3-5</italic>, respectively. It is reasonable that the expression of these <italic>Hox</italic> genes are stimulated upon WDR5 elevation due to RNF220 insufficiency. Cluster 2 is most interesting in that, <italic>Hox7-10</italic> were up-regulated in these cells which were not expressed in wild type hindbrain. This cluster was defined as glycinergic neuron cells with Slc6a5 expression. The nature of this group of cells and the phenotypic effect of <italic>Hox</italic> up-regulation await further analysis. The de-regulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes might have wide effect on the development of the many nuclei in the pons, including cell differentiation and neural circuit formation. For the PN, we showed here that the patterning and projection pattern from the motor cortex were affected in the <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>The regulation of WDR5 and <italic>Hox</italic> expression by RNF220 seems to be context dependent and precisely controlled in vivo, depending on the molecular and epigenetic status of the cell. For example, although WDR5 and RNF220 are widely co-expressed in the brain, WDR5 levels are not affected in most regions in the <italic>Rnf220<sup>+/−</sup></italic> brain, including the cortex, cerebellum etc. (Figure 3-figure supplement 2C and D). This is also true for EED, another epigenetic regulator, which is targeted by RNF220 in the cerebellum, but not in the pons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ma et al.,2020</xref>). In untreated P19 cells, knockdown of RNF220 also has no effect on the stability of endogenous WDR5, although overexpression of RNF220 did reduce WDR5 level in 293T cells. We suggest that RA treatment of P19 cells helps to set up the molecular environment that facilitates <italic>Hox</italic> expression as well as RNF220-WDR5 interaction.</p>
<p>In summary, our data support WDR5 as a RNF220 target involved in the maintenance of Hox expression and thus development of the pons.</p>

<title>snRNA-seq library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis</title>
<p>snRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Split-seq platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>). Freshly harvested mouse pons tissues underwent nuclear extraction following previously described protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>.). In brief, mouse brain tissues were transferred into a 2 mL Dounce homogenizer containing 1mL homogenizing buffer (250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH = 8.0], 1 mM DTT, RNase Inhibitor and 0.1% Triton X-100). The mixture was subjected to five strokes with a loose pestle, followed by 10 strokes with a tight pestle. The resulting homogenates were filtered through a 40-μm strainer into 5-mL Eppendorf tubes and subsequently centrifuged for 4 min at 600 <italic>g</italic> and 4 °C. The pellet was re-suspended and washed in 1 mL of PBS containing RNase inhibitors and 0.1% BSA. The nuclei were again filtered through a 40-μm strainer and quantified. These nuclei were partitioned into 48 wells, each of which contained a barcoded, well-specified reverse transcription primer, to enable in-nuclear reverse transcription. Subsequent second and third barcoding steps were carried out through ligation reactions. After the third round of barcoding, the nuclei were divided into 16 aliquots and lysed prior to cDNA purification. The resulting purified cDNA was subjected to template switching and qRT-PCR amplification, which was halted at the beginning of the plateau stage. Finally, the purified PCR products (600 pg) were used to generate Illumina-compatible sequencing libraries. Distinct, indexed PCR primer pairs were employed to label each library, serving as the fourth barcode.</p>
<p>The libraries underwent sequencing on the NextSeq system (Illumina) using 150-nucleotide kits and paired-end sequencing protocols. In this arrangement, Read 1 covered the transcript sequences and Read 2 contained the UMI and UBC barcode combinations. Initially, a six-nucleotide sequencing index, serving as the fourth barcode, was appended to the ends of Read 2. Subsequently, reads with more than one mismatching base in the third barcode were excluded from the dataset. Furthermore, reads containing more than one low-quality base (Phred score ≤ 10) within the UMI region were also discarded. The sequencing results were aligned to exons and introns in the reference genome (Genome assembly GRCm38, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001635.20/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001635.20/</ext-link>) and aggregated intron and exon counts at the gene level were calculated by kallisto and bustools software as described (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bustools.github.io/BUS_notebooks_R">https://bustools.github.io/BUS_notebooks_R</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Mouse brain stereotactic injection and neuronal tracing were carried out as previously described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Xu et al., 2021</xref>.). Adult mice (2–3 months old) were used for anterograde monosynaptic neuronal tracing. The mice were first deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and placed into a stereotactic apparatus with the front teeth latched onto the anterior clamp. The mouth and nose of the mice were covered with a mask to provide isoflurane and keep them in an anesthetic state during the operation. The head was adjusted and maintained in horizontal by inserting ear bars into the ear canal. The hair of the head was shaved with an electric razor and cleaned using a cotton swab which was dipped in 75% alcohol. Cut the scalp along the midline with surgical scissors and make sure the bregma, lambda and the interaural line were exposed. The intersection between the lambda and interaural line was set to zero. The coordinates ±1.75, −4.9, −1.65) were applied for motor cortex localization. Each mouse received a single injection of 500 nL of rAAV-hSyn-EGFP-WPRE-hGH-poly A (Brainvta, PT-1990) viral fluid in the hemisphere. After the injection, mice were bred for another 3 weeks for neuronal tracing before their brains were harvested for analysis.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study focuses on gene regulatory mechanisms essential for hindbrain development. Through molecular genetics and biochemistry, the authors propose a new mechanism for the control of Hox genes, which encode highly conserved transcription factors essential for hindbrain development. The strength of evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, as most claims are supported by the data. This work will be of interest to developmental biologists.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Wang et al. investigates the role of Rnf220 in hindbrain development and Hox expression. The authors suggest that Rnf220 controls Hox expression in the hindbrain through regulating WDR5 levels. The authors combine in vivo experiments with experiments in P19 cells to demonstrate this mechanism. However, the in vivo data does not provide strong support for the claims the authors make and the role of Rnf in Hox maintenance and pons development is unclear.</p>
<p>While the authors partially addressed some of the issues raised in the first round of reviews, and the in vitro data showing a relationship between Rnf220 and WDR5 is convincing, some issues still remain about the experimental evidence supporting their claims and the relationship of this work with previous studies demonstrating the role of Hox proteins in pontine nuclei in vivo.</p>
<p>The authors say they were unable to detect Hox levels via in situ hybridization at late embryonic stages, stating that the levels are likely too low to be detected-yet they are presumably high enough to cause ectopic targeting of pontine neurons. Work from the Rijli group, which the authors cite, shows that Hox3-5 paralogs can be clearly detected both by in situ and by staining with commercially available antibodies. Since a major claim of this paper is the upregulation of Hox genes in Rnf220+/- mice through WDR5 regulation, the authors need to show this more convincingly. The inability to detect Hox upregulation, and subsequent rescue, by means other than qPCR in vivo remains a major weakness of the paper. The authors also do not discuss how broad upregulation of all Hox paralogs leads to the changes in PN targeting in the context of previous work.</p>
<p>The links between Wdr5 expression, epigenetic modifications, Hox expression and axon mistargeting in vivo remains somewhat tenuous. For example, the authors show epigenetic modification changes in some Hox genes, but not Hox5 paralogs, and only show the rescue by Wdr5 KO in vitro. Similarly, they do not attempt to show rescue of axon targeting in vivo after presumably restoring Hox levels by Wdr5 inhibition or knockdown.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p>
<p>(1) A major issue throughout the paper is that Hox expression analysis is done exclusively through quantitative PCR, with values ranging from 2-fold to several thousand-fold upregulation, with no antibody validation for any Hox protein (presumably they are all upregulated).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment.</p>
<p>We tried to verify the stimulated <italic>Hox</italic> expression pattern by in situ hybridization. Although in early embryos (E9.5) we could detect clearly hox (<italic>i.e. Hox8 and Hox9</italic> in Author response image 1) expression patterns in the neural tube by whole mount in situ hybridization, we failed to detect a clear pattern in the brain stem at E18.5 either in whole mount tissue or on sections. That’s one reason that we turned to single nuclear RNA-seq instead.</p>
<p>This is likely due to their low expression levels at late developmental stages and need to be detected by more sensitive method. However, we estimated that the stimulated expression levels of the representative <italic>Hox</italic> genes are at least comparable to the physiological levels at posterior spinal cord to evoke a functional effect.</p>

<p>(2) In Figure 1, massive upregulation of most Hox genes in the brainstem is shown after e16.5 but the paper quickly focuses on analysis of PN nuclei. What are the other consequences of this broad upregulation of Hox genes in the brainstem? There is no discussion of the overall phenotype of the mice, the structure of the brainstem, the migration of neurons, etc. The very narrow focus on motor cortex projections to PN nuclei seems bizarre without broad characterization of the mice, and the brainstem in particular. There is only a mention of &quot;severe motor deficits&quot; from previous studies, but given the broad expression of Rnf220, the fact that is a global knockout, and the effects on spinal cord populations shown previously the justification for focusing on PN nuclei does not seem strong.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment.</p>
<p>Although RNF220 is important for the dorsal-ventral patterning of the spinal cord as well as the hindbrain during embryonic development, the earlier neural patterning and differentiation are normal in the <italic>Rnf220+/-</italic> mice (Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2022). However, these mice showed reduced survival and motility to various degree postnatally (Ma <italic>et al</italic>., 2019; Ma <italic>et al</italic>., 2021), likely suggesting a dosage dependent role of RNF220 in maintaining late neural development. As our microarray assay showed the deregulation of the <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the brain, we followed this direction in this study and narrowed down the affected region to the pons. Our single nuclear RNA-Seq (snRNA-seq) data further shows that the <italic>Hox</italic> de-regulation mainly occurred in 3 clusters of neurons. However, the pons is complex and contains tens of nuclei. And the current resolution of our data does not support to assign a clear identity to each of them. Although it is clear that more nuclei are likely affected, the PN (cluster7) is the only cluster we can identify to follow in the current study.</p>
<p>As to general effect of RNF220 haploinsufficiency on the brainstem, we carried out Nissl staining assays and found no clear difference in neuronal cell organization between WT and <italic>Rnf220+/-</italic> pons (revised Figure 2-figure supplement 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is stated that cluster 7 in scRNA-seq corresponds to the PN nuclei. The modest effect shown on Hox3-5 expression in that data in Figure 1 is inconsistent with the larger effect shown in Figure 2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment.</p>
<p>Due to the low efficiency of snRNA-seq and the depth of the sequencing, the quantification of the <italic>Hox</italic> expression based on the snRNA-seq data is likely less accurate as the qRT-PCR. In addition, only mRNAs in the nuclear could be captured by snRNA-seq, while mRNAs in both the nuclear and cytoplasm were reversed-transcribed and examined for qRT-PCR assays in Figure 2A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Presumably, Hox genes are not the only targets of Rnf220 as shown in the microarray/RNA-sequencing data. There is no definitive evidence that any phenotypes observed (which are also not clear) are specifically due to Hox upregulation. The only assay the authors use to look at a Hox-dependent phenotype in the brainstem is the targeting of PN nuclei by motor cortex axons. This is only done in 2 animals and there are no details as to how the data was analyzed and quantified. The only 2 images shown are not convincing of a strong phenotype, they could be taken at slightly different levels or angles. At the very least, serial sections should be shown and the experiment repeated in more animals. There is also no discussion of how these phenotypes, if real, would relate to previous work by the Rijli group which showed very precise mechanisms of synaptic specificity in this system.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>The deregulation of <italic>Hox</italic> is the most obvious phenomena observed from the RNA-seq data, and we tried to assign its specific phenotypic effect in this study. As the roles of <italic>Hox</italic> in PN patterning and circuit formation is well established, we focused on the PN in the following study. Based on literature, we carried out the circuit analysis to examine the targeting of PN neurons by the motor cortex axons. A cohort of additional animals with different genotypes (n=10 for WT and n=9 for <italic>Rnf220+/-</italic>) were used to repeat the experiment and we got the same conclusion. More detailed information on data analysis and serial images were included in the revised manuscript and figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The temporal aspect of this regulation in vivo is not clear. The authors show some expression changes begin at e16.5 but are also present at 2 months. Is the presumed effect on neural circuits a result of developmental upregulation at late embryonic stages or does the continuous overexpression in adult mice have additional influence? Are any of the Hox genes upregulated normally expressed in the brainstem, or PN specifically, at 2 months? Why perform single-cell sequencing experiments at 2 months if this is thought to be mostly a developmental effect? Similarly, the significance of the upregulated WRD5 in the pons and pontine nuclei at 2 months in Figure 3 is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment.</p>
<p>The spatial and temporal expression pattern of <italic>Hox</italic> genes is established at early embryonic stages and then maintained throughout developmental stage in mammals. As we have shown, the de-repression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes is a long-lasting defect in <italic>Rnf220+/-</italic> mice beginning at late embryonic stages. Since the neuronal circuit is established after birth in mice, we speculated that the neuronal circuit defects from motor cortex to PN neurons were due to the long-lasting up-regulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in PN neurons. We could not distinguish the effect on neural circuit a result of <italic>Hox</italic> genes developmental upregulation or continuous overexpression in adult mice. An inducible knockout mouse model may help to answer this question in the future. The discussion on this point was included in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We carried out snRNA-seq analysis using pons tissues from adult mice aiming to identify the specific cell population with <italic>Hox</italic> up-regulation, which we failed to specify by in situ hybridization.</p>
<p>We repeated the related experiments in the original Figure 3 and some of the blot images were replaced and quantified.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 3C, the levels of RNF220 in wt and het don't seem to be that different.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We repeated the experiments and changed the related image in the revised Figure 3C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Based on the single-cell experiments, and the PN nuclei focus, the rescue experiments are confusing. If the Rnf220 deletion has a sustained effect for up to 2 months, why do the injections in utero? If the focus is the PN nuclei why look at Hox9 expression and not Hox3-5 which are the only Hox genes upregulated in PN based on sc-sequencing? No rescue of behavior or any phenotype other than Hox expression by qPCR is shown and it is unclear whether upregulation of Hox9 paralogs leads to any defects in the first place. The switch to the Nes-cre driver is not explained. Also, it seems that wdr5 mRNA levels are not so relevant and protein levels should be shown instead (same for rescue experiments in P19 cells).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments.</p>
<p>Since our data suggest that the upregulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes expression is a long-lasting effect beginning at the late embryonic stage of E16.5, we conducted the rescue experiments by in utero injection of WDR5 inhibitor at E15.5 and examined the expression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes at E18.5. Although it is also necessary to examine whether the rescue effect by WDR5 inhibitor injection is also a long-lasting effect at adult stages, it is difficult to distinguish the embryos or pups when they were given birth. As a supplement, rescue assays with genetic ablation of <italic>Wdr5</italic> gene were conducted and the results showed that genetic ablation of a single copy of <italic>Wdr5</italic> allele could revere the upregulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes by RNF220 haploinsufficiency in the hindbrains at P15.</p>
<p>Most of the upregulated <italic>Hox</italic> genes including both <italic>Hox9</italic> and <italic>Hox3-5</italic> were examined in our rescue experiments. Since this study focuses on the PN nuclei, the results of <italic>Hox3-5</italic> genes were shown in the revised main Figure 6.</p>
<p>We conducted rescue experiments by deleting <italic>Wdr5</italic> in neural tissue using _Nestin-Cr_e mice because <italic>Wdr5+/-</italic> mice is embryonic lethal. And the up-regulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes could be also observed in the hindbrains of <italic>Rnf220fl/wt</italic>; <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> mice. Although <italic>Rnf220fl/wt; Wdr5fl/wt; Nestin-Cre</italic> mice are viable and could survive to adult stages, developmental defects in the forebrains, including cerebral cortex and hippocampus, were observed in <italic>Rnf220fl/wt;Wdr5fl/wt;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice. Therefore, no rescue of behavior tests was conducted in this study. We believe that it is out of the scope of this study to discuss the role of WDR5 in the development of forebrains.</p>
<p>The potential defects due to the up-regulation of <italic>Hox9</italic> paralogs awaits further investigations.</p>
<p><italic>Wdr5</italic> mRNA levels were firstly examined to confirm the genetic deletion or siRNA mediated knockdown of <italic>Wdr5</italic> genes. We have carried out western blot to examine the WDR5 protein levels and the results were included in the revised Figure 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) What is the relationship between Retinoic acid and WRD5? In Figure 3E there is no change in WRD5 levels without RA treatment in Rnf KO but an increase in expression with RA treatment and Rnf KO. However, the levels of WRD5 do not seem to change with RA treatment alone. Does Rnf220 only mediate WDR5 degradation in the presence of RA? This does not seem to be the case in experiments in 293 cells in Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment.</p>
<p>We believe that the regulation of WDR5 and <italic>Hox</italic> expression by RNF220 is context dependent and precisely controlled in vivo, depending on the molecular and epigenetic status of the cell, which is fulfilled by RA treatment in P19 cells. In Figure 4, the experiment is based on exogenous overexpression assays, which might not fully reflect the situation in vivo.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Why are the levels of Hox upregulation after RA treatment so different in Figure 5 and Figure Supplement 5?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure.5C, the <italic>Hox</italic> expression levels were normalized against the control group in the presence of RA; while in Figure Supplement 5 they were normalized to the control group without RA treatment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) In Figures 4B+C which lanes are input and which are IP? There is no quantitation of Figure 4D, from the blot it does look that there is a reduction in the last 2 columns as well. The band in the WT flag lane seems to have a bubble. Need to quantitate band intensities. Same for E, the effect does not seem to be completely reversed with MG132.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out. The labels were included in the revised Figure 4B and 4C.</p>
<p>We repeated the experiments for Figure 4D and 4E. Some of bot images were replaced and quantified in the revised Figure 4D and 4E.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figure 1E shows that Rnf220 knockdown alone could not induce an increase in Hox expression without RA, which indicates that Rnf220 might endogenously upregulate Retinoic acid signaling. The authors should test if RA signaling is downstream of Rnf220 by looking at differences in the expression of Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase genes (as a proxy for RA synthesis) upon Rnf220 knockdown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment and suggestion.</p>
<p>Two sequential reactions are required for RA synthesis from retinol, which catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs)/ retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDHs also known as ALDHs) respectively. When RA is no longer needed, it is catabolized by cytochrome enzymes (CYP26 enzymes) (Niederreither, <italic>et al</italic>.,2008; Kedishvili <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). Here, we test ADHs、ALDHs and CYP26 enzymes in E16.5 WT and <italic>Rnf220-/-</italic> embryos.</p>
<p>The results are as follows. ADH7 and ADH10 are slightly upregulated. ALDH1 and ALDH3 are upregulated and downregulated in <italic>Rnf220-/-</italic> embryos, respectively, but there is no significant change in the expression of ALDH2, which plays a key role in RA synthesis during embryonic development (Niederreither, <italic>et al</italic>.,2008). Furthermore, Cyp26a1 which responsible for RA catabolism was upregulated in <italic>Rnf220-/-</italic> embryos. Collectively, these data do not support a clear effect on RA signaling by RNF220.</p>

<p>(2) In Figure 2C-D further explanation is required to describe what criteria were used to segment the tissue into Rostral, middle, and caudal regions. Additionally, it is unclear whether the observed change in axonal projection pattern is caused due to physical deformation and rearrangement of the entire Pons tissue or due to disruption of Hox3-5 expression levels. Labeling of the tissue with DAPI or brightfield image to show the structural differences and similarities between the brain regions of WT and Rnf220 +/- will be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment and suggestion.</p>
<p>More information on the quantification of the results shown in Figure 2C-D was included in our revised manuscript. We carried out Nissl staining assays using coronal sections of the brainstem and found that there is no significant difference in neuronal cell organization between WT and <italic>Rnf220+/-</italic> (revised Figure 2-figure supplement 2).</p>

<p>(3) Line 192-195. These roles of PcG and trxG complexes are inconsistent with their initial descriptions in the text - lines 73-74.</p>

<p>We are sorry for the mistake. We carefully revised the related descriptions to avoid such mistake. Thank you.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 4D, the band in the gel seems unclear and erased. Please provide a different one. These data show that neither Rnf220 nor wdr5 directly regulates Hox gene expressions. The effect of double knockdown in the presence of RA suggests that they work together to suppress Hox gene expression via a different downstream target. This point should be addressed in the text and discussion section of the paper. example for the same data which shows a full band with lower intensity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion.</p>
<p>We repeated the experiment of Figure 4D and some of the blot images were replaced in the revised Figure 4D.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the presence of RA, knockdown of <italic>Rnf220</italic> alone can upregulate the expression <italic>Hox</italic> genes (Figure 5C). Knockdown of <italic>Wdr5</italic> could reverse the upregulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in RNF220 knockdown cells, suggesting that <italic>Rnf220</italic> regulated <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression in a <italic>Wdr5</italic> dependent manner. However, in the absence of RA, none of <italic>Rnf220</italic> knockdown, <italic>Wdr5</italic> knockdown or <italic>Rnf220</italic> and <italic>Wdr5</italic> double knockdown had a significant effect on the expression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in P19 cells. It seems that RA signaling plays a crucial role for the regulation of RNF220 to WDR5 in P19 cells and discussion on this point was included in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(5) In Figure 4G the authors could provide some form of quantitation for changes in ubiquitination levels to make it easier for the reader.

<p>In fact, knockdown of <italic>Rnf220</italic> alone can upregulate the expression <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the presence of RA (Figure 5C).

<p>(7) In Figure 6, while the reversal of changes in Hox gene expression upon concurrent Rnf220; Wdr5 inhibition highlights the importance of Wdr5 in this regulatory process, the mechanistic role of wdr5 and its functional consequences are unclear. To answer these questions, the authors need to: (i) Assay for activated and repressive epigenetic modifications upon double knockdown of Rnf220 and Wdr5 similar to that shown in Figure 3- supplement 1. This will reveal if wdr5 functions according to its intended role as part of the TrxG complex. (ii) The authors need to assay for changes in axon projection patterns in the double knockdown condition to see if Wdr5 inhibition rescues the neural circuit defects in Rnf220 +/- mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion.</p>
<p>Although it is also necessary to examine whether the rescue effect by WDR5 inhibitor injection in uetro is also a long-lasting effect for neuronal cirtuit at adult stages, it is difficult to distinguish the embryos or pups when they were given birth. Although <italic>Rnf220fl/wt;Wdr5fl/wt;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice are viable and could survive to adult stages, developmental defects in the forebrains, including cerebral cortex and hippocampus, were observed in <italic>Rnf220fl/wt;Wdr5fl/wt;Nestin-Cre</italic> mice. Therefore, no rescue effect on defects of behavior and neuronal circuit were examined in this study. Maybe, a PN nuclei specific inducible Cre mouse line could help toward this direction in the future.</p>
<p>We carried out ChIP-qPCR and tested activated and repressive epigenetic modifications upon double knockdown of <italic>Rnf220</italic> and <italic>Wdr5</italic> in P19 cell line and found <italic>Rnf220</italic> and <italic>Wdr5</italic> double knockdown recured Hox epigenetic modification to a certain degree (Figure 6-figure supplement 1).</p>
