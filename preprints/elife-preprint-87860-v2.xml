<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>N6</italic>-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant mRNA modification, is deposited in mammals/insects/plants by m6A methyltransferase complexes (MTC) comprising a catalytic subunit and at least five additional proteins. The yeast MTC is critical for meiosis and was known to comprise three proteins, of which two were conserved. We uncover three novel MTC components (Kar4/Ygl036w-Vir1/Dyn2). All MTC subunits, except for Dyn2, are essential for m6A deposition and have corresponding mammalian MTC orthologs. Unlike the mammalian bipartite MTC, the yeast MTC is unipartite, yet multifunctional. The mRNA interacting module, comprising Ime4, Mum2, Vir1, and Kar4, exerts the MTC’s m6A-independent function, while Slz1 enables the MTC catalytic function in m6A deposition. Both functions are critical for meiotic progression. Kar4 also has a mechanistically separate role from the MTC during mating. The yeast MTC constituents play distinguishable m6A-dependent, MTC-dependent and MTC-independent functions, highlighting their complexity and paving the path towards dissecting multi-layered MTC functions in mammals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The <italic>N6</italic>-methyl-adenosine (m6A) modification is the most widespread RNA modification on mammalian messenger RNA (mRNAs). The mark is deposited by a multi-subunit protein complex, also known as the m6A <underline>m</underline>ethyltransferase (“writer”) <underline>c</underline>omplex (MTC), of which the catalytic subunit is METTL3 in human and Ime4 in yeast, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balacco &amp; Soller, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clancy <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). In mammals, the deposition of m6A occurs at DRACH motifs throughout transcripts that are distant from splice sites, biasing this modification towards long internal and last exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dominissini <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Meyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Uzonyi <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). The presence of m6A on mRNA primarily impacts mRNA stability but has also been linked to a wide array of additional molecular outcomes, and its disruption is associated with diverse phenotypes ranging from immune dysfunction to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Murakami &amp; Jaffrey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zaccara <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>METTL3, which forms a hetero dimer complex with METTL14, is the catalytic unit of the MTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Several auxiliary proteins that interact with METTL3/METTL14 are required for the deposition of m6A. These include the scaffold proteins WTAP and VIRMA, E3 ligase HAKAI, ZCH13H3, and RNA binding proteins RBM15/RBM15b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bawankar <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Knuckles <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ping <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schwartz <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wen <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yue <italic>et al</italic>, 2018b</xref>). Structural and topological analyses of the mammalian and Drosophila MTCs revealed that MTCs can be divided into two subcomplexes: (1) the m6A METTL complex (MAC) which consists of METTL3/METTL14, and a (2) m6A-METTL associated complex (MACOM) consisting of WTAP, VIRMA, HAKAI, ZCH13H3, and RBM15/RBM15b (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lence <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Su <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). MACOM directly interacts with MAC to enhance m6A deposition. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> all subunits of both MAC and MACOM, except for RBM15/RBM15b, are conserved and play related roles in m6A deposition suggesting structural and topological conservation in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ruzicka <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>In yeast, m6A is deposited solely during early meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwala <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shah &amp; Clancy, 1992</xref>). Intriguingly, early dissections of the yeast MTC have revealed only three proteins <underline>M</underline>um2, Ime4 and <underline>S</underline>lz1, collectively coined the MIS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwala <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). However, only two of these proteins (Ime4 and Mum2) have mammalian homologs (METTL3 and WTAP respectively), which could suggest that MTCs have undergone substantial rewiring throughout evolution.</p>
<p>More than 1000 mRNAs are methylated during early yeast meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schwartz <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Like in mammals, m6A modified mRNAs are turned over more rapidly compared to unmodified mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bushkin <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Scutenaire <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Varier <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). The decay of m6A transcripts requires active translation and is mediated by the YTH domain containing protein Pho92/Mrb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Varier <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Several studies have shown that preventing the m6A modification at single meiotic transcripts can cause defects in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bushkin <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Scutenaire <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). However, the exact function of the m6A modification in yeast meiosis remains elusive. In yeast, Ime4 has both m6A-dependent and m6A-independent functions in meiosis, as a catalytically inactive mutant of Ime4 shows milder delay in meiotic progression compared to the Ime4 deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwala <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clancy <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that MTCs in mammals, Drosophila and plants harbour at least six conserved protein subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), motivated us to re-examine the composition of the yeast MTC. Here we uncover and characterize three novel components of the yeast MTC (Kar4, Ygl036w/Vir1 and Dyn2). We further demonstrate that Kar4 and Vir1, and potentially also Slz1, a previously known component, are orthologs of known components of the mammalian MTC (METTL14, VIRMA, and ZCH13H3, respectively). In total five members of the yeast MTC likely have orthologs matching the mammalian MTC. We show that Ime4, Mum2, Vir1 and Kar4 form a stable complex on mRNAs required for meiotic progression, while the Slz1 subunit is essential for m6A deposition but not for MTC integrity. The composition of the yeast MTC is considerably more similar to its mammalian counterparts than previously thought. Our findings also suggest that in contrast to mammals and Drosophila, the yeast MTC has no MAC and MACOM arrangement.</p>

<title><bold>Identification of Mum2 (and Kar4) interacting proteins</bold></title>
<p>The inconsistency in the composition of the yeast MTC, comprising only three known components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwala <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), in comparison to its mammalian, Drosophila and plant MTC counterparts all comprising at least six conserved proteins (seven in the case of mammals and Drosophila), prompted us to re-evaluate the yeast MTC using a proteomics approach (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We generated a yeast strain with the conserved scaffold protein in MTCs, Mum2, fused to the ProA-tag followed by a TEV cleavage sequence at the carboxy terminus. Subsequently, we performed immunoprecipitation with the ProA-tag in protein extracts generated from cells staged in early meiosis followed by elution with the TEV protease (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref>, and Table S1). As expected, Ime4 was strongly enriched in the Mum2 IP-MS analysis. We also identified two other proteins that were strongly enriched, Ygl036w and Kar4. Two additional RNA binding proteins, Pab1 and Npl3, and light chain dynein protein, Dyn2, were significantly enriched in the Mum2 IP, albeit to a lesser extent (log<sub>2</sub> protein intensity fold change (FC) &gt;2, and −log <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-value &gt;1). Noteworthy, Slz1, a known component of the MIS complex, was not significantly enriched (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that Kar4 and Ygl036w are integral parts of the yeast MTC, we performed a Kar4 IP-MS using a similar setup (Figure S1A). Even though Kar4 enrichment was only 4-fold over background, we found that Mum2, Ime4 and Ygl036w, but not Slz1, significantly co-purified with Kar4 (log<sub>2</sub> protein intensity FC &gt;2, and −log <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-value &gt;1).</p>
<p>Next, we examined whether the interaction with Mum2 was dependent on the presence of RNA in the sample by treating the protein lysate with RNase. The Mum2-IP MS analysis identified Ime4, Ygl036w, Kar4, Slz1, and Dyn2 in both control and RNAse-treated samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>, S1B, and Table S1). Pab1 was identified in the control but was not enriched in the RNAse treated sample, while Npl3 was not enriched at all in these analyses (log<sub>2</sub> protein intensity FC &gt;2, and −log <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-value &gt;1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>, S1B, and Table S1). We conclude that Ime4, Ygl036w, Kar4, Slz1, and Dyn2 interact with Mum2 in an RNA independent manner, while Pab1 interaction with Mum2 is RNA-dependent and hence indirect. These data suggest that Kar4, Ygl036w and Dyn2 are MTC components.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Kar4, Ygl036w and Slz1 are essential for m6A deposition</title>
<p>Next, we determined whether known members and newly identified interactors are required for m6A deposition. Previous work showed that m6A deposition is severely reduced in deletion mutants of two components of the MIS complex: <italic>IME4</italic> and <italic>MUM2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwala <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). To confirm these previous findings, we determined m6A levels in diploid cells undergoing early meiosis (4 hours in sporulation medium (SPO)) harbouring gene deletion in <italic>MUM2</italic> and <italic>IME4</italic> (<italic>mum2</italic>Δ and <italic>ime4</italic>Δ). Both deletion mutants showed a severe reduction in m6A over A levels as determined by LC-MS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with previous measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ensinck <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). We also quantified m6A levels in a <italic>SLZ1</italic> deletion strain. We found that <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells showed a similar reduction in m6A levels as <italic>ime4</italic>Δ cells (LC-MS), suggesting that Slz1 is also required for m6A deposition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The analysis contrasts previous work that showed only a partial reduction in m6A levels in <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwala <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). One possibility for the discrepancy is that <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells had a delay in m6A accumulation during early meiosis, and possibly m6A accumulation occurs later in meiosis in <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells. However, m6A levels in <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells did not accumulate at any time in the 12 hours following meiotic induction and showed background levels similar to <italic>ime4</italic>Δ cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>In yeast, Kar4 is known to act as a transcription factor important for the mating response pathway, however no clear mechanistic role for Kar4 in meiosis has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kurihara <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). Interestingly, high-throughput studies suggest that the <italic>KAR4</italic> deletion negatively affects meiosis and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deutschbauer <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Enyenihi &amp; Saunders, 2003</xref>). Based on sequence homology analysis, Kar4 has been proposed to be the yeast orthologue of METTL14, a critical component of MTCs in mammals, Drosophila, and plants. Phylogenetic analysis of methyltransferase domains showed that Kar4 and METTL14 belong to the same subfamily, but are relatively different from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bujnicki <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Since METTL14 is considered a structural subunit in the METTL3/METTL14 heterodimer, we hypothesized that Kar4 may play a related role in m6A deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sledz &amp; Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). We found that like <italic>ime4</italic>Δ cells entering meiosis, <italic>kar4</italic>Δ cells showed no detectable m6A levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine whether Ygl036w, Dyn2 and the other identified Mum2 interacting proteins (Pab1 and Npl3) are important for m6A deposition, we performed m6A-ELISA and m6A-seq2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Both analyses by m6A-ELISA and m6A-seq2 showed that <italic>ygl036w</italic>Δ had no detectable m6A levels, similar to <italic>ime4</italic>Δ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Additionally, <italic>dyn2</italic>Δ had reduced m6A levels (50% of WT) as detected by m6A ELISA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Pab1 is an essential gene and Npl3 is essential for entry into meiosis. To examine whether the two are required for m6A deposition, we depleted both proteins using the auxin induced degron (AID) system during meiosis (Figure S2). To obtain efficient depletion in meiosis, we let cells enter early meiosis (2 hours SPO) and subsequently induced depletion of Pab1 (<italic>PAB1-AID</italic>) or Npl3 (<italic>NPL3-AID</italic>) for 2 hours (Figure S2). As a control we also depleted Slz1 (<italic>SLZ1-AID</italic>). We found that depletion of Pab1 and Npl3 showed no significant reduction in m6A levels compared to the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). As expected, depletion of Slz1 showed a strong reduction of m6A. Also given that Pab1 and Npl3 interactions with Mum2 were RNA dependent or not reproducible (in the case of Npl3), both RNA binding proteins are likely not part of the yeast MTC. We conclude that in addition to Ime4 and Mum2, Slz1, Kar4, and Ygl036w are all essential for m6A deposition.</p>

<title>The m6A writer complex is conserved</title>
<p>Our analysis revealed that the yeast MTC comprises at least six protein subunits (Mum2, Ime4, Kar4, Ygl036w, Slz1, Dyn2), all of which - with the exception of Dyn2 - are required for m6A methylation. Two subunits that were described previously have mammalian orthologues: Ime4/METTL3 and Mum2/WTAP. Among the newly identified subunits Kar4 has a clear mammalian orthologue, named METTL14.</p>
<p>The two remaining subunits, Ylg036w and Slz1, did not have any obvious homologs based on standard BLAST searches. To investigate this further, we first conducted pairwise comparisons of the Ylg036w protein coding sequence against all sequences of the human proteome, relying on both global (Needle) and local (Matcher) sequence similarity scores (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The analysis revealed that Ygl036w displayed a striking sequence similarity with VIRMA, a known subunit of the mammalian MTC. We next performed proteome-wide structural alignments of the predicted structure of Ygl036w against all predicted structures of the human proteome. The top hit in this analysis, by far, was VIRMA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). A structural alignment of Ygl036w against VIRMA displays a high extent of agreement (TM-score of 0.483, normalized for Ygl036w) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and S3). These analyses thus strongly suggest that Ygl036w and VIRMA are homologs, and we hence renamed Ygl036W to Vir1, as the yeast orthologue of VIRMA in mammals, Virilizer in Drosophila, and VIR in plants, respectively.</p>

<p>Motivated by these results, we next sought to conduct the same sets of analyses for Slz1. Strikingly, Slz1 showed partial similarity with ZC3H13 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). ZC3H13 is highly unstructured, and much larger than Slz1, which made 3D structural alignments uninformative. Interestingly, both SLZ1 and ZC3H13 have been proposed to play a similar role, of shuttling the MTC complex into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schwartz <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wen <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), providing further evidence that these two proteins may be orthologues. We conclude that the yeast MTC is considerably more conserved than previously described, with five subunits of the mammalian MTC complex (METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, VIRMA, ZC3H13) likely having orthologues in the yeast counterpart (Ime4, Kar4, Mum2, Vir1, Slz1).</p>

<title>Topological features of the yeast MTC</title>
<p>To gain further insight on the organization of the yeast MTC, we dissected the interrelationships between the MTC components. Often, protein subunits interacting as stable macromolecular complexes are destabilized when protein complexes are disrupted, e.g. upon deletion of a scaffold protein. With this in mind, we determined protein expression levels of all yeast MTC subunits in deletion mutants for each of the remaining subunits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A and S4A</xref>-E). The analyses revealed that Ime4, Mum2 and Vir1 were all required for mutual stabilisation in cells undergoing meiosis, with protein levels of any of these three components being strongly reduced upon elimination of any of the other two (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>, 4B, and S4A-C). Interestingly, loss of any of these proteins also led to loss of Kar4, yet - surprisingly - this was not mutual, as <italic>kar4</italic>Δ had little effect on expression of any of the subunits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>, 4B, and S4D). The <italic>slz1</italic>Δ had little effect on expression of any of the subunits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>, 4B, and S4A-D). Importantly, loss of the different components was not due to changes in RNA levels as shown by RNA-seq, as these remain relatively unchanged in the mutants except for Slz1, where <italic>SLZ1</italic> mRNA induction was reduced in the deletion mutants resulting in lower Slz1 protein levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>, 4B, S4E and S4F). These results are at odds with results in mammalian cells where METTL14, the Kar4 orthologue, stabilises METTL3, and VIRMA is not important for METTL3 and METTL14 stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yue <italic>et al</italic>., 2018b</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine the manifestation of these interdependencies in the composition of the m6A writer complex, we performed Mum2 IP-MS in WT, <italic>slz1</italic>Δ and <italic>kar4</italic>Δ cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref>, and Table S1). In line with the protein expression analysis of the m6A writer complex deletion mutants, we found that in <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells the Mum2-Ime4-Vir1-Kar4 complex remained intact, and in <italic>kar4</italic>Δ cells Mum2 formed interactions with Vir1 and Ime4. Slz1 and Dyn2 were also both enriched in the Mum2-IP in <italic>kar4</italic>Δ cells, suggesting that Kar4 does not mediate interactions between the other subunits of the m6A writer complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and Table S1). Interestingly, Dyn2 was not identified as an interactor with Mum2 in the <italic>slz1</italic>Δ cells, suggesting that Slz1 mediates the interaction of Dyn2 with the MTC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and Table S1).</p>
<p>Our analyses showed that in cells undergoing meiosis Ime4, Mum2, Vir1, Kar4, Slz1 and Dyn2 make up the MTC, and that, except for Dyn2, all MTC components are essential for m6A deposition. However, it does not exclude the possibility that other proteins might be required for MTC assembly. Therefore, we co-expressed all five subunits essential for m6A (Ime4, Kar4, Mum2, Vir1, Slz1) in insect cells. Subsequently, we performed a single step affinity purification using the Strep-tag system with a Strep-tag II fused to the amino-terminal domain of Ime4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The analyses revealed that Vir1, Mum2, Kar4, and Slz1 co-purified with Ime4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), showing that these five subunits form a stable complex <italic>in vitro</italic>. Collectively, these analyses suggest that the yeast MTC comprises three mutually stabilizing components: (1) a core comprising Ime4, Mum2, and Vir1, (2) Kar4, which also is stabilized when part of the MTC, and (3) a module comprising Slz1 and Dyn2, where Slz1 acts as a hub for binding of Dyn2. Additionally, we showed that the MTC components, Ime4, Mum2, Vir1, Kar4 and Slz1, form a stable complex <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>The yeast MTC has m6A dependent and independent functions in meiosis</title>
<p>It has previously been established that Ime4, the catalytic component, has both m6A dependent and m6A independent functions, on the basis of the observation that an Ime4 catalytic inactive mutant (<italic>IME4</italic><sup>CD</sup>) displays a milder phenotype than an <italic>IME4</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwala <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clancy <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). We confirmed the difference between <italic>ime4</italic>Δ and <italic>IME4</italic><sup>CD</sup>. Indeed, we found <italic>IME4</italic><sup>CD</sup> showed no m6A deposition and a milder delay in meiosis compared the <italic>ime4Δ</italic> (Figure S5A and S5B). One can conceive of two classes of m6A independent roles for Ime4: (1) A ‘moonlighting’ function, independent also of the role of Ime4 in forming part of the yeast MTC, (2) an MTC-dependent (yet m6A-independent) function. We reasoned that the availability of three (Vir1, Kar4, Dyn2) new additional components of the MTC complex might allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. If the m6A independent role of Ime4 is independent of the MTC, deletion of <italic>IME4</italic> would result in a phenotype unique to Ime4 and not overlapping with its counterparts upon deletion of other MTC components. In contrast, if the phenotype is due to the requirement of the MTC complex, identical phenotypes should be observed also upon loss of additional components.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we monitored the progression of meiosis upon loss of each of the MTC components. <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, <italic>vir1</italic>Δ, <italic>mum2</italic>Δ, and <italic>ime4</italic>Δ cells all displayed a strong defect in meiosis, and less than 40 percent completed meiotic divisions after 24h in SPO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

<p>To characterize the role played by the different writer complex subunits during meiosis in greater detail, we profiled RNA expression in each of the MTC mutants along a high-resolution meiotic time course. We took samples at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours following meiotic induction, which covers the early and middle phases of the yeast sporulation programme. For the analysis, we compared WT, <italic>ime4</italic>Δ, <italic>mum2</italic>Δ, <italic>slz1</italic>Δ, <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, <italic>vir1</italic>Δ and <italic>dyn2</italic>Δ. The experiment allowed us to assess more precisely which stage of meiosis was affected in the different deletion mutants of the m6A writer complex (Table S2). Two approaches were taken to analyse the data. First, we used a principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering across all time points and all mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and S5C). Second, we assessed gene expression across different gene clusters in meiosis described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). These genes clusters represent the early metabolic genes (cluster C1), early meiotic genes (cluster C2 and C3), early to middle meiotic genes (cluster C4), and middle meiotic genes (cluster C5), respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Consistent with the meiotic phenotypes, we found that <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, <italic>vir1</italic>Δ, <italic>mum2</italic>Δ, and <italic>ime4</italic>Δ displayed the most severe expression phenotypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref>, 5D, and S5C). This is most pronounced between the 4-to-6-hour timepoints, where <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, <italic>vir1</italic>Δ, <italic>mum2</italic>Δ, and <italic>ime4</italic>Δ remained staggered at cluster C2, whereas WT transitioned into cluster C4 and C5. The fact that the different MTC mutants clustered together is highly suggestive of a function common to all of them, as opposed to moonlighting functions of individual components (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>, and S5A). Also consistent with the phenotypic analysis, <italic>slz1</italic>Δ showed a mild delay, distinct from the remaining mutants, whereas <italic>dyn2</italic>Δ showed little difference in comparison to WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref>, 5D and S5C).</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite the general lack of differences between the strains at the 2-hour timepoint, the histone genes, <italic>HHF2</italic> and <italic>HTB2</italic>, were significantly reduced in expression in five of the deletion mutants (<italic>ime4</italic>Δ, <italic>mum2</italic>Δ, <italic>slz1</italic>Δ, <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, <italic>vir1</italic>Δ), potentially hinting at an early role of the MTC complex in regulation of histone levels, reminiscent of recent findings in planaria (Figure S5D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dagan <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we determined whether the m6A-dependent decay function is reflected in the RNA-seq data set. Recent work showed that the sole m6A reader protein in yeast Mrb1/Pho92 controls the decay of m6A modified mRNAs during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Varier <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). We used an iCLIP dataset that identified the mRNAs associated by Pho92 in an m6A dependent manner to assess how these mRNAs were affected throughout the time course in WT and deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Varier <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Using this subset of the transcripts, we observed that in WT cells, these transcripts were generally induced up to the 2-hour timepoint, following which their levels declined. In contrast, in all five deletion mutants essential for m6A (<italic>ime4</italic>Δ, <italic>mum2</italic>Δ, <italic>slz1</italic>Δ, <italic>kar4</italic>Δ, <italic>vir1</italic>Δ), their levels failed to decline after their initial induction at 2 hours (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Consistent with the m6A and meiotic phenotype, the <italic>dyn2</italic>Δ only showed marginal difference compared to the WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). A control set of randomly chosen transcripts did not display a difference between the WT and the deletion mutants (Figure S5E). These data support the m6A-dependent function of the MTC complex subunits, which is to m6A modify mRNAs for decay via Pho92 during early yeast meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Varier <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these analyses suggest that Kar4, Mum2, Vir1, and Ime4 play a dual role in controlling the expression program of meiosis via both m6A-dependent and m6A-independent yet MTC-complex-dependent functions, in contrast to Slz1 exhibiting only an m6A dependent function.</p>

<title>The molecular functions of Kar4 in meiosis and mating differ</title>
<p>Kar4 has been shown to be important for controlling transcription of genes involved in the mating pathway in yeast. When haploid cells sense mating pheromone, Kar4 is induced and is recruited to promoters predominantly controlled by the transcription factor Ste12 to activate transcription of genes involved in the mating pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gammie <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kurihara <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lahav <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Our above-described findings reveal that Kar4 is also an integral component of the yeast MTC and important for meiosis. We therefore wondered whether the mating and meiotic functions might be mediated via a shared mechanism. Under such a scenario, Kar4’s roles in mating might require the additional MTC components, and - conversely – the role of Kar4 in meiosis might be mediated via binding to chromatin. Under the latter scenario, we speculated that Kar4 might function in directing the MTC to chromatin to facilitate co-transcriptional m6A deposition, which could be consistent with one of the proposed modes of action of METTL14 in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). To examine this, we first tested whether Ime4, Slz1, or Mum2 are expressed during mating. As expected, a shorter protein isoform of Kar4 was strongly induced when <italic>MAT</italic>a cells were treated with mating pheromone (α-factor) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gammie <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). However, Ime4 and Mum2 expression were not elevated and Slz1 expression was not detected at all upon pheromone treatment. We also examined whether Kar4 expression during mating was dependent on the components of the MIS complex as observed in meiosis. We found that Kar4 levels were unaffected in <italic>ime4</italic>Δ, and <italic>mum2</italic>Δ cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). In line with protein expression data, we found that Kar4 was bound to the <italic>AGA1</italic> promoter upon mating pheromone treatment as determined by ChIP, while other MTC subunits (Ime4, Mum2, Slz1) showed no enrichment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aymoz <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). These data indicate that the yeast MTC does not play a role in the mating pathway.</p>

</fig>
<p>Second, we determined Kar4 localization during meiosis and mating by using a strain with Kar4 fused to mNeongreen (Kar4-mNG). We found that the Kar4 localization pattern was different between mating and meiosis. Kar4-mNG concentrated inside the nucleus in <italic>MAT</italic>a cells treated with α-factor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>, and S6A). During meiosis (<italic>MAT</italic>a/α cells), however, we found that Kar4-mNG was localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6D</xref>, 6E, and S6B).</p>
<p>Third, we examined whether Kar4 or several components of the yeast MTC (Ime4, Mum2, and Szl1) associate with chromatin during meiosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6F</xref>, 6G, S6C and S6D). While Kar4 was bound to 800 genomic locations in <italic>MAT</italic>a cells treated with α-factor, only few Kar4 peaks were detected during meiosis in <italic>MAT</italic>a/α cells (less than 10) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>). As expected, Kar4 ChIP-seq peaks were enriched for the Ste12 binding sites (motif 3 in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>), but other motifs were also identified, perhaps indicating that Kar4 can bind to promoters in a Ste12 independent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6H and S6D</xref>). In line with Kar4, ChIP-seq of Ime4, Mum2, and Slz1 showed no enrichment throughout the genome during meiosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6G and S6C</xref>). As a control we included ChIP-seq of the key meiotic transcriptional regulator Ume6 under the same conditions, which showed, as expected, enrichment at over 1000 genomic locations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chia <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Lastly, we examined whether the Ste12 transcription factor, which is important for Kar4 recruitment during mating, plays a role in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kurihara <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lahav <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). We found that <italic>ste12</italic>Δ did not affect the onset of meiosis (Figure S6E). The above results thus rule out the requirement of additional MTC components during mating, and further rule out a Kar4-mediated association of the yeast MTC with chromatin during early meiosis. We conclude that the Kar4 function in the MTC during meiosis differs from its known role as transcription regulator in the mating response pathway.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Kar4 stabilizes the MTC on mRNAs</title>
<p>Given the different roles of Kar4 in meiosis and mating, and that Kar4 was not required for stabilization of Ime4, we sought to better understand the molecular role played by Kar4 in the MTC complex during meiosis. Specifically, we examined whether Kar4 was required for allowing Ime4 to associate with mRNAs.</p>
<p>We assessed RNA binding of the m6A writer complex in cells staged in early meiosis. We applied RNA-protein interaction capture after chemical crosslinking to purify protein-RNA complexes from cells after short and mild crosslinking with formaldehyde using oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Figure S6F). The assay revealed that both Ime4 and Kar4 efficiently co-purify with mRNA following RNAse elution from the beads, while pulldown from extracts pre-treated with RNAse did not show Ime4 and Kar4 signals with immunoblot as expected (Figure S6F). As an orthogonal approach, we performed photo activatable UV crosslinking to determine whether RNA associate with Kar4. The analysis revealed Kar4 can crosslink to RNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref> and S6G). Thus, Ime4 and Kar4 can both associate with mRNAs during early meiosis.</p>
<p>Next, we assessed whether Ime4 association with mRNAs is regulated by Kar4, Slz1, and Mum2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>). We applied RNA-protein interaction capture on extracts from <italic>slz1</italic>Δ, <italic>kar4</italic>Δ and <italic>mum2</italic>Δ cells that were induced to enter meiosis. After the polyA pull-down, and elution with RNase, Ime4 was specifically enriched to comparable degrees in both the control and <italic>slz1</italic>Δ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>). In contrast, Ime4 association to mRNAs was reduced in <italic>kar4</italic>Δ cells with the no effect on Ime4 levels in input. Given Mum2’s stabilizing role in the yeast MTC, the Ime4 signal in <italic>mum2</italic>Δ cells was greatly reduced in both input and eluate from polyA pull-down. The Pab1 protein signal, which served as a positive control for RNA binding, did not differ across the different samples. These data suggest that Kar4 is important for stabilizing the interaction between Ime4 (and likely the whole MTC) and mRNAs, and that Slz1 is not required for this.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous work showed that the yeast MTC consists of only three subunits (Mum2, Ime4, Slz1), which contrasted the six or seven subunits described for MTCs in mammals, Drosophila, and plants, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwala <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Here, we showed that the yeast MTC comprises six subunits of which five are essential for m6A deposition and have orthologues in the mammalian MTC. While the yeast MTC subunits are considerably more conserved than previously described, our findings suggest that the MTC is configured differently compared to the mammalian and Drosophila counterparts (see below). The yeast MTC exerts both m6A dependent and independent functions that are both crucial for yeast meiosis.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Composition and features of the yeast MTC</title>
<p>Our analysis suggests that five subunits of the yeast MTC have orthologues in mammalian MTCs (Ime4/METTL3, Kar4/METTL14, Mum2/WTAP, Vir1/VIRMA, and potentially also Slz1/ZC3H13) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, the composition of the yeast MTC is more conserved than previously described, however, we propose that the yeast MTC subunits are configured differently in a complex. The mammalian and Drosophila MTCs are configured into MAC (METTL3 and METTL14) and MACOM (WTAP, VIRMA, ZC3H13, HAKAI and RBM15) complexes, of which MAC harbours the catalytic activity and MACOM is critical for stimulating MAC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Knuckles <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Consistent with the presence of two complexes, diverse studies over the years have reported that METTL3 and METTL14 mutually stabilize each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sledz &amp; Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Likewise, subunits of the MACOM complex (e.g. WTAP and VIRMA) mutually stabilize each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yue <italic>et al</italic>, 2018a</xref>). However, depletion of components in one of subcomplex was not reported to impact the integrity of the other subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yue <italic>et al</italic>., 2018a</xref>). In yeast, we show that five subunits (Mum2, Ime4, Vir1, Kar4, and Slz1) are essential for m6A deposition and form a stable complex. We also provide evidence that the yeast MTC subunits Ime4, Mum2, and Vir1 stabilize each other and Kar4, indicating that in yeast the MAC and MACOM subunits are interweaved (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This interweaved arrangement of the yeast MTC is accompanied also by loss of a mutual stabilizing interaction between Ime4 and Kar4, which is in contrast to their mammalian counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sledz &amp; Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="528004v2_fig7.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We showed that Ygl036w-Vir1 is the orthologue of Virma in mammals, Virilizer in Drosophila, and Vir in plants, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haussmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ruzicka <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yue <italic>et al</italic>., 2018a</xref>). Like its mammalian/Drosophila/plant counterparts, Vir1 has a central role in the MTC and m6A deposition. Structurally, Vir1 and VIRMA showed strong conservation, however Vir1 does not contain the VIRMA domain which is thought to bridge the interaction between HAKAI and Fl2(d) in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bawankar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The absence of this domain may underlie the lack of a discernible HAKAI orthologue in yeast. We showed that in yeast, Vir1 stabilizes Mum2, Ime4, and Kar4, and that it is stabilized by Mum2 and Ime4. This contrasts with the mammalian MTC, where VIRMA and WTAP stabilize each other, but not METTL3 and METTL14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yue <italic>et al</italic>., 2018a</xref>).</p>
<p>Though Kar4 has been proposed to be the METTL14 orthologue in yeast, no molecular function in meiosis and in m6A deposition for yeast Kar4 was described previously. Here we showed that Kar4 is a critical subunit of the yeast MTC. Like METTL14, Kar4 is essential for m6A deposition and facilitates mRNA binding of the yeast MTC <italic>in vivo</italic>. We speculate that that the role of Kar4 in bridging mRNA binding of the yeast MTC is critical since in yeast the MTC likely does not harbour a designed RNA binding protein such as RBM15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Patil <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). This function of Kar4 is perhaps related to how METTL14 stabilizes METTL3 on mRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sledz &amp; Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that Slz1 shows some sequence similarities with ZC3H13 in humans, suggesting Slz1 and ZC3H13 are possible orthologues despite being very different in size. Previous work showed that Slz1 is required for localizing the yeast MTC to the nucleus, which is also consistent with findings for ZC3H13 in mammals where it also is important for MTC nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schwartz <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wen <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). In Drosophila Flacc (ZC3H13/Slz1) bridges the interaction between Nito (RBM15) and the MTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Knuckles <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). However, our analysis failed to identify a yeast orthologue for Nito (RBM15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Knuckles <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Slz1 does not seem to be important for MTC association with mRNAs and is dispensable for the m6A-independent role of the MTC. However, Slz1 is essential for driving the m6A deposition reaction since cells lacking Slz1 showed no m6A. Recent structural work on the human MTC showed that ZC3H13 facilitates a conformational change in VIRMA and WTAP, which may be important for m6A deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). The relevance of such a role in yeast remains to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Our analysis showed that dynein light chain protein, Dyn2, is a subunit of the yeast MTC. Despite the small size of Dyn2, we identified Dyn2 in all Mum2-IP-MS experiments. Moreover, the interaction between Dyn2 and the yeast MTC Mum2 is RNA independent but requires Slz1. In contrast to the remaining components, loss of Dyn2 led to a partial loss of mRNA methylation accompanied by a very mild meiotic phenotype. We therefore decided to primarily focus on the remaining components in this study. However, it is worth noting that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> a dynein light chain protein Dlc1 is involved in stabilizing the m6A writer Mett10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dorsett &amp; Schedl, 2009</xref>). More work is needed to dissect the role of Dyn2 in the yeast MTC.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Multifunctionality of the yeast MTC</title>
<p>Previous studies have pointed at m6A-dependent and m6A-independent roles played by Ime4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwala <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clancy <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). These conclusions were primarily guided by differences in phenotypes between <italic>IME4</italic> deletion and an <italic>IME4</italic> catalytic inactive mutant, both of which abolishing methylation but are associated with phenotypes of distinct severity. The nature of such m6A-independent roles had been so far unknown. Such a phenotype could be ‘MTC complex independent’, i.e. mediated via a completely new function of ime4, unrelated not only to its catalytic activity but also to its participation in the methylation-complex. Alternatively, such a phenotype could be MTC-dependent. The discovery of additional components of the yeast MTC allowed us to uncover that the substantially more severe phenotype of the <italic>IME4</italic> deletion mutant was shared also upon loss of other components of the yeast MTC, strongly suggestive of an MTC-dependent function. These results suggest that an intact MTC is critical for yeast meiosis, independent of its ability to methylate RNA. In this sense, these results are reminiscent of studies conducted on diverse proteins playing a role in modifying the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or transfer RNA (tRNA), often revealing that catalytically inactive mutations display considerably less pronounced phenotypes than full deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Letoquart <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Leulliot <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sharma <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sharma <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">White <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). In such cases, there was no moonlighting activity of the modifying enzyme reported, but instead the modifying enzyme played a scaffolding or chaperoning role, for which its catalytic activity was not essential.</p>
<p>m6A-independent functions have been reported for METTL3 and METTL14 of the mammalian MTC, however, to our knowledge no role for an inactive but intact MTC in mammals has been documented so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barbieri <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). In addition to the m6A dependent and independent roles of the yeast MTC in meiosis, Kar4 also has a separate function where it acts as a transcription factor in mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kurihara <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lahav <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The functions in transcription and in the MTC of Kar4 are not linked since Kar4 does not stably associate with chromatin during meiosis.</p>
<p>At the time of preparation of this manuscript a related study showed that Ylg036w-Vir1 is important for m6A deposition and meiosis in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park <italic>et al</italic>, 2023a</xref>). Additionally, the same group showed in two different studies that Kar4 has an important role in controlling gene expression in meiosis, and elegantly identified separation of function mutants that affect either the mating or meiotic function of Kar4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Park <italic>et al</italic>, 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Park <italic>et al</italic>, 2023c</xref>).

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>In conclusion, we describe a new composition of the yeast MTC. We showed that yeast MTC components are considerably more conserved than previously described, and yet the yeast MTC is re-configured compared to mammalian and Drosophila MTCs. The yeast MTC exerts both m6A-dependent and m6A-independent functions that are both important for meiosis. Our findings expand the relevance of yeast as a model system for understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating m6A deposition, as well as other m6A-independent roles of MTCs.</p>

<p>For this study we used strains derived from the sporulation proficient SK1 background and experiments were carried out in diploid cells unless stated otherwise. Gene deletions and carboxy terminal tagging with mNeongreen, 3xV5, TEV Protein A, or AID were performed using one step gene replacement protocol described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Longtine <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Tam &amp; van Werven, 2020</xref>). Depletions using C-terminal auxin-inducible degron (AID) tag were performed as described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nishimura <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). A short version of the AID-tag, known as mini-AID, was used for depleting Slz1, Pab1 and Npl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Morawska &amp; Ulrich, 2013</xref>).

<title>Growth conditions</title>
<p>Cells were grown in YPD (1.0% (w/v) yeast extract, 2.0% (w/v) peptone, 2.0% (w/v) glucose, and supplemented with uracil (2.5 mg/l) and adenine (1.25 mg/l)). To induce meiosis a standard protocol for sporulation was followed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Varier <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). In short, cells were grown until saturation for 24h in YPD, then grown in pre-sporulation medium BYTA (1.0% (w/v) yeast extract, 2.0% (w/v) bacto tryptone, 1.0% (w/v) potassium acetate, 50 mM potassium phthalate) for about 16 h, and shifted to sporulation medium (SPO) (0.3% (w/v) potassium acetate and 0.02% (w/v) raffinose)). All experiments were performed at 30°C in a shaker incubator at 300 rpm. For mating experiments, cells were grown to early log phase in YPD, when 1uM α-factor was added, and cells were incubated with the pheromone for 30 minutes before collection. To enable efficient depletion of mini-AID strains (Slz1, Vir1, Pab1 and Npl3), 1 mM of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 50 µM of CuSO<sub>4</sub> were added 2 hours after cells were shifted to SPO and samples collected at 4 hours in SPO. As a control, the same volume of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) was added to the yeast culture.</p>

Reverse cross-linking was done in 1% SDS-TE buffer + Ribonuclease A (10 ng/μl) (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1.0% v/v SDS) at 65°C overnight. Proteinase K treated samples were column purified.</p>
<p>qPCR was used for determining the association with AGA1 promoter, and HMR was used a background control. For ChIP-seq, libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyperprep kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were size-selected for DNA fragments between 150 nt and 700 nt using gel extraction. Purified libraries were further quantified and inspected on a Tapestation (Agilent Technologies) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 to an equivalent of 50 bases single-end reads, at a depth of approximately 16 million reads per library.</p>

<title>Western blotting and quantification</title>
<p>3.6 ODs of yeast cells were pelleted from cultures via centrifugation for protein expression analysis. Proteins were precipitated from whole cells via trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Cells were lysed with glass beads using a bead beater and lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, and 2.75 mM DTT). Proteins were denatured in 3X sample buffer (9% (w/v) SDS and 6% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) at 100°C and separated by SDS/PAGE (4-12% gels). A PVDF membrane was used for protein transfer. Blocking was performed using 5% (w/v) dry skimmed milk. Proteins were detected using an ECL detection kit or using infra-red fluorescent antibodies visualised with LiCor CLx. Samples were normalised using Hxk1 as a loading control. Images were taken using the Li-Cor (manufacturer) and analysed using the Image Studio Lite software.</p>
<p>For the chemical RNA interactome capture (RIC) experiments, 15 μg of total protein (input control) and 20% of eluates were resolved on 4-20% SDS polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) membranes (Cytiva life sciences, 10600003). Membranes were blocked in PBS-0.1% Tween-20 containing 5% skimmed milk, probed with designated antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibodies, and developed with the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (MerckMillipore, WBKLS0500). Blots were recorded with an Amersham A600 gel documentation system (Cytiva life sciences). The following antibodies were used: V5 tag monoclonal antibody (1:2,000; ThermoFisher, R96025), mouse anti-Pab1 (1:5000; Antibodies online, ABIN1580454), mouse anti-Act1 (1:2500; MP Biomedicals, 0869100), HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:5000; Cytiva, NA931V).</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry</title>
<p>Yeast cells containing the Mum2-TEV-ProA tagged protein and control cells were induced to undergo sporulation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Spedale <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). For each immunoprecipitation experiment we used 1250 OD units of yeast cells. Cells were resuspended in lysis Buffer E (10 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% glycerol, 1mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) supplemented with RNase inhibitors (HALT protease inhibitor), and snap frozen, and processed into a powder using a Spex SamplePrep Freezer/Mill Cryogenic Grinder. Cell powder was dissolved in 12 ml Lysis Buffer E supplemented with RNase inhibitors and rotated to mix for at least 30 minutes in 4°C. Large debris was removed by a short spin (3000g for 2 minutes, 4°C), and to clarify the lysate 45.000 rpm for 1 hour. All handling of the lysate was done at 4°C. For each sample, 250 μl Streptavidin M-280 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with 30 μl Biotinylated Anti-Rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) was added. The yeast extracts were incubated with the beads for 2 hours at 4°C. For samples treated with RNase I, the protein concentration was determined with Bradford reagent (manufacturer) and 1 U RNase I per mg protein was added at the start of the incubation. Beads were collected using magnetic stands, washed once with lysis buffer E, and washed 3 times with Cleavage Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT). Finally, beads were resuspended in 49 μl cleavage buffer. Proteins were eluted by the addition of 1uL TEV Protease (New England Biolabs) and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature, gently shaking at 450 rpm.</p>
<p>Reduced and alkylated proteins were prepared by in-gel digesting overnight at 37°C using 100ng trypsin (Promega). The supernatant was dried by vacuum centrifugation and the samples were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoro acetic acid. 1-10 μl of acidified protein digest was loaded on an Ultimate 3000 nanoRSLC HPLC (Thermo Scientific) onto a 20mm x 75um Pepmap C18 trap column (Thermo Scientific) prior to elution via a 50cm x 75um EasySpray C18 column into a Lumos Tribrid Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). A 70-minute gradient of 6% - 40% B was used followed by washing and re-equilibration (A= 2%ACN, 0.1% formic acid; B= 80%ACN, 0.1% formic acid). The Orbitrap was operated in “Data Dependent Acquisition” mode followed by MS/MS in “TopS” mode using the vendor supplied “universal method” with default parameters. Raw files were processed using Maxquant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://maxquant.org">maxquant.org</ext-link>) and Perseus (maxquant.net/perseus) with a recent download of the UniProt <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> reference proteome database and a common contaminants database. A decoy database of reversed sequences was used to filter false positives, at a peptide false detection rate of 1%. T-tests were performed with a permutation-based FDR of 5% to address multiple hypothesis testing.</p>

<title>Fluorescence microscopy and image quantification</title>
<p>Kar4-mNeongreen and Htb2-mCherry image acquisition was conducted using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope. Exposure times were set as follows: 500ms GFP, and 50ms mCherry. An ORCA-FLASH 4.0 camera (Hamamatsu) and NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon) were used to collect images. Quantification of fluorescence signals was performed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schindelin <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). ROIs were manually drawn around the periphery of each cell or around the nucleus. The mean intensity in each channel per cell was determined and used for the analysis.

<title>m6A-mRNA quantification by LC-MS/MS and m6A-ELISA</title>
<p>RNA was extracted and DNase treated as described above and polyA RNA isolated after purification twice with oligodT dynabeads (Ambion, 61005) according to manufacturer’s instructions. M6A LC-MS was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Varier <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). In short, polyA selected RNA was digested with addition of reaction buffer (2.5mM ZnCl2, 25mM NaCl, 10mM NaAcetate), 2 units of Nuclease P1 (Sigma, N8630) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Followed by 2 h with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 1μl Alkaline Phosphatase (NEB, M0525). Formic Acid was added to the reaction mixture and filtered with a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. The sample was then injected (20 μl) and analysed by LC-MS/MS using a reverse phase liquid chromatography C18 column and a triple quadrupole mass analyser (Agilent 6470 or Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantiva) instrument in positive electrospray ionisation mode. Flow rate was at 0.2 ml/min and column temperature 25 °C with the following gradient: 2 min 98% eluent A (0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate in water) and 2% eluent B (0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate in MeOH), 75% A and 25% B up to 10 min, 20% A and 80% B up to 15 min, 98% A and 2% B up to 22.5 min. Nucleosides were quantified using a calibration curve of pure nucleosides standards.</p>
<p>For ELISA we either used the EpiQuik m6A RNA methylation quantification kit from EpiGentek (P-9005) according to manufacturer’s protocol or an m6A ELISA protocol previous described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ensinck <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Chemical crosslinking RNA-protein interactome capture</title>
<p>To determine Ime4 and Kar4 binding to mRNAs, we adapted an RNA-protein interactome protocol by using chemical crosslinking instead of UV crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Matia-Gonzalez <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Na <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Patton <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). In short, RNA-protein complexes were crosslinked chemically using 0.2% formaldehyde (ThermoFisher, 28908) for 10 min at 30 °C. Crosslinking was quenched by adding 2.5 M glycine to a final concentration 125 mM followed by incubation for 5 min in an orbital shaker at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were ground in liquid nitrogen using pre-chilled mortar and pestle. Cell powder was resuspended in 3.5 ml of RIC lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 600 mM LiCl, 0.5% LiDS, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5× Halt™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (ThermoFisher, 78429), 1 mM AEBSF and 0.2 U SUPERase RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen, AM2696)). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Total protein quantification was estimated with Bradford assay.</p>
<p>RNA-protein complexes were isolated with oligo[dT)]<sub>25</sub> magnetic beads (New England Biolabs, S1419S). Briefly, 350 µl of oligo[dT)]<sub>25</sub>-coupled beads were pre-equilibrated by washing them five times with 1 ml of RIC lysis buffer. 3.5 mg of total protein extracts from each culture were mixed with beads, vortexed briefly then incubated at room temperature for 15 min with gentle rotation in a rotator wheel. Beads were washed twice with 1 ml of wash buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 600 mM LiCl, 0.2% LiDS, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X100, 1× 1.5× Halt™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail,1 mM AEBSF and 0.2 U SUPERase), and twice with 1 ml of wash buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 600 mM LiCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1× 1.5× Halt™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail,1 mM AEBSF and 0.2 U ml SUPERase) each for 15 seconds on ice. Beads were resuspended in 60 µl elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 U of RNase I, 4 µg RNase A) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes.

<p>Here, Ensinck et al. investigated the composition of the yeast mRNA m6A methyltransferase complex required for meiosis. This complex was known to contain three proteins, but is much more complex in mammals, insects and plants. Through IP-MS analysis they identified three more proteins Kar4, Ygl036w and Dyn2. Of these Kar4 and Ygl036w are homologous to Mettl14 and Virma, respectively, and, like the previously described factors are essential for m6A deposition, mating and binding of the reader Pho92 to mRNA during meiosis by evidence acquired with appropriate methodology. Dyn2 is a novel factor not described for any m6A complex and is not essential for m6A deposition, mating and binding of the reader Pho92 to mRNA during meiosis.</p>
<p>In addition, detailed analysis of the Slz1 revealed homology to the mammalian factor m6A complex member ZC3H13 to comprise a conserved complex of five proteins, Mettl3, Mettl14, Mum2/WTAP, Virma and Slz/ZC3H13. When co-expressed in insects cells, they co-purify stoichiometrically and presence of Mum2 as a dimer is also indicated as shown for WTAP.</p>
<p>Complementary to these data they show that stability of the individual complex members is affected in mutants supporting that they are stabilized through complex formation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors then show that kar4 has additional roles in mating that is separable from its role through the m6A complex in meiosis.</p>
<p>The authors employ appropriate methodology throughout to address their aims and present convincing evidence for their claims. The evidence presented here reinforces that the m6A complex is evolutionary highly conserved which has broad scope for its functional analysis in humans and model organisms.</p>

<p>N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant mRNA modification, is deposited by the m6A methyltransferase complexes (MTC). While MTC in mammals/flies/plants consists of at least six subunits, yeast MTC was known to contain only three proteins. Ensinck, Maman, et al. revisited this question using a proteomic approach and uncovered three new yeast MTC components, Kar4/Ygl036w/Dyn2. By applying sequence and structure comparisons, they identified Kar4, Ygl036w, Slz1 as homologs of the mammalian METTL14, VIRMA. ZC3H13, respectively. While these proteins are essential for m6A deposition, the dynein light chain protein, Dyn2, is not involved in mRNA methylation. Interestingly, while mammalian and fly MTCs are configured as MAC (METTL3 and METTL14) and MACOM (other subunits) complexes, yeast MTC subunits appear to have different configurations. Finally, Kar4 has a different role as transcription regulator in mating, which is not mediated by other MTC members. These data establish fundamental framework for the yeast MTC and also provide novel insights for those studying m6A deposition.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This study is well presented and contains all the necessary experiments to support their claims. They made the interesting finding of an additional factor Dyn2. However, it is unclear whether it is present in the human complex. Hence, it would be interesting to see whether Dyn2 co-purifies when expressed with the other complex components in insect cells. Also, purification of a tagged complex from yeast would have indicated whether Dyn2 is part of the complex and whether other factors, like RBM15 or Hakai, present in humans are also present in yeast.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that Dyn2 subunit is an exciting new finding that is worth further investigation. The IP-MS experiments suggest that Dyn2 is subunit of the complex and that the Dyn2 interaction is mediated via Slz1. We also noticed a reduction in m6A levels (50%) in the dyn2 deletion mutant. What the function of Dyn2 is and whether it is conserved remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Our IP-MS experiments with Mum2 identified the complex as described in the manuscript, however we did not find evidence of orthologs of RBM15 and Hakai. More follow up work is needed using in vivo and in vitro assays are needed to determine how m6A by the yeast MTC is regulated.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Most of the conclusions of this paper are well supported by data, and the text is clearly written and easy to read. Here are my suggestions and comments:</p>
<p>1. In Fig.2, why not use LC-MS to measure m6A levels in Ygl036w, Dyn2, Pab1, Npl3 mutants, as in Fig.1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For measuring m6A levels, we use combination of LC-MS and m6A ELISA and m6A-seq2 throughout the manuscript. We used ELISA in the Fig2 because we had established this assay in the lab (Ensinck et al, RNA Journal, 2023). M6A-ELISA technique was more accessible and easier to execute compared to LC-MS. Additionally our collaborator for the LC-MS moved his lab to another country, which made it impractical to continue the use of LC-MS.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The protein purification experiment described in Fig. 4D is informative. Can they include Dyn2 in the expression system as well?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. Dyn2 was not the focus of the manuscript as Dyn2 has, at best, only a minor role in m6A deposition in vivo. We are also currently aiming to dissect how Dyn2 regulates m6A and the yeast MTC in follow up work. Hence we decided not to add more experiments on Dyn2 to the current manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Among the MTC components identified in this study, Dyn2 is a new and interesting subunit. It was shown that in C. elegans Dlc1 is involved in stabilizing the m6A writer Mett10. I wonder if yeast has a homolog of C. elegans Mett10?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As far as we know, there is no ortholog identified of Mett10 (METTL16 in mammals) in budding yeast.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors have emphasized &quot;the m6A dependent and independent functions&quot;; however, this is only based on previous observations. Is it possible that the less severe phenotype associated with ime4 catalytic mutant is due to residual catalytic activity? I think the data presented in Fig. 5 tell us that Ime4 and other MTC subunits have no additional moonlighting function. It is not entirely clear to me what &quot;the m6A-independent function&quot; is.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The observation that the yeast MTC complex has m6A dependent and independent function is based on the previous observations and the current work. In Agarwala et al 2012 PLOS Genetics, it was shown that mum2 and ime4 deletion mutants have more severe phenotype than slz1 deletion mutant or the catalytically inactive mutant of Ime4. We confirmed these observations in the revised manuscript (see Figure S5A and S5B). In this work, we showed that kar4 and vir1 deletion mutants have comparable delay in the onset of meiosis as mum2 and ime4 deletion mutants. Also, the MTC remains intact with absence of Slz1, but falls apart in ime4D, mum2D, vir1D or showed strongly reduced RNA binding (kar4 deletion mutant). Based on this we conclude that an m6A independent function of the MTC exists.</p>
<p>We have included data demonstrating that the catalytically inactive mutant has no residual m6A and a milder meiotic phenotype compared to the ime4 deletion mutant (see Figure S5A and S5B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Mum2-TEV-ProA IP (1B) and Kar4-TEV-ProA IP (S1A), Slz1 was not significantly enriched; however, in the repeated Mum2-TEV-ProA IP with/without RNAse (S1B, 4C), Slz1 was strongly enriched. Why are the Slz1 results so variable?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an astute observation, for which we do not have a definitive answer. One possibility is that Slz1 is the only subunit that is induced during meiosis. It is possible that induction of Slz1 varied between the different IP-MS experiments, hence leading to variability in its association with the MTC complex.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The last paragraph on page 11, &quot;Collectively...&quot;, and the first paragraph on page 12, &quot;Collectively...&quot;, seem redundant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have removed the duplicated paragraph in the revised manuscript.</p>
