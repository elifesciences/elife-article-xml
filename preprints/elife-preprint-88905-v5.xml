<title>Abstract</title>
<p>IQ motif-containing proteins can be recognized by calmodulin (CaM) and are essential for many biological processes. However, the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in spermatogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the novel gene IQ motif-containing H (<italic>IQCH</italic>) in a Chinese family with male infertility characterized by a cracked flagellar axoneme and abnormal mitochondrial structure. To verify the function of IQCH, <italic>Iqch</italic> knockout (KO) mice were generated via CRISPR-Cas9 technology. As expected, the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO male mice exhibited impaired fertility, which was related to deficient acrosome activity and abnormal structures of the axoneme and mitochondria, mirroring the patient phenotypes. Mechanistically, IQCH can bind to CaM and subsequently regulate the expression of RNA-binding proteins (especially HNRPAB), which are indispensable for spermatogenesis. Overall, this study revealed the function of IQCH, expanded the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in reproductive processes, and provided important guidance for genetic counseling and genetic diagnosis of male infertility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis is one of the most complex biological processes in male organisms and functions to produce mature spermatozoa from spermatogonia in three phases: (i) mitosis, (ii) meiosis, and (iii) spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hess and Renato de Franca 2008</xref>). This delicate process can be easily disturbed and further cause male reproductive disorders. Male infertility affects 7% of men in the general population, and its causes vary and include anatomical or genetic abnormalities, systemic diseases, infections, trauma, iatrogenic injury, and gonadotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Krausz et al. 2018</xref>). Approximately 10% of the human genome is related to reproductive processes; thus, male infertility is often predicted to be largely genetic in origin, whereas only 4% of infertile men are diagnosed with a distinct genetic cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Krausz and Riera-Escamilla 2018</xref>). Genetic causes are highly heterogeneous and involve chromosomal abnormalities, point mutations in single genes, copy number variations, microRNA dysfunction, and polygenic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Meschede and Horst 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Traven et al. 2017</xref>). The highest percentage of known genetic factors that account for up to 25% of male infertility are karyotype anomalies, Y chromosome microdeletions, and <italic>CFTR</italic> mutations, which are mostly associated with azoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Krausz and Riera-Escamilla 2018</xref>). However, in a relatively high proportion of infertile men (40%), the etiology cannot be recognized and is also referred to as idiopathic. With the help of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), some men have the chance to reproduce; however, there is a risk of passing on undetermined genetic abnormalities. In addition, genetic defects leading to fertilization failure and embryo development arrest cannot be effectively rescued by ART; thus, discovering novel genetic factors and further confirming their molecular mechanisms are of clinical importance.</p>
<p>Calmodulin (CaM) is defined as a major Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that activates many kinds of enzymes in response to an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through interactions with a diverse group of cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Klee et al. 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Means et al. 1982</xref>). CaM has a completely conserved amino acid sequence across all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jensen et al. 2018</xref>). Specifically, in the human genome, there are three independent CaM genes (<italic>CALM1-3</italic>), while in the mouse genome, there are five CaM genes (<italic>Calm1-5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jensen et al. 2018</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=calm+mouse">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=calm+mouse</ext-link>). Previous studies have reported that CaM is extraordinarily abundant in the mammalian testis and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Smoake et al. 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kakiuchi et al. 1982</xref>). Moreover, CaM is predominantly expressed in the mammalian testis, from the pachytene to meiotic division stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Smoake et al. 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kakiuchi et al. 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">YAMAMOTO 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sano et al. 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kägi et al. 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Moriya et al. 1995</xref>). CaM binds to proteins through recognition motifs, including the short CaM-binding motif containing conserved Ile and Gln residues (IQ motif) for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding and two related motifs for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nie et al. 2009</xref>). The identified IQ motif-containing proteins included a good range of proteins with biological functions, one of which is a sperm surface protein, suggesting that IQ motif-containing proteins might play a potential role in male reproductive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wen et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dolmetsch et al. 2001</xref>). Currently, 15 IQ motif-containing proteins have been identified in humans, namely, IQCA1, IQCB1, IQCC, IQCD, IQCE, IQCF1, IQCF2, IQCF5, IQCF6, IQCG, IQCH, IQCJ, IQCK, IQCM, and IQCN. With the exception of IQCF2, mice possess a similar set of IQ proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term</ext-link>= IQCF2). Notably, IQCF4 is present in mice but absent in humans. However, among these IQ motif-containing proteins, only a few have been reported to be responsible for male fertility. It has been shown that the IQ motif-containing D (IQCD) primarily accumulates in the acrosome area of spermatids during mouse spermiogenesis, and the acrosome reaction is inhibited in human spermatozoa by the anti-IQCD antibody, suggesting a potential function of IQCD in fertilization and the acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Iqcf1</italic> knockout (KO) male mice showed significantly less fertility, which was related to reduced sperm motility and acrosome reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fang et al. 2015</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Iqcg</italic> is required for mouse spermiogenesis, which is attributable to its role in flagellar formation and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Harris et al. 2014</xref>). Humans and mice without IQCN presented failed fertilization rates related to manchette assembly defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dai et al. 2022</xref>). Although reliable findings provide substantial insight into IQ motif-containing proteins that participate in male reproductive processes, the relevant regulatory mechanism and the function of many other IQ motif-containing proteins in spermatogenesis have not been determined thus far.</p>
<p>Here, we revealed a testis-specific IQ motif containing H gene, <italic>IQCH</italic>, which is essential for spermiogenesis and fertilization. Disruption of IQCH leads to deficient acrosome activity and abnormal structure of the axoneme and mitochondria in both humans and mice. Moreover, it is suggested that the interaction of IQCH with CaM is a prerequisite for IQCH function, which further regulates the expression of RNA-binding proteins (especially HNRPAB) during spermatogenesis. Collectively, our findings unveiled a novel genetic diagnostic indicator of male infertility, and the uncovered mechanism of IQCH in spermatogenesis might shed new light on the treatment of this disease.</p>

<title>Identification of a novel homozygous variant of <italic>IQCH</italic> involved in male infertility</title>
<p>A 33-year-old man from a consanguineous family with primary infertility for four years was recruited for our study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Semen analysis of this patient revealed inordinate decreases in sperm motility and count, as well as abnormal sperm morphology (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In addition to the proband, his great uncle was also affected, and he had never conceived during sexual intercourse without contraception in his marriage. We further explored the possible genetic cause through whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis, and a homozygous deletion variant in <italic>IQCH</italic> (c.387+1_387+10del, NM_0010317152) was identified in the proband. This variant is rare in the general human population according to the 1000 Genomes Project (0.007%), ExAC Browser (0.059%), and gnomAD databases (0.024%). We further clarified the putative contribution of this variant in this family by Sanger sequencing. Noticeably, this homozygous variant was confirmed in his infertile great uncle, and the fertile parents of the proband carried the heterozygote of this variant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Moreover, we used a minigene splicing assay to examine the effect of this variant on <italic>IQCH</italic> mRNA splicing. The electrophoresis results revealed that wild-type <italic>IQCH</italic> (WT-<italic>IQCH</italic>) yielded one transcript with a size of 381 bp, whereas the mutant <italic>IQCH</italic> (Mut-<italic>IQCH</italic>) resulted in one strong band of 263 bp (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, i</xref>). Sanger sequencing further showed that the variant resulted in the absence of the whole exon 4, which was expected to translate into a truncated protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, ii</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">iii</xref>). Therefore, we constructed a plasmid containing the aberrant cDNA sequence of <italic>IQCH</italic> caused by the splicing mutation to verify the effect of the variant on protein expression. The western blotting results showed that the Mut-c<italic>IQCH</italic> plasmid did not express IQCH, while the WT-c<italic>IQCH</italic> plasmid did (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, iv</xref>). We further conducted immunofluorescence staining of spermatozoa from the proband and the control. We detected very little expression of the IQCH protein in spermatozoa from the proband compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Taken together, these results reveal that this identified <italic>IQCH</italic> variant is responsible for splicing abnormalities and further causes a lack of IQCH expression, which is likely the genetic cause of male infertility in this family.</p>

<title>IQCH deficiency leads to sperm with cracked axoneme structures accompanied by defects in the acrosome and mitochondria</title>
<p>A comprehensive sperm morphology analysis was further conducted on the proband (the semen was not available from his great uncle). Papanicolaou staining revealed that the spermatozoa displayed multiple morphological flagellar abnormalities, such as coiled, bent, irregular, and even fractured tails (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These morphological anomalies were confirmed more precisely by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Significantly, more subtle abnormalities, such as axoneme exposure, bending, and cracking, were further identified between the midpiece and the principal piece of the proband’s spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, a deranged or incomplete ‘9+2’ microtubule structure of the flagella was observed in the proband by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). In addition, we detected ultrastructural defects in the spermatozoa nucleus, including irregular shapes, large vacuoles, and deformed acrosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The mitochondria of the spermatozoa had an abnormal arrangement and enlarged diameter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Moreover, we performed immunofluorescence staining for the marker of the acrosome (peanut agglutinin: PNA) as well as the mitochondrial marker (transcription factor A, mitochondrial: TFAM) to confirm the deficiency of the acrosomes and mitochondria in the proband’s spermatozoa. The results of the PNA and TFAM staining suggested that the spermatozoa acrosomes and mitochondria were severely defective in the proband compared to the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, E</xref>). In addition, we performed staining for SEPTIN4 (SEPT4), a functional marker of the annulus, to explore whether the flagellar fracture at the joint between the middle piece and principal piece was caused by a nonfunctional annulus. There was no significant difference in the SEPT4 signal in the spermatozoa between the proband and the control (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p>

<title>Impairment of male fertility in mice without <italic>Iqch</italic></title>
<p>To further elucidate the role of IQCH in male reproduction, we first explored the pattern of <italic>Iqch</italic> expression in mice by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and found that <italic>Iqch</italic> was more highly expressed in the mouse testis than in other organs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Additionally, we investigated the temporal expression of <italic>Iqch</italic> in mouse testes on different postnatal days. The results revealed that the expression of <italic>Iqch</italic> significantly increased on postnatal day 21, peaked on postnatal day 35, and then stabilized (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). To better understand the role of IQCH in spermatogenesis, we performed immunofluorescence staining of germ cells at different developmental stages in human and mouse testes. IQCHs exhibited the same pattern in human and mouse spermatogenesis and were detected mainly in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes and round spermatids and in the flagella of late spermatids (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The testis-enriched expression of <italic>Iqch</italic>/IQCH suggested its potential role in spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>We next generated <italic>Iqch</italic> knockout (KO) mice using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology. We used a guide RNA targeting exons 2 through 3 of <italic>Iqch</italic> to achieve the knockout (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and western blotting further confirmed the success of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mouse construction (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). The <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice showed no overt abnormalities in their development or behavior. The <italic>Iqch</italic> KO female mice showed normal fertility, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining further showed that the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO female mice had normal follicle development compared to that of the WT mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). However, the fertility of the KO male mice was significantly lower than that of the WT mice, as was the pregnancy rate and litter size (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). There was no detectable difference in the testis or epididymis/body weight ratio between the WT and <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), and the histology of the testes and epididymides in the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice showed no obvious abnormalities compared to those in the WT mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p>
<p>However, computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) confirmed that sperm motility was significantly reduced in the KO mice, and the sperm count was slightly decreased (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; Figure 3-video 1 and Figure 3-video 2). Moreover, morphological anomalies of the sperm flagella, such as an unmasking, bending, or cracking axoneme, which recapitulated the flagellar phenotype of the infertile patient, were easily observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>). We further found that during the spermatogenic process, abnormalities in axoneme exposure had already occurred when the spermatozoa flagellum developed (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). Intriguingly, tail defects, including bending and cracking between the middle piece and the principal piece, were mainly present in the epididymal spermatozoa (Figure 3—figure supplement 4), suggesting that more severe flagellum breakage might occur during sperm movement.</p>

<p>We further performed TEM analysis to investigate the ultrastructural defects in the testicular and epididymal spermatozoa of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice. In contrast to those of the WT mice, the spermatozoa of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice showed dilated intermembrane spaces of mitochondria and even loss of some mitochondrial material (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the annulus did not significantly differ between the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO and WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that the disruptive link between the flagellar middle piece and the principal piece might result from mitochondrial defects rather than the annulus. Immunofluorescence staining of mitochondrial markers (Solute carrier family 25 member 4: SLC25A4) and SEPT4 also revealed that the mitochondria of the spermatozoa of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice were severely defective, and there was no significant difference in the annulus of the spermatozoa between the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice and WT mice, which was consistent with the findings of the proband (Figure 3—figure supplement 5).</p>

<title>Poor in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in <italic>Iqch</italic> KO male mice</title>
<p>To evaluate the cause of the impaired fertility of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO male mice, mature oocytes from WT female mice in their reproductive period were retrieved and placed into culture dishes with sperm from the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice and WT mice for IVF treatment. We found that 70% of the embryos had pronuclei in the WT group, while the fertilization rate of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO group was dramatically reduced, accounting for 47% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Consequently, the percentages of both two-cell embryos and blastocysts were significantly lower in the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO male mice than in the WT male mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Noticeably, an inactive acrosome reaction was observed in most of the sperm from the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), leading to the inability to cross the zona pellucida (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, PNA staining revealed abnormal acrosome development in the different development germ cells of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Similarly, the expression of PNA was abnormal in the mature sperm of <italic>Iqch</italic> KO male mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). In the sperm of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO male mice and the proband, the PLCζ fluorescence signal was attenuated and abnormally localized (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Taken together, these data suggested that <italic>Iqch</italic> might play an important role in acrosomal formation, which is essential for fertilization.</p>

<title>RNA-binding proteins are the most relevant targets by which IQCH regulates spermatogenesis</title>
<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which IQCH regulates male fertility, we performed liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis using mouse sperm lysates and detected 288 interactors of IQCH (Figure 5—source data 1). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the IQCH-bound proteins revealed many particularly enriched pathways related to fertilization, sperm axoneme assembly, mitochondrion organization, calcium channel, and RNA processing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Intriguingly, 33 ribosomal proteins were identified (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that IQCH might be involved in protein synthesis. Using proteomic analysis of sperm from <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice, we further assessed key proteins that might be upregulated by IQCH. A total of 1,993 differentially expressed proteins were quantified, including 807 upregulated proteins and 1,186 downregulated proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). GO analysis revealed that the significantly downregulated proteins were enriched in RNA processing, gene expression, mitochondrion biogenesis, and calcium ion regulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), which was consistent with the enrichment of the IQCH-bound proteins.</p>

We focused on SYNCRIP, HNRNPK, FUS, EWSR1, ANXA7, SLC25A4, and HNRPAB, which play important roles in spermatogenesis. Specifically, SYNCRIP, HNRNPK, FUS, EWSR1, and HNRPAB are RBPs that are linked to spermatogenesis by controlling mRNA translation or spermatid postmeiotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kuroda et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fukuda et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sechi et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tian and Petkov 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Xu et al. 2022</xref>). ANXA7 is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that is a negative regulator of mitochondrial apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Du et al. 2015</xref>). Loss of SLC25A4 results in mitochondrial energy metabolism defects in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Graham et al. 1997</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Among these interactors of IQCH, HNRPAB was the most significantly downregulated protein according to proteomic analysis (Figure 5—source data 2), implying that HNRPAB might be the main target of IQCH. As an RBP, HNRPAB has been suggested to play an important role in spermatogenesis by regulating the translation of testicular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fukuda et al. 2013</xref>). We thus employed RNA-seq analysis of sperm from <italic>Iqch</italic> KO and WT mice to investigate the effects on RNA levels in the absence of IQCH. Importantly, among the downregulated genes, most were related to male fertility, such as axoneme assembly, spermatid differentiation, flagellated sperm motility, and fertilization (Figure 6—figure supplement 3). We hypothesized that this downregulation is linked to HNRPAB binding. Considering the disrupted fertilization and axoneme assembly in <italic>Igch</italic> KO mice, we selected the essential molecules involved in these two processes, <italic>Catsper1</italic>, <italic>Catsper2</italic>, <italic>Catsper3</italic>, <italic>Ccdc40</italic>, <italic>Ccdc39</italic>, <italic>Ccdc65</italic>, <italic>Dnah8</italic>, <italic>Irrc6,</italic> and <italic>Dnhd1</italic>, to confirm our speculation. We carried out RNA immunoprecipitation on formaldehyde-crosslinked sperm followed by qPCR to evaluate the interactions between HNRPAB and <italic>Catsper1</italic>, <italic>Catsper2</italic>, <italic>Catsper3</italic>, <italic>Ccdc40</italic>, <italic>Ccdc39</italic>, <italic>Ccdc65</italic>, <italic>Dnah8</italic>, <italic>Irrc6,</italic> and <italic>Dnhd1</italic> in KO and WT mice. As expected, binding between HNRPAB and important molecules was detected in the WT mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), supporting the functional role of HNRPAB in testicular mRNAs. Intriguingly, significantly decreased interactions between HNRPAB and those molecules were observed in the KO mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Therefore, IQCH is involved in spermatogenesis mainly by regulating RBPs, especially HNRPAB, to further mediate essential mRNA expression in the testis.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>The interaction of IQCH with CaM is a prerequisite for IQCH function</title>
<p>Given that IQCH is a calmodulin-binding protein, we hypothesized that IQCH regulates these key molecules by interacting with CaM (Figure 6—figure supplement 4). As expected, CaM interacted with IQCH, as indicated by LC-MS/MS analysis. We initially confirmed the binding of IQCH and CaM in WT sperm by co-IP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). In addition, their colocalization was detected during spermatogenesis by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 6—figure supplement 4).</p>
<p>We further confirmed the binding of IQCH to CaM in K562 cells, which express both IQCH and CaM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Moreover, a decrease in HNRPAB expression was observed when IQCH or CaM was knocked down (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>; Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 4), suggesting that IQCH or CaM might regulate HNRPAB expression. We then overexpressed IQCH and knocked down CaM or overexpressed CaM and knocked down IQCH in K562 cells and found that the reduced HNRPAB expression could not be rescued in either of these two situations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>; Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 4), indicating that CaM or IQCH alone cannot mediate HNRPAB expression. These findings suggested that HNRPAB expression might be regulated by the interaction of IQCH with CaM.</p>
<p>Using a microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay, we further confirmed that the IQ motif of IQCH is required for CaM binding. The binding affinity between IQCH (target) from cell lysates overexpressing GFP-<italic>IQCH</italic> plasmids and recombinant CaM (ligand) increased with increasing concentrations of recombinant CaM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). However, their binding was disrupted when the IQ motif of IQCH was deleted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). co-IP assays verified the above findings (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>; Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Not surprisingly, the expression of HNRPAB in cells cotransfected with the <italic>IQCH</italic> (△IQ)/<italic>CaM</italic> plasmid and the control/<italic>CaM</italic> plasmid was similar but was lower than that in cells overexpressing the WT-<italic>IQCH</italic> and <italic>CaM</italic> plasmids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>; Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Collectively, our findings suggest that IQCH interacts with CaM via the IQ motif to manipulate the expression of important molecules, especially HNRPAB, to play a role in spermatogenesis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Throughout the evolution of divergent species, IQCH has been conserved, indicating its fundamental role in organisms. As a novel CaM-binding protein, IQCH was first identified in human and mouse testes and exclusively localized in spermatocytes and spermatids, suggesting its potential activity in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yin et al. 2005</xref>). However, since IQCH was identified, no other findings have supported its function in male reproduction. In this study, we found that the <italic>IQCH</italic> mutation impaired male fertility, as indicated by flagellar morphological abnormalities and axoneme cracking. An aberrant ultrastructure in sperm with the <italic>IQCH</italic> mutation was associated with severe defects in acrosomes and mitochondria. Furthermore, <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice exhibited similar irregularities in the flagellum, especially the axoneme and mitochondria. We also found that <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice exhibited different degrees of functional defects in acrosomes. Thus, our work supported the vital role of IQCH in flagellar and acrosome development.</p>
<p>To date, only four IQ motif-containing proteins, IQCD, IQCF1, IQCG, and IQCN, have been suggested to participate in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Harris et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fang et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dai et al. 2022</xref>). Most IQ motif-containing proteins function in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent biological processes by binding to CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Harris et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fang et al. 2015</xref>); thus, IQCD, IQCF1, and IQCN are involved in fertilization and are relevant to the acrosome reaction, sperm capacitation, or manchette assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fang et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dai et al. 2022</xref>). In addition, because CaM has an impact on the actin cytoskeleton, <italic>Iqcg</italic> KO mice exhibit detachment of sperm heads from tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Harris et al. 2014</xref>). In our study, the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice also showed an impaired acrosome reaction, which caused reduced fertilization. Intriguingly, axoneme breaks at the annulus and mitochondrial defects were prominent in the flagella of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice, whose phenotypes were unexplored in the previously discovered IQ motif-containing proteins. Because CaM activation can stimulate changes in the actin cytoskeleton, it is reasonable that flagellum formation is defective when IQCH is absent. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a key player in the regulation of mitochondrial functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bravo-Sagua et al. 2017</xref>). Thus, the absence of IQCH leads to a failure of interaction with CaM and disruption of normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which consequently causes mitochondrial defects in <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice and patients with <italic>IQCH</italic> variants. Our findings suggested that fertilization is the main action of IQ motif-containing proteins, and each specific IQ motif-containing protein also has its own distinct role in spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>However, there are few publications regarding the underlying mechanism by which IQ motif-containing proteins manipulate reproductive processes, except for a recent study showing that IQCN interacts with CaM to regulate the expression of CaM-binding proteins, including manchette-related proteins (LZTFL1, KIF27, and RSPH6A), IFT family proteins and their motor proteins (IFT22, IFT43, IFT74, IFT81, IFT140, IFT172, WDR19, TTC21B, and DYNC2H1), and ribosomal protein family proteins (RPS5, RPS25, RPS27, and RPSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Dai et al. 2022</xref>). In our study, IQCH was shown to regulate the expression of RBPs via interactions with these proteins. RBPs are a large class of proteins that assemble with RNAs to form ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). RBPs function at various stages of RNA processing, including alternative splicing, RNA modification, nuclear export, localization, stability, and translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Corley et al. 2020</xref>). RNA processing in male reproductive biology is essential for the production of mature sperm, and many RBPs have been demonstrated to be indispensable during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Morgan et al. 2021</xref>). Among the RBPs, HNRPAB, a heterogeneous nuclear RNP, showed the most significant reduction among the downregulated interactors of IQCH, suggesting that HNRPAB might be the most important downstream effector protein of IQCH. It has been reported that HNRPAB plays a central role in spermatogenesis by regulating stage-specific translation of testicular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fukuda et al. 2013</xref>). As expected, a RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay using an anti-HNRPAB antibody revealed binding between HNRPAB and the mRNAs of several important genes (<italic>Catsper1</italic>, <italic>Catsper2</italic>, <italic>Catsper3</italic>, <italic>Ccdc40</italic>, <italic>Ccdc39</italic>, <italic>Ccdc65</italic>, <italic>Dnah8</italic>, <italic>Irrc6</italic>, and <italic>Dnhd1</italic>) involved in spermatogenesis. We further found that the interaction between IQCH and CaM is a prerequisite for regulating HNRPAB expression. We thus hypothesized that IQCH regulates male fertility by binding to CaM and controlling HNRPAB to manipulate the expression of key mRNAs involved in spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study identified a novel IQ motif-containing protein-coding gene, <italic>IQCH</italic>/<italic>Iqch</italic>, which is responsible for spermatogenesis in humans and mice, broadening the scope of known male infertility-associated genes and thus further illustrating the genetic landscape of this disease. In addition, our study suggested an unexplored mechanism in which IQCH regulates the expression of key RBPs involved in spermatogenesis, especially HNRPAB, by interacting with CaM to play crucial roles in fertilization and axoneme assembly. We believe that our findings will provide genetic diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for infertile males with <italic>IQCH</italic> pathogenic variants.</p>

The sgRNA sequences synthesized by Sangon Biotech are listed in Figure 3-source data 1. The two complementary DNA oligos of each sgRNA target were annealed and ligated to the pUC57-sgRNA plasmid (Addgene) for cloning. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into DH5α competent cells, and positive clones were screened based on kanamycin resistance and sequencing. The recombinant plasmid was linearized and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. In vitro transcription of the sgRNAs was performed using the MEGAshortscript Kit (Ambion, AM1354), and the sgRNAs were purified using the MEGAclear Kit (Ambion, AM1908). Cas9 mRNA was purchased from TriLink BioTechnologies. The mouse zygotes were coinjected with an RNA mixture of Cas9 mRNA (∼50 ng/μl) and sgRNA (∼30 ng/μl). The injected zygotes were transferred into pseudopregnant recipients to obtain the F0 generation. DNA was extracted from the tail tissues of the 7-day-old offspring, and PCR amplification was carried out with genotyping primers.

The supernatants were collected following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentrations were calculated by Bradford quantification and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). An enzyme solution at a ratio of 1:20 of trypsin enzyme (μg) to substrate protein (μg) was added to 100 μg of the protein samples, which were subsequently vortexed, centrifuged at low speed for 1 min, and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The peptide liquid obtained after salt removal was freeze-dried. The peptide sample was dissolved in 0.5 M TEAB, added to the corresponding iTRAQ labeling reagent and stored at room temperature for 2 h. The Shimadzu LC-20AB liquid phase system was used for purification, and the separation column was a 5 μm 4.6 × 250 mm Gemini C18 column for liquid phase separation of the sample. The dried peptide samples were reconstituted with mobile phase A (2% can, 0.1% FA) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, after which the supernatant was collected for injection. The separation was performed by an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher, USA). The sample was first enriched in a trap column, desalted and then placed into a self-packed C18 column. The peptides separated by liquid phase chromatography were ionized by a nanoESI source and then passed to a Q Exactive HF X tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, USA) for DDA (data-dependent acquisition) mode detection. The raw data were converted to mgf files for bioinformatics analysis, and protein identification from tandem mass spectra was performed by database searching (UniProt). The protein quantification process included the following steps: protein identification, tag impurity correction, data normalization, missing value imputation, protein ratio calculation, statistical analysis, and results presentation.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study describes mice with a knock out of the IQ motif-containing H (IQCH) gene, to model a human loss-of-function mutation in IQCH associated with male sterility. While the evidence for interaction between IQCH and potential RNA binding proteins is limited, the human infertility is reproduced in the mouse, making it a <bold>compelling</bold> model. The paper could be of interest to cell biologists and male reproductive biologists working on the sperm flagellar cytoskeleton and mitochondrial structure.</p>

<p>In this study, Ruan et al. investigate the role of the IQCH gene in spermatogenesis, focusing on its interaction with calmodulin and its regulation of RNA-binding proteins. The authors examined sperm from a male infertility patient with an inherited IQCH mutation as well as Iqch CRISPR knockout mice. The authors found that both human and mouse sperm exhibited structural and morphogenetic defects in multiple structures, leading to reduced fertility in Ichq-knockout male mice. Molecular analyses such as mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation indicated that RNA-binding proteins are likely targets of IQCH, with the authors focusing on the RNA-binding protein HNRPAB as a critical regulator of testicular mRNAs. The authors used in vitro cell culture models to demonstrate an interaction between IQCH and calmodulin, in addition to showing that this interaction via the IQ motif of IQCH is required for IQCH's function in promoting HNRPAB expression. In sum, the authors concluded that IQCH promotes male fertility by binding to calmodulin and controlling HNRPAB expression to regulate the expression of essential mRNAs for spermatogenesis. These findings provide new insight into molecular mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis and how important factors for sperm morphogenesis and function are regulated.</p>
<p>The strengths of the study include the use of mouse and human samples, which demonstrate a likely relevance of the mouse model to humans; the use of multiple biochemical techniques to address the molecular mechanisms involved; the development of a new CRISPR mouse model; ample controls; and clearly displayed results. Assays are done rigorously and in a quantitative manner. Overall, the claims made by the authors in this manuscript are well-supported by the data provided.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is unclear to us why you did not adjust the title to better reflect the well-supported claims of the paper, i.e., that this is a valuable model for human loss-of-function mutations in IQCH.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the editor’s suggestion. We have changed the title to “Deficiency of IQCH causes male infertility in humans and mice.” Additionally, we have provided the original images of the gels or blots as a zipped folder.</p>
