<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Several countries have reported that deaths with a primary code of cancer did not rise during COVID-19 pandemic waves compared to baseline pre-pandemic levels. This is in apparent conflict with findings from cohort studies where cancer has been identified as a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. Here we further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US by testing the impact of death certificate coding changes during the pandemic and leveraging heterogeneity in pandemic intensity across US states. We computed excess mortality from weekly deaths during 2014-2020 nationally and for three states with distinct COVID-19 wave timing (NY, TX, and CA). We compared pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple causes (MC) death data for six types of cancer and high-risk chronic conditions such as diabetes and Alzheimer’s. Any coding change should be captured in MC data.</p>
<p>Nationally in 2020, we found only modest excess MC cancer mortality (∼12,000 deaths), representing a 2% elevation over baseline. Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematologic, 2-5%) than cancers with a poor 5-year survival (lung and pancreatic, 0-1%). In comparison, there was substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes (39%) and Alzheimer’s (31%). Homing in on the intense spring 2020 COVID-19 wave in NY, mortality elevation was 2-15% for cancer and 126% and 55% for diabetes and Alzheimer’s, respectively. Simulations based on a demographic model indicate that differences in life expectancy for these conditions, along with the age and size of the at-risk populations, largely explain the observed differences in excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found limited elevation in cancer mortality during COVID-19 waves, even after considering coding changes. Our demographic model predicted low expected excess mortality in populations living with certain types of cancer, even if cancer is a risk factor for COVID-19 fatality risk, due to competing mortality risk. We also find a moderate increase in excess mortality from blood cancers, aligned with other types of observational studies. While our study concentrates on the immediate consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer mortality, further research should consider the pandemic impact on hospitalizations, delayed diagnosis/treatment and risk of Long COVID in cancer patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The dominant risk factors for COVID-19 mortality have consistently been shown to be advanced age, male gender and certain chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chavez-MacGregor et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rüthrich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>). Cancer has also been identified as a high-risk condition based on case-control and cohort studies, although these studies have provided conflicting results. In a large cohort study of ∼500,000 COVID-19 inpatients, only cancer patients under recent treatment were at increased risk of COVID-19 related deaths (OR=1.7) relative to non-cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chavez-MacGregor et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, a smaller European study of 3,000 COVID-19 inpatients found that cancer was not a risk factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rüthrich et al., 2021</xref>), as did an international, multicenter study of 4,000 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Raad et al., 2023</xref>). More recently a meta-analysis of 35 studies from Europe, North America, and Asia found a 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 mortality among cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Di Felice et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, a large analysis from the UK found that the risk of COVID-19 mortality for cancer patients had declined over the course of the pandemic but remained 2.5 times higher than for non-cancer patients into 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Starkey et al., 2023</xref>). Taken together, such observational studies provide a mixed picture of cancer as a COVID-19 mortality risk factor, with several studies reporting that controlling for other important factors such as age is a challenge. Further, cancer is often considered as a single disease category despite the diversity of conditions and patients represented.</p>
<p>Further evidence for the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 comes from population-level analysis of vital statistics. A recent US study showed no elevation in cancer deaths concomitant with COVID-19 waves, in stark contrast to mortality from other chronic diseases (W.-E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). Several other countries, including Sweden, Italy, Latvia, Brazil, England and Wales also observed stable or decreasing cancer mortality during the first year of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alicandro et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fernandes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gobiņa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Grande et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kontopantelis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lundberg et al., 2023</xref>). Further, a study of 240,000 cancer patients in Belgium found a 33% rise in mortality in April 2020, but concluded that this was no different from the excess mortality observed in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Silversmit et al., 2021</xref>). These findings raise the question of the true relationship between cancer and COVID-19.</p>
<p>The relationship between these two diseases could operate via multiple biological mechanisms, where immunosuppression in cancer patients could increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or risk of severe clinical outcome upon infection. Conversely, immunosuppression could be seen as a protective factor in the face of a severe respiratory infection that over stimulates the immune system – the immune incompetence rescue hypothesis. (Reichert 2004). This hypothesis was put forward to explain the lack of elevation in underlying cancer mortality during the 1968 influenza pandemic and severe influenza epidemics, a departure from patterns seen for other high-risk conditions such as heart disease and diabetes (Reichert 2004). A further mechanism that could affect the observed relationship between cancer deaths and COVID-19 is changing guidelines for establishing the primary cause of death. Coding guidelines evolved throughout the pandemic as testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection became more widespread, which presumably affected vital statistics studies.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level, we analyzed US vital statistics in detail to understand the potential role of coding changes during the pandemic and explored putative differences in mortality patterns between different types of cancer. The US provides a particularly useful case study as the timing of COVID-19 waves varied considerably between states, so that elevations in cancer deaths, should they exist, should also be heterogeneous. For context, we also assessed mortality patterns for other chronic conditions such as diabetes, ischemic heart disease (IHD), kidney disease, and Alzheimer’s, for which the association with COVID-19 is less debated.</p>

<title>Establishing patterns and timing of COVID-19 related deaths</title>
<p>We obtained individual ICD-10 coded death certificate data from the US for the period January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020. We compiled time series by week, state, and cause of death, for underlying cause (UC) and for multiple-cause (MC, any mention on death certificate) mortality. We considered 10 causes of death, including diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, ischemic heart disease (IHD), kidney disease, and 6 types of cancer (all-cause cancer, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, lung, and hematological; see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Appendix 1 - Table 1</xref> for a list of disease codes). We chose these types of cancer to illustrate conditions for which the 5-year survival rate is low (13% and 25%, respectively, for pancreatic and lung cancers) and high (65% and 91%, respectively, for colorectal and breast cancers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">National Cancer Institute, n.d.</xref>).</p>

<p>Hematological cancer (67% 5-year survival rate) was included because it has been singled out as a risk factor in several previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chavez-MacGregor et al., 2022</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Han et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rüthrich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>).To compare mortality patterns with the timing of COVID-19 pandemic waves, we accessed national and state counts of reported COVID-19 cases from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In national data, time series of COVID-19-coded death certificates (both UC and MC) tracked with the temporal patterns of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), revealing three distinct COVID-19 waves: a spring wave peaking on April 12, 2020, a smaller summer wave peaking on July 26, 2020, and a large winter wave that had not yet peaked by the end of the study in December 2020. This correspondence between COVID-19 case and death activity represents a “signature” mortality pattern of COVID-19.</p>

<caption><p>Weekly counts of death certificates listing COVID-19 as either the underlying or a multiple cause. When included on a death certificate, COVID-19 was most often listed as the underlying cause of death rather than a contributing cause. National-level data reveal three distinct waves: Wave 1 (spring, March 1 - June 27, 2020), Wave 2 (summer, June 28 - October 3, 2020), and Wave 3 (winter, October 4 - December 6, 2020, incomplete). Vertical dashed lines represent the peak of each wave, dotted lines represent the number of reported cases (y-axis on the right). New York experienced its first large COVID-19 wave in Wave 1, while Texas had its first large wave in Wave 2 and California did not experience a large wave until Wave 3 which had not yet peaked at the end of 2020.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>In state-level data, different states experienced variable timing, intensity and number of COVID-19 waves during 2020. To focus on periods with substantial COVID-19 activity and explore the association with cancer, we identified three large US states with unique, well-defined waves (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). New York (NY) state experienced a large, early wave in March-May 2020, based on recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths and high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in New York City in this period (over 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Stadlbauer et al., 2021</xref>)). Meanwhile, California (CA) experienced a large COVID-19 wave at the end of the year and had only little activity during the spring and summer. Finally, Texas (TX) had two large waves; one during late summer, followed by one in winter 2020.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>National patterns in excess mortality from cancer</title>
<p>Similar to other influenza and COVID-19 population-level mortality studies (W.-E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lee et al., 2023</xref>), we established a weekly baseline model for expected mortality in the absence of pandemic activity by modeling time trends and seasonality in pre-pandemic data and letting the model run forward during the pandemic (see Methods). Each cause of death (UC and MC) and geography was modeled separately. We then computed excess mortality as the difference between observed deaths and the model-predicted baseline. We summed weekly estimates to calculate excess mortality for the full pandemic period and during each of the 3 waves (see Methods). In addition to these absolute effects of the pandemic on mortality, we also calculated the relative effects by dividing excess mortality by baseline mortality (see Methods).</p>
<p>Nationally, we found a drop in UC cancer deaths during spring 2020 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, panel a; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), although the drop was not statistically significant. A similar non-significant decline was also seen for specific cancer types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, panels b-c; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 1 - Figure 1</xref>, panels a;f-j). We also saw that pre-pandemic mortality trends for each cancer type continued unabated during the first pandemic year. We reasoned that the drop in UC cancer deaths seen at the start of the pandemic could be evidence of a modest harvesting effect or alternatively could be due to changes in coding practices. If a death occurred in a cancer patient with COVID-19, the death could be coded with COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death and could explain the observed drop. We turned to MC mortality to resolve this question.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Time series of MC cancer mortality (any mention of any cancer code) showed a significant increase in all three waves (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, panel a; <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Appendix 1 - Table 2</xref>). A similar pattern was seen in MC time series for colorectal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, panel h), breast (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 1 - Figure 1</xref>, panel i), and hematological cancer (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 1 - Figure 1</xref>, panel j). However, the total excess mortality was modest with 12,000 excess cancer deaths in 2020, representing a statistically significant 2% elevation over baseline (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The largest relative increase in MC mortality was observed in hematological cancer at 5% (statistically significant, 3100 excess deaths). No excess in MC mortality was seen for the two deadliest cancers, pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, panel f) and lung cancer (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 1 - Figure 1</xref>, panel g).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>National patterns in deaths due to other chronic conditions</title>
<p>We considered diabetes and Alzheimer’s as “positive controls” as they are also considered COVID-19 risk factors and can illustrate associations between excess mortality from chronic conditions and COVID-19 on a population level. Diabetes provides a particularly useful comparator for cancer as the mean age at death is similar (∼72 years, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and because few individuals live in a nursing home (Appendix 1 - Supplemental Methods). Mortality time series from UC and MC diabetes and Alzheimer’s were highly correlated with COVID-19 activity, with statistically significant mortality elevation synchronous with pandemic wave activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 b-c</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Appendix 1 - Figures 2</xref>-<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For diabetes, we measured an excess of 11,400 and 85,700 deaths (UC and MC, respectively), corresponding to an elevation of 17% and 39% over baseline level mortality (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For Alzheimer’s, we estimated 18,500 and 32,200 excess deaths, corresponding to 21% and 31% elevation over baseline, respectively. Pandemic-related excess mortality was also seen for IHD and kidney disease (see supplement for estimates, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Appendix 1 - Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>State-level patterns in excess mortality</title>
<p>Similar to cancer patterns in national level data, none of the studied states had notable increases in UC cancer mortality, while there was a modest, non-significant increase in MC cancer mortality (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Appendix 1 - Figures 6</xref>-<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The largest mortality increase was seen in NY during the spring wave, with an 8% rise in MC cancer mortality above the model baseline (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Appendix 1 - Table 3</xref>). The magnitude of the increase seen during the spring wave varied by cancer type, with minimal increases seen in pancreatic and lung cancers (≤2%) and higher increases in colorectal, hematological, and breast cancers (8, 13, and 15% respectively). For comparison, there was a statistically significant rise in Alzheimer’s and diabetes deaths during this wave by 55% and 126%.</p>

<p>In CA and TX, mortality fluctuations were less pronounced than in NY, coinciding with less intense COVID-19 waves, and this was seen across all conditions. MC excess mortality estimates remained within +/-6% of baseline levels for cancers, irrespective of the type of cancer and pandemic wave, except for a 12% elevation in hematological cancer (MC) during the summer wave in Texas. None of these elevations were statistically significant. In comparison, there was significant excess mortality elevation for both Alzheimer’s and diabetes deaths (range, 25-49% in the CA winter wave, and 65-76% in the TX summer wave, <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Appendix 1-Tables 4</xref>-<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).</p>

<title>Mortality projections under the null hypothesis that cancer in and of itself is not a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality</title>
<p>Two main factors could drive cancer mortality patterns during COVID-19, namely the age of the population living with cancer (since age is such a pronounced risk factor for COVID-19), and the life expectancy under cancer diagnosis. These factors would operate irrespective of the true biological relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection, severity, and cancer.</p>
<p>To test the impact of these factors on observed excess mortality patterns and assess whether these factors alone could explain differences in excess mortality between chronic conditions, we designed a simple demographic model of COVID-19 mortality for individuals with chronic conditions. The model projected excess mortality during the pandemic under the null hypothesis that the chronic condition was not in and of itself a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, with only the demography of the population living with the disease (namely, age, size and baseline risk of death) affecting excess mortality. In the demographic model, we first estimated the number of expected COVID-19 infections among persons with a certain condition, by multiplying the estimated number of US individuals living with the condition by the reported SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence at the end of our study period (December 2020). We focused on seroprevalence among individuals ≥65 years, the most relevant age group for the conditions we considered. We then multiplied the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections by an age-adjusted infection-fatality ratio (IFR) for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">COVID-19 Forecasting Team, 2022</xref>). This gave an estimate of COVID-19-related deaths, or excess deaths, for a given condition. We divided our excess death estimate by the total deaths for that condition in 2019 to estimate a percent elevation over baseline (see Methods). We repeated this analysis for each cancer type, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, IHD, and kidney disease. In addition to the null hypothesis, we also projected an alternative hypothesis of a biological association, assuming that a given chronic condition would raise the risk of COVID-19 mortality (via the infection fatality ratio) by a factor 2. We compared these modeled expectations for the null and alternative hypotheses with the observed excess mortality in 2020, focusing on MC as the outcome (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Under the null hypothesis we projected a 7% elevation in all cancer deaths over the 2019 baseline (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For hematological cancers and particularly deadly cancers such as pancreatic and lung, we projected only a 1-2% elevation in mortality, in part driven by the high competing risk of death from these cancers (short life expectancy) and the small size of the population-at-risk. For colorectal and breast cancers, we projected a 6% and 14% elevation in mortality, in part driven by the lower risk of death from these cancers (longer life expectancy). Under the alternative hypothesis that cancer doubled the COVID-19 infection fatality rate (IFR), we projected a 13% elevation in total cancer mortality, 2% in pancreatic- and 28% in breast cancer. In empirical national MC mortality data, we observed a 0-3% elevation over baseline for all the non-hematological cancers and 5% for hematological cancers, more consistent with the null hypothesis. We note, however, that for the large spring wave in NY state the rise in cancers was closer to that projected under the assumption of a relative risk of 2.</p>
<p>We repeated this analysis for diabetes, Alzheimer’s, IHD, and kidney disease mortality (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; <xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Appendix 1 - Table 6</xref>). For diabetes we projected a 28% elevation over baseline based on the age distribution and substantial size of the population-at-risk alone. In fact, we observed a 39% elevation over baseline in national US data. For Alzheimer’s we projected a 46% increase over baseline, while we found a 31% increase in national US mortality data. Similarly, for IHD and kidney disease, the magnitude of the excess mortality rise projected under the demographic model was higher than for cancer and consistent with observations (<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Appendix 1-Table 6</xref>). These projections support the idea that demography alone (age, size, and baseline mortality of the population living with each of these conditions) can explain much of the differences in absolute and relative mortality elevations seen during the pandemic across conditions like cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cancer is generally thought of as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, yet observational studies have produced conflicting evidence. With recent availability of more detailed US vital statistics data, we used statistical time series approaches to generate excess mortality estimates for multiple cause of death data, different types of cancer, and several geographic locations. We accounted for potential changes in coding practices during the pandemic, for instance capturing a COVID-19 patient with cancer whose death may have been coded as a primary COVID-19 death and not a cancer death. Based on multiple cause of death data, we estimated 12,000 national COVID-19-related excess cancer deaths, which aligns well with reporting on death certificate data, where 13,400 deaths are ascribed to COVID-19 in cancer patients (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Appendix 1 - Figure 9</xref>). Yet these deaths only represent a 2% elevation over the expected baseline cancer mortality. Percent mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers (breast and colorectal) than cancers with a poor 5-year survival (lung and pancreatic). Consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chavez-MacGregor et al., 2022</xref>; S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Han et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rüthrich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>), we found that the largest mortality increase for specific cancer types was seen in hematological cancers with a 5% elevation over baseline.</p>
<p>In contrast to cancer, we observed substantial COVID-19-related excess mortality for diabetes and Alzheimer’s, temporally consistent with the three-wave “signature” pattern observed in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. To investigate whether demographic differences in underlying patient populations (age distribution, population size, and baseline risk of death due to underlying condition) could explain differences in excess mortality during the pandemic, we ran a simple demographic model for each condition – first assuming the condition in and of itself was not a risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality (null hypothesis). The results of these projections were consistent with observed excess mortality patterns; specifically, we did not expect to see large increases in cancer deaths compared to these other chronic conditions.</p>
<p>These projections also illustrate the importance of competing risks, where the risk of cancer death predominates over the risk of COVID-19 death. This is exacerbated for cancers with the lowest survival; for instance, for pancreatic cancer, under the null hypothesis we would expect a &lt;1% risk of mortality from COVID-19 in 2020 (assuming a 9% attack rate and 2.6% IFR, <xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">Appendix 1 - Table 7</xref>). In contrast, the 2019 baseline risk of death for pancreatic cancer itself is 43.5% (ratio of deaths to population-at-risk = 1:2.3, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Even if pancreatic cancer had in fact doubled the risk of dying of COVID-19 (IFR = 5.2), we would not expect to see more than a 1% excess mortality elevation during the pandemic (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), due to the high baseline level mortality associated with this disease. On the other hand, conditions with a lower baseline level mortality, such as diabetes (&lt;1% baseline risk of death), are more sensitive to COVID-19 driven elevations in mortality.</p>
<p>Our study rules out the immune incompetence rescue hypothesis that was raised in a 2004 paper on excess mortality patterns during influenza seasons (Reichert et al 2004). Similarly, the possibility that infectious disease mortality risk is modulated by immune competence has been put forward to explain the extreme mortality in young healthy adults in the 1918 pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Short et al., 2018</xref>). In the 2004 study, cancer deaths did not increase during the 1968 influenza pandemic as it did for other risk conditions, leading the authors to propose that immunosuppressive cancer treatment could mitigate an aberrant immune response to pandemic influenza infection. However, observational studies have consistently found the opposite to be the case for COVID-19 infection in patients with hematological cancers. These patients have twice the risk of dying compared to patients without cancer, likely due to the immunosuppression associated with their malignancy and treatment (X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Han et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Starkey et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>). Under the immune incompetence rescue hypothesis, one would have expected the opposite – that hematological cancers would have lowest excess mortality of all cancers. Our analysis of empirical vital statistics reveals instead that hematologic cancers were the most impacted by the pandemic, relative to other types of cancer, with a percent elevation over baseline most pronounced in states that were hit intensely like New York.</p>
<p>Nationally, the observed excess mortality for non-hematological cancers was lower than that expected under our demographic model, even under the null hypothesis of no biological association between non-hematologic cancers and COVID-19. The null hypothesis may still be valid as our analysis ignores any behavioral effects associated with the pandemic. It is conceivable that cancer patients may have shielded themselves from COVID-19 more than the average person or even other persons with chronic diseases in 2020. Our projections assume an average risk of infection for a typical individual over 65 years as there is no serologic data for specific clinical population subgroups (of any age). If shielding was high among cancer patients, our projections of cancer excess mortality during the pandemic would be inflated, potentially explaining the disconnect with observations. Retrospective serologic analysis of banked sera from the first year of the pandemic, broken down by underlying comorbidities, may shed light on whether infection risk may have varied by chronic condition.</p>
<p>State-level mortality patterns can potentially provide indirect insights on the question of shielding from exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Because NY experienced the earliest and most intense COVID-19 wave of the US, with 25% of the population infected in Spring 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., 2023</xref>), and because social distancing did not come into effect until March 2020, shielding would have had a more limited impact there than in other states. Thus, a biological relationship between cancer and COVID-19 would have been most dramatic in NY in spring 2020. Indeed, cancer excess mortality was exacerbated in NY, including an 8-15% increase in colorectal and breast cancer mortality. Yet these increases are still aligned with the projections from our demographic model under the null hypothesis. The absence of excess mortality in pancreatic and lung cancer in NY (0% and 1% over baseline) are, as discussed above, still consistent with what would be expected under a high competing risk situation.</p>
<p>Most vital statistics studies focused on the COVID-19 pandemic have relied on underlying cause-specific deaths, which are prone to changes in coding practices. Our initial hypothesis going into this work was that coding changes associated with a better recognition of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 led to an underestimation of excess mortality from cancer, affecting our perception of the relationship between cancer and COVID-19. We certainly found an effect of coding changes, where for instance a drop in excess mortality in underlying cancer deaths turned into an increase in any-listed cancer deaths, particularly in the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. The impact of coding changes was also seen in mortality from other chronic conditions but was particularly important for cancer. Yet both the absolute and relative excess mortality elevation remained modest for cancer, even after adjustment for coding changes, leading us to consider additional mechanisms such as the competing risk hypothesis.</p>
<p>Our study is subject to limitations. Given uncertainty in SARS-CoV-2 attack-rates and the age distribution and size of the population-at-risk for all studied conditions, our demographic model projections are not an exact tool to titrate excess mortality nor the relative risk associated with each condition. Our model merely serves as an illustration of the role of demography and competing risks. Further, we did not study the potential long-term consequences of the pandemic on cancer care, which includes avoidance of the health care system for diagnosis or treatment. We did not see any delayed pandemic effect on mortality from pancreatic cancer, which may have manifested in 2020 given the very low survival rate of this cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lemanska et al., 2023</xref>), but we cannot rule out longer-term effects on breast or colorectal cancers that would not be seen until 2021 or later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Doan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Han et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Haribhai et al., 2023</xref>; R. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Nascimento de Lima et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nickson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Nonboe et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tope et al., 2023</xref>). Additional years of data will be important to evaluate such effects. Additional years of data will also be important for assessing the impact of vaccination on the relationship between cancer and COVID-19; there is evidence that vaccines may be less immunogenic in patients with cancer compared to those without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Seneviratne et al., 2022</xref>). Another limitation of our study is the reliance on mortality as an outcome, while it may be important to consider the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and morbidity, and Long COVID in cancer patients. A small US study reported that 60% of cancer patients suffered Long COVID symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dagher et al., 2023</xref>). Future analyses using hospitalization data and electronic medical records may provide additional insights on how different cancer stages or other comorbidities may contribute to increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Lastly, a few methodological limitations are worth raising. Though it was important to assess excess mortality in state level data because of asynchrony in pandemic waves, confidence intervals in state-level estimates were large, particularly for specific types of cancers, affecting significance levels. Lastly, our study is a time-trend analysis and – similar to cohort and case-control studies – correlation does not necessarily imply causation. However, the intensity and brevity of COVID-19 pandemic waves in space and time lends support to our analyses.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our detailed excess mortality study considered six cancer types and found that there is at most a modest elevation in cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering multiple-causes-of-death records to accurately reflect changes in coding practices associated with the emergence of a new pathogen. In contrast to earlier studies, we propose that lack of excess cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic reflects the competing mortality risk from cancer (especially for pancreatic and lung cancers) itself rather than protection conferred from immunosuppression. We note the more pronounced elevation in mortality from hematological cancers during the pandemic, compared to other cancers, which aligns with a particular group of cancer patients singled out in several cohort studies. Future research on the relationship between COVID-19 and cancer should concentrate on different outcomes, such as excess hospitalizations, Long COVID, changes in screening practices during COVID-19, and longer-term patterns in cancer mortality.</p>

<p>We obtained individual ICD-10 coded death certificate data with exact date of death from the United States for the period January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020. Each death certificate has one underlying cause (UC) of death, defined as the disease or injury that initiated the train of events leading directly to death, and up to twenty causes of death in total, referred to here as multiple cause mortality (MC). We considered 10 conditions, including diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, ischemic heart disease (IHD), kidney disease, and 6 types of cancer (all cancer, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, lung, and hematological; see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for a list of disease codes). We chose these types of cancer to illustrate conditions for which the 5-year survival rate is low (13% and 25%, respectively, for pancreatic and lung cancers) and high (65% and 91%, respectively, for colorectal and breast cancers) (National Cancer Institute, n.d.). Hematological cancer (67% 5-year survival) was included because it was singled out as a risk factor by previous studies. We compiled time series by week, state, and cause of death, separately for underlying and multiple cause mortality.</p>

<title>Weekly excess mortality models</title>
<p>Similar to other influenza- and COVID-19 excess mortality studies (W.-E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lee et al., 2023</xref>), we established a predicted baseline of expected mortality for each time series, and computed the excess mortality as the excess in observed deaths over this baseline. To establish baselines for each disease nationally and in each state, we applied negative binomial regression models to weekly mortality counts for each cause of death, smoothed with a 5-week moving average and rounded to the nearest integer. Models included harmonic terms for seasonality, time trends, and an offset for population size, following:</p>
<p>Weekly_mortality = t + t<sup>2</sup> + cos(2<italic>π</italic>t/52.17) + sin(2<italic>π</italic>t/52.17) + offset(log(population)), where t represents week.</p>
<p>We fitted national and state-level models for each mortality outcome from January 19, 2014, to March 1, 2020, and projected the baseline forward until December 6, 2020, the last complete week of smoothed mortality data.</p>
<p>Using COVID-19 coded death certificates from March 1, 2020, to December 6, 2020, we established the timing of each pandemic wave from trough to trough. We found that nationally, the first wave occurred from March 1, 2020, to June 27, 2020; the second wave from June 28, 2020 to October 3, 2020 and the third from October 4, 2020 to December 6, 2020 (the 3rd wave was not completed by the last week of available smoothed data on December 6, 2020). For NY, the pandemic pattern was characterized by an intense first wave in Spring 2020, while TX had its major wave in summer 2020 and CA in late 2020. Comparison of mortality patterns from these three states provides an opportunity to separate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection with that of behavioral changes later in the pandemic. For instance, the effects of healthcare avoidance would predominate in CA or TX in Spring 2020, as there was little SARS-CoV-2 activity but much media attention on COVID-19, with cancer patients potentially avoiding medical care out of fear of getting infected. In contrast, risk of infection would dominate in NY in Spring 2020, and behavioral factors may only play a role as SARS-CoV-2 awareness increased and the wave was brought under control by social distancing.</p>
<p>We estimated weekly excess mortality by subtracting the predicted baseline from the observed mortality. We summed weekly estimates to calculate excess mortality for the full pandemic period and for each of the 3 waves within the first year of the pandemic. In addition to estimating the absolute effects of the pandemic on mortality, we also calculated relative effects by dividing excess deaths in each diagnosis group by the model baseline. Confidence intervals on excess mortality estimates were calculated by resampling the estimated model coefficients 10,000 times using a multivariate normal distribution and accounting for negative binomial errors in weekly mortality counts.</p>
<p>We used Pearson correlation to test synchronicity patterns in weekly excess mortality from different cancers and chronic conditions to underlying COVID-19 deaths. Correlation analysis assumes a direct and immediate effect of COVID-19 on cancer mortality. We also investigated the possibility of delayed effects or harvesting by inspecting the time series for evidence of such effects and by comparing total excess deaths for distinct pandemic waves and the whole of 2020.</p>

<title>Projections of excess mortality under the null hypothesis of no specific COVID-19 mortality risk of each condition</title>
<p>To further test the impact of age on the association between chronic conditions and COVID-19, and clarify the additional risk due to each chronic condition, we projected the number of COVID-19 deaths under the null hypothesis that age alone is a risk factor, and that there is no particular interaction between the condition and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Excess mortality projections were then compared with observed excess mortality. We only used MC deaths for this approach to account for the possibility that some individuals may suffer from multiple conditions. For example, an estimated 11.5% of US adults with type 2 diabetes also have a history of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We first calculated the number of expected COVID-19 infections among persons living with a certain chronic condition, by multiplying the estimated number of individuals living with the condition by the reported SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among individuals ≥65 years at the end of 2020 (we interpolated between the CDC surveys conducted in mid-December 2020 and the next one available in February 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023</xref>). We then estimated an age-adjusted COVID-19 IFR based on the estimated age distribution of individuals living with the condition and single-year age fatality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">COVID-19 Forecasting Team, 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">Appendix 1-Table 7</xref>). We multiplied this age-adjusted infection-fatality ratio by the estimated number of infections to arrive at the projected number of COVID-19-related excess deaths for a particular condition during 2020.</p>
<p>To obtain a relative metric of expected COVID-19 burden, we divided projected COVID-19 excess deaths by total deaths in each diagnosis group in the 2019 baseline period (March to December 2019), resulting in an expected percentage elevation over baseline in 2020. We compared this null expectation to the observed percentage elevation over baseline from our excess mortality models. We also generated the expected number of excess deaths under alternative hypotheses where each condition is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 related death given infection (i.e., the baseline age-adjusted infection fatality ratio used in the null hypothesis was increased 2-fold). We also provide projections for a RR of 5 in the Appendix (<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Appendix 1 - Table 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Characteristics of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s deaths in the pre-pandemic period.</p>
<p>For each chronic condition studied (cancer, diabetes, IHD, Alzheimer’s), we assessed potential changes in the characteristics of deaths during the pandemic period that are unrelated to timing but may signal an association with COVID-19. For instance, age is known to be a major risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. For each chronic condition, we computed the average age-at-death in the pre-pandemic year 2019 and compared this to the average age-at-death in 2020. The second potential confounder is living arrangement, as individuals living in nursing homes may be at increased risk of exposure (and death) to COVID-19 due to mixing, even though their underlying condition is not per se a risk factor. To test this hypothesis, we also compared the proportion of individuals in each disease group who died in nursing homes in 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p>And finally, to illustrate the impact of coding practices we compared ICD-10 letter categories between 2020 and 2019 for the underlying cause of death when cancer or diabetes are included on the death certificate, but are not listed as the underlying cause of death (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Appendix 1 - Figure 9</xref>). For 2020, we further compared death certificates listing both COVID-19 and cancer to those listing both COVID-19 and diabetes. For all comparisons between 2019 and 2020 data are limited to March to December to isolate the pandemic period.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> work explores death coding data to understand the impact of COVID-19 on cancer mortality. The work provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence that deaths with cancer as a contributing cause were not above what would be expected during pandemic waves, suggesting that cancer did not strongly increase the risk of dying of COVID-19. These results are an interesting exploration into the coding of causes of death that can be used to make sense of how deaths are coded during a pandemic in the presence of other underlying diseases, such as cancer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the paper &quot;Disentangling the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19&quot;, the authors study whether the number of deaths in cancer patients in the USA went up or down during the first year (2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. They found that the number of deaths with cancer mentioned on the death certificate went up, but only moderately. In fact, the excess with-cancer mortality was smaller than expected if cancer had no influence on the COVID mortality rate and all cancer patients got COVID with the same frequency as in the general population. The authors conclude that the data show no evidence of cancer being a risk factor for COVID and that the cancer patients were likely actively shielding themselves from COVID infections.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper studies an important topic and uses sound statistical and modeling methodology. It analyzes both, deaths with cancer listed as the primary cause of death, as well as deaths with cancer listed as one of the contributing causes. The authors argue, correctly, that the latter is a more important and reliable indicator to study relationships between cancer and COVID. The authors supplement their US-wide analysis by analysing three states separately.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main findings of the paper can be summarized as six numbers. Nationally, in 2022, multiple-cause cancer deaths went up by 2%, Alzheimer's deaths by 31%, and diabetes deaths by 39%. At the same time, assuming no relationship between these diseases and either Covid infection risk or Covid mortality risk, the deaths should have gone up by 7%, 46%, and 28%. The authors focus on cancer deaths and as 2% &lt; 7%, conclude that cancer is not a risk factor for COVID and that cancer patients must have &quot;shielded&quot; themselves against Covid infections.</p>
<p>However, I did not find any discussion of the other two diseases. For diabetes, the observed excess was 39% instead of &quot;predicted by the null model&quot; 28%. I assume this should be interpreted as diabetes being a risk factor for Covid deaths. I think this should be spelled out, and also compared to existing estimates of increased Covid IFR associated with diabetes.</p>
<p>And what about Alzheimer's? Why was the observed excess 31% vs the predicted 46%? Is this also a shielding effect? Does the spring wave in NY provide some evidence here? Why/how would Alzheimer's patients be shielded? In any case, this needs to be discussed and currently, it is not.</p>

<p>The article is very well written, and the approach is quite novel. I have two major methodological comments, that if addressed will add to the robustness of the results.</p>
<p>(1) Model for estimating expected mortality. There is a large literature using a different model to predict expected mortality during the pandemic. Different models come with different caveats, see the example of the WHO estimates in Germany and the performance of splines (Msemburi et al Nature 2023 and Ferenci BMC Medical Research Methodology 2023). In addition, it is a common practice to include covariates to help the predictions (e.g., temperature and national holidays, see Kontis et al Nature Medicine 2020). Last, fitting the model-independent for each region, neglects potential correlation patterns in the neighbouring regions, see Blangiardo et al 2020 PlosONE.</p>
<p>Based on the above:</p>
<p>
a. I believe that the authors need to run a cross-validation to justify model performance. I would suggest training the data leaving out the last year for which they have mortality and assessing how the model predicts forward. Important metrics for the prediction performance include mean square error and coverage probability, see Konstantinoudis et al Nature Communications 2023. The authors need to provide metrics for all regions and health outcomes.</p>
<p>b. In the context of validating the estimates, I think the authors need to carefully address the Alzheimer case, see Figure 2. It seems that the long-term trends pick an inverse U-shape relationship which could be an overfit. In general, polynomials tend to overfit (in this case the authors use a polynomial of second degree). It would be interesting to see how the results change if they also include a cubic term in a sensitivity analysis.</p>
<p>c. The authors can help with the predictions using temperature and national holidays, but if they show in the cross-validation that the model performs adequately, this would be fine.</p>
<p>d. It would be nice to see a model across the US, accounting for geography and spatial correlation. If the authors don't want to fit conditional autoregressive models in the Bayesian framework, they could just use a random intercept per region.</p>
<p>(2) I think the demographic model needs further elaboration. It would be nice to show more details, the mathematical formula of this model in the supplement, and explain the assumptions.</p>
