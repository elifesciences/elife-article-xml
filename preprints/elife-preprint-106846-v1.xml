<title>Abstract</title><p>Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed into long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), whose functions and modes of action remain poorly understood. <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> is an evolutionary conserved, broadly and highly expressed lncRNA that produces the H/ACA snoRNA <italic>SNORA13</italic> from one of its introns. We studied the consequences of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> perturbation in breast cancer cells and found that it acts both <italic>in cis</italic>, to enhance transcription of the proximal <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> gene and additional genes in its two flanking topologically associated domains, and in <italic>trans</italic> by broadly regulating gene expression, including expression of snoRNAs, transcription of genes involved in nucleolar biology and the distribution of nucleolar proteins. These effects are phenocopied by the loss of SUB1, an interactor of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>, and are observed following transient perturbations of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> that do not affect steady-state <italic>SNORA13</italic> levels or the rRNA modification it helps install. Exogenous expression of the full-length <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> locus but not <italic>SNORA13</italic> expression can rescue the <italic>trans</italic>-acting transcriptional effects of its perturbation.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a highly heterogeneous group of RNA molecules, defined as being &gt;500 nt long and not displaying a significant protein-coding potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Given this broad definition and the pervasive transcription of the human genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, lncRNAs are now the RNA class with the largest number of annotated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Long noncoding RNAs exhibit a wide range of expression levels, driven by varying transcription rates and half-lives. However, only a limited number of lncRNAs have well-defined mechanisms of action. Although small peptides arising from short and poorly conserved translated open reading frames (ORFs) have been reported in several lncRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and studies using ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome profiling data and deep proteomic analysis, found evidence of translation of ORFs in hundreds of lncRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Yet it remains unclear how many of these are encoding functional peptides, mainly because these ORFs are typically poorly conserved and the protein products do not appear to be abundant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Similar to protein-coding mRNAs, lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), 5’ capped with 7-methyl guanosine (m<sup>7</sup>G), polyadenylated at their 3’ ends, and have a canonical exon–intron structure.</p>
<p>One way to functionally classify lncRNAs is by the nature of the functional elements harbored within their loci. One class comprises genes in which the DNA element has a function unrelated to the transcription of the locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The other includes cases in which the act of transcription is functionally relevant, while the resulting RNAs are “byproducts” of Pol II activity, which, for example, can tune the expression of another locus in 3D proximity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This class is potentially broad because it can explain the prevalence of lncRNA loci in which the lncRNAs are expressed at very few copies and/or have sequences that are evolving without any apparent selection. For the cases where the RNA product is functional, a further distinction can be made between <italic>cis</italic>- acting lncRNAs, the function of which is restricted to the locus from which they are transcribed, and <italic>trans</italic>-acting lncRNAs, which are transcribed, processed, and then move away by diffusion or active transport to exert their function elsewhere. The latter RNAs require a relatively stable RNA molecule because they have to interact with one or more other RNA species and/or proteins, whereas, for <italic>cis</italic>-acting lncRNAs, such an RNA molecule may or may not be necessary, with the act of transcription and concomitant chromatin remodeling reported to be sufficient in several cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are intermediate-sized RNAs whose main function is to guide RNA modifications at other RNAs, mostly ribosomal RNAs. In mammalian cells, snoRNAs are produced mainly from introns of polyadenylated transcripts, some of which code for proteins, and others are lncRNAs. Noncoding snoRNA host genes (or ncSHNG) are characterized by several characteristic features, including high and broad expression levels, relatively inefficient splicing, and sensitivity to nonsense-mediated decay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. While lncRNA functions have been shown for some ncSNHGs, most remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a bioinformatic screen that converged on <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>, a very abundant and conserved lncRNA acting as a <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulator, and our observations that this lncRNA also works in <italic>trans</italic> to regulate nucleolar biology.</p>

<title>A computational screen for putative <italic>cis</italic>-acting lncRNAs</title>
<p>We hypothesized that lncRNAs likely to act in <italic>cis</italic> will be occasionally co-regulated with their target genes and also found in spatial proximity to the target promoters. We sought such lncRNA-target pairs in the GeneHancer database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, that connects regulatory elements and their targets by combining tissue co-expression data, enhancer-enriched histone modifications, transcription factor binding, Hi-C data, and eQTLs. We complemented this resource with RNA- seq datasets from the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 exposed to different treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1">Table S1</xref>). This analysis (see Methods) led us to focus on four lncRNA-target pairs connected in GeneHancer and in which both genes were significantly either upregulated or downregulated in the treatment conditions, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A-D</xref>). We knocked down (KD) each candidate with two distinct GapmeRs—antisense oligonucleotides with a DNA core that induces the degradation of target nascent RNA via RNAse H activity. We then tested the expression of the target genes using RT-qPCR. Among the four lncRNAs, KD of <italic>EPB41L4A- AS1</italic> significantly repressed <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), whereas the other lncRNAs had no substantial effects on the putative target genes.</p>

<title><italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> is a complex lncRNA gene</title>
<p>The <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> locus is ∼2 kb (kilobases) long, and the main transcribed isoform terminates ∼300 nt from the 3’ end of the main isoform of the convergently transcribed <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> gene, and &gt;250 kb away from the <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> transcription start site (TSS, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). An H/ACA snoRNA, <italic>SNORA13</italic>, a homolog of yeast <italic>snR35</italic>, is embedded within the first intron of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>. This snoRNA guides pseudouridylation on position 1248 of the small subunit 18S rRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This modification is the first step in the installation of one of the most complex RNA modifications—N1-methyl-N3-aminocarboxypropyl-pseudouridine (m(1)acp(3)Ψ)—that is located next to the tRNA P-site and is often lost in human cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Recently, <italic>SNORA13</italic> has been reported to negatively regulate ribosome biogenesis by decreasing the incorporation of RPL23 into maturing 60S subunits, eventually triggering p53-mediated cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Several groups reported different functions of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>. It was found to be differentially expressed across the cell cycle, and its KD affected cell cycle progression and reduced proliferation in multiple cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Another study implicated <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> in glucose metabolism through interactions with HDAC2 and NPM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Silencing of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> led to HDAC2 translocation into the nucleoplasm, where it binds the <italic>VDAC1</italic> and <italic>VHL</italic> promoter regions, among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and effects on the expression of additional genes were reported in other systems as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In human cancers, <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> is also downregulated and correlates with a poor prognosis in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer (BRCA), which we also observed by analyzing the TCGA data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>), aligning with the widespread loss of the m(1)acp(3)Ψ modification. <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> instead is a poorly studied gene, reported to be involved in predisposition to papillary thyroid carcinoma by modulating the WNT/β-catenin pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, possibly playing a role in connecting the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, as well as throughout development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>

<title><italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> is highly expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is regulated in multiple conditions</title>
<p>Using single-molecule fluorescence <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization (smFISH) and subcellular fractionation we found that <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> displays both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in MCF-7 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), with a minor fraction associated with chromatin as well (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). In contrast, both <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> and <italic>SNORA13</italic> were mostly found in the chromatin fraction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), the former possibly due to the length of its pre-mRNA (&gt;250 kb), which would require substantial time to transcribe. Coding-Potential Assessment (CPAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> analysis showed the sequence of <italic>EPB41L4A- AS1</italic> has little coding potential. A translated ORF in the first exon of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> has been reported to produce a small peptide (TIGA1), which localizes to the mitochondria and induces growth arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Applying CPAT to each exon separately, found evidence for some coding potential only in the first exon that harbors the TIGA1 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3A</xref>). Importantly, analysis of the RNA-seq signal coverage shows that the common <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> isoform in MCF-7 cells begins downstream of the AUG codon at the start of TIGA1, and TIGA1 doesn’t have another in-frame AUG in its sequence. Consistently, the vast majority of CAGE tags at the <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> are also downstream of the AUG of TIGA1, consistent with the start sites of most isoforms of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> annotated in GENCODE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), We conclude that while some fraction of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> might produce TIGA1 peptides, most RNA products of this gene in MCF-7 do not produce TIGA1 or other peptides predicted to be functional.</p>
<p>Consistently with a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, we found a strong upregulation of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1, EPB41L4A</italic>, and <italic>SNORA13</italic> in MCF-7 cells upon serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3B</xref>). In contrast with a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, we did not detect <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> to be differentially expressed across the cell cycle in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3C</xref>). We further explored the effect of different stresses and environmental conditions on <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> by analyzing its expression in a published dataset comprising five different cell types exposed to a panel of 50 different substances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3D</xref>), as well as exposing MCF-7 cells to LPS (bacterial infection), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (oxidative stress), thapsigargin (ER stress and unfolded protein response) and etoposide (DNA damage) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3E</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> expression was induced in nearly all conditions, often together with <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> but not <italic>SNORA13</italic>, suggesting the levels of the snoRNA are typically detached from that of the lncRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, likely because the latter is substantially more stable (see below).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title><italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> regulates <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> transcription</title>
<p>We assessed the 3D chromatin architecture around the <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> locus by performing UMI-4C-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> with baits targeting the lncRNA, <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> and the promoter of <italic>STARD4</italic>—a flanking gene found ∼650 Kb upstream of the <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> promoter. <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> formed contacts with both genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, middle), with prominent peaks corresponding to the promoter of <italic>EPB41L4A</italic>. Interestingly, the promoter of <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> displays several contacts with its own gene body (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, right panel), consistent with a “stripe” in HiC data where a single anchor interacts with the whole topologically associated domain (TAD) at high frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, with those frequencies reduced to below background levels upstream of the <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> locus.</p>
<p>Conversely, contacts from the <italic>STARD4</italic> promoter also show a peak near <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> and then reduced below the background (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, left panel). These data indicate that <italic>EPB41L4A- AS1</italic> is located at a TAD boundary region, forming strong spatial contacts with sites upstream and downstream, including the promoter of <italic>EPB41L4A</italic>. In agreement with this, <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> is located between the 5q22.1 and 5q22.2 chromosomal bands, delimiting two TADs as evident in both our 4C-seq and Micro-C data from H1 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Both <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> and <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> are characterized by CTCF binding near their promoters and their chromatin is extensively demarcated with H3K27ac (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). A recent study identified this boundary as one of the most insulated in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>We then focused on a possible reciprocal regulation between <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> and <italic>EPB41L4A</italic>. <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD with antisense GapmerRs reduced the expression of <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> mRNA and its promoter-associated divergent lncRNA <italic>EPB41L4A-DT</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), as well as the EPB41L4A protein levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). CUT&amp;RUN-qPCR of the H3K27ac mark—which is associated with active promoters and enhancers—showed a reduction of H3K27ac at the <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In contrast to the effects of GapmeRs, which mostly act in the nucleus and on the nascent RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, KD of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> with siRNAs, which instead mainly act on the mature RNA in the cytoplasm, did not affect <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A</xref>). Levels of <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> were not affected by increased expression of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> from the endogenous locus by CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), nor by its exogenous expression from a plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4E</xref>) or upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4G</xref>) of <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> did not have any consistent effects on <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> expression, suggesting a unidirectional effect of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> transcription of its nascent RNA product on <italic>EPB41L4A</italic>.

We conclude that the transcription of the RNA product of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> acts unidirectionally and in <italic>cis</italic> to promote the expression of <italic>EPB41L4A</italic>, possibly by ensuring spatial proximity between the TAD boundary and the <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> promoter.</p>

<title>Genome-wide transcriptional alterations upon depletion of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic></title>

Consistently with the qRT-PCR data, KD of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> reduced <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> expression, and also reduced expression of several, but not all other genes in the TADs flanking the lncRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Based on these data, <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> is a significant <italic>cis</italic>-acting activator according to TransCistor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> (P=0.005 using the digital mode). The <italic>cis</italic>-regulated genes reduced by <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD included <italic>NREP</italic>, a gene important for brain development, whose homolog was downregulated by genetic manipulations of regions homologous to the lncRNA locus in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Depletion of <italic>EPB41L4A- AS1</italic> thus affects several genes in its vicinity.</p>
<p>Downregulation of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> led to broad changes in gene expression beyond the proximal TADs. A total of 2,364 genes were differentially expressed (1,110 up, 1,254 down, adjusted P&lt;0.05 and |log<sub>2</sub>Fold-change| &gt;0.41) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), in contrast to only 104 (36 up, 68 down) when <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> was targeted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). A total of 25 (69%) of the upregulated, and 22 (32%) of the downregulated genes after <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> KD were also regulated in the same direction by the KD of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5B</xref>, P&lt;10<sup>-15</sup> for both). In agreement with studies on <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, these genes were enriched with those functioning in cell-cell adhesion and cell surface receptor signaling, although with a borderline significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S4C</xref>). Most of the consequences of the depletion of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> are thus not directly explained by changes in <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> levels. An additional <italic>trans</italic>-acting function for <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> would be consistent with its high expression levels compared to most lncRNAs detected in MCF-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Several GO terms were found to be enriched among both up- and down-regulated genes following <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD. Upregulated genes were linked to cell-cell adhesion, inflammatory response and JAK/STAT/ERK pathway, and the downregulated ones to cell cycle, division and DNA repair, among others (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). When considering cellular components, the downregulated genes were associated with ribonucleoprotein and spliceosomal complexes, as well as to ribosome subunit and, interestingly, the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6B</xref>). Thus, since <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> is a snoRNA-host gene (SNHG) and snoRNAs typically localize to and act in the nucleolus, we aimed to investigate whether this lncRNA might interact with some factors that can explain the observed enrichment in nucleolar-associated genes.</p>

<p>We hypothesized that loss of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> might affect SUB1, either via the reduction in its expression or by affecting its functions. We stratified SUB1 eCLIP targets into confidence intervals, based on the number, strength and confidence of the reported binding sites. Indeed, eCLIP targets of SUB1 (from HepG2 cells profiled by ENCODE) were significantly downregulated following <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD in MCF-7, with more confident targets experiencing stronger downregulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). To obtain SUB1-associated transcripts in MCF- 7 cells; we performed a native RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing of polyA+ RNAs (RIP-seq) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6C</xref>). As expected, <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> precipitated with SUB1, as did other top hits from the eCLIP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6C</xref>). A total of 1,470 genes were enriched in the IP fraction (adjusted P&lt;0.05 and |log<sub>2</sub>Fold-change| &gt;0.41) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6D</xref>), and the MCF-7 RIP data were in agreement with that of the eCLIP in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6E</xref>). Similarly to what was done with the eCLIP data, we divided the RIP-defined targets into confidence intervals based on the significance and overall enrichment in the IP fraction. Strikingly, SUB1-associated transcripts were downregulated upon <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), similar to what was observed for the eCLIP-based targets. Since SUB1 is also a transcriptional regulator associated with chromatin, we performed CUT&amp;RUN to uncover the genome-wide chromatin occupancy of SUB1 in MCF- 7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table3">Table S3</xref>). SUB1 binding was enriched around TSSs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>) and among its 835 high- confidence genomic peaks, 418 (∼50%) overlapped with the promoters of 411 genes. Of these genes, transcripts of only 56 genes were also bound by SUB1 at the RNA level, suggesting largely distinct sets of genes targeted by SUB1 at both the DNA and the RNA levels. Genes with promoter occupancy of SUB1 were enriched for biological processes related to genome maintenance, stress response, and nuclear transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6F</xref>), which is in line with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. These genes were also slightly yet highly significantly downregulated following <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Taken together, <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> interacts with SUB1 and its KD led to both a decrease in SUB1 mRNA level and the concomitant downregulation of SUB1 targets on chromatin and at the RNA level, positioning this lncRNA as a modulator of SUB1 activity.</p>

<title>Global de-regulation of snoRNAs and histone mRNA expression upon loss of <italic>EPB41L4A- AS1</italic></title>
<p>Since many classes of noncoding RNAs—including those localizing to the nucleolus—are not polyadenylated, we next sequenced total rRNA-depleted RNAs from <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD and control MCF-7 cells. As expected, using this approach we could quantify various RNA species lacking polyA tails, such as small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), snoRNAs and histone mRNAs, and could also better quantify intronic expression. Consistent with a <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulation at the transcriptional level, both the exonic and intronic reads of <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> were significantly reduced after <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7A</xref>). When considering different transcript classes, we observed a marked upregulation of most snRNAs and snoRNAs and a significant downregulation of histone mRNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To quantity SNHG de-regulation at higher resolution, we created a custom annotation in which we divided each SNHG into exonic regions, the snoRNA-encoding region, regions in the snoRNA-containing introns that are found upstream (‘pre-’) and downstream (‘post-’) of the snoRNA, and other snoRNA-less introns (‘Other’) of the SNHG transcripts, while considering the various isoforms annotated for each SNHG (see Methods) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We then quantified the levels of each region in control and KD conditions. Intriguingly, while SNHG exons and unrelated introns were not affected by <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD, read coverage was increased over both the snoRNAs and the flanking intronic regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These changes were shared among all the snoRNA classes and were concordant within individual introns when both (pre- and post-) had enough coverage to be quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7C</xref>). Notably, the effect sizes of these changes were small, and they were not evident when plotting metagenes of these regions—that show the median coverage level—which is close to zero even in rRNA-depleted data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7D</xref>), therefore suggesting that snoRNA processing remains an efficient process even in <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>-depleted cells, and most of the effect we observe is in increased accumulation of the mature and stable snoRNAs. This suggests that <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> perturbation specifically affects the snoRNA production and/or stability rather than SNHG transcription.</p>

<p>To test if the effects on snoRNA biogenesis are related to the changes in SUB1 expression and/or activity, we sequenced RNA from MCF-7 cells in which SUB1 was depleted by siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7F</xref>). We identified a total of 243 upregulated and 154 downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7G</xref>), of which 41 (∼17%) and 74 (∼48%) were concordantly affected by <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> depletion, and the magnitudes of the genome-wide responses were moderately, but significantly correlated (Spearman’s R = 0.138, P&lt;10<sup>-15</sup>). Strikingly, <italic>SUB1</italic> KD led to a similar increase in snoRNA levels and a decrease in histone mRNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7H</xref>).

<p>Lastly, we tested whether the effects of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> perturbation could be a generic outcome of a noncoding SNHG (ncSNHG) perturbation.

We therefore wondered if the effects we observe in our experimental system result from changes in expression levels of this snoRNA. <italic>SNORA13</italic> levels did not change in RT-qPCR analysis of perturbed cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), or in rRNA-depleted RNA-seq data (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We also performed a Northern blot for <italic>SNORA13</italic>, which also did not indicate changes in expression level or changes in RNA size of <italic>SNORA13</italic> upon GapmeR-mediated depletion of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). To complement these data, we assessed the levels of the 18S:1248m<sup>1</sup>acp<sup>3</sup>Ψ modification, which includes a pseudouridylation guided by <italic>SNORA13</italic>. We used an aminocarboxyl propyl reverse transcription (aRT)-PCR assay as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and found no difference in HinfI cleavage between control cells and those transfected with either <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>- or <italic>EPB41L4A</italic>-targeting GapmeRs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), suggesting that overall the MACP modification is not affected as well. In addition, variant calling at 18S:1248 exploiting the residual rRNA reads in our polyA+ RNA-seq dataset revealed no distinction in allele frequency between control and transfected cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), concordant with the aRT-PCR results. In conclusion, we show that in our experimental system—MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with GapmeRs targeting its host—we do not observe changes in steady state <italic>SNORA13</italic> levels nor abundance of the only known RNA modification driven by this snoRNA. Therefore, we postulate that the observed endophenotypes are likely due to changes in the <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> lncRNA levels and its cooperation with SUB1.</p>

<title>A full-length, intron- and <italic>SNORA13</italic>-containing <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> is required to partially rescue snoRNA expression</title>
<p>We reasoned that if <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> indeed regulates snoRNA expression, this function likely occurs in <italic>trans</italic>, because none of the genes in the vicinity of the <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> locus are known to be involved in snoRNA biogenesis or stability. To test this, we performed rescue experiments in which we co-transfected lncRNA-targeting GapmeRs with different GapmeR-resistant <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> variants expressed from a plasmid driven by a constitutive CMV promoter. We confirmed that the transfected vector is well spliced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), and results in an increase in both <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> and <italic>SNORA13</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>, left).</p>
<p>We then assessed both KD dynamics and the abundance of snoRNAs selected based on their sensitivity to <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD in the RNA-seq data at 24, 48 and 72 hours after transfection using qRT-PCR. <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> expression decreased concomitantly with that of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>, in line with the transcription of the lncRNA regulating this gene in <italic>cis</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>, right). The expression of most <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>-sensitive snoRNAs increased as early as 24 hours after transfection, and they generally remained upregulated throughout the next two days (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>We designed four different <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> expression vectors to attempt a rescue: 1) full length, including introns; 2) full length, including introns but without <italic>SNORA13</italic> (Δ<italic>SNORA13</italic>); 3) full length, including introns but with either the H or ACA <italic>SNORA13</italic> boxes deleted (ΔH and ΔACA); and 4) <italic>SNORA13</italic> alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). We then compared gene expression between cells transfected with the overexpressing vectors (OE) or an empty control (EV). We were able to obtain a partial rescue of snoRNA expression only when co-transfecting the full length <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>, and not any other vector not expressing any or just a mutated <italic>SNORA13</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>), indicating that the <italic>SNORA13</italic> sequence is involved in the process. However, the expression of a stand-alone <italic>SNORA13,</italic> using the expression vector used and validated previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, was incapable to drive any rescue of the snoRNAs abundance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). This would suggest that it is the whole <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> transcript and its snoRNA-containing processing that can counter <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD.</p>

<title><italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> affects RNA metabolism of both the genes found in <italic>cis</italic> and of snoRNAs</title>
<p>To distinguish between the effects of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> depletion on RNA synthesis and RNA decay, we performed SLAM-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> using ribo-depleted total RNA in <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table4">Table S4</xref>). After 48 hours of control or <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>–targeting GapmeR transfection, we collected RNA at 0, 4, 8 and 24 hours post-addition of 4sU to the media, while replenishing fresh 4sU at each time point (see Methods) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> showed decreased synthesis rate and unchanged half-life (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>), as expected from a gene regulated at the level of transcription. As a group, genes upregulated after <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD in the regular steady-state RNA-seq data had substantially higher synthesis rates, and those downregulated had lower synthesis rates, when compared to unchanged ones (P=3.25x10<sup>-14</sup> for the up-regulated genes and P=0.002 for the down-regulated genes, Mann-Whitney test, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), whereas only a minor difference was observed in terms of half-lives (P=0.011 for the up-regulated genes and P=1.82x10<sup>-8</sup> for the down-regulated genes, Mann-Whitney test, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). This suggests that the <italic>trans</italic>-regulated genes are also mostly regulated at the level of their transcription. When considering the genes in the two neighboring TADs of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>, we also observed a general reduction in both synthesis rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10A</xref>, left) and half-lives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10B</xref>, left). When comparing the effects across genes in the two neighboring TADs (“Cis”), other TADs on the same chromosome (“Chr5”), or other chromosomes (“Trans”), the genes proximal to <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> specifically exhibit a reduced synthesis rate compared to the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10A-B</xref>).</p>

<p>Compared to their hosts and other genes, snoRNAs were, as expected, relatively stable in both KD and control conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>), while the intronic regions exhibited high turnover. When comparing <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD to the control GapmeRs, a slight increase in the synthesis rates of different parts of SNHGs was observed. The snoRNA half-life is difficult to measure accurately due to their relative stability and their short length, which means that the number of incorporated 4sU that can be detected is much lower than that in longer transcripts. With these caveats in mind, there appeared to be a relative increase in snoRNA stability compared to a reduction observed in other genes and other parts of the SNHGs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>). Altogether, this indicates that the snoRNA level increase driven by <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> knockdown is primarily due to the increased transcription of their hosts, with a possible additional component of relative stabilization.</p>

<title><italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> loss affects cell proliferation and invasion</title>
<p>Lastly, we aimed to assess the phenotypic consequences of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> loss. As mentioned above, the genes affected by the KD were found to be enriched for GO terms related to cell adhesion, movement and division (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Thus, we measured cell migration and proliferation by performing wound healing and cell counting assays in cells with reduced <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> levels. Cells transfected with <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> targeting GapmeRs exhibited significantly higher migration rates, compared to controls (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>), with cells bordering the wounded region displaying a flattened and translucent morphology (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). This higher migration is not due to higher cellular proliferation/division, as cells with reduced lncRNA levels proliferate less (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>), and this deficiency could be rescued by co-transfecting a vector encoding the GapmeR- resistant, full-length <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>), suggesting that this modulation takes place in <italic>trans</italic>. Taken together, these findings suggest that proper <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> expression is required for cellular proliferation, whereas its deficiency results in the onset of more aggressive and migratory behavior, likely linked to the increase of the gene signature of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We show here that the <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> gene locus harbors a pleiotropic gene that, within a single biological system—MCF-7 breast cancer cells—performs diverse functions. At the site of its own transcription, which overlaps a strong TAD boundary, <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> is required to maintain expression of several adjacent genes, regulated at the level of transcription. Strikingly, the promoter of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> ranks in the 99.8th percentile of the strongest TAD boundaries in human H1 embryonic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. It features several CTCF binding sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), and in MCF-7 cells, we demonstrate that it blocks the propagation of the 4C signal between the two flanking TADSs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Future studies will help elucidate how <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> transcription and/or the RNA product regulate this boundary. So far, we found that <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> did not affect CTCF binding to the boundary, and while some peaks in the vicinity of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> were significantly affected by its loss, they did not appear to be found near genes that were dysregulated by its KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10C</xref>). We also found that KD of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>—which depletes the RNA product, but may also affect the nascent RNA transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>—reduces the spatial contacts between the TAD boundary and the <italic>EPB41L4A</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Further elucidation of the exact functional entity needed for the <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulation will require detailed genetic perturbations of the locus, that are difficult to carry out in the polypoid MCF-7 cells, without affecting other functional elements of this locus or cell survival as we were unable to generate deletion clones despite several attempts.</p>
<p>Beyond its site of transcription, <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> associates with SUB1, an abundant protein linked to various functions, and these two players are required for proper distribution of various nuclear proteins. Their dysregulation results in large-scale changes in gene expression, including up-regulation of snoRNA expression, mostly through increased transcription of their hosts, and possibly through a somewhat impaired snoRNA processing and/or stability. Several features of the response to <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> resemble nucleolar stress, including altered distribution of NPM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. SUB1 was shown to be involved in many nuclear processes, including transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, DNA damage response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, telomere maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, and nucleolar processes including rRNA biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Our results suggest a complex and multi-faceted relationship between <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> and SUB1, as SUB1 mRNA levels are reduced by the lncRNA KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), the distribution of the protein in the nucleus is altered (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>), while the protein is the most prominent binder of the mature <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> in ENCODE eCLIP data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The most prominent connection between <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> and SUB1 is the similar phenotype triggered by their loss (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). It is difficult to determine which of the connections between these two genes is the most functionally relevant and which may be indirect and/or feedback interactions. For example, it is possible that <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> primarily acts as a transcriptional regulator of <italic>SUB1</italic> mRNA or that its RNA product is required for proper stability and/or localization of the SUB1 protein or that <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> acts as a scaffold for the formation of protein-protein interactions of SUB1.</p>
<p>In the context of cancer, a systematic study of TCGA data, which is consistent with our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>) found that <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> is downregulated in tumors compared to tumor-adjacent normal tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, in accordance with both the downregulation of the TIGA1 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and the reduction in the <italic>SNORA13</italic>-guided rRNA modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The association with poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> is consistent with the observed increased invasiveness that we find in MCF-7 cells. Effects of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> on migration were also reported in colorectal cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Several recent studies have described the functions of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> in various biological systems, highlighting its dysregulation in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Both p53 and PGC-1α were shown to act upstream of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> and regulate its expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In these different systems, different pathways were described as regulated by this lncRNA, including glycolysis, glutamine metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, it was reported that this lncRNA regulates gene expression via its association with and upregulation of KAT2A (GCN5/GNC5L2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. These prior studies generally relied on candidate-gene or co-expression approaches to identify the genes regulated by <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>, and did not systematically examine its <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting effects, with the exception of a <italic>cis</italic>- acting regulation, that was briefly hinted in a preprint posted four years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>, but not published so far to the best of our knowledge. These studies also did not systematically investigate the <italic>trans</italic>-regulated targets of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>, did not separately deplete the nascent and the mature forms of the lncRNA, and did not attempt to decouple its functions from those of <italic>SNORA13</italic>.</p>
<p>A recent study found that <italic>SNORA13</italic> negatively regulates ribosome biogenesis in immortalized human fibroblasts, by decreasing the incorporation of RPL23 into the maturing 60S ribosomal subunits, eventually triggering p53-mediated cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In their experimental setting, <italic>SNORA13</italic> was constitutively reduced by either CRISPRi of the <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> locus for 7 days or its KO leaving the lncRNA sequence expression unaltered, whereas our approach relies solely on transient knockdown for 48–72hrs that does not appreciably affect <italic>SNORA13</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>), or the levels of the RNA modification that it guides (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Therefore, while both studies implicate <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> in nucleolar biology and its perturbation in nucleolar stress, there is an apparent discrepancy between our results on the role that <italic>SNORA13</italic> plays. In our hands, the differential expression of snoRNAs and cell proliferation can be rescued by expression of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> with the snoRNA, and not by separate expression of <italic>SNORA13</italic>, suggesting the snoRNA is not playing a central role in the observed phenotypes. Also, the study by Cheng et al. showed that activity of the p53 pathway was less active in <italic>SNORA13</italic> knockout cells, with or without induction of oncogenic stress, whereas we see an opposite trend of some up-regulation of the p53 pathway upon transient <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig. S10D</xref>). We cannot however completely rule out potential contributions of this snoRNA to the phenotypes observed in this study. For instance, the phenotype of snoRNAs expression is partially rescued by <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> overexpression in <italic>trans</italic> only when a full-length, unspliced and <italic>SNORA13</italic>-containing vector is used, and not when the snoRNA is deleted, mutated or expressed alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). This would suggest that the processing of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic> is involved in its mode of action, although further experiments will be needed to address whether <italic>SNORA13</italic> or its DNA sequence are indeed required to regulate the expression of the snoRNAs. We note that compensatory effects are possible in cells that grow for extended periods of time without <italic>SNORA13</italic>.</p>

We therefore sought such lncRNA-target pairs using the GeneHancer database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> that connects between regulatory elements and their targets by combining tissue co-expression data, ChIP-seq of enhancer-enriched histone modifications and transcription factor binding, Hi-C data and eQTLs within putative enhancer regions.

<title>UMI Circular Chromosome Conformation Capture (UMI-4C)</title>
<p>Quantitative UMI-4C was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, with minor modifications. An equal amount of 3C template (5-10 µg) for each sample/replicate was diluted to a final volume of 200 µL with Elution Buffer and sonicated to an extent the fragments size ranges between 250 and 1000bp. To the sonicated fragments, 20 µL of 10X End-Repair Buffer (NEB) and 10 µL of End Repair Mix (NEB) were added and the samples were incubated for 30’ at 20°C, after which they were cleaned with 2.2X Sera-Mag Selection Beads and eluted in 78 µL 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. To 76 µL of the cleaned DNA, 10 µL 10X NEBuffer 2, 10 µL 10 mM dATP, and 4 µL Klenow (3’-5’ exo, NEB) were added, and the reaction was incubated for 30’ at 37°C. After this, the enzymes were inactivated by incubating the samples for 20’ at 75°C, then 2 µL of FastCIP (NEB) were added and the reactions were further incubated for 1 h at 50°C, followed by purification with 2X Sera-Mag Size Selection Beads and elution in 67 µL of 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Illumina-compatible adapters were ligated by adding 80 µL Quick Ligase Buffer (NEB), 10 µL Quick Ligase (NEB) and 4 µL of 15µM Y-Shaped Adaptors (IDT) to 66 µL of the eluted DNA from the previous step, followed by an incubation at 25°C for 15’. After that, the samples were denatured for 2’ at 95°C, placed on ice, brought to volume by adding 160 µL of nuclease- free H<sub>2</sub>O, cleaned with 1X Sera-Mag Size Selection Beads and eluted in 40 µL 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. To quantify the resulting 4C template, 1 µL was diluted in 4 µL of 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, denatured for 5’ at 95°C, placed on ice and analyzed by ssDNA Qubit.</p>
<p>Libraries were then prepared using a nested PCR approach, preparing five reactions for each sample and employing three bait primers for each target (EPB41L4A-AS1 TSS, EPB41L4A TSS, STARD4 TSS, see next for design criteria) to increase complexity of the 4C profiles. For the first PCR (PCR1), upstream bait primers were designed close (&lt;80-85 bp) to a DpnII restriction site (hg19 genome build); for the second PCR (PCR2), the downstream bait primers were designed to follow – but not overlap – the upstream ones, ending ideally &lt;20bp from the DpnII site (“pad” sequence), and containing a sequence consisting of the Universal Illumina P5 on their 5’ end. Both primers were designed to have a standard annealing temperature of ∼60°C, and their sequences are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table5">Table S5</xref>. PCR1 consisted of 200 ng of 4C template, 10 µL of 10X Phusion Buffer (NEB), 1 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 2.5 µL of pooled upstream bait primers with a final concentration of 10 µM, 2.5 µL of 10 µM Universal Illumina P7 primer, 0.5 µL Phusion Polymerase (NEB), and nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O up to a final volume of 50 µL. The reactions were incubated for 30’’ at 98°C, amplified with 20 cycles consisting of 10’’ at 98°C, 30’’ at 56°C and 60’’ at 72°C, with a final extension of 10’ at 72°C, individually purified with 0.8X Sera-Mag Size Selection Beads and eluted in 20 µL of 10 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.0. PCR2 consisted of 15 µL of purified template from PCR1, 10 µL of 10X Phusion Buffer (NEB), 1 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 2.5 µL of pooled downstream bait primers with a final concentration of 10 µM, 2.5 µL of 10µM Universal Illumina P7 primer, 0.5 µL Phusion Polymerase (NEB), and nuclease-free H<sub>2</sub>O up to a final volume of 50 µL. The reactions were incubated with the same program of PCR1 but with 18 cycles of amplification instead of 20, all five replicates of each sample were then pooled together, purified with 0.8X Sera-Mag Size Selection Beads and eluted in 40 µL of Elution Buffer. The libraries were then quality-checked by both dsDNA Qubit and Tapestation, and eventually pooled according to the relative number of reads needed. All libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument, aiming at ∼5M reads per sample.</p>

<title>UMI-4C Data Analysis</title>
<p>To analyze the UMI-4C data we have employed the umi4cpackage R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tanaylab/umi4cpackage">https://github.com/tanaylab/umi4cpackage</ext-link>). After setting up the configuration file as described, they were loaded with the <italic>p4cLoadConfFiles</italic> function, and the raw fastq files were analyzed using the <italic>p4cCreate4CseqTrack</italic> function. The 4C profiles were then built and plotted using the <italic>p4cNewProfile</italic> and plot functions, respectively, specifying the <italic>cis</italic> window and overlaying two profiles when needed. The p-values and log<sub>2</sub>FC between conditions and across a genomic region of interest were finally calculated using the <italic>p4cIntervalsMean</italic> function.</p>

<title>Metabolic labeling, SLAM-seq and data analysis</title>
<p>For half-life and synthesis rate estimation upon the KD of <italic>EPB41L4A-AS1</italic>, cells were transfected with control and targeting GapmeRs as described above. Metabolic labeling and SLAM-seq were then performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>, with minor modifications. All steps were performed in the dark until the chemical conversion with iodoacetamide (IAA). After 48h hours, the growth medium was replaced with fresh media supplemented with 500 µM 4-Thiouridine (4sU, Sigma), and replaced again with fresh 4sU after every time point. In total, we collected RNA from cells at time 0 (unlabeled), and after 4, 8 and 24h hours post-4sU addition. RNA extraction was carried out as described above with the addition of DTT (0.1 mM final concentration) to keep the samples under reducing conditions, and IAA conversion was performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. Ribosomal RNAs were then depleted using the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit V2 (NEB) and libraries were generated with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional Library Kit (NEB), both according the manufacturer’s instructions. Estimation of half-lives and synthesis rates was performed using GRAND-SLAM/grandR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>, and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table4">Table S4</xref>. Notably, the estimation assumes steady state expression in control samples, but not in the KD ones.</p>

<p>Monziani and Ulitsky present a large and exhaustive study on the lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 using a variety of genomic methods. They uncover a rather complex picture of an RNA transcript that appears to act via diverse pathways to regulate the expression of large numbers of genes, including many snoRNAs. The activity of EPB41L4A-AS1 seems to be intimately linked with the protein SUB1, via both direct physical interactions and direct/indirect of SUB1 mRNA expression.</p>
<p>The study is characterised by thoughtful, innovative, integrative genomic analysis. It is shown that EPB41L4A-AS1 interacts with SUB1 protein and that this may lead to extensive changes in SUB1's other RNA partners. Disruption of EPB41L4A-AS1 leads to widespread changes in non-polyA RNA expression, as well as local cis changes. At the clinical level, it is possible that EPB41L4A-AS1 plays disease-relevant roles, although these seem to be somewhat contradictory with evidence supporting both oncogenic and tumour suppressive activities.</p>
<p>A couple of issues could be better addressed here. Firstly, the copy number of EPB41L4A-AS1 is an important missing piece of the puzzle. It is apparently highly expressed in the FISH experiments. To get an understanding of how EPB41L4A-AS1 regulates SUB1, an abundant protein, we need to know the relative stoichiometry of these two factors. Secondly, while many of the experiments use two independent Gapmers for EPB41L4A-AS1 knockdown, the RNA-sequencing experiments apparently use just one, with one negative control (?). Evidence is emerging that Gapmers produce extensive off-target gene expression effects in cells, potentially exceeding the amount of on-target changes arising through the intended target gene. Therefore, it is important to estimate this through the use of multiple targeting and non-targeting ASOs, if one is to get a true picture of EPB41L4A-AS1 target genes. In this Reviewer's opinion, this casts some doubt over the interpretation of RNA-seq experiments until that work is done. Nonetheless, the Authors have designed thorough experiments, including overexpression rescue constructs, to quite confidently assess the role of EPB41L4A-AS1 in snoRNA expression.</p>
<p>It is possible that EPB41L4A-AS1 plays roles in cancer, either as an oncogene or a tumour suppressor. However, it will in the future be important to extend these observations to a greater variety of cell contexts.</p>
<p>This work is valuable in providing an extensive and thorough analysis of the global mechanisms of an important regulatory lncRNA and highlights the complexity of such mechanisms via cis and trans regulation and extensive protein interactions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Monziani et al. identified long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that act in cis and are coregulated with their target genes located in close genomic proximity. The authors mined the GeneHancer database, and this analysis led to the identification of four lncRNA-target pairs. The authors decided to focus on lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1.</p>
<p>They thoroughly characterised this lncRNA, demonstrating that it is located in the cytoplasm and the nuclei, and that its expression is altered in response to different stimuli. Furthermore, the authors showed that EPB41L4A-AS1 regulates EPB41L4A transcription, leading to a mild reduction in EPB41L4A protein levels. This was not recapitulated with siRNA-mediated depletion of EPB41L4AAS1. RNA-seq in EPB41L4A-AS1-depleted cells with single LNA revealed 2364 DEGs linked to pathways including the cell cycle, cell adhesion, and inflammatory response. To understand the mechanism of action of EPB41L4A-AS1, the authors mined the ENCODE eCLIP data and identified SUB1 as an lncRNA interactor. The authors also found that the loss of EPB41L4A-AS1 and SUB1 leads to the accumulation of snoRNAs, and that SUB1 localisation changes upon the loss of EPB41L4A-AS1. Finally, the authors showed that EPB41L4A-AS1 deficiency did not change the steady-state levels of SNORA13 nor RNA modification driven by this RNA. The phenotype associated with the loss of EPB41L4A-AS1 is linked to increased invasion and EMT gene signature.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting and nicely done study on the versatile role of EPB41L4A-AS1 and the multifaceted interplay between SUB1 and this lncRNA, but some conclusions and claims need to be supported with additional experiments. My primary concerns are using a single LNA gapmer for critical experiments, increased invasion, and nucleolar distribution of SUB1- in EPB41L4A-AS1-depleted cells. These experiments need to be validated with orthogonal methods.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used complementary tools to dissect the complex role of lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 in regulating EPB41L4A, which is highly commendable. There are few papers in the literature on lncRNAs at this standard. They employed LNA gapmers, siRNAs, CRISPRi/a, and exogenous overexpression of EPB41L4A-AS1 to demonstrate that the transcription of EPB41L4A-AS1 acts in cis to promote the expression of EPB41L4A by ensuring spatial proximity between the TAD boundary and the EPB41L4A promoter. At the same time, this lncRNA binds to SUB1 and regulates snoRNA expression and nucleolar biology. Overall, the manuscript is easy to read, and the figures are well presented. The methods are sound, and the expected standards are met.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors should clarify how many lncRNA-target pairs were included in the initial computational screen for cis-acting lncRNAs and why MCF7 was chosen as the cell line of choice. Most of the data uses a single LNA gapmer targeting EPB41L4A-AS1 lncRNA (eg, Fig. 2c, 3B, and RNA-seq), and the critical experiments should be using at least 2 LNA gapmers. The specificity of SUB1 CUT&amp;RUN is lacking, as well as direct binding of SUB1 to lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1, which should be confirmed by CLIP qPCR in MCF7 cells. Finally, the role of EPB41L4A-AS1 in SUB1 distribution (Figure 5) and cell invasion (Figure 8) needs to be complemented with additional experiments, which should finally demonstrate the role of this lncRNA in nucleolus and cancer-associated pathways. The use of MCF7 as a single cancer cell line is not ideal.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors made some interesting observations that EPB41L4A-AS1 lncRNA can regulate the transcription of both the nearby coding gene and genes on other chromosomes. They started by computationally examining lncRNA-gene pairs by analyzing co-expression, chromatin features of enhancers, TF binding, HiC connectome, and eQTLs. They then zoomed in on four pairs of lncRNA-gene pairs and used LNA antisense oligonucleotides to knock down these lncRNAs. This revealed EPB41L4A-AS1 as the only one that can regulate the expression of its cis-gene target EPB41L4A. By RNA-FISH, the authors found this lncRNA to be located in all three parts of a cell: chromatin, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm. RNA-seq after LNA knockdown of EPB41L4A-AS1 showed that this increased &gt;1100 genes and decreased &gt;1250 genes, including both nearby genes and genes on other chromosomes. They later found that EPB41L4A-AS1 may interact with SUB1 protein (an RNA-binding protein) to impact the target genes of SUB1. EPB41L4A-AS1 knockdown reduced the mRNA level of SUB1 and altered the nuclear location of SUB1. Later, the authors observed that EPB41L4A-AS1 knockdown caused an increase of snRNAs and snoRNAs, likely via disrupted SUB1 function. In the last part of the paper, the authors conducted rescue experiments that suggested that the full-length, intron- and SNORA13-containing EPB41L4A-AS1 is required to partially rescue snoRNA expression. They also conducted SLAM-Seq and showed that the increased abundance of snoRNAs is primarily due to their hosts' increased transcription and stability. They end with data showing that EPB41L4A-AS1 knockdown reduced MCF7 cell proliferation but increased its migration, suggesting a link to breast cancer progression and/or metastasis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the paper is well-written, and the results are presented with good technical rigor and appropriate interpretation. The observation that a complex lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 regulates both cis and trans target genes, if fully proven, is interesting and important.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper is a bit disjointed as it started from cis and trans gene regulation, but later it switched to a partially relevant topic of snoRNA metabolism via SUB1. The paper did not follow up on the interesting observation that there are many potential trans target genes affected by EPB41L4A-AS1 knockdown and there was limited study of the mechanisms as to how these trans genes (including SUB1 or NPM1 genes themselves) are affected by EPB41L4A-AS1 knockdown. There are discrepancies in the results upon EPB41L4A-AS1 knockdown by LNA versus by CRISPR activation, or by plasmid overexpression of this lncRNA.</p>
