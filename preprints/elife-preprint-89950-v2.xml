<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Hearing involves analyzing the physical attributes of sounds and integrating the results of this analysis with other sensory, cognitive and motor variables in order to guide adaptive behavior. The auditory cortex is considered crucial for the integration of acoustic and contextual information and is thought to share the resulting representations with subcortical auditory structures via its vast descending projections. By imaging cellular activity in the corticorecipient shell of the inferior colliculus of mice engaged in a sound detection task, we show that the majority of neurons encode information beyond the physical attributes of the stimulus and that the animals’ behavior can be decoded from the activity of those neurons with a high degree of accuracy. Surprisingly, this was also the case in mice in which auditory cortical input to the midbrain had been removed by bilateral cortical lesions. This illustrates that subcortical auditory structures have access to a wealth of non-acoustic information and can, independently of the auditory cortex, carry much richer neural representations than previously thought.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Classically, perception is considered to rely on the flow of information from the sensory periphery via a sequence of hierarchically-organized brain structures up to the cortex. The ascending sensory pathways connecting these structures have been studied extensively and much has been learned about how signals are relayed, how features are extracted, and how information is integrated to produce increasingly abstract representations of the sensory environment. These pathways are paralleled by descending pathways that can feed information back to lower-order sensory structures. The fact that descending projections often outnumber their feedforward counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sherman, 2007</xref>) attests to their likely importance for brain function. This may include turning an otherwise passive, stimulus-driven device into an active and adaptive brain that is capable of processing sensory input within its behavioral context and, therefore, able to learn and create meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kraus and White-Schwoch, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Malmierca, Anderson and Antunes, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The descending projections of the auditory cortex target all major subcortical stations of the auditory pathway and are among the largest pathways of the brain (Winer, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bajo and King, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Antunes and Malmierca, 2021</xref>), making them a particularly suitable system for investigating the behavioral and physiological consequences of corticofugal processing. One of their main targets is the inferior colliculus (IC), an obligatory midbrain relay for nearly all ascending auditory input. The corticocollicular projection primarily terminates in the non-lemniscal shell of the IC. The shell encapsulates and is extensively connected with the central nucleus of the IC, which forms part of the tonotopically organized core or lemniscal auditory pathway to the primary auditory cortex. The projection from the auditory cortex to the midbrain was identified almost a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mettler 1935</xref>) and decades of research have since demonstrated that manipulating the activity of descending projection neurons can alter the collicular representations of multiple sound features, influence adaptive plasticity and perceptual learning, and even trigger an innate flight response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Suga 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nakamoto et al 2008</xref>; Bajo et al 2010; Xion et al 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blackwell et al 2020</xref>). However, experimental evidence, especially from behaving animals, that could help explain what information the auditory midbrain and other subcortical sensory structures rely on their cortical input for is still very limited.</p>
<p>Interactions between different sensory pathways occur at multiple processing levels and they are also closely linked with the brain’s motor centers and neuromodulatory regions. Indeed, recordings in awake animals have shown that behavior, cognition and brain state can strongly influence activity in the sensory pathways (Schneider and Mooney, 2018; McCormick et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Parker et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with a hierarchical view of sensory processing in which neurons at higher levels carry progressively more complex representations of the world, such contextual influences appear particularly strong in the cortex (Stringer et al,. 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Musall et al., 2019</xref>) and may to a large extent be the result of intracortical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Noudoost et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, non-acoustic and contextual variables can also alter sensory processing at subcortical levels, including the IC and particularly its shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Metzger et al., 2006</xref>; Gruters and Groh, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen and Song, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Parras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Saderi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shaheen et al., 2021</xref>). This raises the possibility that these context-dependent effects may be inherited from the auditory cortex.</p>
<p>To test whether auditory midbrain neurons convey behaviorally-relevant signals that depend on descending cortical inputs, we imaged corticorecipient IC shell neurons in mice engaged in a sound detection task. We found that the activity of most neurons contained information beyond the physical attributes of the sound and that this information could be used to decode the animals’ behavior with a high degree of accuracy. Surprisingly, this was the case both in mice with an intact cortex and those in which the auditory cortex had been lesioned. These findings suggest that subcortical auditory structures have access to a wealth of non-auditory information independently of descending inputs from the auditory cortex. Consequently, the contextually-enriched representations that are characteristic of sensory cortices can arise from subcortical processing.</p>

<title>Transient suppression of the auditory cortex impairs sound detection</title>
<p>Our aim was to characterize the activity of neurons in the shell of the IC in animals engaged in sound-guided behavior and assess how this activity is influenced by the input from the auditory cortex. To this end, we trained water-regulated mice on a sound detection task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) in which they were rewarded with a drop of water for licking in response to a click sound. Transient pharmacological silencing of auditory cortex using the GABA-A agonist muscimol has been shown to abolish the ability of rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Talwar et al., 2001</xref>), including head-fixed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2017</xref>), to perform a sound detection task, making this approach unsuitable for our aim of exploring the role of IC during behavior. We found that optogenetic suppression of cortical activity by photoactivating ChR2-expressing inhibitory neurons in <italic>GAD2-IRES-cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lohse et al., 2020</xref>) also significantly impaired sound detection performance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>), albeit not to the same degree as pharmacological silencing. Although a control group in which the auditory cortex was injected with an EYFP virus lacking ChR2 would be required to confirm that the altered behavior results from an opsin-dependent perturbation of cortical activity, this result shows that this manipulation is also unsuitable for this study as it would leave us unable to determine whether any changes in the activity of IC neurons arise from removal of their auditory cortical input or are a consequence of alterations in the animals’ behavior.</p>

<title>Auditory cortex lesions leave detection ability intact</title>
<p>Several recent studies have shown that in contrast to the disruptive effects of transient silencing, cortical lesions leave performance in some sensory tasks intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ceballo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">O’Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>). In order to assess how auditory cortex lesions impact sound detection performance, we therefore compared the performance of mice with bilateral lesions of the auditory cortex (n = 7) with non-lesioned controls (n = 9).</p>
<p>Most corticocollicular neurons project ipsilaterally, with a substantial proportion also sending axons to the contralateral midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stebbings et al., 2014</xref>). The majority of corticocollicular neurons are found in the temporal cortex, and overwhelmingly in the auditory fields, while a small fraction populates adjacent areas, such as the temporal association area (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1</xref>). After the experiments, we injected a retrogradely-transported viral tracer (rAAV2-retro-tdTomato) into the right IC to determine whether any corticocollicular neurons remained after the auditory cortex lesions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 3</xref>). The presence of retrogradely-labeled corticocollicular neurons in non-temporal cortical areas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) was not the result of viral leakage from the dorsal IC injection sites into the superior colliculus (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>

This causes transsynaptic delivery of the virus to the IC and expression of GCaMP6f in corticorecipient IC neurons. Several weeks later, the mice underwent bilateral lesioning of auditory cortex either by aspiration or by thermocoagulation (see <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 2</xref> for histological sections from a mouse that underwent thermocoagulation) and were implanted with a glass window over the right auditory cortex. Following recovery from this procedure, water access was restricted and, 2-3 days later, behavioral training and imaging commenced. After data collection had been completed, rAAV2-retro-tdTomato was injected in the dorsal IC in order to label corticocollicular neurons that had remained intact.

<p>The ability of the mice to learn and perform the click detection task was evident in increasing hit rates and decreasing false alarm rates across training days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, p &lt; 0.01, mixed-design ANOVAs). There was no difference between lesioned and non-lesioned mice in their learning speed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, p &gt; 0.05, mixed-design ANOVAs) or psychometric functions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, p &gt; 0.05, mixed-design ANOVA). Cortical lesioning thus leaves behavioral sensitivity to clicks intact and therefore provides a means of examining the effects of removing corticocollicular input, albeit non-reversibly, without directly affecting sound detection performance.</p>

<title>Transsynaptic labeling and two-photon calcium imaging of auditory corticorecipient IC neurons</title>
<p>Manipulations of auditory cortical activity can influence the activity of neurons throughout the IC, including the central nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Suga 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nakamoto et al., 2008</xref>), where corticocollicular axons are relatively sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stebbings et al 2014</xref>). The strongest effects, however, tend to be observed in the shell, where cortical input is densest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nakamoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Vila et al 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blackwell et al., 2020</xref>). But even here, effects can be subtle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Vila et al., 2019</xref>) or undetectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blackwell et al., 2020</xref>), especially for cortical silencing. It is also unclear whether the IC neurons recorded in these studies receive cortical input or not. Therefore, we took a projection-specific approach to record the activity of IC neurons that receive direct input from the auditory cortex. More specifically, we injected AAV1.hSyn.Cre.WPRE, a virus with anterograde transsynaptic spread properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>), into the right auditory cortex of, initially, a tdTomato (Ai9) reporter mouse. This resulted in the expression of Cre recombinase and the reporter gene in neurons that receive input from the auditory cortex, including the corticorecipient neurons of the IC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). By employing this approach in GCaMP6f (Ai95D) reporter mice, we could target the expression of a calcium indicator to corticorecipient IC neurons. We then proceeded to record the activity of corticorecipient neurons within about 150 µm of the dorsal surface of the IC using two-photon microscopy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Video 1).</p>

<title>Corticorecipient IC neurons display heterogeneous response profiles</title>
<p>The activity of individual corticorecipient IC neurons showed distinct response profiles across neurons and trial outcomes (hit vs miss) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). While averaging across all neurons cannot capture the diversity of responses, the averaged response profiles suggest that it is mostly trial outcome rather than the acoustic stimulus and neuronal sensitivity to sound level that shapes those responses (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, close to half (1272 / 2649) of all neurons showed a statistically significant difference in response magnitude between hit and miss trials, while only a small fraction (97 / 2649) exhibited a significant response to the sound. While the number of sound-responsive neurons is low, it is not necessarily surprising given the moderate intensity and very short duration of the stimuli. For comparison: Using the same transgenics, labeling approach and imaging setup and presenting 200-ms long pure tones at 60 dB SPL with frequencies between 2 kHz and 64 kHz, we typically find that between a quarter and a third of neurons in a given imaging area exhibit a statistically significant response (data not shown).</p>
<p>To capture the heterogeneity of response patterns across all recorded neurons, we used an unsupervised clustering algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Namboodiri et al. 2019</xref>) to group the average responses on hit and miss trials for each neuron. This yielded 10 clusters that displayed different response patterns over the course of the trial (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Most of the clusters exhibited distinct activity for hit vs miss trials. Some hit trial profiles were characterized by increases or decreases in activity, with a very sharp, short-latency onset, as in clusters 4 and 10 (see <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 - figure supplement 1</xref> for a scaled version of cluster 10), and others by much more gradual changes in which a peak occurred seconds after the trial onset, as in clusters 5 and 9. Cluster 3, which contained the smallest number of neurons, was an exception in that it showed a transient, short latency response to the stimulus for both trial outcomes. The response profiles of some other clusters, especially clusters 6 and 8, were also qualitatively similar across hit and miss trials and/or only weakly modulated across both trial types.</p>

<p>This suggests that the activity of the majority of neurons in the recorded population contained information beyond the physical properties of the stimulus. Given that licking causes self-generated sounds, IC neurons could, in principle, respond to the sound of licking. However, given how quiet these are - estimated to be just 12 dB SPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Singla et al., 2017</xref>) - and that much of the response to such lick-related sounds is already canceled out at the level of the cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Singla et al., 2017</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shaheen et al., 2021</xref>), it is highly unlikely that lick-related sounds play a major role in driving activity in the IC.</p>
<p>To assess whether certain response profiles depended on auditory cortical input, we compared the ratio of neurons from lesioned vs non-lesioned mice in each cluster to that of the overall recorded population. The number of recorded neurons was unequal for lesioned and non-lesioned mice (952 vs 1697, respectively), reflecting the fact that a greater proportion of imaging sessions in non-lesioned animals were carried out using a larger field of view, which contained larger numbers of neurons (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 - figure supplement 2</xref>). To account for this, the percentages shown on the pie charts were normalized to the ratio in the overall population (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Neurons from both groups were well represented across all 10 clusters and while a significant difference in the lesioned/non-lesioned ratio was found for four clusters, the difference between the groups was greater than 20% for only one of them. Furthermore, there was a close correspondence between the cluster averages of lesioned and non-lesioned mice (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests that the IC shell can produce very similar output regardless of whether auditory cortical input is available or not.</p>

<title>Behavior can be accurately decoded from neural activity in lesioned and non-lesioned mice</title>
<p>The average responses of individual neurons in the IC shell exhibited a variety of activity patterns associated with both the stimulus and the trial outcome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>). To gain insight into how these activity patterns can be read out collectively on a trial-by-trial basis, we assessed the relationship between the trial-by-trial network activity and the trial outcome. We trained logistic regression models to classify hit vs miss trials on a trial-by-trial, frame-by-frame basis. As different populations of neurons were recorded in different imaging sessions, the models were trained separately for each session. “Dummy models”, which randomly classified trials while taking into account the probability of hit vs miss trials in a given session, were used as the baseline model performance. If the population activity of the IC shell contained information about the trial outcome, the performance of the models would be significantly above baseline.</p>
<p>In both lesioned and non-lesioned mice, the average model performance was significantly above baseline in classifying hit vs miss trials (p &lt; 0.05, one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test or paired t-test with Bonferroni correction, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), showed a temporal profile that is consistent with the dynamics of the activity profiles of some of the clusters, in particular clusters 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>), and was not meaningfully affected by differences in sound level distributions between hit and miss trials (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 1</xref>) Additionally, the model performance in non-lesioned mice was significantly better than that in lesioned mice (p &lt; 0.05, one-sided Mann-Whitney U test or t-test with Bonferroni correction, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

<p>By examining the corticocollicular labeling and referencing the histological sections against a mouse brain atlas (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001), we categorized the mice according to lesion size. Four of the seven lesioned animals had “(near-)complete” lesions, meaning that all (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) or an estimated ∼95% (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 2</xref>) of the auditory cortex had been lesioned, while the remaining mice had “partial” lesions, with an estimated 15% - 25% of the auditory cortex left intact. To assess whether the size of the lesions impacted the decoding performance, we compared the model performance between mice that had (near-)complete lesions and mice that had partial lesions. This revealed that the average decoding performance for mice with (near-)complete lesions was significantly better than that measured for mice with partial lesions. While this pattern of results may be unexpected, it is consistent with work showing smaller lesions being associated with greater somatosensory processing deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the decoding performance in mice with (near-)complete lesions was largely indistinguishable from that in mice with an intact auditory cortex. Although the proportion of individual neurons with distinct response magnitudes in hit and miss trials in lesioned mice did not differ from that in non-lesioned mice, it was significantly lower when separating out mice with partial lesions (<xref rid="fig6s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 3</xref>). These results imply that the activity of IC shell neurons can contain similar amounts of information about the animal’s behavior regardless of whether descending input from the cortex is available or not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

<title>Pre-stimulus activity is predictive of the upcoming trial outcome</title>
<p>Remarkably, decoding accuracy was better than baseline even before stimulus onset. This could reflect changes in the network state that led or contributed to the upcoming trial outcome. For instance, changes in arousal or motivation can alter both the probability that an upcoming stimulus is detected and the activity of neurons in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>). The decoding models might detect such changes in activity, resulting in higher decoding accuracy prior to stimulus onset. Additionally, pre-stimulus differences in hit and miss trial activity could also reflect the anticipation of an upcoming stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ruth et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nienhuis and Olds, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Metzger et al., 2006</xref>) and the resulting change in attentional state. Inter-trial intervals in our experiments were randomly drawn from a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation of 8 s and 2 s, respectively, and a lower bound of 3 s. Nevertheless, spontaneous licks did not occur at random times during the peri-catch trial periods following hit trials. Instead, average lick rates approximated the inter-trial interval distribution (<xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 - figure supplement 4A-D</xref>), suggesting that mice learned to adapt their behavior to this distribution and anticipate the timing of upcoming stimuli (<xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 - figure supplement 4E,F</xref>). Assuming that successfully anticipating the timing of an upcoming stimulus confers a greater chance of detecting the stimulus, neurons whose activity reflects that anticipation might be expected to show differences in pre-trial activity between hit and miss trials that could be detected by a decoding model. Note that for the analysis illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, hit trials were excluded if there were any licks between -500 ms and +120 ms (the latter number representing the lower bound of the animals’ lick-latency) relative to stimulus onset, suggesting that changes in pre-stimulus activity cannot be directly related to licking.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Imaging auditory corticorecipient neurons in the dorsal shell of the IC in mice trained to perform a sound detection task revealed that the majority of neurons exhibited distinct activity profiles for hit and miss trials, implying that they encode information beyond just the physical attributes of the stimulus. Indeed, using logistic regression models to classify hit vs miss trials, we found that the animals’ behavioral choice can be read out from these neurons with a high degree of accuracy. Importantly, the difference in IC activity between hit and miss trials was observed across different sound levels and was not due to a difference in the sound level distribution for these two trial outcomes. Surprisingly, neural activity profiles and the decoding performance were similar in mice in which the auditory cortex had been lesioned bilaterally, suggesting that the midbrain has, independently of the auditory cortex, access to a wealth of non-acoustic information, which may be sufficient to support sound detection behavior.</p>
<p>Auditory corticocollicular axons terminate predominantly in the shell of the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stebbings et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bajo and King, 2013</xref>) and the strongest effects of cortical manipulations have been reported in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nakamoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Vila et al 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blackwell et al., 2020</xref>). However, these effects can be subtle (Cruces-Solis et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Vila et al., 2019</xref>) or undetectable, especially when optogenetic silencing is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blackwell et al., 2020</xref>). Because of this and uncertainties over exactly what proportion of neurons in the shell of the IC is innervated by the auditory cortex and even where the border lies with the underlying central nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barnstedt et al., 2015</xref>), we used an anterograde transsynaptic tagging approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>) to identify corticorecipient neurons. This therefore maximized the chances of revealing the contribution of descending cortical input to the response properties of these midbrain neurons. We imaged across the optically accessible dorsal surface of the IC down to a depth of about 150 µm below the surface. Consequently, the neurons we recorded were located predominantly in the dorsal cortex. However, identifying the borders between different subdivisions of the IC is not straightforward and we cannot rule out the possibility that some were located in the lateral cortex.</p>

<title>Inferior colliculus neurons exhibit task-related activity</title>
<p>Our recordings from corticorecipient neurons in the IC are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that neural representations of behavioral variables can be found in the auditory midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ruth et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nienhuis and Olds, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Metzger et al., 2006</xref>; Gruters and Groh, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen and Song, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Saderi et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Franceschi and Barkat, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shaheen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Quass et al., 2023</xref>). In keeping with responses recorded in the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Francis et al., 2018</xref>; Franceschi et al., 2021) and IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen and Song 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; Franceschi et al., 2021) of behaving mice, we found that the activity of most neurons was facilitated and about a third were suppressed during the sound detection task. Overall, only a small minority of clusters (mostly cluster 3) in our dataset showed what could be characterized as largely behavior-invariant response profiles to the auditory stimulus. In contrast, a large number of neurons were clearly driven by variables other than the stimulus itself. Their activity may represent the choice (to lick or not to lick) that an animal made, preparatory motor activity, corollary discharge or the reward and the somatosensory or gustatory feedback associated with its consumption, as well as modulation by the animal’s cognitive and behavioral state. Due to the task structure used, for the most part, it was not possible to unambiguously assign activity profiles to a particular variable. Nevertheless, we can speculate that neurons with late transients, such as in cluster 5, are more likely to represent corollary discharge and signals associated with the consumption of the reward, while those with very short latency peaks, as in clusters 4 and 10, may represent the animals’ choice and/or preparatory motor activity.</p>
<p>When engaged in the detection task, an animal’s arousal or motivational state may vary spontaneously or as a result of changes in, for instance, thirst, time of day or time into a session. In addition, cognitive factors, such as expectations about the timing of an upcoming trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ruth et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nienhuis and Olds, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Metzger et al., 2006</xref>), which mice may have derived by learning the shape of the inter-trial interval distribution, may lead to variations in arousal or attentional state. Pre-trial differences in activity as well as the above-chance decoding performance before trial onset likely reflect the joint impact of those state changes on the activity of IC corticorecipient neurons and detection sensitivity (McCormick et al., 2020).</p>

<title>Contribution of the auditory cortex to task-related activity in the midbrain</title>
<p>Given the massive corticofugal projections that exist within the auditory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bajo and King, 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that task-related activity in the IC might depend on descending inputs from the auditory cortex. To address this, we imaged corticorecipient IC neurons during the same sound detection task after removing the cortical input. Consistent with previous work in the auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">O’Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>) and somatosensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hong et al., 2018</xref>), we found that transient optogenetic silencing of the auditory cortex impaired sound detection, whereas cortical lesions had no effect on detection behavior, with lesioned mice learning the task as quickly as non-lesioned animals and achieving the same level of performance. In order to determine whether the absence of auditory cortical input alters the activity of IC neurons during sound detection behavior, we therefore focused on mice with bilateral cortical lesions to avoid the potentially confounding effects that reduced detection sensitivity produced by transient cortical silencing might have on the activity of IC neurons. For the same reason, we opted against the more targeted approach of optogenetic silencing of corticocollicular axons. Furthermore, it would have been difficult to silence the entire corticocollicular projection and the higher light powers required for manipulating axons compared to somata would have risked transmitting light to the cortex or other corticofugal targets, potentially causing behavioral changes and/or sacrificing specificity. Locally silencing corticocollicular axons would also have left indirect transmission via the thalamus between the auditory cortex and IC intact and would have been very challenging to verify. Finally, it has been reported that using optogenetic silencing tools in axons can have unintended consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wiegert et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In keeping with our findings, numerous studies (reviewed in e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pickles, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buser and Imbert, 1992</xref>) have shown that simple auditory skills, including the ability of freely moving rats to detect sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kelly, 1970</xref>), are unaffected by the removal of the auditory cortex. However, transient pharmacological silencing of the auditory cortex in freely moving rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Talwar et al., 2001</xref>), as well as head-fixed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2017</xref>), completely abolishes sound detection (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gimenez et al., 2015</xref>). The time course of the effects produced by muscimol application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Talwar et al 2001</xref>) suggests that there is a relationship between the size of the behavioral deficit and the degree of cortical inactivation. Consequently, milder impairments may be produced by the optogenetic approaches employed by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kato et al 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">O’Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>) because of incomplete suppression of cortical activity. Alternatively, the larger behavioral effects reported following muscimol application may be due to diffusion of the drug to other brain structures, potentially including the IC. Although our results cannot speak directly to the question of whether the preservation of sound detection without auditory cortex reflects a rewiring or repurposing of circuits in the brain, this seems unlikely given that other studies have shown that trained mice achieve pre-lesion performance levels on simple auditory discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ceballo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">O’Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>) or somatosensory detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hong et al., 2018</xref>) tasks suddenly and within 48 hours following cortical ablation.</p>
<p>Why then does transient inactivation produce behavioral deficits? One possibility is that disabling the auditory cortex impacts behavior not because it contributes necessary computations or information, but because of the sudden and disruptive removal of tonic excitation (Oberle et al., 2021) to downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Otchy et al., 2015</xref>) that are indispensable for successful sound detection. In this scenario, normal operation would resume once synaptic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Keck et al., 2013</xref>) had homeostatically restored normal activity in these structures, a process that has been suggested to take up to 48 hours and is consistent with the time course of recovery after lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ceballo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, several circuits may redundantly support sound detection. Silencing the auditory cortex might then transiently impede sound detection until the relevant downstream decision and motor structures have updated their synaptic weights and/or processing has shifted to the other circuits. Two observations, however, argue against this possibility. First, removing one of several redundant structures should leave some residual function intact and not have the devastating effect that pharmacological cortical silencing achieves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Talwar et al., 2001</xref>, Li et a., 2017). Second, other circuits mediating the acousticomotor transformation required for successful sound detection behavior very likely incorporate subcortical auditory structures, including the auditory midbrain. Activity in the IC may trigger actions (Cassedey and Covey, 1996), such as licking, via its direct projections to the superior colliculus, pontine nuclei and the periaqueductal gray (Hufman and Henson, 1990, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wenstrup et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Casseday and Covey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>) or indirectly via its projections to the auditory thalamus. If cortical lesioning results in a greater weight being placed on the activity in spared subcortical circuits for perceptual judgements, we would expect the accuracy with which trial-by-trial outcomes could be read out from IC neurons to be greater in mice without auditory cortex. However, that was not the case. This could imply that, following cortical lesions, greater weight is placed on structures other than the IC, with the thalamus being an obvious candidate, or that the auditory midbrain, thalamus and cortex are bypassed entirely if simple acousticomotor transformations, such as licking a spout in response to a sound, are handled by circuits linking the auditory brainstem and motor thalamus via pedunculopontine and midbrain reticular nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Inagaki et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Some differences were observed for mice with only partial lesions of the auditory cortex. Those mice had a lower proportion of neurons with distinct response magnitudes in hit and miss trials than mice with (near-)complete lesions. Furthermore, trial outcomes could be read out with lower accuracy from these mice. While this finding is somewhat counterintuitive and is based on only three mice with partial lesions, it has been observed before that smaller lesions can have a more disruptive effect than larger, more complete lesions, in that the time it takes mice to learn a whisker-dependent sensory detection task is anticorrelated with the size of their somatosensory cortex lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). While the complete destruction of a cortical area severs all its communication with downstream structures, a partial lesion may actually be more disruptive by eradicating normal local processing while at the same time leaving intact some tissue, especially in the deeper output layers, which continues to transmit what are now aberrant activity patterns. The difference in decoding accuracy that we observed in the IC could thus be a consequence of residual and now disruptive cortical input.</p>
<p>Our results show that behavioral variables are encoded by corticorecipient neurons in the dorsal shell of the IC independently of their main source of descending input, the auditory cortex. It therefore seems likely that this region of the auditory midbrain is part of the circuit that supports sound detection behavior in the absence of the auditory cortex. Nevertheless, except for the regions immediately bordering the auditory cortex, corticocollicular neurons located in other areas were left intact. These relatively sparse descending projections to the IC, such as those originating from somatosensory cortical areas (Lohse et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lesicko et al., 2016</xref>) and parietal cortex may have contributed to the response profiles that we observed. Additional non-acoustic sensory input can reach the IC via brainstem nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lesicko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Shore and Zhou, 2006</xref>) and the superior colliculus (Chen et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coleman and Clerici, 1987</xref>). The latter, together with input from the substantia nigra (Olazabal and Moore, 1989) and the globus pallidus (Morizumi and Hattori, 1991) may also be a source of motor signals, while state changes may impact on the IC via inputs from neuromodulatory structures, including the locus coeruleus and the subparafascicular, dorsal raphe and tegmental nuclei (Chen et al., 2020, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Behavior is a major determinant of activity in the non-lemniscal auditory midbrain and thus key to understanding how it contributes to hearing. The anatomical feature that defines this structure more than any others is its connection with the auditory cortex. While modulation of IC activity by this descending projection has been implicated in various functions, most notably in the plasticity of auditory processing, we have shown in mice performing a sound detection task that IC neurons show task-related activity in the absence of auditory cortical input. These results therefore emphasize more than ever the need to factor in subcortical processing when considering how the cortex contributes to sound-guided behavior.</p>

<p>All experiments were approved by the Committee on Animal Care and Ethical Review at the University of Oxford and were licensed by the UK Home Office (Animal Scientific Procedures Act, 1986, amended in 2012).

<title>Surgeries</title>
<p>For all surgical procedures, mice were premedicated with intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone (Dexadreson, 4 mg), atropine (Atrocare, 1 mg) and carprofen (Rimadyl, 0.15 mg) before being anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5-2%) and administered with buprenorphine (Vetergesic, 1 ml/kg) postoperatively. Mice were then placed in a stereotaxic frame (Model 900LS, David Kopf Instruments, CA, USA) and their body temperature was kept constant at 37°C by the use of a heating mat and a DC temperature controller in conjunction with a temperature probe (FHC, ME, USA).</p>
<p>For injections in the auditory cortex of AAV1.hSyn.Cre.WPRE (Penn Vector Core), the skin over this part of the brain was shaved and an incision was made, after which three small holes were drilled (Foredom K.1070, Blackstone Industries, CT, USA) into the skull with a 0.4 mm drill bit and the virus injected using a pulled glass pipette and a custom pressure injection system. In order to express GCaMP6f or tdTomato in IC neurons that receive auditory cortical inputs, a total of 150-200 nl of AAV1.hSyn.Cre.WPRE was injected at three sites in the right auditory cortex of GCaMP6f (Ai95D) or tdTomato (Ai9) reporter mice, respectively, at depths of 450-550 μm below the brain surface. Given the anterograde transsynaptic spread properties of AAV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zingg et al. 2017</xref>), this caused the expression of the desired fluorescent protein in structures that the auditory cortex projects to, including the shell of the IC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to prepare GAD2-Ires-Cre mice for the optogenetics experiments, we removed a large flap of skin over the parietal and temporal bones, partially removed the temporal muscles and performed a circular craniotomy of 3 mm diameter over each auditory cortex. We then injected a total of 500 nl of AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2-EYFP, UNC Vector Core) bilaterally across 4 sites and two depths (200 and 600 μm) into the auditory cortex. Each craniotomy was covered with a circular 3 mm glass window that was attached to the edges of the skull with cyanoacrylate glue (Pattex Ultra Gel, Henkel), and the exposed skull was sealed with dental acrylic (C&amp;B Superbond, Sun Medical, Japan) into which a custom steel bar was embedded for head fixation. Experiments commenced approximately three weeks afterwards.</p>
<p>The IC window implantation and cortical lesioning in the Ai95D mice were performed at least three weeks after the injections. The window implantation involved removing a flap of skin over the (inter-)parietal and occipital bone and making a circular 3 mm craniotomy over the midbrain. A 3-mm diameter glass coverslip that had been glued to a ∼1 mm tall steel cylinder with 0.5 mm wall thickness was inserted into this craniotomy. The cylinder allowed us to press the glass window gently onto the brain (in order to minimize brain movement during experiments) and was then glued to the edges of the skull. For head fixation, we embedded a custom steel plate in the dental acrylic used to seal the exposed bone.</p>
<p>Lesions were performed as part of the cranial window implantation surgery. In those mice undergoing lesions, we removed a slightly larger flap of skin on both sides in order to expose the temporal bone, detached and deflected and/or partly removed the temporal muscle and then made, on both sides, an elliptical craniotomy over the auditory cortex of ∼3 mm (dorsoventral) by 4 mm (rostrocaudal). The exposed tissue was then aspirated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hong et al., 2018</xref>) with a blunted 19 G needle connected to a suction pump (Eschmann Vp25, UK) or destroyed by thermocoagulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ceballo et al., 2019</xref>) with a cauterizer (Small Vessel Cauterizer Kit, FST, Germany) and the piece of skull that had been removed for the craniotomy was glued (Pattex Ultra Gel) back in place. In some of the lesioned mice, after completion of the imaging, 150 nl of a retrograde viral construct (rAAV2-CAG-tdTomato, UNC Vector Core) was injected into the dorsal IC across two to three sites at depths of 100-400 μm below the brain surface in order to visualize the remaining IC-projecting cortical neurons. The extent of the lesions was estimated from the histological sections and by referencing them against sections from a mouse brain atlas (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001). The experimenters were not blinded to the treatment group, i.e. lesioned or non-lesioned, but they were blind to the lesion size both during the behavior experiments and most of the data processing.</p>
<p>In order to visualize the distribution of IC-projecting neurons in mice without cortical lesions, 150 nl of the retrograde rAAV2-CAG-cre (UNC Vector Core) construct was injected into the dorsal IC of one Ai9 mouse with an intact cortex across three sites at depths of 100-400 μm below the brain surface.</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>For histological processing, mice were perfused transcardially, first with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then with 4% paraformaldehyde in (PBS), and their brains were sectioned coronally (100 μm thick) with a vibratome (Leica). Images were taken manually using a Leica DMR microscope, a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus FV1000) or with an automated slide scanner (Zeiss Axioscan Z1). The brain of one mouse (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1</xref>) was sectioned and imaged on a custom-built two-photon whole brain tomograph.</p>

<title>Click detection task</title>
<p>Starting 2-3 days before training commenced, the mice were habituated to head fixation in the experimental setup and their access to water was restricted to about ∼1 ml per day, bringing their body weight down to about ∼85% of the pre-restriction values. During the training phase, the mice were required to report a 0.5 ms broadband click stimulus of 80 dB SPL by licking a waterspout positioned in front of them. Licking within a 1.5-second response window (occasionally this was reduced in duration to discourage excessive licking) triggered an immediate water reward (∼2 μl). Stimulus trials and catch (no stimulus) trials were randomly interleaved with an inter-trial interval drawn from a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation of 8 s and 2 s, respectively, and a lower bound of 3 s. Successful reporting of the sound within the response window was scored a ‘hit’, while failure to respond was scored a ‘miss’. During catch trials, neither licking (‘false alarm’) during the 1.5-second response window nor withholding licking (‘correct rejection’) triggered a reward. To help the mice form an association between sound and reward, they received occasional ‘free’ rewards in stimulus trials during the initial training even when no licking occurred.</p>
<p>Once the mice had achieved a stable level of performance (typically two days with d’ &gt; 1.5), quieter stimuli (41-71 dB SPL) were introduced. The range of sound levels was adjusted to each animal’s behavioral performance to avoid floor and ceiling effects and could, therefore, differ from mouse to mouse. The behavioral experiments were run using custom MATLAB (MathWorks) scripts interfacing with a National Instruments board (NI USB-6501) for reward delivery and lick registration. The stimuli were presented using Psychtoolbox through a free-field speaker (Vifa, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Germany), positioned about ∼15 cm from the snout of the mouse. Stimuli were calibrated using a Pettersson M500 microphone, which was itself referenced to a sound-level calibrator (Iso-Tech SLC-1356). Stimulus levels were calibrated by integrating the recorded RMS of clicks over the mouse hearing range (1-100 kHz) and comparing this to the RMS of stimuli from the reference sound-level calibrator.</p>
<p>In the optogenetics experiments, the behavioral task was identical except that a single sound level (80 dB SPL) was used and on 50% of the trials bilateral photostimulation (20 Hz, 10 ms pulses, 0.2 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was performed via two 470 nm LEDs (CREE-XP-E2, LED-Tech, Germany) positioned above the cranial windows. LED-on and LED-off trials were randomly interleaved and stimulation lasted for 700 ms starting 50 ms before trial onset. Furthermore, masking flashes were presented on all trials from two bright LEDs (60 mW) positioned a few cm in front of the animals’ eyes.</p>

<title>Two-photon calcium imaging</title>
<p>Imaging was performed at a depth of 50 μm – 150 μm from the IC surface using a commercial two-photon laser-scanning microscope (B-Scope, ThorLabs, VA, USA), a SpectraPhysics Mai-Tai eHP laser (Spectra-Physics, CA, USA) tuned to 930 nm, and a Nikon 16x 0.8 NA objective. Images were acquired with a resolution of 512 by 512 pixels at a rate of ∼28 Hz. The size of the field of view was either 500 µm by 500 µm or 666 µm by 666 µm, which allowed us to, typically, image dozens of corticorecipient IC neurons simultaneously. Each imaging session lasted around 1-2 hours.</p>

<title>Image processing</title>
<p>Rigid and non-rigid image registration, segmentation, neuropil and signal extraction were performed using the Python version of suite2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pachitariu et al. 2017</xref>). Neuropil extraction was performed using default suite2p parameters (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://suite2p.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html">https://suite2p.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html</ext-link>), neuropil correction was done using a coefficient of 0.7 and calcium ΔF/F signals were obtained by using the median over the entire fluorescence trace as F0. To remove slow fluctuations in the signal, a baseline of each neuron’s entire trace was calculated by Gaussian filtering as well as minimum and maximum filtering using default suite2p parameters. This baseline was then subtracted from the signal. To assess the extent of image displacement in the z-axis, we compared the average of the top and the bottom 500 frames of each spatial principal component (PC) of the registered images for every 8-16 minutes of the recordings. Any region of interest (ROI) with substantial z-axis movement was excluded from further analysis. Sessions in which the majority of ROIs had to be excluded were discarded entirely. Furthermore, in order to specifically assess brain motion caused by the motor component of the task, i.e. the animal’s licking, lick-triggered movies of the imaging frames were created for every 8-16 minutes of the recordings. The rationale here is that if licking causes a stereotypical displacement of the imaging plane, this will become apparent when image sequences are averaged across lick events. Specifically, non-registered image sequences surrounding (from 2 s before to 2 s after) lick events were used to produce averaged lick-triggered movies. These lick-triggered movies, as well as non-averaged sequences, were then visually inspected and ROIs were excluded from subsequent analysis if they were affected by substantial z-motion.</p>

<title>Analysis of task-modulated and sound-driven neurons</title>
<p>To identify individual neurons that produced significantly different response magnitudes in hit and miss trials, we calculated the mean activity for each stimulus trial by taking the mean activity over the 5 seconds following stimulus presentation and subtracting the mean activity over the 2 seconds preceding the stimulus during that same trial. A Mann-Whitney U test was then performed to assess whether a neuron showed a statistically significant difference (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.05) in response magnitude between hit and miss trials. The analysis was performed using equal numbers of hit and miss trials at each sound level to ensure balanced sound level distributions. If, for a given sound level, there were more hit than miss trials, we randomly selected a sample of hit trials (without substitution) to match the sample size for the miss trials and vice versa. Sound-driven neurons were identified by comparing the mean miss trial activity before and after stimulus presentation. Specifically, we performed a Mann-Whitney U test to assess whether there was a statistically significant difference (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.05) between the mean activity over the 2 seconds preceding the stimulus and the mean activity over the 1 second period following stimulus presentation. This analysis was performed using miss trials with click intensities from 53 dB SPL to 65 dB SPL (many sessions contained very few or no miss trials for higher sound levels).</p>

<sec id="s5h">
<title>Clustering analysis</title>
<p>To identify sub-populations of neurons with distinct response profiles, a clustering analysis was performed. While clustering is a useful approach for organizing and visualizing the activity of large and heterogeneous populations of neurons, we need to be mindful that, given continuous distributions of response properties, the locations of cluster boundaries can be somewhat arbitrary and/or reflect idiosyncrasies of the chosen method and thus vary from one algorithm to another. We employed an approach very similar to that described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Namboodiri et al. (2019)</xref> because it is thought to produce stable results in high-dimensional neural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hirokawa et al. 2019</xref>). For each neuron, the trial-averaged activity was obtained by averaging across all the sound levels presented in a given session separately for hit and miss trials (given the small number of catch trials, approximately one tenth of all trials, this analysis was restricted to stimulus trials only). Differences in the field of view size between sessions resulted in slight differences in frame rate and thus frame duration. Therefore, the activity traces were linearly interpolated to have the same number of data points (193 frames). For each neuron, the trial-averaged activity for miss trials was appended to that for hit trials, producing 386 data points per neuron for a total of 2649 neurons (n = 1697 neurons from 40 sessions with 9 non-lesioned mice; n = 952 neurons from 40 sessions with 7 lesioned mice). To reduce the dimensionality of this dataset before applying the clustering algorithm, we performed principal components analysis (PCA) along the time axis to capture the temporal response profile for each neuron. Guided by the ‘elbow’ point in a scree plot visualizing the fraction of variance explained by each PC, we decided to project the dataset to the lower dimensional subspace formed by the first 9 PCs.</p>
<p>Spectral clustering was used to cluster the resulting data. The affinity matrix was constructed by computing a graph of nearest neighbors. The hyperparameters of the clustering algorithm, including the number of nearest neighbors and the number of clusters, were optimized by a grid search to maximize the mean Silhouette Score for all samples. The Silhouette Score is a measure of the compactness of individual clusters (intra-cluster distance) and the separation amongst clusters (inter-cluster distance). For a given sample <italic>i</italic> that belongs to cluster <italic>C<sub>I</sub></italic>, the Silhouette Score is defined as:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="544013v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic> is the mean distance between sample <italic>i</italic> and all the other samples in the same cluster, and <italic>b<sub>i</sub></italic> is the mean distance of sample <italic>i</italic> to the nearest cluster that sample <italic>i</italic> is not part of. Let |<italic>C<sub>I</sub></italic>| and |<italic>C<sub>J</sub></italic>| be the number of samples belonging to clusters <italic>C<sub>I</sub></italic> and <italic>C<sub>J</sub></italic>, and <italic>d</italic>(<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) be the distance between samples <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>; <italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>b<sub>i</sub></italic> are defined as:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="544013v2_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The resulting clusters from the hyperparameter search were further examined by plotting clusters in pairs against each other with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, a statistical method for visualizing high-dimensional data that involves giving each data point a location in a two or three-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">van der Maaten and Hinton 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Population decoding</title>
<p>Logistic regression models were trained on the network activity of each session, i.e., the ΔF/F values of all ROIs in each session, to classify hit vs miss trials. This was done on a frame-by-frame basis, meaning that each time point (frame) of each session was trained separately. Rather than including all the trials in a given session, only trials of intermediate difficulty were used for the decoding analysis. More specifically, we only included trials across five sound levels, comprising the lowest sound level that exceeded a d’ of 1.5 plus the two sound levels below and above that level. That ensured that differences in sound level distributions would be small, while still giving us a sufficient number of trials to perform the decoding analysis. Sessions were only included if there were at least 15 instances for both hit and miss trials. The models were trained with L2 regularization, which gave similar contributions to correlated features (i.e., individual neuronal activity) instead of discarding some of the correlated features that were also related to behaviorally-relevant information. The strength of the regularization for each model was hyperparameter-tuned and the reported results were cross validated. Specifically, neuronal data in each session was split into 5 stratified folds, and each fold preserved the percentage of hit and miss trials in a given session. Four folds were used for cross-validated hyperparameter search (randomized search drawn from the log-uniform distribution between 1 × <italic>10<sup>-4</sup></italic>and 1 × <italic>10<sup>2</sup></italic>), and the remaining 1 fold was used for evaluating the model after the best hyperparameters were refitted on the 4 folds of data. To more reliably estimate the model results, the evaluation was done for each of the 5 folds for each session and the average of these 5 results was taken as each session’s model performance at each timepoint.</p>
<p>The percentage of hit and miss trials was different in each session, and the number of hit trials often exceeded the number of miss trials. To include as many trials as possible while preventing the models from taking advantage of class imbalances, balancing procedures were performed at both the model-level and the metrics-level. First, logistic regression was trained with the class weights adjusted inversely proportional to the frequency of each trial type in the training data, giving higher weights to the minority class and lower weights to the majority class. Given the total number of trials in the training data <italic>N<sub>T</sub></italic>, the number of classes <italic>N<sub>C</sub></italic>, and the number of trials for a given class <italic>N<sub>i</sub></italic>, the weight for a given class <italic>W<sub>i</sub></italic> was defined as follows:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="544013v2_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
These weights were then applied to the cost function during the training process to increase the penalty for minority class misclassifications and reduce the penalty for majority class misclassifications. Second, to avoid the estimated model performance being inflated due to class imbalance, balanced accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brodersen et al. 2010</xref>) was used to report the model performance. Balanced accuracy was defined as the arithmetic mean of the true positive rate and the true negative rate. For a model performing equally well on either class, the balanced accuracy is the same as the conventional accuracy (i.e., the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions). However, for a model scoring above chance only because the model takes advantage of the class imbalance (i.e. consistently predicts the majority class), the balanced accuracy is at chance level.
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="544013v2_ueqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Additionally, dummy models were used as baseline models to compare against the performance of the logistic regression models. Dummy models predicted the class labels (i.e., hit or miss trials) randomly while taking into account the probability of each class.</p>
<p>To assess whether the model performance was correlated with the number of ROIs recorded in a session, Spearman’s correlation coefficient was computed between the number of ROIs in a session and the mean model performance over different 1-second time periods relative to stimulus onset (from 2 seconds before to 5 seconds after stimulus onset).</p>
<p>Statistical tests were conducted to compare the model performance between lesioned and non-lesioned mice, as well as between the trained models and dummy models. Since the frame rate varied slightly with the size of the field of view, the numbers of frames (193 - 197 frames) per 7-s trial could be different across sessions. Thus, model performance was linearly interpolated to make all sessions contain the same number of frames before statistical tests were performed at each timepoint. The model performance of each session was cross-validated and averaged across folds, and the statistical tests were performed on the distributions of the sessions’ model performance. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine whether a parametric or nonparametric test should be used, using p &lt; 0.05 as a criterion. A one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test or paired t-test was performed for comparing trained vs dummy models, while a one-sided Mann-Whitney U test or t-test was performed for comparing trained models for different groups of mice. Because of the smaller sample sizes, the statistical tests in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> were carried out after binning the scores for every two timepoints. Statistical significance was defined as p &lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction.</p>

<caption><p>Contra- and ipsilateral corticocollicular neurons along the rostrocaudal axis. Seven coronal sections are shown from each hemisphere covering approximately 2.5 mm of the rostrocaudal axis. Corticocollicular neurons were labeled by injecting a total of 150 nL of rAAV2-CAG-cre into the dorsal IC (at three sites and several depths from 100 µm - 400 µm below the brain surface) of a tdTomato reporter mouse (Ai9). Data were obtained using whole-brain laser scanning two-photon tomography. The resulting images were grayscale inverted and thresholded to remove all background labeling so that they could be more easily arranged into a common figure. Area borders were drawn onto the images according to Paxinos and Franklin (2001).

The red line illustrates the distribution of ‘reward-to-next-trial-onset’ intervals experienced by the example mouse. Given that licks are plotted time-locked to reward delivery, we plotted the distribution of intervals between reward delivery and onset of the next trial rather than the ITI distribution. In practice the difference between the two is roughly the latency between the stimulus and the first lick and thus barely distinguishable at this scale. As the distribution indicates the probability of the next trial presentation as a function of time since the preceding reward delivery we refer to it as ‘next-trial-probability’.

Although the next-trial-probability is a good predictor of changes in the average lick rate, the lick rate at the peak of the distribution is merely about a quarter higher than at its tails where next-trial-probability approaches zero. Furthermore, to put the average lick rates into perspective, note that mice tend to lick in bouts, typically consisting of two to six licks in very quick succession (see lick raster in <bold>A</bold>), and that, consequently, the lick rate exceeds the underlying bout rate by a factor of about four.

While the peri-catch trial lick rate profile changed substantially over the course of the initial training (<bold>F</bold>) and started to approximate the stimulus probability distribution towards the end of training, it remained broadly stable throughout the main experiment (<bold>E</bold>). In order to increase the statistical power for this analysis, we included data from several additional mice used in other projects. These additional mice received the same training and performed the same task, but differed from those in the main dataset in that they had a different genetic background and/or had been fitted with a cranial implant for cortical rather than midbrain imaging.

<p>The inferior colliculus (IC) is the central auditory system's major hub. It integrates ascending brainstem signals to provide acoustic information to the auditory thalamus. The superficial layers of the IC (&quot;shell&quot; IC regions as defined in the current manuscript) also receive a massive descending projection from the auditory cortex. This auditory cortico-collicular pathway has long fascinated the hearing field, as it may provide a route to funnel &quot;high-level&quot; cortical signals and impart behavioral salience upon an otherwise behaviorally agnostic midbrain circuit.</p>
<p>Accordingly, IC neurons can respond differently to the same sound depending on whether animals engage in a behavioral task (Ryan and Miller 1977; Ryan et al., 1984; Slee &amp; David, 2015; Saderi et al., 2021; De Franceschi &amp; Barkat, 2021). Many studies also report a rich variety of non-auditory responses in the IC, far beyond the simple acoustic responses one expects to find in a &quot;low-level&quot; region (Sakurai, 1990; Metzger et al., 2006; Porter et al., 2007). A tacit assumption is that the behaviorally relevant activity of IC neurons is inherited from the auditory cortico-collicular pathway. However, this assumption has never been tested, owing to two main limitations of past studies:</p>
<p>(1) Prior studies could not confirm if data were obtained from IC neurons that receive monosynaptic input from the auditory cortex.</p>
<p>(2) Many studies have tested how auditory cortical inactivation impacts IC neuron activity; the consequence of cortical silencing is sometimes quite modest. However, all prior inactivation studies were conducted in anesthetized or passively listening animals. These conditions may not fully engage the auditory cortico-collicular pathway. Moreover, the extent of cortical inactivation in prior studies was sometimes ambiguous, which complicates interpreting modest or negative results.</p>
<p>Here, the authors' goal is to directly test if the auditory cortex is necessary for behaviorally relevant activity in IC neurons. They conclude that surprisingly, task relevant activity in cortico-recipient IC neuron persists in absence of auditory cortico-collicular transmission. To this end, a major strength of the paper is that the authors combine a sound-detection behavior with clever approaches that unambiguously overcome the limitations of past studies.</p>
<p>First the authors inject a transsynaptic virus into the auditory cortex, thereby expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator in the auditory cortex's postsynaptic targets in the IC. This powerful approach enables 2-photon Ca2+ imaging from IC neurons that unambiguously receive monosynaptic input from auditory cortex. Thus, any effect of cortical silencing should be maximally observable in this neuronal population. Second, they abrogate auditory cortico-collicular transmission using lesions of auditory cortex. This &quot;sledgehammer&quot; approach is arguably the most direct test of whether cortico-recipient IC neurons will continue to encode task-relevant information in absence of descending feedback. Indeed, their method circumvents the known limitations of more modern optogenetic or chemogenetic silencing, e.g. variable efficacy.</p>
<p>The authors have revised their manuscript and adequately addressed the major concerns. Although more in depth analyses of these rich datasets are definitely possible, the current results nevertheless stand on their own. Indeed, the work serves as a beacon to move away from the idea that cortico-collicular projections function primarily to impart behavioral relevance upon auditory midbrain neurons. This knowledge inspires a search for alternative explanations as to the role of auditory cortico-collicular synapses in behavior.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study takes a new approach to studying the role of corticofugal projections from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus. The authors performed two-photon imaging of cortico-recipient IC neurons during a click detection task in mice with and without lesions of auditory cortex. In both groups of animals, they observed similar task performance and relatively small differences in the encoding of task-response variables in the IC population. They conclude that non-cortical inputs to the IC provide can substantial task-related modulation, at least when AC is absent.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study provides valuable new insight into big and challenging questions around top-down modulation of activity in the IC. The approach here is novel and appears to have been executed thoughtfully. Thus, it should be of interest to the community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are however, substantial concerns about the interpretation of the findings and limitations to the current analysis. In particular, Analysis of single unit activity is absent, making interpretation of population clusters and decoding less interpretable. These concerns should be addressed to make sure that the results can be interpreted clearly in an active field that already contains a number of confusing and possibly contradictory findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to demonstrate that cortical feedback is not necessary to signal behavioral outcome to shell neurons of the inferior colliculus during a sound detection task. The demonstration is achieved in a very clear manner by the observation of the activity of cortico-recepient neurons in animals which have received lesions of the auditory cortex. The experiment shows that neither behavior performance nor neuronal responses are significantly impacted by cortical lesions except for the case of partial lesions which seem to have a disruptive effect on behavioral outcome signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The demonstration of the main conclusions is based on state-of-the-art, carefully controlled methods and is highly convincing. There is an in depth discussion of the different effects of auditory cortical lesions on sound detection behavior.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The description of feedback signals could be more detailed although it is difficult to achieve good temporal resolution with the calcium imaging technique necessary for targeting cortico-recipient neurons.</p>

<p>The inferior colliculus (IC) is the central auditory system's major hub. It integrates ascending brainstem signals to provide acoustic information to the auditory thalamus. The superficial layers of the IC (&quot;shell&quot; IC regions as defined in the current manuscript) also receive a massive descending projection from the auditory cortex. This auditory cortico-collicular pathway has long fascinated the hearing field, as it may provide a route to funnel &quot;high-level&quot; cortical signals and impart behavioral salience upon an otherwise behaviorally agnostic midbrain circuit.</p>
<p>Accordingly, IC neurons can respond differently to the same sound depending on whether animals engage in a behavioral task (Ryan and Miller 1977; Ryan et al., 1984; Slee &amp; David, 2015; Saderi et al., 2021; De Franceschi &amp; Barkat, 2021). Many studies also report a rich variety of non-auditory responses in the IC, far beyond the simple acoustic responses one expects to find in a &quot;low-level&quot; region (Sakurai, 1990; Metzger et al., 2006; Porter et al., 2007).

However, this assumption has never been tested, owing to two main limitations of past studies:</p>
<p>(1) Prior studies could not confirm if data were obtained from IC neurons that receive monosynaptic input from the auditory cortex.</p>
<p>(2) Many studies have tested how auditory cortical inactivation impacts IC neuron activity; the consequence of cortical silencing is sometimes quite modest.

Moreover, the extent of cortical inactivation in prior studies was sometimes ambiguous, which complicates interpreting modest or negative results.</p>
<p>Here, the authors' goal is to directly test if auditory cortex is necessary for behaviorally relevant activity in IC neurons. They conclude that surprisingly, task relevant activity in cortico-recipient IC neuron persists in absence of auditory cortico-collicular transmission. To this end, a major strength of the paper is that the authors combine a sound-detection behavior with clever approaches that unambiguously overcome the limitations of past studies.</p>
<p>First, the authors inject a transsynaptic virus into the auditory cortex, thereby expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator in the auditory cortex's postsynaptic targets in the IC. This powerful approach enables 2-photon Ca2+ imaging from IC neurons that unambiguously receive monosynaptic input from auditory cortex. Thus, any effect of cortical silencing should be maximally observable in this neuronal population. Second, they abrogate auditory cortico-collicular transmission using lesions of auditory cortex. This &quot;sledgehammer&quot; approach is arguably the most direct test of whether cortico-recipient IC neurons will continue to encode task-relevant information in absence of descending feedback. Indeed, their method circumvents the known limitations of more modern optogenetic or chemogenetic silencing, e.g. variable efficacy.</p>
<p>I also see three weaknesses which limit what we can learn from the authors' hard work, at least in the current form. I want to emphasize that these issues do not reflect any fatal flaw of the approach. Rather, I believe that their datasets likely contain the treasure-trove of knowledge required to completely support their claims.</p>
<p>(1) The conclusion of this paper requires the following assumption to be true: That the difference in neural activity between Hit and Miss trials reflects &quot;information beyond the physical attributes of sound.&quot; The data presentation complicates asserting this assumption. Specifically, they average fluorescence transients of all Hit and all Miss trials in their detection task. Yet, Figure 3B shows that mice's d' depends on sound level, and since this is a detection task the smaller d' at low SPLs presumably reflects lower Hit rates (and thus higher Miss rates). As currently written, it is not clear if fluorescence traces for Hits arise from trials where the sound cue was played at a higher sound level than on Miss trials. Thus, the difference in neural activity on Hit and Miss trials could indeed reflect mice's behavior (licking or not licking). But in principle could also be explained by higher sound-evoked spike rates on Hit compared to Miss trials, simply due to louder click sounds. Indeed, the amplitude and decay tau of their indicator GCaMP6f is non-linearly dependent on the number and rate of spikes (Chen et al., 2013), so this isn't an unreasonable concern.</p>
<p>(2) The authors' central claim effectively rests upon two analyses in Figures 5 and 6. The spectral clustering algorithm of Figure 5 identifies 10 separate activity patterns in IC neurons of control and lesioned mice; most of these clusters show distinct activity on averaged Hit and Miss trials. They conclude that although the proportions of neurons from control and lesioned mice in certain clusters deviates from an expected 50/50 split, neurons from lesioned mice are still represented in all clusters. A significant issue here is that in addition to averaging all Hits and Miss trials together, the data from control and lesioned mice are lumped for the clustering. There is no direct comparison of neural activity between the two groups, so the reader must rely on interpreting a row of pie charts to assess the conclusion. It's unclear how similar task relevant activity is between control and lesioned mice; we don't even have a ballpark estimate of how auditory cortex does or does not contribute to task relevant activity. Although ideally the authors would have approached this by repeatedly imaging the same IC neurons before and after lesioning auditory cortex, this within-subjects design may be unfeasible if lesions interfere with task retention. Nevertheless, they have recordings from hundreds to thousands of neurons across two groups, so even a small effect should be observable in a between-groups comparison.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 6, the authors show that logistic regression models predict whether the trial is a Hit or Miss from their fluorescence data. Classification accuracy peaks rapidly following sound presentation, implying substantial information regarding mice's actions. The authors further show that classification accuracy is reduced, but still above chance in mice with auditory cortical lesions. The authors conclude from this analysis task relevant activity persists in absence of auditory cortex. In principle I do not disagree with their conclusion.</p>
<p>The weakness here is in the details. First, the reduction in classification accuracy of lesioned mice suggests that auditory cortex does nevertheless transmit some task relevant information, however minor it may be. I feel that as written, their narrative does not adequately highlight this finding. Rather one could argue that their results suggest redundant sources of task-relevant activity converging in the IC. Secondly, the authors conclude that decoding accuracy is impaired more in partially compared to fully lesioned mice. They admit that this conclusion is at face value counterintuitive, and provide compelling mechanistic arguments in the Discussion. However, aside from shaded 95% CIs, we have no estimate of variance in decoding accuracy across sessions or subjects for either control or lesioned mice. Thus we don't know if the small sample sizes of partial (n = 3) and full lesion (n = 4) groups adequately sample from the underlying population. Their result of Figure 6B may reflect spurious sampling from tail ends of the distributions, rather than a true non-monotonic effect of lesion size on task relevant activity in IC.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study takes a new approach to studying the role of corticofugal projections from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus. The authors performed two-photon imaging of cortico-recipient IC neurons during a click detection task in mice with and without lesions of auditory cortex. In both groups of animals, they observed similar task performance and relatively small differences in the encoding of task-response variables in the IC population. They conclude that non-cortical inputs to the IC provide can substantial task-related modulation, at least when AC is absent.
Strengths:</p>
<p>This study provides valuable new insight into big and challenging questions around top-down modulation of activity in the IC. The approach here is novel and appears to have been executed thoughtfully. Thus, it should be of interest to the community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: There are, however, substantial concerns about the interpretation of the findings and limitations to the current analysis. In particular, Analysis of single unit activity is absent, making interpretation of population clusters and decoding less interpretable. These concerns should be addressed to make sure that the results can be interpreted clearly in an active field that already contains a number of confusing and possibly contradictory findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to demonstrate that cortical feedback is not necessary to signal behavioral outcome to shell neurons of the inferior colliculus during a sound detection task. The demonstration is achieved by the observation of the activity of cortico-recipient neurons in animals which have received lesions of the auditory cortex. The experiment shows that neither behavior performance nor neuronal responses are significantly impacted by cortical lesions except for the case of partial lesions which seem to have a disruptive effect on behavioral outcome signaling.
Strengths:</p>
<p>The experimental procedure is based on state of the art methods. There is an in depth discussion of the different effects of auditory cortical lesions on sound detection behavior.
Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The analysis is not documented enough to be correctly evaluated. Have the authors pooled together trials with different sound levels for the key hit vs miss decoding/clustering analysis? If so, the conclusions are not well supported, as there are more misses for low sound levels, which would completely bias the outcome of the analysis. It would possible that the classification of hit versus misses actually only reflects a decoding of sound level based on sensory responses in the colliculus, and it would not be surprising then that in the presence or absence of cortical feedback, some neurons responds more to higher sound levels (hits) and less to lower sound levels (misses). It is important that the authors clarify and in any case perform an analysis in which the classification of hits vs misses is done only for the same sound levels. The description of feedback signals could be more detailed although it is difficult to achieve good temporal resolution with the calcium imaging technique necessary for targeting cortico-recipient neurons.</p>

This includes an analysis in which we were able to demonstrate for one imaging session with a sufficiently large number of trials that limiting the trials entered into the decoding analysis to those from a single sound level did not meaningfully impact decoding accuracy. We would like to highlight another new analysis here because it supplements both the clustering and decoding analyses that we conducted to compare hit and miss trial activity and addresses the other reviewers’ request for an analysis that operates at the level of single units rather than the population level.

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to read your paper. I think the conclusion is exciting. Indeed, you indicate that perhaps contrary to many of our (untested) assumptions, task-relevant activity in the IC may persist in absence of auditory cortex.</p>
<p>As mentioned in my public review: Despite my interest in the work, I also think that there are several opportunities to significantly strengthen your conclusions. I feel this point is important because your work will likely guide the efforts of future students and post-docs working on this topic. The data can serve as a beacon to move the field away from the (somewhat naïve) idea that the evolved forebrain imparts behavioral relevance upon an otherwise uncivilized midbrain. This knowledge will inspire a search for alternative explanations. Indeed, although you don't highlight it in your narrative, your results dovetail nicely with several studies showing task-relevant activity in more ventral midbrain areas that project to the IC (e.g., pedunculopontine nuclei; see work from Hikosaka in monkeys, and more recently in mice from Karel Svoboda's lab).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the kind words.</p>
<p>These studies, in particular the work by Inagaki et al. (2022) outlining how the transformation of an auditory go signal into movement could be mediated via a circuit involving the PPN/MRN (which might rely on the NLL for auditory input) and the motor thalamus, are indeed highly relevant.</p>
<p>We made the following changes to the manuscript text.</p>
<p>Line 472:”...or that the auditory midbrain, thalamus and cortex are bypassed entirely if simple acousticomotor transformations, such as licking a spout in response to a sound, are handled by circuits linking the auditory brainstem and motor thalamus via pedunculopontine and midbrain reticular nuclei (Inagaki et al., 2022).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The beauty of the eLife experiment is that you are free to incorporate or ignore these suggestions. After all, it's your paper, not mine. Nevertheless, I hope you find my comments useful.</p>
<p>
First, a few suggestions to address my three comments in the public review.</p>
<p>Suggestion for public comment #1: An easy way to address this issue is to average the neural activity separately for each trial outcome at each sound level. That way you can measure if fluorescence amplitude (or integral) varies as a function of mice's action rather than sound level. This approach to data organization would also open the door to the additional analyses for addressing comment #2, such as directly comparing auditory and putatively non-auditory activity in neurons recorded from control and lesioned mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have carried out additional analyses for distinguishing between the two alternative explanations of the data put forward by the reviewer: That the difference in neural activity between hit and miss trials reflects a) behavior or b) sound level (more precisely: differences in response magnitude arising from a higher proportion of high-sound-level trials in the hit trial group than in the miss trial group). If the data favored b), we would expect no difference in activity between hit and miss trials when plotted separately for each sound level. The new Figure 4 - figure supplement 1 indicates that this is not the case. Hit and miss trial activity are clearly distinct even when plotted separately for different sound levels, confirming that this difference in activity reflects the animals’ behavior rather than sensory information.</p>
<p>Changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 214: “While averaging across all neurons cannot capture the diversity of responses, the averaged response profiles suggest that it is mostly trial outcome rather than the acoustic stimulus and neuronal sensitivity to sound level that shapes those responses (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1).”</p>
<p>Additionally, we assessed for each neuron separately whether there was a significant difference between hit and miss trial activity and therefore whether the activity of the neuron could be considered “task-modulated”. To achieve this, we used equal numbers of hit and miss trials at each sound level to ensure balanced sound level distributions and thus rule out any potential confound between sound level distributions and trial outcome. This analysis revealed that the proportion of task-modulated neurons was very high (close to 50%) and not significantly different between lesioned and non-lesioned mice (Figure 6 - figure supplement 3).</p>
<p>Changes to the manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 217: “Indeed, close to half (1272 / 2649) of all neurons showed a statistically significant difference in response magnitude between hit and miss trials…”</p>
<p>Line 307: “Although the proportion of individual neurons with distinct response magnitudes in hit and miss trials in lesioned mice did not differ from that in non-lesioned mice, it was significantly lower when separating out mice with partial lesions (Figure 6 – figure supplement 3).”</p>
<p>Differences in the distributions of sound levels in the different trial types could also potentially confound the decoding into hit and miss trials. Our original analysis was actually designed to take this into account but, unfortunately, we failed to include sufficient details in the methods section.</p>
<p>Changes to the manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 710: “Rather than including all the trials in a given session, only trials of intermediate difficulty were used for the decoding analysis. More specifically, we only included trials across five sound levels, comprising the lowest sound level that exceeded a d’ of 1.5 plus the two sound levels below and above that level. That ensured that differences in sound level distributions would be small, while still giving us a sufficient number of trials to perform the decoding analysis.“</p>
<p>In this context, it is worth bearing in mind that a) the decoding analysis was done on a frame-byframe basis, meaning that the decoding score achieved early in the trial has no impact on the decoding score at later time points in the trial, b) sound-driven activity  predominantly occurs immediately after stimulus onset and is largely over about 1 s into the trial (see cluster 3, for instance, or average miss trial activity in Figure 4 – figure supplement 1), c) decoding performance of the behavioral outcome starts to plateau 500-1000 ms into the trial and remains high until it very gradually begins to decline after about 2 s into the trial. In other words, decoding performance remains high far longer than the stimulus would be expected to have an impact on the neurons’ activity. Therefore, we would expect any residual bias due to differences in the sound level distribution that our approach did not control for to be restricted to the very beginning of the trial and not to meaningfully impact the conclusions derived from the decoding analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, we carried out an additional decoding analysis for one imaging session in which we had a sufficient number of trials to perform the analysis not only over the five (59, 62, 65, 68, 71 dB SPL) original sound levels, but also over a reduced range of three (62, 65, 68 dB SPL) sound levels, as well as a single (65 dB SPL) sound level (Figure 6 - figure supplement 1). The mean sound level differences between the hit trial distributions and miss trial distributions for these three conditions were 3.08, 1.01 and 0 dB, respectively. This analysis suggests that decoding performance is not meaningfully impacted by changing the range of sound levels (and sound level distributions), other than that including fewer sound levels means fewer trials and thus noisier decoding.</p>

<p>Line 287: ”...and was not meaningfully affected by differences in sound level distributions between hit and miss trials (Figure 6 – figure supplement 1).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Suggestion for public comment #2: Perhaps a solution would be to display example neuron activity in each cluster, recorded in control and lesioned mice. The reader could then visually compare example data from the two groups, and immediately grasp the conclusion that task relevant activity remains in absence of auditory cortex. Additionally, one possibility might be to calculate the difference in neural activity between Hit and Miss trials for each task-modulated neuron. Then, you could compare these values for neurons recorded in control and lesion mice. I feel like this information would greatly add to our understanding of cortico-collicular processing.</p>
<p>I would also argue that it's perhaps more informative to show one (or a few) example recordings rather than averaging across all cells in a cluster. Example cells would give the reader a better handle on the quality of the imaging, and this approach is more standard in the field. Finally, it would be useful to show the y axis calibration for each example trace (e.g. Figure 5 supp 1). That is also pretty standard so we can immediately grasp the magnitude of the recorded signal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that while the information we provided shows that neurons from lesioned and nonlesioned groups are roughly equally represented across the clusters, it does not allow the reader to appreciate how similar the activity profiles of neurons are from each of the two groups. However, picking examples can be highly subjective and thus potentially open to bias. We therefore opted instead to display, separately for lesioned and non-lesioned mice, the peristimulus time histograms of all neurons in each cluster, as well as the cluster averages of the response profiles (Figure 5 - figure supplement 3). This, we believe, convincingly illustrates the close correspondence between neural activity in lesioned and non-lesioned mice across different clusters. All our existing and new figures indicate the response magnitude either on the figures’ y-axis or via scale/color bars.</p>

<p>Suggestion for public comment #3: In absence of laborious and costly follow-up experiments to boost the sample size of partial and complete lesion groups, it may be more prudent to simply tone down the claims that lesion size differentially impacts decoding accuracy. The results of this analysis are not necessary for your main claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our new results on the proportions of ‘task-modulated’ neurons (Figure 6 - figure supplement 3) across different experimental groups show that there is no difference between non-lesioned and lesioned mice as a whole, but mice with partial lesions have a smaller proportion of taskmodulated neurons than the other two groups. While this corroborates the results of the decoding analysis, we certainly agree that the small sample size is a caveat that needs to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 477: ”Some differences were observed for mice with only partial lesions of the auditory cortex.</p>
<p>Those mice had a lower proportion of neurons with distinct response magnitudes in hit and miss trials than mice with (near-)complete lesions. Furthermore, trial outcomes could be read out with lower accuracy from these mice. While this finding is somewhat counterintuitive and is based on only three mice with partial lesions, it has been observed before that smaller lesions…”</p>

<p>A few more suggestions unrelated to public review:</p>
<p>Figure 1: This is somewhat of an oddball in this manuscript, and its inclusion is not necessary for the main point. Indeed, the major conclusion of Fig 1 is that acute silencing of auditory cortex impairs task performance, and thus optogenetic methods are not suitable to test your hypothesis. However, this conclusion is also easily supported from decades of prior work, and thus citations might suffice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not agree that these data can easily be substituted with citations of prior published work. While previous studies (Talwar et al., 2001, Li et al., 2017) have demonstrated the impact of acute pharmacological silencing on sound detection in rodents, pharmacological and optogenetic silencing are not equivalent. Furthermore, we are aware of only one published study (Kato et al., 2015) that investigated the impact of optogenetically perturbing auditory cortex on sound detection (others have investigated its impact on discrimination tasks). Kato et al. (2015) examined the effect of acute optogenetic silencing of auditory cortex on the ability of mice to detect the offsets of very long (5-9 seconds) sounds, which is not easily comparable to the click detection task employed by us. Furthermore, when presenting our work at a recent meeting and leaving out the optogenetics results due to time constraints, audience members immediately enquired whether we had tried an optogenetic manipulation instead of lesions. Therefore, we believe that these data represent a valuable piece of information that will be appreciated by many readers and have decided not to remove them from the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A worst case scenario is that Figure 1 will detract from the reader's assessment of experimental rigor. The data of 1C are pooled from multiple sessions in three mice. It is not clear if the signed-rank test compares performance across n = 3 mice or n = 13 sessions. If the latter, a stats nitpicker could argue that the significance might not hold up with a nested analysis considering that some datapoints are not independent of one another. Finally, the experiment does not include a control group, gad2-cre mice injected with a EYFP virus. So as presented, the data are equally compatible with the pessimistic conclusion that shining light into the brain impairs mice's licking. My suggestion is to simply remove Figure 1 from the paper. Starting off with Figure 3 would be stronger, as the rest of the study hinges upon the knowledge that control and lesion mice's behavior is similar.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Instead of reporting the results session-wise and doing stats on the d’ values, we now report results per mouse and perform stats on the proportions of hits and false alarms separately for each mouse. The results are statistically significant for each mouse and suggest that the differences in d’ are primarily caused by higher false alarm rates during the optogenetic perturbation than in the control condition.</p>
<p>Changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>New Figure 1.</p>
<p>We agree that including control mice not expressing ChR2 would be important for fully characterizing the optogenetic manipulation and that the lack of this control group should be acknowledged. However, in the context of this study, the outcome of performing this additional experiment would be inconsequential. We originally considered using an optogenetic approach to explore the contribution of cortical activity to IC responses, but found that this altered the animals’ sound detection behavior. Whether that change in behavior is due to activation of the opsin or simply due to light being shone on the brain has no bearing on the conclusion that this type of manipulation is unsuitable for determining whether auditory cortex is required for the choice-related activity that we recorded in the IC.</p>
<p>Changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 106: ”Although a control group in which the auditory cortex was injected with an EYFP virus lacking ChR2 would be required to confirm that the altered behavior results from an opsindependent perturbation of cortical activity, this result shows that this manipulation is also unsuitable… ”</p>

<p>Figure 2, comment #1: The micrograph of panel B shows the densest fluorescence in the central IC. You interpret this as evidence of retrograde labeling of central IC neurons that project to the shell IC. This is a nice finding, but perhaps a more relevant micrograph would be to show the actual injection site in the shell layers. The rest of Figure 2 documents the non-auditory cortical sources of forebrain feedback. Since non-auditory cortical neurons may or may not target distinct shell IC sub-circuits, it's important to know where the retrograde virus was injected. Stylistic comment: The flow of the panels is somewhat unorthodox. Panel A and B follow horizontally, then C and D follow vertically, followed by E-H in a separate column. Consider sequencing either horizontally or vertically to maximize the reader's experience.</p>
<p>Figure 2, comment # 2: It would also be useful to show more rostral sections from these mice, perhaps as a figure supplement, if you have the data. I think there is a lot of value here given a recent paper (Olthof et al., 2019 Jneuro) arguing that the IC receives corticofugal input from areas more rostral to the auditory cortex. So it would be beneficial for the field to know if these other cortical sources do or do not represent likely candidates for behavioral modulation in absence of auditory cortex.</p>
<p>Figure 2, comment #3: You have a striking cluster of retrogradely labeled PPC neurons, and I'm not sure
PPC has been consistently reported as targeting the IC. It would be good to confirm that this is a &quot;true&quot; IC projection as opposed to viral leakage into the SC. Indeed, Figure 2, supplement 2 also shows some visual cortex neurons that are retrogradely labeled. This has bearing on the interpretations, because choice-related activity is rampant in PPC, and thus could be a potential source of the task relevant activity that persists in your recordings. This could be addressed as the point above, by showing the SC sections from these same mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All IC injections were made under visual guidance with the surface of the IC and adjacent brain areas fully exposed after removal of the imaging window. Targeting the IC and steering clear of surrounding structures, including the SC, was therefore relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>We typically observed strong retrograde labeling in the central nucleus after viral injections into the dorsal IC and, given the moderate injection volume (~50 nL at each of up to three sites), it was also typical to see spatially fairly confined labeling at the injection sites.  For the mouse shown in Figure 2, we do not have further images of the IC. This was one of the earliest mice to be included in the study and we did not have access to an automatic slide scanner at the time. We had to acquire confocal images in a ‘manual’ and very time-consuming manner and therefore did not take further IC images for this mouse. We have now included, however, a set of images spanning the whole IC and the adjacent SC sections for the mouse for which we already show sections in Figure 2 - figure supplement 2. These were added as Figure 2 - figure supplement 3A to the manuscript. These images show that the injections were located in the caudal half of the IC and that there was no spillover into the SC - close inspection of those sections did not reveal any labeled cell bodies in the SC. Furthermore, we include as Figure 2 - figure supplement 3B a dozen additional rostral cortical sections of the same mouse illustrating corticocollicular neurons in regions spanning visual, parietal, somatosensory and motor cortex. Given the inclusion of the IC micrographs in the new supplementary figure, we removed panel B from Figure 2. This should also make it easier for the reader to follow the sequencing of the remaining panels.</p>

The presence of retrogradely-labeled corticocollicular neurons in non-temporal cortical areas (Figure 2) was not the result of viral leakage from the dorsal IC injection sites into the superior colliculus (Figure 2 – figure supplement 3).”</p>

<p>Figure 5 (see also public review point #2): I am not convinced that this unsupervised method yields particularly meaningful clusters; a grain of salt should be provided to the reader. For example, Clusters 2, 5, 6, and 7 contain neurons that pretty clearly respond with either short latency excitation or inhibition following the click sound on Hits. I would argue that neurons with such diametrically opposite responses should not be &quot;classified&quot; together.

<p>MAJOR CONCERNS</p>
<p>(1) (Fig. 5) What fraction of individual neurons actually encode task-related information in each animal group? How many neurons respond to sound? The clustering and decoding analyses are interesting, but they obscure these simple questions, which get more directly at the main questions of the study. Suggested approach: For a direct comparison of AC-lesioned and -non-lesioned animals, why not simply compare the mean difference between PSTH response for each neuron individually? To test for trial outcome effects, compare Hit and Miss trials (same stimulus, different behavior) and for sound response effects, compare Hit and False alarm trials (same behavior, different response). How do you align for time in the latter case when there's no stimulus? Align to the first lick event. The authors should include this analysis or explain why their approach of jumping right to analysis of clusters is justified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now calculated the fraction of neurons that encode trial outcome by comparing hit and miss trial activity. That fraction does not differ between non-lesioned animals and lesioned animals as a whole, but is significantly smaller in mice with partial lesions. The author’s suggestion of comparing hit and false alarm trial activity to assess sound responsiveness is problematic because hit trials involve reward delivery and consumption. Consequently, they are behaviorally very different from false alarm trials (not least because hit trials tend to contain much more licking). Therefore, we calculated the fraction of neurons that respond to the acoustic stimulus by comparing activity before and after stimulus onset in miss trials. We found no significant difference between the non-lesioned and lesioned mice or between subgroups.</p>
<p>We have addressed these points with the following changes to the manuscript:</p>
<p>Line 217: “Indeed, close to half (1272 / 2649) of all neurons showed a statistically significant difference in response magnitude between hit and miss trials, while only a small fraction (97 / 2649) exhibited a significant response to the sound.”</p>
<p>Line 307: “Although the proportion of individual neurons with distinct response magnitudes in hit and miss trials in lesioned mice did not differ from that in non-lesioned mice, it was significantly lower when separating out mice with partial lesions (Figure 6 – figure supplement 3).”</p>
<p>Line 648: “Analysis of task-modulated and sound-driven neurons. To identify individual neurons that produced significantly different response magnitudes in hit and miss trials, we calculated the mean activity for each stimulus trial by taking the mean activity over the 5 seconds following stimulus presentation and subtracting the mean activity over the 2 seconds preceding the stimulus during that same trial. A Mann-Whitney U test was then performed to assess whether a neuron showed a statistically significant difference (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.05) in response magnitude between hit and miss trials. The analysis was performed using equal numbers of hit and miss trials at each sound level to ensure balanced sound level distributions. If, for a given sound level, there were more hit than miss trials, we randomly selected a sample of hit trials (without substitution) to match the sample size for the miss trials and vice versa.  Sounddriven neurons were identified by comparing the mean miss trial activity before and after stimulus presentation. Specifically, we performed a Mann-Whitney U test to assess whether there was a statistically significant difference (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.05) between the mean activity over the 2 seconds preceding the stimulus and the mean activity over the 1 second period following stimulus presentation.”</p>

<p>(2) (L 234) &quot;larger field of view&quot;. Do task-related or lesion-dependent effects depend on the subregion of IC imaged? Some anatomists would argue that the IC shell is not a uniform structure, and concomitantly, task-related effects may differ between fields. Did coverage of IC subregions differ between experimental groups? Is there any difference in task related effects between subregions of IC? Or maybe all this work was carried out only in the dorsal area? The differences between lesioned and non-lesioned animals are relatively small, so this may not have a huge impact, but a more nuanced discussion that accounts for observed or potential (if not tested) differences between regions of the IC.</p>
<p>The specific subregion coverage could also impact the decoding analysis (Fig 6), and if possible it might be worth considering an interaction between field of view and lesion size on decoding.</p>

<p>Each day we chose a new imaging location to avoid recording the same neurons more than once and aimed to sample widely across the optically accessible surface of the IC. We typically stopped the experiment only when there were no more new areas to record from. In terms of the depth of the imaged neurons, we were limited by the fact that corticorecipient neurons become sparser with depth and that the signal available from the GCaMP6f labeling of the Ai95 mice becomes rapidly weaker with increasing distance from the surface. This meant that we recorded no deeper than 150 µm from the surface of the IC. Consequently, while there may have been some variability in the average rostrocaudal and mediolateral positioning of imaging locations from animal to animal due to differences between mice in how much of the IC surface was visible, cranial window positioning, and in neuronal labeling etc, our dataset is anatomically uniform in that all recorded neurons receive input from the auditory cortex and are located within 150 µm of the surface of the IC. Therefore, we think it highly unlikely that small sampling differences across animals could have a meaningful impact on the results.</p>
<p>Given that there is no consensus as to where the border between the dorsal and external/lateral cortices of the IC is located and that it is typically difficult to find reliable anatomical reference points (the location of the borders between the IC and surrounding structures is not always obvious during imaging, i.e. a transition from a labeled area to a dark area near the edge of the cranial window could indicate a border with another structure, but also the IC surface sloping away from the window or simply an unlabeled area within the IC), we made no attempt to assign our recordings from corticorecipient neurons to specific subdivisions of the IC.</p>
<p>Changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 195: “We then proceeded to record the activity of corticorecipient neurons within about 150 µm of the dorsal surface of the IC using two-photon microscopy (Figure 4B, Video 1).”</p>
<p>Line 375: “We imaged across the optically accessible dorsal surface of the IC down to a depth of about 150 µm below the surface. Consequently, the neurons we recorded were located predominantly in the dorsal cortex. However, identifying the borders between different subdivisions of the IC is not straightforward and we cannot rule out the possibility that some were located in the lateral cortex.”</p>

<p>(3) (L 482-483) &quot;auditory cortex is not required for the task-related activity recording in IC neurons of mice performing a sound detection task&quot;. Most places in the text are clearer, but this statement is confusing. Yes, animals with lesions can have a &quot;normal&quot;-looking IC, but does that mean that AC does not strongly modulate IC during this behavior in normal animals? The authors have shown convincingly that subcortical areas can both shape behavior and modulate IC normally, but AC may still be required for IC modulation in non-lesioned animals. Given the complexity of this system, the authors should make sure they summarize their results consistently and clearly throughout the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an important point. What we have shown is that corticorecipient dorsal IC neurons in mice without auditory cortex show neural activity during a sound detection task that is largely indistinguishable from the activity of mice with an intact auditory cortex. In lesioned mice, the auditory cortex is thus not required. Whether the IC activity of the non-lesioned group can be shaped by input from the auditory cortex in a meaningful way in other contexts, such as during learning, is a question that our data cannot answer.</p>
<p>Changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 508: &quot;While modulation of IC activity by this descending projection has been implicated in various functions, most notably in the plasticity of auditory processing, we have shown in mice performing a sound detection task that IC neurons show task-related activity in the absence of auditory cortical input.&quot;</p>

<p>LESSER CONCERNS</p>
<p>(L. 106-107) &quot;Optogenetic suppression of cortical activity is thus also unsuitable...&quot; It appears that behavior is not completely abolished by the suppression. One could also imagine using a lower dose of muscimol for partial inactivation of AC feedback. When some behavior persists, it does seem possible to measure task-related changes in the IC. This may not be necessary for the current study, but the authors should consider how these transient methods could be applied usefully in the Discussion. What about inactivation of cortical terminals in the IC? Is that feasible?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our argument is not that acute manipulations are unsuitable because they completely abolish the behavior, but because they significantly alter the behavior. Although it would not be trivial to precisely measure the extent of pharmacological cortical silencing in behaving mice that have been fitted with a midbrain window, it should be possible to titrate the size of a muscimol injection to achieve partial silencing of the auditory cortex that does not fully abolish the ability to detect sounds. However, such an outcome would likely render the data uninterpretable. If no effect on IC activity was observed, it would not be possible to conclude whether this was due to the fact that the auditory cortex was only partially silenced or that projections from the auditory cortex have no influence on the recorded IC activity. Similarly, if IC activity was altered, it would not be possible to say whether this was due to altered descending modulation resulting from the (partially) silenced auditory cortex or to the change in behavior, which would likely be reflected in the choice-related activity measured in the IC.</p>
<p>Silencing of corticocollicular axons in the IC is potentially a more promising approach and we did devote a considerable amount of time and effort to establishing a method that would allow us to simultaneously image IC neurons while silencing corticocollicular axons, trying both eNpHR3.0 and Jaws with different viral labeling approaches and mouse lines. However, we ultimately abandoned those attempts because we were not convinced that we had achieved sufficient silencing or that we would be able to convincingly verify this. Furthermore, axonal silencing comes with its own pitfalls and the interpretation of its consequences is not straightforward. Given that our discussion already contains a section (line 421) on axonal silencing, we do not feel there would be any benefit in adding to that.</p>

<p>Also, have the authors considered measuring a peri-lick response? The difference between hit and miss trials could be perceptual or it could reflect differences in motor activity.

<p>Given a sufficient number of catch trials, it should be possible to decode false alarm and correct rejection trials.

<p>Thank you for this suggestion. Gimenez et al.

(2015) reported that discrimination performance is mildly impaired after lesioning auditory cortex. Where the results of Gimenez et al. (2015) stand out is in the comparatively mild impairments that were seen in their task when they used muscimol injections, which contrast with the (much) larger impairments reported by others (e.g. Talwar et al., 2001; Li et al., 2017;  Jaramillo and Zador, 2014).</p>

<p>Changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 666: “While clustering is a useful approach for organizing and visualizing the activity of large and heterogeneous populations of neurons we need to be mindful that, given continuous distributions of response properties, the locations of cluster boundaries can be somewhat arbitrary and/or reflect idiosyncrasies of the chosen method and thus vary from one algorithm to another. We employed an approach very similar to that described in Namboodiri et al. (2019) because it is thought to produce stable results in high-dimensional neural data (Hirokawa et al. 2019).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors must absolutely clarify if the hit versus misses decoding and clustering analysis is done for a single sound level or for multiple sound levels (what is the fraction of trials for each sound leve?). If the authors did it for multiple sound levels they should redo all analyses sound-level by sound-level, or for a single sound level if there is one that dominates. No doubt that there is information about the trial outcome in IC, but it should not be over-estimated by a confound with stimulus information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important point. The original clustering analysis was carried out across different sound levels. We have now carried out additional analysis for distinguishing between two alternative explanations of the data, which were also raised by reviewer #1. – that the difference in neural activity between hit and miss trials could reflect a) the animals’ behavior or b) relatively more hit trials at higher sound levels, which would be expected to produce stronger responses. If the data favored b), we would expect no difference in activity between hit and miss trials when plotted separately for different sound levels. The new figure 4 - figure supplement 1 indicates that that is not the case. Hit and miss trial activity are clearly distinct even when plotted separately for different sound levels, confirming that this difference in activity reflects the animals’ behavior rather than sensory information.</p>
<p>We made the following changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 214: “While averaging across all neurons cannot capture the diversity of responses, the averaged response profiles suggest that it is mostly trial outcome rather than the acoustic stimulus and neuronal sensitivity to sound level that shapes those responses (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1).”</p>
<p>Differences in the distributions of sound levels in the different trial types could also potentially confound the decoding into hit and miss trials. Our analysis actually aimed to take this into account but, unfortunately, we failed to include sufficient details in the methods section.</p>
<p>Changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 710: “Rather than including all the trials in a given session, only trials of intermediate difficulty were used for the decoding analysis. More specifically, we only included trials across five sound levels, comprising the lowest sound level that exceeded a d’ of 1.5 plus the two sound levels below and above that level. That ensured that differences in sound level distributions would be small, while still giving us a sufficient number of trials to perform the decoding analysis.“</p>
<p>In this context, it is worth bearing in mind that a) the decoding analysis was done on a frame-byframe basis, meaning that the decoding score achieved early in the trial has no impact on the decoding score at later time points in the trial, b) sound-driven activity predominantly occurs immediately after stimulus onset and is largely over about 1 s into the trial (see cluster 3, for instance, or average miss trial activity in figure 4 - figure supplement 1), c) decoding performance of the behavioral outcome starts to plateau 500-1000 ms into the trial and remains high until it very gradually begins to decline after about 2 s into the trial. In other words, decoding performance remains high far longer than the stimulus would be expected to have an impact on the neurons’ activity. Therefore, we would expect any residual bias due to differences in the sound level distribution that our approach did not control for to be restricted to the very beginning of the trial and not to meaningfully impact the conclusions derived from the decoding analysis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we carried out an additional decoding analysis for one imaging session in which we had a sufficient number of trials to perform the analysis not only over the five (59, 62, 65, 68, 71 dB SPL) original sound levels, but also over a reduced range of three (62, 65, 68 dB SPL) sound levels, as well as a single (65 dB SPL) sound level (Figure 6 - figure supplement 1). The mean sound level difference between the hit trial distributions and miss trial distributions for these three conditions were 3.08, 1.01 and 0 dB, respectively. This analysis suggests that decoding performance is not meaningfully impacted by changing the range of sound levels (and sound level distributions) other than that including fewer sound levels means fewer trials and thus noisier decoding.</p>
<p>Changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 287: ”...and was not meaningfully affected by differences in sound level distributions between hit and miss trials (Figure 6 – figure supplement 1).”</p>
<p>Finally, in order to supplement the decoding analysis, we determined for each individual neuron whether there was a significant difference between the average hit and average miss trial activity. Note that this was done using equal numbers of hit and miss trials at each sound level to ensure balanced sound level distributions and to rule out any potential confound of sound level. This revealed that the proportion of neurons containing “information about trial outcome” was generally very high, close to 50% on average, and not significantly different between lesioned and non-lesioned mice.</p>
<p>Changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 307: “Although the proportion of individual neurons with distinct response magnitudes in hit and miss trials in lesioned mice did not differ from that in non-lesioned mice, it was significantly lower when separating out mice with partial lesions (Figure 6 – figure supplement 3).”</p>
<p>Line 648: “Analysis of task-modulated and sound-driven neurons. To identify individual neurons that produced significantly different response magnitudes in hit and miss trials, we calculated the mean activity for each stimulus trial by taking the mean activity over the 5 seconds following stimulus presentation and subtracting the mean activity over the 2 seconds preceding the stimulus during that same trial. A Mann-Whitney U test was then performed to assess whether a neuron showed a statistically significant difference (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.05) in response magnitude between hit and miss trials. The analysis was performed using equal numbers of hit and miss trials at each sound level to ensure balanced sound level distributions. If, for a given sound level, there were more hit than miss trials we randomly selected a sample of hit trials (without substitution) to match the sample size for the miss trials and vice versa. ”</p>

<p>(2) I have the feeling that the authors do not exploit fully the functional data recorded with two-imaging. They identify several cluster but do not describe their functional differences. For example, cluster 3 is obviously mainly sensory driven as it is not modulated by outcome. This could be mentioned. This could also be used to rule out that trial outcome is the results of insufficient sensory inputs. Could this cluster be used to predict trial outcome at the onset response? Could it be used to predict the presence of the sound, and with which accuracy. The authors discuss a bit the different cluster type, but in a very elusive manner. I recognize that one should be careful with the use of signal analysis methods in calcium imaging but a simple linear deconvolution of the calcium dynamic who help to illustrate the conclusions that the authors propose based on peak responses. It would also be very interesting to align the clusters responses (deconvolved) to the timing of licking and rewards event to check if some clusters do not fire when mice perform licks before the sound comes. It would help clarify if the behavioral signals described here require both the presence of the sound and the behavioral action or are just the reflection of the motor command. As noted by the authors, some clusters have late peak responses (2 and 5). However, 2 and 5 are not equivalent and a deconvolution would evidence that much better. 2 has late onset firing. 5 has early onset but prolonged firing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s statement that “cluster 3 is obviously mainly sensory driven”. In the Discussion we refer to cluster 3 as having a “largely behaviorally invariant response profile to the auditory stimulus” (line X), which is consistent with the statement of the reviewer. With regard to the reviewer’s suggestion to describe the “functional differences” between the clusters, we would like to refer to the subsequent three sentences of the same paragraph in which we speculate on the cognitive and behavioral variables that may underlie the response profiles of different clusters. Given the limitations imposed by the task structure, we do not think it is justified to expand on this.</p>
<p>We have added an additional analysis in order to explicitly address the question of which neurons are sound responsive (please also see response to point 3 below and to point 1 of reviewer #2). That trial outcome could be predicted on the basis of only the sound-responsive neurons’ activity during the initial period of the trial (“predict trial outcome at the onset response”) is unlikely given their small number (only 97 of 2649 neurons show a statistically significant sound-evoked response) and given that only a minority (42/98) of those sound-driven neurons are also modulated by trial outcome within that initial trial period (i.e. 0-1s after stimulus onset; data not shown).</p>
<p>Changes to manuscript.</p>
<p>Line 219: “..., while only a small fraction (97 / 2649) exhibited a significant response to the sound.”</p>
<p>Line 658: “Sound-driven neurons were identified by comparing the mean miss trial activity before and after stimulus presentation. Specifically, we performed a Mann-Whitney U test to assess whether there was a statistically significant difference (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.05) between the mean activity over the 2 seconds preceding the stimulus and the mean activity over the 1 second period following stimulus presentation. This analysis was performed using miss trials with click intensities from 53 dB SPL to 65 dB SPL (many sessions contained very few or no miss trials at higher sound levels).”</p>
<p>While calcium traces represent an indirect measure of neural activity, deconvolution does not necessarily provide an accurate picture of the spiking underlying those traces and has the potential to introduce additional problems. For instance, deconvolution algorithms tend to perform poorly at inferring the spiking of inhibited neurons (Vanwalleghem et al., 2021). Given that suppression is such a prominent feature of IC activity and is evident both in our calcium data as well as in the electrophysiology data of others (Franceschi and Barkat, 2021), we decided against using deconvolved spikes in our analyses. See also the side-by-side comparison below of the hit and miss trial activity of one example neuron based on either the calcium trace (left) or deconvolved spikes (right) (extracted using the OASIS algorithm (Friedrich et al., 2017) incorporated into suite2p (Pachitariu et al., 2016).</p>

<p>As requested by reviewer #2 and mentioned in response to the previous point, we have now quantified the number of neurons in the dataset that produced significant responses to sound (97 / 2649). For a given imaging area, the fraction of neurons that show a statistically significant change in neural activity following presentation of a click of between 53 dB SPL and 65 dB SPL rarely exceeded ten percent. While that number is low, it is not necessarily surprising given the moderate intensity and very short duration of the stimuli. For comparison: Using the same transgenics, labeling approach and imaging setup and presenting 200-ms long pure tones at 60 dB SPL with frequencies between 2 kHz and 64 kHz, we typically find that between a quarter and a third of neurons in a given imaging area exhibit a statistically significant response (data not shown).</p>

For comparison: Using the same transgenics, labeling approach and imaging setup and presenting 200-ms long pure tones at 60 dB SPL with frequencies between 2 kHz and 64 kHz, we typically find that between a quarter and a third of neurons in a given imaging area exhibit a statistically significant response (data not shown).”</p>

<p>(4) In the discussion, the interpretation of different transient and permanent cortical inactivation experiment is very interesting and well balanced given the complexity of the issue. There is nevertheless a comment that is difficult to follow. The authors state:</p>
<p>If cortical lesioning results in a greater weight being placed on the activity in spared subcortical circuits for perceptual judgements, we would expect the accuracy with which trial-by-trial outcomes could be read out from IC neurons to be greater in mice without auditory cortex. However, that was not the case.</p>
<p>However, there is no indication that the activity they observe in shell IC is causal to the behavioral decision and likely it is not. There is also no indication that the behavioral signals seen by the authors reflect the weight put on the subcortical pathway for behavior. I find this argument handwavy and would remove it.</p>

<p>While we are happy to amend this section, we would not wish to remove it because a) we believe that the point we are trying to make here is an important and reasonable one and b) because it is consistent with the reviewer’s comment. Hopefully, the following will make this clearer: In order for the mouse to make a perceptual judgment and act upon it - in the context of our task, hearing a sound and then licking a spout - auditory information needs to be read out and converted into a motor command. If the auditory cortex normally plays a key role in such perceptual judgments, cortical lesions would require the animal to base its decisions on the information available from the remaining auditory structures, potentially including the auditory midbrain. This might result in a greater correspondence between the mouse’s behavior and the neural activity in those structures. That we did not observe this outcome for the IC could mean that the auditory cortex did not contribute to the relevant perceptual judgments (sound detection) in the first place. Therefore, no reweighting of signals from the other structures is necessary. Alternatively, greater weight might be placed exclusively on structures other than the auditory midbrain, e.g. the thalamus. The latter would imply that the contribution of the IC remains the same. This includes the possibility that the IC shell does not play a causal role in the behavioral decision – in either control mice or mice with cortical lesions – as suggested by the reviewer.</p>

<p>(5) In Fig. 5 the two colors used in B and C are the same although they describe different categories.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The dark green and ‘deep orange’ we used to distinguish between non-lesioned and lesioned in Figure 5C are slightly lighter than the colors used to distinguish between these two categories in other figures and therefore might be more easily confused with the blue and red in Figure 5B. This has been changed.</p>
