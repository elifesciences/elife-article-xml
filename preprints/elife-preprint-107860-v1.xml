<title>Abstract</title><p>Fever is a hallmark of malaria. Several studies have linked febrile temperatures to reduced parasite viability, but also to increased cytoadhesion, a key driver of pathology. However, different mechanisms have been proposed to cause changes in cytoadhesion and parasite sensitivity to heat. Here, we demonstrate that exposure of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) to physiologically relevant febrile heat stress (39 °C), derived from patient data, enhances cytoadhesion through increased trafficking of the major virulence factor PfEMP1 to the iRBC surface. This phenomenon is not limited to PfEMP1 and common laboratory strains, as it extends to the surface nutrient channel PSAC in four clinical isolates of diverse geographic origin. The increased surface protein display occurs without changes in overall protein expression or parasite developmental progression. Using phosphoproteomics and proximity labelling, we find that elevated temperature also increases trafficking and phosphorylation of exported proteins into the RBC. Enhanced export is likely reliant on the presence of a transmembrane domain as shown by NanoLuc reporter assays. Collectively, our results indicate that febrile temperatures commonly experienced during infection can accelerate protein export, likely at the parasitophorous vacuole. This enhanced export following heat stress is relevant because increased cytoadhesion could influence disease severity through earlier iRBC sequestration and elevated bound parasite mass.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases and is caused by unicellular eukaryotic parasites of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genus. Of the six species that infect humans, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for the vast majority of malaria-related deaths. An estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608,000 deaths occur annually <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The pathology of malaria arises during the asexual replication phase of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> within red blood cells (RBCs). This cycle involves RBC invasion, intracellular growth, and the production of daughter merozoites, which are released upon host cell rupture, leading to exponential parasite growth.</p>
<p>Fever is a hallmark of malaria and a defining feature of the host immune response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection. Malaria-associated fever is thought to arise from pathogen-associated and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) released during RBC rupture as parasites egress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Febrile heat stress is frequently encountered by <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and the parasite has likely evolved mechanisms to adapt to and prosper under these conditions. As asexual parasites progress through the 48-hour life cycle, they develop through three key stages: ring stage (0–24 hours post-invasion (hpi)), trophozoite stage (24-40 hpi), and schizont stage (40-48 hpi).</p>
<p>Previous studies found that the first half of the asexual life cycle (0-24 hpi) is more resistant to heat stress than the second half (24-48 hpi) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Research into the impact of elevated temperatures on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> growth and gene regulation has provided key insights into the parasite’s response to heat stress. Random mutagenesis screening of 992 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genes at 41 °C identified more than 200 mutants with significantly altered growth responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Transcriptomic analyses of wild-type <italic>P. falciparum</italic> following heat stress (40 °C and 41 °C) revealed significant changes in gene expression. Oakley et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> found that these changes mirror apoptotic cell responses, while Tinto-Font et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> identified a transcription factor (PfAP2-HS) required for parasite growth at both normal (37 °C) and elevated (40 °C) temperatures.</p>
<p>Cytoadhesion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected red blood cells to the vascular endothelium is a key virulence trait. It is mediated by the exported and surface-displayed Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1), which prevents splenic clearance. The specific PfEMP1 variant expressed determines the site of sequestration. For example, expression of the VAR2CSA variant enables infected red blood cells to bind chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placenta <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. PfEMP1-mediated sequestration in host organs is unique to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and is a major driver of disease severity, contributing to serious complications such as cerebral and placental malaria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Fever-like temperatures have been reported to increase PfEMP1 on the surface of RBCs, although this has been contested as described in more detail below <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Approximately 10% of the proteins encoded by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> are predicted to be exported beyond the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) into the parasitophorous vacuole lumen (PVL) and subsequently across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) into the RBC cytosol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. These exported proteins remodel the host cell, mediating processes such as nutrient acquisition and immune evasion. Exported proteins contain one of two trafficking elements: PEXEL-containing proteins, which undergo N-terminal cleavage before export, and PEXEL-negative exported proteins (PNEPs) which are not cleaved but contain transmembrane domains required for export <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>PfEMP1 is trafficked to the red blood cell surface via parasite-derived membranous organelles known as Maurer’s clefts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This process relies on several exported proteins, many unique to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, including FIKK4.1, an exported kinase that localises to the red blood cell periphery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.Deletion of FIKK4.1 leads to a 55% reduction in PfEMP1-mediated cytoadhesion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Even though several proteins have been identified that are important for PfEMP1 trafficking, the precise mechanisms that underlie PfEMP1 surface translocation remain poorly understood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Several studies have examined the effects of febrile heat stress on iRBC cytoadhesion, showing contradictory results. Udomsangpetch <italic>et al.</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> reported that heat stress increased iRBC cytoadhesion to endothelium expressing the PfEMP1 cognate receptor, correlating with higher PfEMP1 levels on the iRBC surface. In contrast, Oakley <italic>et al.</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> found no change in the proportion of iRBCs displaying PfEMP1 on the surface following heat stress. Furthermore, trophozoite stage iRBCs become more rigid under heat stress, a property predicted to aid parasite sequestration in organs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Zhang et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> reported an alternative mechanism whereby cytoadhesion increased due to elevated phosphatidylserine (PS) and not PfEMP1 on the iRBC surface following heat stress. One protein that has been linked to both heat stress and PfEMP1 surface levels is the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exported protein HSP70x. Charnaud et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, but not Cobb et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, found HSP70x to be essential for normal PfEMP1 trafficking, although both studies concluded that HSP70x is dispensable for intraerythrocytic parasite growth at 37 °C. Charnaud <italic>et al.</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, further reported no significant growth differences in HSP70x knockout parasites under heat stress or nutrient-limiting conditions. In contrast, Day et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> observed reduced parasitaemia in HSP70x knockdown parasites in the cycle following heat stress, compared to wild-type strains. In summary, whether febrile temperatures modulate cytoadhesion and by what mechanism remains unclear. Given that increased cytoadherent iRBC biomass in febrile patients could contribute to disease severity, further studies are important.</p>
<p>The divergent outcomes of the above-mentioned studies could be due to differences in the heat-stress conditions used, including those that affect parasite viability. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> can cause gene loss of exported proteins, and transfections can impose a genetic bottleneck that may enrich such mutants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. It is therefore not uncommon to observe defects in cytoadhesion after generating transgenic parasites. Consequently, loss of cytoadhesion without restoring the phenotype by gene complementation or using conditional approaches should be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>Here, we assessed how febrile heat stress influences exported protein trafficking and cytoadhesion in <italic>P. falciparum.</italic> We first defined three key criteria: 1) a physiologically relevant heat stress commonly occurring in malaria patients, 2) its impact on parasite growth across asexual stages, and 3) the normal timing of PfEMP1 trafficking to the iRBC surface. Using this framework, we tested whether febrile heat stress modulates iRBC cytoadhesion and its underlying mechanism. We show that heat stress increases cytoadhesion of iRBCs, coinciding with a greater proportion of infected cells displaying PfEMP1 on their surface. Comparative phosphoproteomic analysis and proximity labelling of the Maurer’s clefts protein environment suggest that elevated temperatures enhance protein trafficking into the red blood cell cytosol. NanoLuciferase (NanoLuc) fusion proteins and compartment-specific isolation confirmed a greater abundance of PfEMP1 in the RBC cytosol following heat stress. Constitutively expressed reporter proteins suggest that transmembrane domains are key contributors to this increased trafficking, independent of overall protein expression levels. This increased surface trafficking is not limited to PfEMP1. It also extends to the Plasmodial Surface Anion Channel (PSAC), a parasite-derived nutrient channel, across four <italic>P. falciparum</italic> clinical isolates from diverse geographic origins.</p>

<title>A physiologically relevant and non-destructive febrile heat stress increases iRBC cytoadhesion and surface PfEMP1 display</title>
<p>While a variety of temperatures mimicking febrile heat stress have been used in previous studies, these have generally not been assessed in relation to parasite viability, or common febrile temperatures in patients. Therefore, we sought to initially establish conditions that reflect the typical febrile response in malaria patients, focusing on a time window when PfEMP1 is exported and parasite viability remains unaffected.</p>
<p>To approximate the most common febrile temperature in individuals infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we analysed patient temperature data from two publicly available supplementary datasets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The average tympanic febrile temperature (defined as greater than 38 °C) in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria cases was 38.9 °C and 39.1 °C, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A-B</xref>). Temperatures ≥ 41 °C were rarely recorded in either dataset. Analysis of microarray data from Mok <italic>et al.</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> showed that higher patient temperatures were associated with a younger average age of circulating parasites, possibly reflecting increased cytoadherence and sequestration of more mature stages during fever (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To assess the impact of heat stress on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (NF54 DiCre strain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>) growth and replication, parasites were exposed to elevated temperatures (38-41 °C) for eight hours across six different developmental time windows. Parasitaemia was measured in the subsequent cycle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar to the observations by Kwiatkowski <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, we found that parasites in the first half of the cycle (0-24 hpi) were more resistant to heat stress than those in the second half (24-48 hpi). However, our data further reveal that recently invaded parasites (0-8 hpi) are less resistant to elevated temperatures compared to later ring-stage parasites (8-16 hpi and 16-24 hpi). We also observe that exposure to 41 °C for eight hours is highly destructive to the parasite, irrespective of the developmental stage at which it is applied.</p>
<p>To test whether PfEMP1 surface translocation is affected at the mean febrile temperature observed in patients, we first determined the percentage of iRBCs maintained at 37 °C that display PfEMP1 (VAR2CSA) on the surface from 12-40 hpi. These experiments revealed a dynamic window of surface expression between 16-32 hpi, consistent with previous reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These foundational data informed the identification of a heat stress window (39 °C) that mimics fever-range temperatures, overlaps with VAR2CSA trafficking to the iRBC surface (16-24 hpi), and was not expected to impair parasite growth.</p>
<p>We next subjected tightly synchronised <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cultures to elevated temperatures (39 °C) or control conditions (37 °C) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) to assess the impact of heat on cytoadhesion and PfEMP1 surface translocation. Following heat stress, significantly more iRBCs (57.6% ±19.4%) cytoadhered under physiological flow conditions (1 dyne/cm²) compared to those maintained at 37 °C, which was set as the baseline and normalised to 100% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). This increase in cytoadhesion correlated with a significantly higher percentage of iRBCs displaying PfEMP1 (VAR2CSA) on their surface (20.5% ±4.2%) compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Importantly, heat stress did not accelerate parasite development through the asexual life cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these data, in line with Udomsangpetch <italic>et al.</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> show that more iRBCs cytoadhere following febrile heat stress as the parasites develop from ring stages to trophozoites. This coincides with a significantly greater number of iRBCs displaying PfEMP1 on the surface. The mechanism underlying the increased translocation of PfEMP1 to the surface remains unknown.</p>

<title>Red blood cells infected with four <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains from different geographic origins exhibit increased sensitivity to sorbitol following heat stress</title>
<p>To investigate whether proteins other than PfEMP1 are trafficked differently during heat stress, we sought to identify another cell surface protein that is both detectable and essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth, ensuring its expression across all <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains. One such protein complex is the Plasmodial Surface Anion Channel (PSAC), which facilitates nutrient uptake and is exported to the surface of iRBCs. PSAC comprises three proteins: RhopH2, RhopH3, and one of several cytoadherence-linked asexual gene (CLAG) variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, which contain a putative transmembrane domain (TMD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. All three components are expressed during the late stages of the parasite life cycle.

<p>We found that significantly more NF54 iRBCs were sensitive to sorbitol treatment following heat stress (53.3% ±5.2%) compared to normal conditions (26.2% ±8.6%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-D</xref>). To assess whether heat-induced changes in protein surface translocation are conserved across <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains, we extended our analysis to three geographically distinct isolates: HB3 (Honduras, 1984), Cam3.II (Cambodia, 2012), and HL2208 (Uganda, 2024) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In all three strains, heat stress (39 °C) resulted in a significant increase in iRBC sensitivity to sorbitol lysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E-G</xref>), consistent with findings in the NF54 strain. Unless PSAC components are modified (for example through post-translational modifications) to increase PSAC activity following heat stress, these results indicate that earlier trafficking of PSAC to the iRBC surface under febrile heat stress is a conserved phenomenon across diverse <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates. These results further indicate that the increased membrane trafficking described above is not restricted to PfEMP1.</p>

<title>A <italic>P. falciparum</italic> heat stress phosphoproteome reveals substantial enrichment in phosphorylation of exported proteins by exported FIKK kinases</title>
<p>We next sought to identify factors that influence protein trafficking to the iRBC surface. Our previous work identified the exported protein kinase FIKK4.1 as important for efficient surface translocation of PfEMP1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. This kinase is also required for phosphorylation of RhopH3 (PF3D7_0905400), a component of the PSAC complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and may therefore play a role in regulating the trafficking of both proteins. FIKK4.1 is part of the FIKK kinase family, which includes 19 kinases in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, 18 of which are likely exported into the RBC. Several other exported kinases, including FIKK10.2, a kinase localised to the Maurer’s clefts, phosphorylate proteins involved in PfEMP1 export but do not affect PfEMP1 trafficking at 37 °C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. To broadly investigate whether FIKK kinases respond to elevated temperatures and potentially contribute to increased surface translocation of PfEMP1 and PSAC, we measured the phosphoproteome of iRBCs following heat stress and control conditions.</p>
<p>Following the same heat stress window previously shown to increase cytoadhesion (16-24 hpi, 39 °C), parasites were returned to 37 °C until 30 hpi. At this point, iRBCs were enriched from uninfected cells by density separation and lysed in 8 M urea. Proteins were digested and labelled with tandem mass tags (TMT), and enriched phosphopeptides were identified by LC-MS/MS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tables1">Supplementary Tables 1-2</xref>). A total of 196 phosphopeptides (1.2% of those detected) were differentially phosphorylated following heat stress, with 143 showing increased phosphorylation (&gt;1 Log2FC) and 53 showing decreased phosphorylation (&lt;–1 Log2FC). Notably, 71% of the heat-enriched phosphopeptides mapped to exported proteins, which far exceeds the approximately 10% of the total proteome predicted to be exported (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B-C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.

<p>We have previously mapped the phosphorylation events that depend on each FIKK kinase under normal temperature (37 °C) conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. To determine whether the heat-induced phosphosites were novel or dependent on known FIKKs, we compared heat-induced phosphosites with our prior datasets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. This analysis suggested that most heat-dependent phosphorylation could be largely attributed to FIKK10.2 and, to a lesser extent, FIKK4.1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). To validate these results, we performed a second phosphoproteomic analysis following heat stress conditions using several previously generated exported FIKK knockout strains (FIKK1, FIKK4.1, FIKK4.2, all FIKK9s, FIKK10.1, and FIKK10.2). This confirmed that FIKK10.2 is required for the majority of phosphorylation increases observed in exported proteins during heat stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tables3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, while FIKK4.1 was previously shown to be necessary for efficient PfEMP1 surface translocation at 37 °C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, we still observed a significant increase in PfEMP1 surface levels in the absence of FIKK4.1 following heat stress. Despite being critical for most heat-stress phosphorylation events, FIKK10.2 was also not required for the heat-induced increase in PfEMP1 surface presentation or sorbitol sensitivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E-F</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether disruption of proteins targeted by FIKK kinases during heat stress might help identify required mediators of early trafficking, two additional DiCre-mediated conditional knockout strains of HA-tagged lines were generated. HSP70x (PF3D7_0831700), previously implicated to have a role in PfEMP1 trafficking and heat stress survival, showed increased phosphorylation under heat stress conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. PF3D7_0702500, a Maurer’s cleft-residing protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> exhibited the highest number of phosphosites with increased phosphorylation in response to heat stress. Both tagged proteins localised as previously reported and were efficiently excised upon RAP treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figures 6-7</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. However, neither HSP70x nor PF3D7_0702500 disruption was found to have an effect on heat stress survival, PfEMP1 trafficking, PSAC surface expression at 37 °C, or were required for accelerated heat stress trafficking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figures 8-13</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these data show that elevated temperature leads to increased phosphorylation of exported proteins, with the majority of this modification mediated by the Maurer’s cleft-localising kinase FIKK10.2. However, neither FIKK4.1, FIKK10.2 nor the putative substrates HSP70x and PF3D7_0702500 are required for the enhanced trafficking of PfEMP1 or the increased sorbitol sensitivity, which is likely driven by elevated PSAC trafficking. Based on these findings, we reasoned that the observed increase in phosphorylation may result from greater protein flux into or through subcellular compartments where FIKK4.1 and FIKK10.2 localise.</p>

<title>The FIKK10.2-TurboID Maurer’s cleft proxiome during normal and febrile temperatures</title>
<p>FIKK10.2 is localised to the Maurer’s clefts, which are key trafficking hubs established by the parasite in the RBC. To measure trafficking of proteins through the Maurer’s Clefts, we generated a C-terminal fusion of endogenous FIKK10.2 and TurboID (FIKK10.2-TurboID) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>). In the presence of biotin and ATP, TurboID generates and releases reactive biotin molecules that bind to lysine residues in proximal (up to ∼10 nm) proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Biotinylated proteins are then digested, and the resulting biotinylated peptides are enriched by immunoprecipitation, quantified by LC-MS/MS and mapped to the corresponding proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To assess how the FIKK10.2-TurboID proxiome changes during heat stress, we measured three conditions: (A) continuous biotin labelling without heat stress to identify proteins that are either persistently or transiently proximal to FIKK10.2 throughout the asexual cycle, (B) biotin labelling from 16-24 hpi without heat stress to capture interactions during PfEMP1 trafficking, and (C) biotin labelling with heat stress from 16-24 hpi to determine heat-induced changes in FIKK10.2’s local protein environment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A-B</xref>).</p>

<p>Across all conditions, a total of 316 unique biotinylated peptides were detected, comprising 278 from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and 38 from human proteins. In condition A, where biotin was present throughout the parasite life cycle, 256 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> peptides were consistently detected in every replicate. Of these, 231 peptides (90%) mapped to 39 exported proteins, underscoring the specificity and robustness of this peptide-level enrichment approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. These proteins are very likely to be either trafficked through or localised to the Maurer’s clefts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tables4">Supplementary Tables 4-5</xref>). Many of these proteins have predicted transmembrane domains and by mapping the FIKK10.2-TurboID enriched peptides on their projected topology, the red blood cell cytosol facing domain can be predicted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 15</xref>).</p>
<p>Although six peptides were detected only in the 39 °C heat-stressed biotin-pulsed condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), they originate from proteins also present in the other conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D-E</xref>). Thus, these TurboID data indicate that FIKK10.2 does not encounter unique proteins during heat stress that are absent under normal conditions. Based on these data, we hypothesised that a greater number of exported proteins are in proximity to FIKK10.2 during febrile heat stress, suggesting increased trafficking of proteins to or through the Maurer’s clefts. These proteins are phosphorylated by FIKK10.2 during their transit. One possible origin of increased trafficking of exported proteins could be increased translocation of proteins through the PVM into the RBC cytosol.</p>

<p>To quantify export efficiency under normal (37 °C) and heat-stressed (39 °C) conditions, we measured NanoLuc activity across three distinct compartments: (A) the RBC cytosol, (B) the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), and (C) the total parasite/RBC lysate. These compartments were selectively isolated in the supernatant following different permeabilisation protocols. Equinatoxin II (EqtII) permeabilises the RBC membrane while leaving the PVM intact, saponin (SAP) releases proteins from both the RBC cytosol and PV lumen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, and NP40 detergent solubilises all non-nuclear proteins within the parasite, PV, and RBC cytosol (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C-D</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, NanoLuc activity in the NP40 supernatant did not differ significantly between control and heat-stressed conditions, suggesting that total VAR2CSA expression remains unchanged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This supports our hypothesis that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> does not markedly accelerate its developmental program or significantly alter protein expression in response to heat stress, and that increased cytoadhesion under febrile conditions is more likely due to altered protein trafficking.</p>
<p>Notably, following heat stress, NanoLuc activity significantly increased (58% more) in the EqtII permeabilised supernatant but not in the SAP fraction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This suggests that heat stress promotes trafficking of VAR2CSA from the PV into downstream compartments such as the Maurer’s clefts and ultimately to the RBC surface.</p>

<title>Transmembrane domain containing exported reporter proteins are trafficked more efficiently into the red blood cell cytosol during febrile heat stress</title>

<p>These data suggest that TMD containing proteins are specifically affected in trafficking under heat conditions. To directly test this, the TMD from PF3D7_0702500 was added to REX3-NanoLuc to generate REX3-TMD-NanoLuc. Trafficking of REX3-TMD-NanoLuc into the RBC cytosol was less efficient than REX3-NanoLuc at 37 °C. However, following heat stress, 57.6% more REX3-TMD-NanoLuc was detected in the RBC cytosolic fraction compared to normal temperature conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). A non-exported NanoLuc strain was also generated as a negative control and showed negligible signal in the exported compartments, with no significant change under heat stress (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these data suggest that elevated febrile temperatures alleviate a trafficking bottleneck between the PV and the RBC cytosol, at least for the TMD-containing proteins examined in this study.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanism underlying increased iRBC cytoadhesion following febrile heat stress is not well understood, with both PfEMP1-dependent and independent pathways proposed. Variability in experimental heat stress conditions, including differences in temperature that affect parasite viability, as well as differences in duration and timing within the asexual cycle, likely contributes to the divergent findings reported across studies. We show that elevated temperatures at multiple stages of the parasite life cycle negatively affect parasite viability. These growth-impairing conditions are likely to trigger significant stress or apoptosis-like responses. To minimise the potential for such stress responses to confound cytoadhesion outcomes, we selected a non-destructive heat stress condition (39 °C, 16-24 hpi) for our experiments. More extreme protocols may not accurately reflect the febrile temperatures typically experienced by malaria patients. In addition to the PfEMP1-dependent mechanism examined here, increased phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of iRBCs following 1 hour at 40 °C has been observed and coincides with increased cytoadhesion to CHO cells expressing endothelial receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Although a role for PfEMP1 in this increased cytoadhesion was not identified previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, our findings indicate that PfEMP1 surface expression contributes possibly alongside PS to the heightened cytoadhesion during fever. However, genetic deletion of proteins required for PS exposure and PfEMP1 surface translocation may be necessary to unequivocally establish the individual contribution of each to overall cytoadhesion.</p>
<p>Our data confirm a previous study reporting increased PfEMP1 on the red blood cell surface following febrile heat stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. We propose that this increase in surface trafficking results from a reduction in a trafficking bottleneck during elevated temperature. Elevated temperature does not only affect PfEMP1 surface translocation but also enhances trafficking of other TMD-containing proteins into the RBC. This likely results in increased PSAC levels at the iRBC surface, although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the observed increase in sorbitol sensitivity is due to enhanced PSAC activity following heat stress, for example through post-translational modifications. However, we consider this explanation less likely, as deletion of the kinases known to phosphorylate PSAC components had no measurable effect on sorbitol sensitivity. Using several complementary approaches, including NanoLuc reporter assays, proteomics, DNA content measurements, egress timing, and assessments of subsequent replication, we conclude that under our heat stress conditions (39 °C, 16 to 24 hpi), parasite development does not accelerate. These findings indicate that the observed phenotypes are due to differences in protein trafficking.</p>
<p>While heat stress induces changes in the Maurer’s cleft proxiome and phosphoproteome, we did not identify any proteins that were altered exclusively under these conditions compared to 37 °C. This suggests that proteins involved in accelerated trafficking during heat stress are also present and likely functional at normal temperatures, rather than being uniquely expressed or specifically localised in response to elevated temperature.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which proteins are differentially exported at elevated temperatures remains unknown, although differential trafficking requirements for TMD and non-TMD-containing proteins have been proposed at both the PPM and PVM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Our reporter assay measures export into the RBC compartment but cannot definitively distinguish whether the trafficking differences occur at the level of the PVM or later, for example between the Maurer’s clefts and the red blood cell plasma membrane. Nevertheless, the PTEX complex, which mediates protein translocation from the PV through the PVM into the RBC cytosol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, is a likely candidate to facilitate increased export of TMD-containing proteins under heat stress. We excluded HSP70x to be involved in protein trafficking as we show that conditional deletion of HSP70x does not affect PfEMP1 surface translocation.</p>
<p>What may be the consequences of accelerated PfEMP1 trafficking, or protein surface export during fever in a human infection? Our data show that a greater proportion of iRBCs are sensitive to sorbitol following heat stress, suggesting that more cells may present functional PSAC at the surface. Increased function of PSAC could potentially enhance nutrient uptake under these strained conditions. Elevated PfEMP1 levels at the iRBC surface during heat stress may help counteract the negative effects of increased cellular rigidity that occur at higher temperatures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. As cytoadhesion is thought to prevent filtration of the rigidified iRBC in the spleen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, concurrent increased cytoadhesion may need to occur with increased stiffness.</p>
<p>If increased body temperature leads to an increased cytoadhering parasite load, malaria symptoms may be exacerbated. The observed reduction in the age of circulating parasites at higher temperatures suggests that cytoadhesion may occur earlier under febrile conditions. An alternative explanation is that the younger parasite age reflects a recent, synchronised egress event, which has been proposed to trigger fever <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. However, tightly synchronised parasite replication is likely rare in fever-inducing natural infections.</p>
<p>Quantifying the synchronicity of natural <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections is inherently difficult, primarily due to the sequestration of mature parasite stages via cytoadherence and the ethical concerns of continuous monitoring without treatment. Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies, such as Kapulu et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, sampled circulating parasites twice daily using quantitative PCR. Infections were allowed to progress for up to 21 days or until fever symptoms develop. Even in these tightly controlled conditions, circulating parasites are often detectable at every 12-hour interval, suggesting that they are not tightly synchronized. As parasite burden increases, complete absence of circulating parasites becomes increasingly rare, further indicating asynchronous development. Polyclonal infections, resulting from repeated mosquito bites and the introduction of genetically distinct parasite strains, also appear to drive asynchronicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. This is particularly relevant in high-transmission settings where individuals may receive, on average, more than 20 Anopheles mosquito bites per day <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Importantly, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> fever should not be conflated with synchronicity. As noted by Kitchen in Malariology (1949) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, the febrile patterns of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> are so diverse that the term ‘atypical’ may not meaningfully be applied. While fever may influence parasite dynamics, it is unlikely that only specific stages experience it; all stages are plausibly exposed to host fever responses during an infection.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is unclear if febrile conditions promote survival of the parasite or the host, it is likely that a sustained fever (&gt;39 °C, &gt;8 hours) restricts parasite proliferation. However, the frequency of sustained high malarial fevers is not well documented. Moreover, data investigating parasite resilience to febrile heat stress are based mainly on lab-adapted parasites, which are not under selection pressure to survive elevated temperatures. Antipyretic drugs reduce fever, but whether they should be used during viral and bacterial infections is uncertain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. This ambiguity also extends to malaria where a meta-analysis of several clinical studies investigating malaria patient outcome following antipyretic treatment found that there was insufficient data to confirm or refute an impact of antipyretic measures on parasitaemia or malarial illness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. To directly test the impact of fever on parasite survival versus cytoadhesion, well controlled studies in human populations will be required in the future.</p>

Unless otherwise specified, the NF54::DiCre parental strain was used as a wild type-like reference throughout this manuscript. Suitable guide RNAs (gRNAs) were identified using the Eukaryotic Pathogen CRISPR guide RNA/DNA Design Tool <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to the 19 nucleotides nearest the selected PAM sequence were synthesised (Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT), phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed and ligated into the pDC_Cas9_hDHFRyFCU <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> vector digested with BbsI. To produce compatible sticky ends between the annealed oligonucleotides and the BbsI-digested vector, the forward oligonucleotide included a 5′-ATTG overhang, and the reverse oligonucleotide included a 5′-AAAC overhang. gRNAs targeting the gene of interest were assembled using appropriate oligonucleotide pairs. Repair templates were designed in three different configurations. For conditional knockouts, templates included LoxP-containing introns flanking a recodonised, HA-tagged gene followed by a T2A skip peptide and a drug selection cassette<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. For TurboID fusions, templates encoded a recodonised gene C-terminally fused to TurboID with a V5 tag, followed by a T2A skip peptide and drug selection marker. For NanoLuc reporters, the construct comprised the HSP90 promoter driving expression of a variable N-terminal domain fused to NanoLuciferase, followed by a T2A skip peptide and a selection cassette <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Gene blocks encoding recodonised genes, TurboID, and NanoLuciferase were synthesised (IDT). All repair templates were flanked by gene-specific homology arms and included restriction sites to enable excision of the linear repair templates. Prior to transfection 20 μg of a Cas9-expressing guide plasmid and 20 μg of a linearized repair template plasmid, were ethanol precipitated. Ethanol precipitation was performed by adding 0.1 volume of 3 M Sodium Acetate (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol, followed by at least 2 hours incubation at −20 °C. DNA was subsequently centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 minutes and washed twice with 70% ethanol. DNA pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 10 μl Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. Synchronised egressing schizonts (NF54 DiCre) were enriched by 60% Percoll before washing in complete medium. The resuspended DNA was mixed with 90 μl P3 Primary cell solution (Lonza) and was used to resuspend egressing schizonts before transfer to transfection cuvette.</p>
<p>Transfection was performed by electroporation using the FP158 programme of an Amaxa 4D Electroporator machine (Lonza). Following transfection, the parasites were transferred to pre-warmed flasks containing 2 ml complete medium and 300 μl fresh uRBCs. After 40 minutes of gentle shaking incubator at 37 °C, 8 ml complete medium were added to each flask. Transfected parasites were cultured without selection for 24 hours, then selection was first performed with 2.5 nM WR99210 (Jacobus Pharmaceuticals) for 48 hours. After WR99210 resistant parasites emerged, they were further selected with 225 μg/ml G418 (Gibco).

For MS2 acquisition, higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) MS/MS scans were recorded at a resolution of 50,000 following MS1 survey scans acquired at a resolution of 120,000. The MS1 ion target was set to 4 × 10⁵, and the MS2 target to 1 × 10⁵. Fragmentation was performed using a “Top Speed” acquisition strategy with a 3-second cycle time and a dynamic exclusion window of 45 seconds. The maximum ion injection time for MS2 scans was 120 ms, and the normalised HCD collision energy was set to 35. For MS3 acquisition, collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS2 scans were acquired at a resolution of 30,000, following an MS1 scan with the same parameters as above. The MS2 ion target was 5 × 10⁴, and multistage activation of the neutral loss (H₃PO₄) was enabled. The maximum injection time for MS2 scans was 60 ms, with a CID collision energy of 30. HCD MS3 scans were acquired at a resolution of 50,000, using synchronous precursor selection to include up to ten MS2 fragment ions. The MS3 ion target was 1 × 10⁵, with a maximum injection time of 120 ms and a collision energy of 55.</p>
<p>Raw mass spectrometry data were processed using MaxQuant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> v1.6.2.10 (TMT-10plex) and v1.6.12.0 (TMT-16plex), with peptide identification carried out via the Andromeda <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> search engine. Spectra were searched against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> proteomes. TMT-based quantification was performed using the built-in ‘reporter ion MS2 or MS3’ algorithm in MaxQuant, with the reporter ion mass tolerance set to 0.003 Da. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, while variable modifications included methionine oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation, and phosphorylation (S, T, Y). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin, allowing up to two missed cleavages. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm for the first search (used for mass recalibration) and 4.5 ppm for the main search. The ‘match between runs’ option was enabled (time window of 0.7 minutes) for fractionated samples. All datasets were filtered using posterior error probability (PEP) to achieve a 1% false discovery rate at the protein, peptide, and site levels.</p>
<p>Mass spectrometry datasets were imported into Perseus v1.5.0.9 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> and filtered to exclude common contaminants as well as identifications derived from reverse decoy sequences. To generate a list of all quantified phosphorylation sites, reporter intensities were filtered to retain entries with at least one valid value. TMT reporter intensity values were log₂ transformed and normalized by median subtraction. Fold changes between conditions were then calculated for each experiment. Normalisation was performed in two steps. First, for each phosphosite, the mean log₂ intensity across all samples was subtracted from individual values to centre the data per site. Second, the median log₂ intensity of each sample was subtracted from all values in that sample to correct for global sample-level intensity differences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. For each phosphosite quantified across all samples in a given experimental run, the mean log₂ intensity was calculated (i.e., the row mean). This mean was subtracted from each log₂ intensity value within that row. A median was then calculated for each column in the resulting matrix to determine a scaling factor for each sample. These median values were subtracted from the corresponding original log₂ intensity values within each column to obtain the final normalised intensities.</p>

<title>Proteome analysis</title>
<p>Approximately 100 µg of the non-phosphorylated peptide flow-through was subjected to high-pH reversed-phase fractionation using the Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the manufacturer’s protocol for TMT-labeled samples with an additional 5% acetonitrile wash. Fractions were dried by vacuum centrifugation, stored at –80 °C, and subsequently analysed by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer using data-dependent MS2 acquisition method as described above for TMT-10plex. Raw mass spectrometry data were processed using MaxQuant v1.6.2.10 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> as described above with the following variable modifications: methionine oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation, deamidation (NQ).

<title>FIKK10.2-TurboID proxiome labelling</title>
<p>The protocol for TurboID-based proximity labelling and biotinylated peptide enrichment was previously described in detail by Davies <italic>et al.</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. TurboID-expressing parasites were cultured in biotin-free medium for two cycles prior to labelling. Parasites were tightly synchronised to a two-hour invasion window (&gt;10% parasitaemia, 2% haematocrit in 300 mL total volume), and cultures were split into three experimental conditions, each performed in triplicate using red blood cells from independent donors (N = 3, 9 samples total).</p>
<p>Labelling was initiated by resuspending cells in medium containing 100 μM D-biotin (bioAPE); while not undergoing labelling, all cultures were maintained in biotin-free medium. Parasites were subjected to one of three total labelling conditions: continuous biotin labelling for 40 hours at 37 °C, or an 8-hour biotin pulse from 16–24 hpi at either 37 °C or 39 °C (heat stress). Outside these windows, biotin was removed by pelleting cultures and resuspending them in fresh biotin-free medium. At 40 hpi, samples were enriched by 60% Percoll gradient centrifugation and washed five times with PBS. Cells were lysed in ice-cold 8 M urea in 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), supplemented with cOmplete™ Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche). Lysates were sonicated (30% duty cycle, 3 × 30-second bursts on ice), clarified by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 30 minutes, 4 °C), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C.</p>

<title>Reduction, alkylation, and protein digest of biotinylated peptides</title>
<p>Parasite lysates were thawed and centrifuged to pellet insoluble material (15 minutes, 4 °C, 21,000 × g). Protein content in the supernatant was quantified using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). An equal amount of parasite material (4 mg per sample) was taken, and protein concentrations were equalised using 8 M urea in 50 mM HEPES. Oxidised cysteine residues were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature for 60 minutes, followed by alkylation of the reduced cysteines with 10 mM iodoacetamide in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes. For protein digestion, samples were diluted 4-fold with 50 mM HEPES to reduce the urea concentration to below 2 M. Mass spectrometry-grade trypsin was added at a 1:50 enzyme-to-protein ratio and incubated at 37 °C overnight (16 hours). To terminate digestion, samples were cooled on ice for 10 minutes and acidified with TFA to a final concentration of ∼0.4% (v/v), incubating on ice for a further 10 minutes. Samples were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 minutes at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. These peptides were then Sep-Pak desalted and vacuum-dried as previously described.</p>

<title>Charging protein G agarose beads with anti-biotin antibodies</title>
<p>For each sample, 60 µL of a 50% protein-G agarose bead slurry (Pierce #20398) was used and washed three times with 5–10 bead volumes of BioSITe buffer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> comprising 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100 (pH 7.2–7.5 at 4 °C). Between washes, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 minutes at 4 °C. Anti-biotin antibodies (a mixture of 30 µg each of Bethyl Laboratories #150-109A and Abcam #Ab53494) was added per 60 µL of bead slurry, brought up to 2 mL with BioSITe buffer, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed three times with BioSITe buffer, adjusted to approximately a 50% slurry using the same buffer, and aliquoted into 60 µL portions for each sample.</p>

<sec id="s5v">
<title>Biotinylated peptide immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>Dried peptide samples were reconstituted in 1.5 mL of BioSITe buffer with vortexing to facilitate dissolution. The pH was adjusted to between 7 and 7.5 on ice using 1–5 µL of 10 M NaOH. Samples were then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4 °C to remove any insoluble material. Peptide concentrations were determined using the peptide BCA assay kit (Pierce, #23275). Equal peptide amounts from each sample were added to the anti-biotin antibody-conjugated bead slurry (∼60 µL per sample) and incubated with rotation for 2 hours at 4 °C. Following incubation, beads were pelleted by centrifugation (1500 × g, 2 minutes, 4 °C) and sequentially washed with 3 × 0.5 mL BioSITe buffer, 1 × 0.5 mL of 50 mM Tris, and 3 × 1 mL of mass spectrometry-grade water. Biotinylated peptides were eluted by treating the beads with 4 × 50 µL of 0.2% TFA, and eluates were stored at –80 °C.</p>

<title>LC-MS/MS (TurboID biotinylated peptide pulldown) and data analysis</title>
<p>Samples were loaded onto Evotips (according to the manufacturer’s instructions). Following a wash with aqueous acidic buffer (0.1% formic acid in water), samples were loaded onto an Evosep One system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Evosep One was fitted with a 15 cm column (PepSep) and a predefined gradient for a 44 min method was employed. The Orbitrap Lumos was operated in data-dependent mode (1 s cycle time), acquiring IT HCD MS/MS scans in rapid mode after an OT MS1 survey scan (<italic>R</italic> = 60,000). The MS1 target was 4E5 ions, whereas the MS2 target was 1E4 ions. The maximum ion injection time utilised for MS2 scans was 300 ms, the HCD normalised collision energy was set at 32, and the dynamic exclusion was set at 15 s.</p>
<p>Acquired raw files were processed with MaxQuant v1.6.2.10 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. Peptides were identified from the MS/MS spectra searched against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> and Homo sapiens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> proteomes using Andromeda <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> search engine. Biotin (K), Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term) and Phospho (STY) were selected as variable modifications whereas Carbamidomethyl (C) was selected as a fixed modification. The enzyme specificity was set to trypsin with a maximum of three missed cleavages. Minimal peptide length was set at 6 amino acids. Biotinylated peptide search in Max Quant was enabled by defining a biotin adduct (+226.0776) on lysine residues as well as its three diagnostic ions: fragmented biotin (m/z 227.0849), immonium ion harboring biotin with a loss of NH3 (m/z 310.1584), and an immonium ion harboring biotin (m/z 327.1849). The precursor mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm for the first search (used for mass re-calibration) and to 4.5 ppm for the main search. The datasets were filtered on posterior error probability (PEP) to achieve a 1% false discovery rate on protein, peptide and site level. Other parameters were used as pre-set in the software.</p>
<p>MaxQuant output files were processed with Perseus, v1.5.0.9 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>, the data were filtered to exclude common contaminants as well as identifications derived from reverse decoy sequences. Peptide intensities were log₂-transformed, and peptides were filtered to retain those detected in two out of three replicates within at least one condition. Valid peptides were assigned for each group as being present in at least 2 of 3 replicate conditions. Valid proteins were defined for each condition as having at least 2 valid peptides. Valid peptides and proteins from each condition were used to generate area-proportional Venn diagrams using the BioVenn tool <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that fever-like temperatures enhance the export of Plasmodium falciparum transmembrane proteins, including the cytoadherence protein PfEMP1 and the nutrient channel PSAC, to the red blood cell surface, thereby increasing cytoadhesion. Using rigorous and well-controlled experiments, the authors <bold>convincingly</bold> demonstrate that this effect results from accelerated protein trafficking rather than changes in protein production or parasite development. These findings significantly advance our understanding of parasite virulence mechanisms and offer insights into how febrile episodes may exacerbate malaria severity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript from Jones and colleagues investigates a previously described phenomenon in which P. falciparum malaria parasites display increased trafficking of proteins displayed on the surface of infected RBCs, as well as increased cytoadherence in response to febrile temperatures. While this parasite response was previously described, it was not uniformly accepted, and conflicting reports can be found in the literature. This variability likely arises due to differences in the methods employed and the degree of temperature increase to which the parasites were exposed. Here, the authors are very careful to employ a temperature shift that likely reflects what is happening in infected humans and that they demonstrate is not detrimental to parasite viability or replication. In addition, they go on to investigate what steps in protein trafficking are affected by exposure to increased temperature and show that the effect is not specific to PfEMP1 but rather likely affects all transmembrane domain-containing proteins that are trafficked to the RBC. They also detect increased rates of phosphorylation of trafficked proteins, consistent with overall increased protein export.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used a relatively mild increase in temperature (39 degrees), which they demonstrate is not detrimental to parasite viability or replication. This enabled them to avoid potential complications of a more severe heat shock that might have affected previously published studies. They employed a clever method of fractionation of RBCs infected with a var2csa-nanoluc fusion protein expressing parasite line to determine which step in the export pathway was likely accelerating in response to increased temperature. This enabled them to determine that export across the PVM is being affected. They also explored changes in phosphorylation of exported proteins and demonstrated that the effect is not limited to PfEMP1 but appears to affect numerous (or potentially all) exported transmembrane domain-containing proteins.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>All the experiments investigating changes resulting from increased temperature were conducted after an increase in temperature from 16 to 24 hours, with sampling or assays conducted at the 24 hr mark. While this provided consistency throughout the study, this is a time point relatively early in the export of proteins to the RBC surface, as shown in Figure 1E. At 24 hrs, only approximately 50% of wildtype parasites are positive for PfEMP1, while at 32 hrs this approaches 80%. Since the authors only checked the effect of heat stress at 24 hrs, it is not possible to determine if the changes they observe reflect an overall increase in protein trafficking or instead a shift to earlier (or an accelerated) trafficking. In other words, if a second time point had been considered (for example, 32 hrs or later), would the parasites grown in the absence of heat stress catch up?</p>

<p>This manuscript describes experiments characterising how malaria parasites respond to physiologically relevant heat-shock conditions. The authors show, quite convincingly, that moderate heat-shock appears to increase cytoadherance, likely by increasing trafficking of surface proteins involved in this process.</p>
<p>While generally of a high quality and including a lot of data, I have a few small questions and comments, mainly regarding data interpretation.</p>
<p>(1) The authors use sorbitol lysis as a proxy for trafficking of PSAC components. This is a very roundabout way of doing things and does not, I think, really show what they claim. There could be a myriad of other reasons for this increased activity (indeed, the authors note potential PSAC activation under these conditions). One further reason could be a difference in the membrane stability following heat shock, which may affect sorbitol uptake, or the fragility of the erythrocytes to hypotonic shock. I really suggest that the authors stick to what they show (increased PSAC) without trying to use this as evidence for increased trafficking of a number of non-specified proteins that they cannot follow directly.</p>
<p>(2) Supplementary Figure 6C/D: The KAHRP signal does not look like it should. In fact, it doesn't look like anything specific. The HSP70-X signal is also blurry and overexposed. These pictures cannot be used to justify the authors' statements about a lack of colocalisation in any way.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 6: This experiment confuses me. The authors purport to fractionate proteins using differential lysis, but the proteins they detect are supposed to be transmembrane proteins and thus should always be found associated with the pellet, whether lysis is done using equinatoxin or saponin. Have they discovered a currently unknown trafficking pathway to tell us about? Whilst there is a lot of discussion about the trafficking pathways for TM proteins through the host cell, a number of studies have shown that these proteins are generally found in a membrane-bound state. The authors should elaborate, or choose an experiment that is capable of showing compartment-specific localisation of membrane-bound proteins (protease protection, for example).</p>
<p>(4) The red blood cell contains, in addition to HSP70-X, a number of human HSPs (HSP70 and HSP90 are significant in this current case). As the name suggests, these proteins non-specifically shield exposed hydrophobic domains revealed upon partial protein unfolding following thermal insult. I would thus have expected to find significantly more enrichment following heat shock, but this is not the case. Is it possible that the physiological heat shock conditions used in this current study are not high enough to cause a real heat shock?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, it is established that high fever-like 39{degree sign}C temperatures cause parasite-infected red blood cells to become stickier. It is thought that high temperatures might help the spleen to destroy parasite-infected cells, and they become stickier in order to remain trapped in blood vessels, so they stop passing through the spleen.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this research is that it shows that fever-like temperatures can cause parasite-infected red blood cells to stick to surfaces designed to mimic the walls of small blood vessels. In a natural infection, this would cause parasite-infected red blood cells to stop circulating through the spleen, where the parasites would be destroyed by the immune system. It is thought that fevers could lead to infected red blood cells becoming stiffer and therefore more easily destroyed in the spleen. Parasites respond to fevers by making their red blood cells stickier, so they stop flowing around the body and into the spleen. The experiments here prove that fever temperatures increase the export of Velcro-like sticky proteins onto the surface of the infected red blood cells and are very thorough and convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A minor weakness of the paper is that the effects of fever on the stiffness of infected red blood cells were not measured. This can be easily done in the laboratory by measuring how the passage of infected red blood cells through a bed of tiny metal balls is delayed under fever-like temperatures.</p>

<p>We did not assess cytoadhesion at later stages, but in the supplementary figures we show that at 40 hours post infection both heat stress and control conditions have comparable proportions of VAR2CSA-positive iRBCs, whilst they differ at 24h. This is true for the DMSO (control wildtype resembling) HA-tagged lines of HSP70x and PF3D7_072500 (Supplementary Figures 9 and 12 respectively). In the light that protein levels appear not changed, we conclude that trafficking is accelerated during these earlier timepoints, but remains comparable at later stages. This would still increase the overall bound parasite mass as parasites start to adhere earlier during or after a heat stress.</p>

<p>While generally of a high quality and including a lot of data, I have a few small questions and comments, mainly regarding data interpretation.</p>
<p>(1) The authors use sorbitol lysis as a proxy for trafficking of PSAC components. This is a very roundabout way of doing things and does not, I think, really show what they claim. There could be a myriad of other reasons for this increased activity (indeed, the authors note potential PSAC activation under these conditions). One further reason could be a difference in the membrane stability following heat shock, which may affect sorbitol uptake, or the fragility of the erythrocytes to hypotonic shock. I really suggest that the authors stick to what they show (increased PSAC) without trying to use this as evidence for increased trafficking of a number of non-specified proteins that they cannot follow directly.</p>

<p>This is a valid point, however, uninfected RBCs do not lyse following heat stress, nor do much younger iRBCs, indicating that the observed effect is specific to infected RBCs at a defined stage. The sorbitol sensitivity assay is performed at 37°C under normal conditions after cells are returned to non–heat stress temperatures, so the effect is not due to transient changes in membrane permeability at elevated temperature.</p>
<p>Planned experiment: However, to increase the strength of our conclusions and further test our hypothesis, we will perform sorbitol sensitivity assays on &gt;20 hours post infection iRBCs following heat stress in the presence and absence of furosemide, a PSAC inhibitor. If iRBC lysis is abolished with furosemide present, this would confirm that the effect is PSAC-dependent. However, the effect could also possibly be due to altered PSAC activity during heat stress which is maintained at lower temperatures, as outlined in the discussion.</p>

<p>(2) Supplementary Figure 6C/D: The KAHRP signal does not look like it should. In fact, it doesn't look like anything specific. The HSP70-X signal is also blurry and overexposed. These pictures cannot be used to justify the authors' statements about a lack of colocalisation in any way.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Planned experiment: We agree that the IFAs are not the best as presented and will include better quality supplementary images in a revised version.</p>

<p>(3) Figure 6: This experiment confuses me. The authors purport to fractionate proteins using differential lysis, but the proteins they detect are supposed to be transmembrane proteins and thus should always be found associated with the pellet, whether lysis is done using equinatoxin or saponin. Have they discovered a currently unknown trafficking pathway to tell us about? Whilst there is a lot of discussion about the trafficking pathways for TM proteins through the host cell, a number of studies have shown that these proteins are generally found in a membrane-bound state. The authors should elaborate, or choose an experiment that is capable of showing compartment-specific localisation of membrane-bound proteins (protease protection, for example).</p>

<p>We do not believe we identified a novel trafficking pathway, but that we capture trafficking intermediates of PfEMP1 between the PVM and the RBC periphery, in either small vesicles, and/ or possibly Maurer’s clefts. These would still be membrane embedded, but because of their small size, not be pelleted using the centrifugation speeds in our study (we did not use ultracentrifugation). This explanation, we believe, is in line with the current hypothesis of PfEMP1 and other exported TMD protein trafficking to the periphery or the Maurer’s clefts.</p>

<p>(4) The red blood cell contains, in addition to HSP70-X, a number of human HSPs (HSP70 and HSP90 are significant in this current case). As the name suggests, these proteins non-specifically shield exposed hydrophobic domains revealed upon partial protein unfolding following thermal insult. I would thus have expected to find significantly more enrichment following heat shock, but this is not the case. Is it possible that the physiological heat shock conditions used in this current study are not high enough to cause a real heat shock?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted by the reviewer, we do not see enrichment of red blood cell heat shock proteins following heat stress, either with FIKK10.2-TurboID or in the phosphoproteome. We used a physiologically relevant heat stress that significantly modifies the iRBC, as shown by our functional assays. While a higher temperature might induce an association of red blood cell heat shock proteins, such conditions may not accurately reflect the most commonly found context of malaria infection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, it is established that high fever-like 39 C temperatures cause parasite-infected red blood cells to become stickier. It is thought that high temperatures might help the spleen to destroy parasite-infected cells, and they become stickier in order to remain trapped in blood vessels, so they stop passing through the spleen.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this research is that it shows that fever-like temperatures can cause parasite-infected red blood cells to stick to surfaces designed to mimic the walls of small blood vessels. In a natural infection, this would cause parasite-infected red blood cells to stop circulating through the spleen, where the parasites would be destroyed by the immune system. It is thought that fevers could lead to infected red blood cells becoming stiffer and therefore more easily destroyed in the spleen. Parasites respond to fevers by making their red blood cells stickier, so they stop flowing around the body and into the spleen. The experiments here prove that fever temperatures increase the export of Velcro-like sticky proteins onto the surface of the infected red blood cells and are very thorough and convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A minor weakness of the paper is that the effects of fever on the stiffness of infected red blood cells were not measured. This can be easily done in the laboratory by measuring how the passage of infected red blood cells through a bed of tiny metal balls is delayed under fever-like temperatures.</p>

<p>Previous work by Marinkovic et al. (cited in this manuscript) reported that all RBCs, both infected and uninfected, increase in stiffness at 41 °C compared with 37 °C, with trophozoites and schizonts exhibiting a particularly pronounced increase. We agree that it would be interesting to determine whether similar changes occur at physiological fever-like temperatures, and whether this increase in stiffness coincides with the period of elevated protein trafficking. However, since we have already demonstrated enhanced protein export using multiple complementary approaches, we have chosen to address these questions in a follow-up study.</p>
