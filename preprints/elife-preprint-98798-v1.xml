<title>Abstract</title>
<p>New psychoactive substances (NPS) targeting cannabinoid receptor 1 pose a significant threat to society as recreational abusive drugs that have pronounced physiological side effects. These greater adverse effects compared to classical cannabinoids have been linked to the higher downstream <italic>β</italic>-arrestin signaling. Thus, understanding the mechanism of differential signaling will reveal important structure-activity relationship essential for identifying and potentially regulating NPS molecules. In this study, we simulate the slow (un)binding process of NPS MDMB-Fubinaca and classical cannabinoid HU-210 from CB<sub>1</sub> using multi-ensemble simulation to decipher the effects of ligand binding dynamics on downstream signaling. The transition-based reweighing method is used for the estimation of transition rates and underlying thermodynamics of (un)binding processes of ligands with nanomolar affinities. Our analyses reveal major interaction differences with transmembrane TM7 between NPS and classical cannabinoids. A variational autoencoder-based approach, neural relational inference (NRI), is applied to assess the allosteric effects on intracellular regions attributable to variations in binding pocket interactions. NRI analysis indicate a heightened level of allosteric control of NPxxY motif for NPS-bound receptors, which contributes to the higher probability of formation of a crucial triad interaction (Y<sup>7.53</sup>-Y<sup>5.58</sup>-T<sup>3.46</sup>) necessary for stronger <italic>β</italic>-arrestin signaling. Hence, in this work, MD simulation, data-driven statistical methods, and deep learning point out the structural basis for the heightened physiological side effects associated with NPS, contributing to efforts aimed at mitigating their public health impact.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB<sub>1</sub>), which is majorly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) belongs to the class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> GPCRs are expressed in the cellular membrane and help transduce chemical signals from the extra-cellular to the intracellular direction with the help of the downstream signaling proteins (G-proteins and <italic>β</italic>-arrestin).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> In addition, GPCRs are the largest family of drug targets due to their substantial involvement in human pathophysiology and druggability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Significant research efforts have been invested in the discovery of drugs targeting CB<sub>1</sub>, which helps to maintain homeostasis in neuron signaling and physiological process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Initial drug discovery efforts, especially the design of synthetic agonists, were based on modifying the scaffolds of phytocannabinoids (e.g., Δ<sup>9</sup>-Tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabinol) and endocannabinoids (e.g., Anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> The synthetic molecules, which maintain the aromatic, pyran, and cyclohexenyl ring of the most common psychoactive phytocannabinoid Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC, are known as classical cannabinoids (Figure S1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> However, the pharmacological potential of these molecules was diminished due to their psychological and physiological side effects (“tetrad” side effect).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> One such example of a synthetic cannabinoid is 1,1-Dimethylheptyl-11-hydroxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (commonly known as HU-210), which is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup></p>

<p>Apart from the canonical structures of synthetic cannabinoids, molecules with diverse scaffolds were also synthesized through structure-activity studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, these molecules also lacked any pharmacological importance due to psychological side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Due to the diverse structures and psychological effects, these molecules became unregulated substitutes for traditional illicit substances. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> These synthetic cannabinoids belong to a class of molecules known as new psychoactive substances(NPS) as these molecules are not scheduled under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961) or the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Synthetic cannabinoids make up the largest category of NPS molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> NPS creates a significant challenge for drug enforcement agencies, as they appeal to drug users seeking “legal highs” to avoid the legal consequences of using traditional drugs and to be undetectable in drug screenings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The molecular structures of NPS synthetic cannabinoids consist of four pharmacophore components: linked, linker, core, and tail groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> The core usually consists of aromatic scaffolds (e.g., indole, indazole, Carbazole, Benzimidazole) (Figure S2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> The tail and linker groups are connected to the core. In the tail group, long alkyl chain-like scaffolds are ubiquitous in most NPSs; however, molecules with bulkier cyclic chains (e.g., AB-CHMINACA) are also present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Frequently encountered scaffolds in linker groups are methanone, ethanone, carboxamide, and carboxylate ester groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> The linker acts as a bridge between the core and the linked group. In the initial NPS synthetic cannabinoids, the linked group included polyaromatic rings; however, non-cyclic linked groups have also been identified in NPS recently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Structural diversity in every component, while maintaining high binding affinity and potency for CB<sub>1</sub> make these molecules easier for drug manufacturers and harder to ban by drug enforcement agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of NPS synthetic cannabinoids has been found to cause more physiological side effects than traditional cannabinergic “tetrad” side effects. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> These side effects include tachy-cardia, drowsiness, dizziness, hypertension, seizures, convulsions, nausea, high blood pressure, and chest pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> For instance, Gatch and Forster have shown that the high concentrations of AMB-FUBINACA, the molecule which caused “zoombie outbreak” in New York, induced tremors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> A recent biochemical study has linked these discriminatory effects with the differential signaling of <italic>β</italic>-arrestin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> According to Finlay et al., NPS shows higher <italic>β</italic>-arrestin signaling compared to the classical cannabinoids, which has also been confirmed by other <italic>β</italic>-arrestin signaling studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> However, mechanistic understanding of these differential downstream signaling effects between NPS and classical cannabinoids is still missing.</p>
<p>Mutagenesis studies have shown that the conserved NPxxY motif of CB<sub>1</sub> have a larger role in downstream <italic>β</italic>-arrestin signaling than G-protein signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> Recently published MDMB-FUBINACA bound CB<sub>1</sub>-<italic>β</italic>-arrestin-1 complex structure also points out the importance of the unique triad interaction (Y397<sup>7.53</sup>-Y294<sup>5.58</sup>-T210<sup>3.46</sup>) involving NPxxY motif in <italic>β</italic>-arrestin-1 signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> However, structural comparison of the classical cannabinoid (AM841) and NPS (MDMB-FUBINACA) bound active CB<sub>1</sub>-G<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> complex shows a conformationally similar NPxxY motif (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> In light of these experimental observations, it can be inferred that higher <italic>β</italic>-arrestin signaling stems from higher dynamic propensity of triad interaction formation for NPS-bound CB<sub>1</sub>. We hypothesized that distinct orthosteric pocket interactions for NPS and Classical Cannabinoids causes differential allosteric modulation of intracellular dynamics that facilitate triad interaction.</p>

<p>To study these distinct dynamic effects, we compared the (un)binding of the classical cannabinoid (HU-210) and NPS (MDMB-FUBINACA) from the receptor binding site. These molecules have nanomolar affinities. Obtaining the initial pathway of ligand unbinding from unbiased sampling will be computationally expensive. Therefore, a well-tempered metadynamics approach was used to sample the unbinding event, where a time-dependent biased potential is deposited for the faster sampling of the metastable minima along the pathway. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> However, a detailed characterization of the unbinding processes is only possible through the thermodynamics and kinetics estimation of intermediate states. Thus, a transition operator-based approach is needed, which helps to estimate the transition timescale between the states and the stationary density of each state. Estimation from these approaches usually depends on the equilibrium between the local states, which can only be maintained by reversible sampling. For high-affinity ligands like MDMB-FUBINACA and HU-210, reversible sampling is expensive as ligands move from high energy unbound states to lower energy bound states irreversibly. Hence, we implemented a transition operator approach named the transition-based reweighting analysis (TRAM) method, which can tackle this lack of local equilibrium between states by combining unbiased and biased approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> TRAM has been used different simulation studies for estimating thermodynamics and kinetics of high energy processes. Characterization of the dimerization kinetics and sodium ion translocation of <italic>µ</italic>-opioid receptors have been studied using TRAM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> Furthermore, TRAM have been utilized for thermodynamics and kinetics estimations of ligand (un)binding for kinase and Serine protease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> To implement TRAM for our study, extensive sampling of the (un)binding process of both ligands was performed using a combination of umbrella sampling and unbiased simulations from the pathway obtained using metadynamics (see Methods section). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> We showed that TRAM can produce consistent kinetic estimation with less unbiased simulation data compared to traditional methods like the Markov state model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on estimates of thermodynamics and kinetics, it was observed that both NPS and classical cannabinoids have similar unbinding pathways. However, their unbinding mechanisms differ due to the aromatic tail of the MDMB-FUBINACA compared to the alkyl side chain of HU-210. Furthermore, dynamic interaction calculations reveal a major difference with TM7 between NPS and classical cannabinoid. Specifically, the hydroxyl group in the benzopyran moiety of HU-210 forms much stronger polar interactions with S383<sup>7.39</sup> compared to the carbonyl oxygen of the linker group in MDMB-FUBINACA. MD simulations of other classical cannabinoids and NPS molecules bound CB<sub>1</sub> also support these significant interaction differences. The ligand binding effect in intracellular signaling was estimated by measuring the probability of triad formation in the intracellular region. NPS bound CB<sub>1</sub> shows higher probability of forming triad interaction compared to the classical cannbinoids, which supports the experimental observations of high <italic>β</italic>-arrestin signaling of NPS bound receptors. To validate that the triad formation is indeed caused by the binding pocket interaction differences between the two ligands, allosteric strength binding pocket residues and NPxxY motif was estimated with the deep learning technique, Neural relational inference (NRI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> NRI network revealed that binding pocket residues of NPS bound ensemble have higher allosteric weights for the NPxxY motif compared to classical cannabinoids. These analyses validate our hypothesis that the differential dynamic allosteric control of the NPxxY motif might lead to the <italic>β</italic>-arrestin signaling for different ligands. This study provides a foundation for additional computational and experimental research to enhance our understanding of the connection between ligand scaffolds and downstream signaling. This knowledge will assist drug enforcement agencies in proactively banning these molecules and inform policies that can protect individuals from the effects of abuse.</p>

<title>Metadynamics simulations capture the unbinding paths of NPS and classical cannabinoids</title>
<p>The representative classical cannabinoid and NPS selected for this study are HU-210 and MDMB-FUBINACA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Compared to Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC, HU-210 has an extra hydroxyl group in the C-11 position and a 1’,1’-Dimethylheptyl group instead of a pentyl side chain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and S1). MDMB-FUBINACA is a derivative of AB-FUBINACA, which was originally developed by Pfizer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> These ligands binds to CB<sub>1</sub> receptor with nanomolar affinities (MDMB-FUBINACA K<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> : 1.14 nM;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> HU-210 K<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> : 0.61 nM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Metadynamics simulation is a biased sampling method and has been widely used in protein-ligand binding and unbinding studies, as preexisting knowledge of the pathway is not necessary for performing these simulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> In metadynamics, a time-dependent biased potential is deposited into the sampling process for the ligand to get out of stable minima at a faster pace.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> In this work, two replicates of well-tempered metadynamics were performed to capture the unbinding pathway of HU-210 and MDMB-Fubinaca. The commonly used collective variables were selected for metadynamics simulations: (1) z component distance between the center of mass of ligand and residue in the ligand binding pocket (W356<sup>6.48</sup>), and (2) Contact number with the ligand heavy atom and <italic>α</italic> carbon of all binding pocket residues (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref>).</p>
<p>The z-component distance was plotted against the RMSD of the ligands from the bound pose, which indicates that ligands follow a similar pathway for each replica (Figures S3A and S3C). It is also observed that the dissociation happens via the opening formed by TM2, TM3, ECL2, and N-terminus for both ligands (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A, 3B, 3C</xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). These observations indicate that the pathway may be the minimum free energy pathway for the ligand unbinding in CB<sub>1</sub>. Previous metadynamics binding simulation of another cannabinoid ligand also points to a similar pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> Reweighted probability density obtained from metadynamics calculation shows one highly dense region in the pocket, depicting the stability of the bound pose of the ligands (Figures S3C and S3D). However, time dependent external force applied during the metadynamics makes the sampling in the orthogonal direction of the CVs less extensive. Thus, the biased simulation might not sample some protein-ligand interactions that helps to characterize intermediate states. To properly sample intermediate transition states during the underlying unbinding process, extensive unbiased simulations were performed from the initial pathway obtained from the limited sampling of the well-tempered metadynamics (discussed below).</p>

<title>Comparison of thermodynamics and kinetics estimates from Markov state Model and Transition-based reweighting analysis method</title>
<p>MSM and TRAM are both postprocessing techniques for estimating the kinetics and thermodynamics of underlying physical processes observed in MD simulation. MSM is applied to reversible equilibrium simulations, whereas TRAM estimations can be obtained from multi-ensemble simulations (combination of biased and unbiased simulations). The MSM depends on the local equilibrium between the Markovian states, which is also known as detailed balance (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Equation 5</xref>). However, reversible local sampling becomes challenging with short parallel trajectories when the free energy difference between two local Markovian states is high. In those cases, reversibility is still assumed by forcing the detailed balance when estimating the transition probability matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> This leads to the incorrect estimation of the unbinding kinetics due to limited sampling from the stable bound state to the high energy unbound states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> Refining the state discretization (i.e., increasing the number of states) may resolve the issue. However, refined state discretization sometimes decreases the statistically significant transition count between all states, decreasing the model certainty. TRAM was shown to solve this problem by combining biased and unbiased simulations (see Methods section). Biased simulations (e.g., replica exchange, umbrella sampling) help to enhance the local sampling, either by increasing the temperature for faster sampling or by fixing collective variables with biased potential to have better sampling in orthogonal directions. It has been shown that compared to MSM, kinetics predicted using TRAM from the combination of biased and unbiased simulations are more aligned with the experiment results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>As unbinding of ligands with high binding affinity (nanomolar) are being studied here, asymmetric transitions might be observed along the pathway. Therefore, we compared the use of MSM and TRAM in estimating the kinetics and thermodynamics of the (un)binding process. For TRAM, unbiased simulation and umbrella sampling were run from the clusters in conformational ensemble obtained from metadynamics (refer to the Methods section for more details). For MSM estimation, only unbiased simulations starting from the metadynamics pathway were considered.</p>
<p>For thermodynamics comparison, standard free energy was estimated for the ligands considering volume correction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> TRAM and MSM predictions of standard binding free energy are within 0.6 kcal/mol of each other for each ligand (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Although the absolute binding free energy differs from the experimentally predicted value by approximately 3 kcal/mol, the relative estimated free energy (ΔΔG) values are also within 0.6 kcal/mol of the experimentally determined values. Therefore, it indicates that with sufficient sampling, both MSM and TRAM converge to the same predictions of relative free energy.</p>

<p>We also compared the kinetics obtained from the MSM and TRAM. Kinetic measurements were performed with transition path theory (TPT), which uses transition probability matrix from MSM or Tram to estimate mean free passage time between different states (see Methods section). Estimated binding times using TRAM and MSM match perfectly for both ligands. The estimated dissociation times are within one order of magnitude with each other. These observations agree with the previously reported computational research, where experimentally comparable estimation of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> rates were shown to be more challenging compared to <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>Further analyses were performed to compare these methods in the low unbiased data regime. The difference between the dissociation time of ligands was measured with different amounts of unbiased data. It is observed that even with only 25% of original, unbiased data, TRAM can predict the kinetics within an order magnitude of the kinetics estimated with full dataset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). On the other hand, error in MSM predicted kinetics more rapidly compared to TRAM with lesser amount of unbiased data. A similar trend can be observed for ΔΔG prediction (Figure S4). Therefore, TRAM provides better predictions of thermodynamics and kinetics when less amount of unbiased data.</p>

<title>Unbinding mechanism for new psychoactive substance</title>
<p>Although the binding position of the ligand and the overall binding pathway are similar for both the ligands, extensive biased and unbiased simulation analyzed by TRAM shows a significant difference in the unbinding mechanism of the ligands. To capture the unbinding pathway for MDMB-FUBINACA, we projected the TRAM weighted free energy landscape of the distance between the linked part of the ligand (Leucinate group) and TM5 with respect to the distance between the ligand tail group and TM7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The free energy landscape was divided into the non-overlapping intermediate macrostates to obtain better description of the unbinding process. In each macrostate, the contact frequency of ligand with binding pocket residues were calculated along with corresponding contact energies. A metastable minima is observed for macrostate representing the bound pose of the ligand depicting the stability of the ligand (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

<p>The free energy landscape shows two probable mechanisms for MDMB-FUBINACA unbinding from the bound pose. The two pathways are differentiated by whether the linked or tail part of MDMB-FUBINACA dissociates first. One of the pathways, aromatic tail part of MDMB-FUBINACA moves away from TM5 and form interaction with aromatic residues in TM2 (F170<sup>2.57</sup> and F174<sup>2.61</sup>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6A, 6B</xref>, and S5C). This leads to the formation of intermediate metastable states, which we characterize as macrostate Intermediate state 1 (I1). This metastable minimum observed from I1 macrostate might be unique to the FUBINACA family of NPS synthetic cannabinoids as this family has the aromatic ring in tail group, unlike the long alkyl chain in other common synthetic cannabinoids. Along with the aromatic residues of TM2, major interaction with F268<sup>ECL2</sup> is maintained in macrostate I1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). K-L divergence analysis between bound and I1 macrostates show that only minor changes in the binding pocket residues, especially in TM2 are needed to accommodate MDMB-FUBINACA in this conformational state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The interconversion timescale (MFPT) between the macrostates were obtained from the transition path theory. MFPT calculations show that both the timescales are similar with slightly higher timescales for the bound pose compared to I1 transition (20.6 ± 2.3<italic>µs</italic>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). In this pathway, ligand moves from I1 metastable state to space between N-terminus, TM2, TM3, and ECL2 before dissociating from the receptor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). This region between the unbinding ensemble have been characterized as macrostate I3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Contact analysis show significant drop in ligand residue contacts with only aromatic residues in TM2, TM3 and ECL2 forming dominant interactions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and S5D). K-L divergence shows that ligand positioning in this particular regions causes relatively higher divergence on TM2 compared to I1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Kinetically, the transition from I1 to I3 (33.7 ± 3.1<italic>µs</italic>) is much slower compared to reverse transition (0.8 ± 0.0<italic>µs</italic>), validating the higher stability of the I1 compared to I3 macrostate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). According to the TPT analysis, breaking the aromatic interactions for complete dissociation of MDMB-FUBINACA requires ∼ 371.9 ± 40.2<italic>µs</italic>, making it the slowest step in this pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>In the other possible unbinding pathway, orientation of MDMB-FUBINACA in the pocket doesnot change compared to the bound pose. The linked part of the ligand moves to space between N-terminus, TM2, TM3, and ECL2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). We label this macrostate as I2. In this state, we observe stable polar interaction with K376<sup>7.32</sup> and hydrophobic interactions with aromatic and other hydrophobic residues (F177<sup>2.64</sup>, F268<sup>ECL2</sup>, P269<sup>ECL2</sup>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and S5A). However, free energy of this macrostate is higher than the bound pose, depicting higher entropic cost associated with this state. This can be shown by the higher intrastate RMSD of I3 compared to the bound pose (Figure S6). Transition timescale from the bound pose to the I2 (136.7 ± 13.9<italic>µs</italic>) is one order of magnitude higher compared to the reverse transition (9.8 ± 13.9<italic>µs</italic>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). K-L divergence analysis also shows higher divergence in the extracellular region of TM2 and N-terminus compared to bound pose (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Dissociation of MDMB-FUBINACA from I2 to the bulk is faster compared to dissociation from I3 (246.6 ± 26.0<italic>µs</italic>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). However, the overall kinetic barrier for dissociation from the binding pose for the both unbinding mechanisms are relatively similar.</p>

<title>Unbinding mechanism for classical cannabinoid</title>
<p>For capturing the classical cannabinoid (un)binding mechanism, distances from the two terminal scaffolds (cyclohexenyl and alkyl chain) to TM5 and TM7 were measured similar to the NPS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The free energy landscape of the unbinding of the HU-210 shows the differences in the mechanism from MDMB-FUBINACA. Similar to MDMB-FUBINACA, the HU-210 unbinding land-scapes were also divided into non-overlapping macrostates. Macrostate representing HU-210 bound pose shows a metastable energy minimum. Comparing the bound macrostate interactions of MDMB-FUBINACA, classical cannabinoid HU-210 shows higher interactions with TM7 residues (S383<sup>7.39</sup>, F379<sup>7.35</sup>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>, S5B and S7B).

Mutagenesis studies also support this difference in interaction with S383<sup>7.39</sup> between the classical cannabinoids with hydroxyl group (HU-210) and CB<sub>1</sub> ligands, which have carboxylic oxygen in the equivalent position (WIN-55,212-2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> Alanine mutation of S383<sup>7.39</sup> have shown to decrease the lig- and affinity and downstream efficacy of classical cannabinoids by orders of magnitude, while having minimal effect on WIN-55,212-2, which have carboxylic oxygen in the linked part as MDMB-FUBINACA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> Other major interactions (F170<sup>2.57</sup> and F268<sup>ECL2</sup>) in the bound pose are common between the two ligands (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>).</p>
<p>A relatively weaker metastable state is observed when the ligand moves relatively deeper (closer to TM5) inside the binding pocket.

Protein-ligand interaction analysis in the macrostate representing this region (I1) show that hydroxyl group at C-11 forms a major polar interaction with H178<sup>2.65</sup> (Figure S7A). The bound and I1 macrostates are kinetically close, as indicated by the rapid interconversion between these states (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).

<p>Contrasting to MDMB-FUBINACA, only one pathway was discovered with classical cannabinoid cyclic scaffold departing from the receptor first. Major interactions that break when the ligand moves out of the binding pose to macrostate I2 is the polar interaction with S383<sup>7.39</sup> and hydrophobic interaction with aromatic F170<sup>2.57</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A, 7B</xref>, and S7C). Breaking of these bonds leads to larger kinetic barrier of approximately 39.5 ± 1.4<italic>µs</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). In this macrostate, the HU-210 forms major interactions with aromatic residues F268<sup>ECL2</sup> and F177<sup>2.64</sup> and polar interactions with S173<sup>2.60</sup> and D176<sup>2.63</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). From this pose, HU-210 either dissociates from the receptor or obtain another relatively weak stabilized state (I3) in the receptor. In I3, the alkyl chain of the ligand is flipped in the pocket and stabilized by aromatic residues in TM2, TM3 and ECL2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This transition from I2 to I3 (528.1 ± 32.8<italic>µs</italic>) kinetically much slower compared to the reverse transition (6.9 ± 0.0<italic>µs</italic>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). From both I2 and I3 macrostates, the ligand can dissociate from the pocket and mean free passage time for these transitions appear to be in the milisecond timescale, which is one order magnitude higher compared to the MDMB-FUBINACA unbinding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). This phenomena supports the relatively high affinity of the classic cannabinoid HU-210 compared to the NPS MDMB-FUBINACA.</p>

<title>Allosterically controlled distinct downstream signaling between new psychoactive substances and classical cannabinoids</title>
<p>As discussed in the previous section, major interaction differences between are observed in TM7. The universality of this observation is measured by performing unbiased MD simulation (1 <italic>µ</italic>s each) of other NPS (AMB-FUBINACA, 5F-AMP, CUMYL-FUBINACA) and classical cannabinoids (AMG-41, JWH-133, O-1317) bound CB<sub>1</sub> (Figure S8A). Average distance of carbonyl oxygen of NPS molecules’ linker group from S383<sup>7.39</sup> is compared to equivalent distance of hydroxyl group of classical cannbinoids’ benzopyran ring. Larger mean distance in case of all NPS-bound CB<sub>1</sub> supports the universality of the weaker interaction between TM7 and NPS molecules (Figure S8B). This variation in binding pocket pocket interactions might lead to differential allosteric control of the intracellular dynamics that facilitate triad interaction (Y397<sup>7.53</sup>-Y294<sup>5.58</sup>-T210<sup>3.46</sup>) important for <italic>β</italic>-arrestin binding.</p>
<p>We adopted a data-driven deep learning network known as Neural relational inference (NRI) to validate our hypothesis of allosteric control. NRI network has an architecture of variational autoencoder. The encoder part of the network predicts the interactions between the residues from the trajectory dynamics, and the decoder predicts the trajectories from the interaction. With this network, we try to produce alpha carbon coordinates at <italic>t</italic> + <italic>τ</italic> from the coordinates at time t. In the process of regenerating the future coordinates, the latent space of the network learns the dynamic interactions between different residues in the protein. These interactions are calculated from the estimated posterior probability <italic>q</italic>(<italic>z</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>|<italic>x</italic>). In this work, we trained the network with the NPS, and classical cannabinoid-bound unbiased trajectories (Method Section). Here, we compared the allosteric interaction weights between the binding pocket and the NPxxY motif which involves in triad interaction formation. Results show that each binding pocket residue in NPS bound ensemble shows higher allosteric weights with the NPxxY motif, indicating larger dynamic interactions between the NPxxY motif and binding pocket residues(Figure S9).</p>
<p>The probability of triad formation was estimated to observe the effect of the difference in allosteric control. TRAM weighted probability calculation showed that NPS-bound CB<sub>1</sub> have the higher probability of triad formation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Comparison of the pairwise interaction of the triad residues shows that interaction between Y397<sup>7.53</sup>-T210<sup>3.46</sup> is relatively more stable in case of NPS-bound CB<sub>1</sub>, while other two interactions have similar behavior for both systems (Figures S10A, S10B, and S10C). Therefore, higher interaction between Y397<sup>7.53</sup> and T210<sup>3.46</sup> in NPS-bound receptor causes the triad interaction to be more probable.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Synthetic cannabinoids were designed as a potential therapeutics to target cannabinoid receptors. However, major side effects of these ligands diminish their therapeutic potential. Although both classical cannabinoids and NPS synthetic cannabinoids have been abused as recreational drugs, later poses larger threats for the society due the chemical diversity of the NPS structures makes them harder to control from being abused. Furthermore, physiological studies have shown NPS targeting cannabinoid receptors lead to the dangerous physiological effects compared to “tetrad” side effects associated with classical cannabinoids. Previous studies have relate these side effects with the higher downstream <italic>β</italic>-arrestin signaling of NPS. Mutagenesis studies have shown NPxxY motif have larger role to play in <italic>β</italic>-arrestin signaling. In this work, we proposed that NPS and classical cannabinoid have distinct allosteric control on NPxxY motif when bound to orthosteric pocket of CB<sub>1</sub>. In this hypothesis driven study, we compared ligand-protein interactions of NPS MDMB-FUBINACA and classical cannabinoid HU-210 for CB<sub>1</sub> by studying their unbinding mechanism and downstream signaling.</p>
<p>As both ligands are stable binders with nanomolar affinity, well-tempered metadynamics simulations were performed to obtain the initial unbinding pathway. These simulations were able to find similar pathway via the opening formed by TM2, TM3, N-terminus, and ECL2 which matches with previous metadynamics binding simulations for cannabinoid receptors. For the proper characterization of intermediate states, the unbinding processes were further extensively sampled using unbiased simulation and umbrella sampling.</p>
<p>Effectiveness of the post processing techniques TRAM and MSM were compared in predicting the ligands with binding affinity and kinetics. MSM predicts the kinetics and thermo-dynamics from the eigendecomposition of the transition probability matrix. MSM assumes that the local equilibrium is maintained between the Markovian states. However, with limited sampling, this creterion may not valid between local high and low energy states. TRAM tries to solve this issue by combining biased and unbiased simulation, where biased simulations enhances the local sampling to maintain the equilibrium. We observed that with sufficient data both methods performed in similar way in estimating the standard binding free energy. The relative free energy estimated by both methods match with the experimental result within 0.6 kcal/mol. With lesser amount of unbiased data, TRAM predictions of kinetics and thermodynamics remain more consistent than the MSM as the biased simulations help to maintain local equilibrium.</p>
<p>TRAM estimated thermodynamics helped to decipher the differences between the un-binding of NPS MDMB-FUBINACA and classical cannabinoid HU-210. First, for MDMB-FUBINACA, a larger conformational change is observed within the pocket. A metastable intermediate state is observed when the aromatic tail of FUBINACA flip inside the pocket and reorient itself close to the aromatic residues of TM2. It was observed that both linked part and tail part of the ligands can lead the dissociation of the ligand from the receptor. Second, for HU-210, conserved cyclic group leads the dissociation from the receptor. It supports previous simulation where the alkyl side chain of the ligand binds to the receptor first.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Third, aromatic residues in the pocket (F268<sup>ECL2</sup>, F170<sup>2.57</sup>) form major interactions with both classical cannabinoid and NPS molecules. Major differences in protein-ligand interactions were observed in TM7. Stronger interactions were observed for the classical cannabinoid with TM7, especially polar interaction with S383<sup>7.39</sup> and hydrophobic interaction with F379<sup>7.35</sup> compared to NPS molecules.</p>
<p>Finally, we showed that the variation in binding pocket interaction leads to the distinct dynamic allosteric communications in the intracellular region. Allosteric communication strength was measured by the variational autoencoder (NRI). NRI network learns the dynamic interactions between residues in the latent space by learning to reconstruct the dynamics. Dynamic allostery measured by the posterior probability of VAE shows higher allosteric weights from the binding pocket residues to the NPxxY motif region for NPS molecules. Higher allosteric control for NPS-bound CB<sub>1</sub> increases the probability of triad interaction formation, resulting higher <italic>β</italic>-arrestin signaling for NPS. Therefore, these data driven computational study helps us to distinguish between the receptor-protein interaction, unbinding mechanism and downstream signaling NPS compared to other classical cannabinoids.</p>

<p>All ligand-bound systems are minimized and equilibrated before the production run. Ten thousand minimization steps were performed with the conjugate gradient method. Six sequential equilibration steps were carried out to stabilize the systems at 300 K temperature and 1 atm pressure for the production simulations. The systems were heated to 300 K in the NVT ensemble in the initial two stages. Each of these steps was performed for 250 ps. Langevin dynamics was used to control the temperature with additional damping and random force. The damping coefficient for the damping force was set as 1/picosecond.

<title>Markov State Model</title>
<p>Markov state model (MSM) is used to estimate the thermodynamics and kinetics from the unbiased simulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup> The prevalence of MSM as a post-processing technique for MD simulations was due to its reliance on only local equilibration of MD trajectories to predict the global equilibrium properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> Hence, MSM can combine information from distinct short trajectories, which can only attain the local equilibrium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup> This attribute of MSM helps to utilize the power of parallel supercomputers to run parallel short simulations to sample a process with a high energy barrier.</p>
<p>In MSM, the conformational ensemble is discretized into states, assuming that the interstate transition will be Markovian. According to the Markovian property, interstate transitions will only depend on the current state, not on the past state. In order to uphold the principle of Markovian transition, the structures of the discretized states must be conformationally and kinetically similar, allowing for rapid interconversion compared to interstate transitions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup> These faster intrastate conversions ensure that Markovian states lose their memory of the previous interstate transition after a lag time (<italic>τ</italic>).</p>
<p>Another necessary criterion for MSM is the reversibility in the interstate transition, which is also known as the detailed balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup> The detailed balance assures the local equilibrium between the state population, as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Equation 5</xref>, where <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the stationary density of <italic>i</italic>th Markovian states and <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> represents the probability of transition between <italic>i</italic>th to <italic>j</italic>th at lag time. These transition probabilities form a transition matrix with <italic>N × N</italic> dimension where N is the total number of states. From the eigendecomposition of this transition matrix, biomolecular processes are discretized into orthogonal processes (orthogonal eigenvectors). The timescale of these processes is calculated based on eigenvalues. The highest eigenvalue is one; the corresponding left eigenvector of the transition matrix determines the stationary density. Eigenvectors with eigenvalues close to one denote the slow processes.

<title>Deep Learning Network for Allosteric Prediction</title>
<p>Neural relational inference (NRI) network was implemented to predict allosteric dependence between the residues in the different parts of the receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref></sup> This network is a Variational autoencoder (VAE) comprising encoding and decoding parts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref></sup> The encoder (<italic>q</italic><sub><italic>ϕ</italic></sub>(<bold><italic>z</italic></bold>|<bold><italic>x</italic></bold>)) takes the input C<italic>α</italic> coordinates of protein conformations at time t (<bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic>t</italic></bold></sub>) and tries to learn the interactions between two residues (<italic>z</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>) in the protein as a latent space. The decoder (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>θ</italic></sub>(<bold><italic>x</italic></bold>|<bold><italic>z</italic></bold>)) network try to regenerate the protein conformation at time <italic>t</italic> + <italic>τ</italic> (<bold><italic>x</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic>t</italic>+<italic>τ</italic></bold></sub>). Similar to other VAE, the learning process maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn20">Equation 20</xref>, where <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>θ</italic></sub>(<bold><italic>z</italic></bold>) represents the prior distribution for <bold><italic>z</italic></bold>. Here, the prior distribution is selected as default presented in the original paper, where it is represented as a categorical distribution with <italic>K</italic> = 4 (<italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.91, <italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> = 0.03, <italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> = 0.03, <italic>P</italic><sub>4</sub> = 0.03).</p>
<p>As shown in Equation, the ELBO consists of two terms. In the first term, further mathematical derivations can show that the first term can be represented as the the reconstruction error (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn21">Equation 21</xref>), where <italic>σ</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> is variance of the distribution, a user defined parameter.

</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn21">
<graphic xlink:href="560261v2_eqn21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The second term is also called regularization term which is the the K-L divergence between estimated posterior (<italic>q</italic><sub><italic>ϕ</italic></sub>(<bold><italic>z</italic></bold>|<bold><italic>x</italic></bold>)) and prior distribution (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>θ</italic></sub>(<bold><italic>z</italic></bold>)) (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn22">Equation 22</xref>). As the prior distribution is a categorical distribution, the K-L divergence becomes entropy of the posterior distribution. We obtained the code for the NRI network from the GitHub implementation and kept most of hyperparameters as default for our training, except for decreasing the hidden layer size to 64.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref></sup> From each unbinding simulations, 10 unbiased trajectories were selected where the ligand remain in the bound pose. Each trajectory has a length of 100 ns. Both cases, the <italic>τ</italic> was selected to be 5 ns. The allosteric weights (posterior probability) were obtained from the validation data (2 trajectories), where training was performed with remaining 8 trajectories (Figure S18). This procedure was repeated three times, where training and validation data were selected randomly.

<title>Standard Binding Free Energy Calculations</title>
<p>To calculate the standard binding free energy from simulation, we adopted a procedure described in Buch et al..<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> In this procedure, a volumetric correction term is added to the PMF to calculate the final binding free energy (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn23">Equation 23</xref>). The volumetric correction term is used to predict the free energy at the standard condition (1M) as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn24">Equation 24</xref>, where <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> corresponds to the volume of a molecule should occupy at the standard condition (1661 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>) and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub> is the volume of the unbounded state in the simulation box. The expression for the PMF contribution of the free energy is shown is in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn25">Equation 25</xref>, where the denominator of the equation can be represented as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="560261v2_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the final derivation of Δ<italic>G</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn26">Equation 26</xref>

In this work, to estimate the free energy (Δ<italic>G</italic>) x, y, z component of the ligand center of mass is calculated compared to the center of mass of the alpha carbons of binding pocket residues. The three dimensional space was descretized into 25 <italic>×</italic> 25 <italic>×</italic> 50 bins and each bin is weighted using TRAM calculated probability density. Depth of the pmf (Δ<italic>W</italic>) was calculated by averaging the pmf of the 100 bins with highest pmf in the bulk. To evaluate the weighted binding volume <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="560261v2_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, we selected the bins with pmf less than 1 kcal/mol.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents insights into biased signaling in GPCRs, namely cannabinoid receptors. Biased signaling is of broad interest in general, and cannabinoid signaling is particularly relevant for understanding the impact of new drugs that target this receptor. Mechanistic insight from work like this could enable new approaches to mitigate the public health impact of new psychoactive drugs. Towards that end, this manuscript seeks to understand how new psychoactive substances (NPS, e.g. MDMB-FUBINACA) elicit more signaling through β-arrestin than classical cannabinoids (e.g. HU-210). The authors use an interesting combination of simulations and machine learning.</p>
<p>The caption for Figure 3 doesn't explain the color scheme, so it's not obvious what the start and end states of the ligand are.</p>
<p>For the metadynamics simulations were multiple Gaussian heights/widths tried to see what, if any, impact that has on the unbinding pathway? That would be useful to help ensure all the relevant pathways were explored.</p>
<p>It would be nice to acknowledge previous applications of metadynamics+MSMs and (separately) TRAM, such as the Simulation of spontaneous G protein activation... (Sun et al. eLife 2018) and Estimation of binding rates and affinities... (Ge and Voelz JCP 2022).</p>
<p>What is KL divergence analysis between macrostates? I know KL divergence compares probability distributions, but it is not clear what distributions are being compared.</p>
<p>I suggest being more careful with the language of universality. It can be &quot;supported&quot; but &quot;showing&quot; or &quot;proving&quot; its universal would require looking at all possible chemicals in the class.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The investigation provides computational as well as biochemical insights into the (un)binding mechanisms of a pair of psychoactive substances into cannabinoid receptors. A combination of molecular dynamics simulation and a set of state-of-the art statistical post-processing techniques were employed to exploit GPCR-ligand dynamics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of the manuscript lies in the usage and comparison of TRAM as well as Markov state modelling (MSM) for investigating ligand binding kinetics and thermodynamics. Usually, MSMs have been more commonly used for this purpose. But as the authors have pointed out, implicit in the usage of MSMs lies the assumption of detailed balance, which would not hold true for many cases especially those with skewed binding affinities. In this regard, the author's usage of TRAM which harnesses both biased and unbiased simulations for extracting the same, provides a more appropriate way out.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the authors have used TRAM (by citing MSM to be inadequate in these cases), the thermodynamic comparisons of both techniques provide similar values. In this case, one would wonder what advantage TRAM would hold in this particular case.</p>
<p>(2) The initiation of unbiased simulations from previously run biased metadynamics simulations would almost surely introduce hysteresis in the analysis. The authors need to address these issues.</p>
<p>(3) The choice of ligands in the current work seems very forced and none of the results compare directly with any experimental data. An ideal case would have been to use the seminal D.E. Shaw research paper on GPCR/ligand binding as a benchmark and then show how TRAM, using much lesser biased simulation times, would fare against the experimental kinetics or even unbiased simulated kinetics of the previous report</p>
<p>(4) The method section of the manuscript seems to suggest all the simulations were started from a docked structure. This casts doubt on the reliability of the kinetics derived from these simulations that were spawned from docked structure, instead of any crystallographic pose. Ideally, the authors should have been more careful in choosing the ligands in this work based on the availability of the crystallographic structures.</p>
<p>(5) The last part of using a machine learning-based approach to analyse allosteric interaction seems to be very much forced, as there are numerous distance-based more traditional precedent analyses that do a fair job of identifying an allosteric job.</p>
<p>(6) While getting busy with the methodological details of TRAM vs MSM, the manuscript fails to share with sufficient clairty what the distinctive features of two ligand binding mechanisms are.</p>
