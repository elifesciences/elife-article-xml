<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The specific role that prolactin plays in lactational infertility, as distinct from other suckling or metabolic cues, remains unresolved. Here, deletion of the prolactin receptor (Prlr) from forebrain neurons or arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in failure to maintain normal lactation-induced suppression of estrous cycles. Kisspeptin immunoreactivity and pulsatile LH secretion were increased in these mice, even in the presence of ongoing suckling stimulation and lactation. GCaMP fibre photometry of arcuate kisspeptin neurons revealed that the normal episodic activity of these neurons is rapidly suppressed in pregnancy and this was maintained throughout early lactation. Deletion of Prlr from arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in early reactivation of episodic activity of kisspeptin neurons prior to a premature return of reproductive cycles in early lactation. These observations show dynamic variation in arcuate kisspeptin neuronal activity associated with the hormonal changes of pregnancy and lactation, and provide direct evidence that prolactin action on arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary for suppressing fertility during lactation in mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In mammals, lactation is accompanied by a period of infertility. This adaptive change establishes appropriate birth spacing to enable maternal metabolic resources to be directed towards caring for the new-born offspring, rather than supporting another pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Lactational infertility is characterized by a lactation-induced suppression of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, and the temporary loss of the reproductive cycle (in rodents this is exhibited as an extended period of diestrus or anestrus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Lactation is also characterised by chronically elevated levels of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin, which is essential for milk production and promotes adaptive changes in maternal physiology and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Despite hyperprolactinaemia being a well-recognized cause of infertility, the specific role that prolactin plays in lactational infertility, as distinct from other suckling- or metabolic-related cues, is currently unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have confirmed that kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are responsible for the periodic release of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and subsequent pulsatile LH secretion that drives reproductive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Studies using GCaMP fibre photometry in conscious mice have demonstrated that the arcuate kisspeptin neuronal population exhibits episodes of increased intracellular calcium levels coincident with, and immediately preceding, each pulse of LH secretion in intact and gonadectomised male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Miniscope investigations showed that individual kisspeptin neurons within the arcuate population act in a coordinated, synchronised, and episodic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Loss of pulsatile LH secretion during lactation and consequent lactational infertility may be caused by the loss of kisspeptin-mediated stimulation of GnRH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Kisspeptin expression is markedly suppressed in lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and even when exogenously stimulated, kisspeptin neurons are unable to activate GnRH neurons during lactation, likely due to a lack of kisspeptin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>It is well established that hyperprolactinemia causes infertility, and thus, the elevated prolactin present in lactation seems a likely candidate to be involved in suppressing fertility during lactation. Prolactin administration acutely suppresses LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), and chronic exposure to elevated prolactin reduces <italic>Kiss1</italic> mRNA expression in the arcuate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). In lactating mice, suppressing endogenous prolactin secretion shortens the period of infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), suggesting that prolactin is important for maintaining the suppression of pulsatile LH secretion during lactation. Such a role for prolactin is controversial, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), with studies in a number of species suggesting that the neural stimulation of suckling may be more important than prolactin in maintaining lactational infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). However, it has previously been difficult to disentangle the specific role of prolactin, as suckling, prolactin, and milk production are so tightly linked that manipulating one ultimately impacts the others, making it difficult to determine the contribution of any one element. Here, using a conditional deletion strategy, we have blocked prolactin action in the brain leaving suckling, lactation, and maternal behaviour intact. Using GCaMP fibre photometry techniques, we have also documented arcuate kisspeptin neuron activity across pregnancy and lactation transitions in the same mice and established that prolactin directly acts on these neurons to suppress fertility in lactation.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experiments were performed using adult female mice on a C57BL/6J background (8-20 weeks of age unless otherwise stated). Mice were housed under controlled temperature (22 °C ± 2°C) and lighting (12-hour light/12-hour dark schedule, with lights on at 0600 hours) with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water (Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet 2918; Envigo, Huntingdon, United Kingdom). Daily body weight was recorded and daily vaginal cytology was used to monitor the estrous cycle stage. All experiments were carried out with approval from the University of Otago Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>To establish pregnancies, mice were mated with male wild-type C57BL/6J mice (presence of sperm plug = day 1 pregnancy). Male mice were then removed once a sperm plug was seen, and no male mice were present at parturition. The first day a litter was seen was counted as day 1 of lactation and maternal mice were left undisturbed till day 3 of lactation, when vaginal monitoring would resume and litter size was normalised to 6 pups per animal, unless otherwise stated. The intention of the normalisation was to reduce variability in the degree of suckling stimulus each dam would receive.</p>
<p>Towards the end of each recording period, bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) was performed under isoflurane anaesthesia with pre- and post-operative Carprofen (5mg/kg, s.c.) administered for pain relief. This enabled us to examine post-OVX changes in activity of kisspeptin neurons and expression of kisspeptin in the arcuate nucleus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Pulsatile hormone measurement</title>
<p>To monitor pulsatile secretion of LH, serial tail tip blood sampling and measurement of LH by ELISA was undertaken as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). As novel exposure and restraint stress has been shown to suppress pulsatile LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), all mice were habituated to the tail tip blood sampling procedure by picking up the mouse in a gentle restraint device (soft cardboard tube) or hand and lightly massaging the tail for approximately 5 minutes per day for at least 3 weeks prior to experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Sequential whole blood samples (4μl) were collected in 6 minute intervals for 3 hours between 0900 and 1200 hours, unless otherwise stated. Samples were immediately diluted in 48ul 0.01M PBS/0.05% Tween 20, and frozen on dry ice before being stored at -20°C for subsequent LH measurement.</p>

<title>RNAscope</title>
<p>Mice were transcardially perfused with a micro-perfusion pump with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brain sections (14μm-thick) were prepared, thaw mounted onto superfrost-plus microscope slides and then stored at -80°C. RNAscope in-situ hybridization was performed using the RNAscope 2.5 High definition Duplex Detection kit – chromogenic (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA) largely in accordance with manufacturer’s instruction. The channel 1 Prlr probe was custom designed to pick up only the long form of the prolactin receptor. It was designed to transcript NM_011169.5 with a target sequence spanning nucleotides 1107-2147 (Ref: 588621; Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA). The channel 2 Kiss1 probe was custom designed to transcript NM_178260.3 with a target sequence spanning nucleotides 5 to 485 (Ref: 500141-C2; Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA). Sections were thawed at 55°C, postfixed for 3 minutes in 2% PFA, washed in 0.01M PBS for 5 minutes, and endogenous peroxidases were blocked with a hydrogen peroxidase solution for 10 minutes. Tissue was washed in distilled water (3x 2 minutes), then briefly immersed in 100% ethanol, air dried for 5 minutes, and a hydrophobic barrier was applied. Tissue was permeabilized with RNAscope protease plus for 30 minutes at 40°C. Sections were washed (2 x 2 minutes) and were hybridized with the Prlr and Kiss1 probes (1:300 dilution, Prlr:Kiss1) or negative control probe (Cat#320751; Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA) at 40°C for 2 hours. Amplification (Amp 1-6) was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were then hybridized with a Fast-RED (1:60, Fast-RED B:Fast-RED A) for 10 minutes at room temperature, before undergoing further amplification steps (Amp 7-10) in accordance to manufacturer’s instructions. The final positive hybridization was detected by incubation with the secondary detection reagents (1:50, Fast-GREEN B:Fast-GREEN) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Sections were washed, counterstained with haematoxylin (25% Gills), dried at 60°C for 20 minutes, and cover-slipped with VectaMount (Vector laboratories, H-5000) before imaging using an Olympus BX51 light microscope and Olympus UPlanSApo 10/20x lenses.</p>
<p>Quantification of the proportion of kisspeptin neurons co-expressing <italic>Prlr</italic> mRNA was undertaken in FIJI software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) following image acquisition. Positive hybridization for <italic>Kiss1</italic> and <italic>Prlr</italic> was determined based on scoring guidelines included in the manufacturer’s protocol (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). The total number of <italic>Kiss1</italic>-expressing cells and the total number of these that showed <italic>Prlr</italic> mRNA expression were counted.</p>

<title>Effect of neuron-specific deletion of the prolactin receptor gene on the maintenance of lactational infertility</title>
<p>To investigate whether prolactin action in the brain is required for lactational infertility, neuron-specific <italic>Prlr</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) and their respective Cre-negative controls (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>) were generated (as previously described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>)). We have previously shown that while <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice do not have a complete Prlr deletion in the forebrain. There are areas of extensive deletion (as measured by reduced prolactin-induced pSTAT5), such as the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and there are also areas where Prlr is reduced by about 50% such as the medial pre-optic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). In our experience with these animals, this is sufficient to retain normal maternal behaviour in most animals (our unpublished data), and this was the case for the animals used in the present study. RNAscope in-situ hybridization was done to confirm the degree of knockout in intact, diestrous, nulligravid, non-lactating (henceforth termed NL) mice and 14 day post-OVX mice (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> intact n = 6, <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> OVX n = 5, <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> intact n = 5, <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> OVX n = 5; all aged 8-16 weeks). Both intact and OVX mice were included as kisspeptin cell bodies are only visible in the rostral periventricular region of the third ventricle (RP3V) of intact mice and in the arcuate nucleus of OVX mice, due to estradiol regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice showed a significant decrease in the percentage of <italic>Kiss1</italic>-expressing cells co-expressing <italic>Prlr</italic> compared to controls in both the RP3V (p = &lt;0.0001) and arcuate nucleus (p = 0.0009) (unpaired two-tailed t tests, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1A-D</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice are hyperprolactinaemic due to impaired negative feedback of prolactin on hypothalamic dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) and therefore show disrupted estrous cycles (showing recurrent pseudopregnancy-like cycles with long periods of diestrus of approximately 14 days between estrous stages). However, these mice are able to become pregnant and have normal pregnancies. All <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice were given a 250μl subcutaneous injection of bromocriptine (5mg/kg, 5% ethanol/saline; Tocris Bioscience Cat#0427) prior to being mated. This treatment was designed to reinstate an estrous cycle in <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice. Bromocriptine is an agonist for the type 2 dopamine receptor and inhibits prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), thereby terminating the pseudopregnancy-like state and bringing the mice into proestrus the following day. Following treatment, all mice were then housed with a stud male.</p>
<p>For <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice, estrous cycles were monitored from day 3 of lactation until the first day of diestrus following a day of estrus (proestrus and estrus had to be observed prior to transcardial perfusion on the first day of diestrus). Brains were collected following transcardial perfusion for assessment of kisspeptin immunoreactivity. For every lactating <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mouse (n = 8), the brain of a <italic>Prlr<sup>l</sup></italic><sup>ox/lox</sup> control mouse (n = 8) of the equivalent day (±1) of lactation was also collected. A group of NL mice of both genotypes (n = 5-6) was also perfused for immunohistochemistry on diestrus.</p>
<p>To evaluate pulsatile LH secretion in early lactation (prior to the return of estrous cycles) and to determine whether progesterone played any role in regulating pulsatile LH secretion in lactation, additional groups of lactating <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and <italic>Prlr<sup>l</sup></italic><sup>ox/lox</sup> control mice were generated. These mice were treated with either the progesterone receptor antagonist, mifepristone (4mg/kg in sesame oil, s.c.; AK Scientific Inc Cat#J10622), or vehicle (n = 7-8 per group) on the morning of day 4 of lactation and day 5 of lactation. This dose was selected as it was found to be sufficient to cause termination of pregnancy in wild-type C57BL/6J mice (p = 0.0072, chi-squared test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>; pilot study, n = 6 both groups). Neither vehicle nor mifepristone treatment had an effect on litter weight gain (interaction of time x genotype &amp; treatment p = 0.5322, two-way repeated measures ANOVA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). Mice underwent blood sampling for LH for 3 hours on day 5 of lactation, 30 minutes after treatment.</p>

<title>Measurement of LH concentrations</title>
<p>An established sandwich ELISA method was used to determine LH concentration in diluted whole blood samples collected from mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Briefly, a 96-well high plate was incubated with bovine monoclonal antibody (LHβ518b7, 1:1000 in 1xPBS; Dr. L. Sibley, UC Davis, CA, USA) for 16 h at 4°C. Following incubation of standards, controls and experimental samples for 2 hours, plates were incubated in rabbit polyclonal LH antibody (AFP240580Rb; 1:10,000; National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIH) for 90 minutes, followed by incubation with polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG/HRP antibody (1:1000; DAKO Cytomation) for 90 minutes. Finally, plates were incubated in OPD (o-phenylenediamine capsules; Sigma-Aldrich Cat#P7288) for 30 minutes. A standard curve for the detection of LH concentration was generated using serial dilutions of mouse LH-reference preparation peptide (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIH). LH levels were read using a standard absorbance plate reader (SpectraMax ABS Plus; Molecular Devices) at 490nm and 630nm wavelengths. The assay had a sensitivity of 0.04ng/ml to 4ng/ml, with an intra-assay coefficient of variation of 4.40% and an inter-assay coefficient of variation of 8.29%.</p>
<p>PULSAR Otago was used to define LH pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Parameters used; Smoothing 0.7, Peak split 2.5, Level of detection 0.04, Amplitude distance 3, Assay variability 0, 2.5, 3.3, G(1)=3.5, G(2)=2.6, G(3)=1.9, G(4)=1.5, G(6)=1.2.

<p>Mice were anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbital (15mg/mL, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 4% PFA. Brains were removed, postfixed in the same solution, and cryoprotected overnight in 30% sucrose before being frozen at -80°C. Two sets of 30μm thick coronal brain sections were cut using a sliding microtome, from Bregma 1.10mm to - 2.80mm.

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry for kisspeptin in the RP3V and arcuate nucleus was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Briefly, sections were incubated in polyclonal rabbit anti-kisspeptin primary antibody (AC 566, 1:10,000; gift from A. Caraty, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Paris, France) for 48 hours at 4°C. Sections were then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Vector biolabs, Peterborough, GK) for 90 min at room temperature, followed by incubation in an avidin-biotin complex (Elite vectastain ABC kit, Vector laboratories). The bound antibody-peroxidase complex was visualised using a nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction, to form a black cytoplasmic precipitate.</p>
<p>Brain sections were imaged as described in RNAscope section above. Quantification of kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V, was undertaken by manually counting all labelled neurons present in all three subdivisions: the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV); rostral preoptic periventricular nucleus (rPVpo); and caudal preoptic periventricular nucleus (cPVpo). Two sections per subdivision per mouse were averaged for each animal. As kisspeptin cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus were not easily observed, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), kisspeptin fibre immunoreactivity was imaged using a Gryphax NAOS colour camera (Jenoptik) and evaluated using FIJI software and the voxel counter function (National Institutes of Health). Kisspeptin fibre density was measured in the arcuate nucleus across the three subdivisions; rostral arcuate (rARC), middle arcuate (mARC), and caudal arcuate (cARC). Two sections of each subdivision per animal were counted and then averaged across each animal to get total number and reported as total amount of voxels per ROI (voxel fraction).</p>

<p>Adult <italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> or <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice (2-3 months old) were anaesthetised with 2% Isoflurane, given local Lidocaine (4mg/kg, s.c.) and Carprofen (5mg/kg, s.c.) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A custom-made unilateral Hamilton syringe apparatus holding one Hamilton syringe was used to perform unilateral injections into the arcuate nucleus. The needles were lowered into place (-0.14mm A/P, +0.04mm M/L, -0.56mm DV) over 2 minutes and left in situ for 3 minutes before injection was made. 1μl AAV9-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40 (1.3x10<sup>-13</sup> GC/ml, University of Pennsylvania Vector Core, Philadelphia, PA, USA) was injected into the arcuate nucleus at a rate of ∼100nl/min with the needles left in situ for 3 minutes prior to being withdrawn over a period of 6 minutes. This was followed by implantation of a unilateral indwelling optical fibre (400 μm diameter, 6.5 mm long, 0.48 numerical aperture (NA), Doric Lenses, Canada, product code: MFC_400/430-0.48_6.5mm_SM3*_FLT) at the same coordinates. Carprofen (5mg/kg body weight, s.c.) was administered for post-operative pain relief. After surgery, mice received daily handling and habituation to the fibre photometry recording conditions over 4-6 weeks before experimentation began.</p>

<title>GCaMP fibre photometry</title>
<p>Photometry was performed as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Fluorescence signals were acquired using a custom-built fibre photometry system made primarily from Doric components. Violet (405nm) and blue (490nm) fibre-coupled LEDs were sinusoidally modulated at 531 and 211 Hz, respectively, and focused into a 400μm, 0.48 numerical aperture fibre optic patch cord connected to the mouse. Emitted fluorescence was collected by the same fibre and focused onto a femtowatt photoreceiver (2151, Newport). The two GCaMP6s emission signals were collected at 10 Hz in a scheduled 5s on/15s off mode by demodulating the 405nm (non-calcium dependent) and 490nm (calcium dependent) signals. The power output at the tip of the fibre was set at 50μW. Fluorescent signals were acquired using a custom software acquisition system (Tussock Innovation, Dunedin, New Zealand) and analysed using custom templates created by Dr Joon Kim (University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand) based on mathematics and calculations similar to those previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Briefly, the fluorescent signal obtained after stimulation with 405nm light was used to correct for movement artefacts as follows: first, the 405nm signal was filtered using a savitzky-golay filter and fitted to the 490nm signal using least linear square regression. The fitted 405nm signal was then subtracted and divided from the 490nm signal to obtain the movement and bleaching corrected signal. The output of these templates is 490-adjusted405/adjusted405, which was multiplied to get the final ΔF/F as a percentage increase. All photometry data is reported as ΔF/F(%).</p>
<p>All recordings were obtained from freely behaving mice between 0800 hours and 1200 hours (apart from 24 hours post weaning recording (0900 hours to 1700 hours), and day 18/19 pregnancy recording (1800 hours to 0800 hours the following day)). Synchronized events (SEs) were defined as when ΔF/F exceeds 3 standard deviations (SD) above the trace mean. Manual SE shape analysis was performed in addition to standard deviation method for certain datasets where necessary. SEs were counted manually to determine frequency of SEs per 60 minutes. The between-animal variability in total signal means that changes in SE amplitude can only be reported as relative changes within an animal. Relative SE amplitude was calculated by using normalised ΔF/F data and then subtracting the peak of an SE from the nearest nadir to the rise of the SE and averaging that for the number of SEs in a recording. To obtain normalised ΔF/F, three pre-pregnancy datasets from each mouse were used to find the average maximum ΔF/F for that mouse. All datasets were then divided by that normalisation value to get normalised ΔF/F for each trace for each individual mouse. In these long-term longitudinal studies, some data points are missing due to issues with recordings (e.g. dirty fibre optic cannula or system battery issues), meaning that occasionally fewer mice are used for analysis at various time points. During experimentation, no mice lost cannulas, but a gradual reduction in amplitude of signal was observed over time.</p>
<p>Following experimentation, brains were collected in a similar way to that described above. Postmortem analysis of cannula placement and GCaMP6 transfection in each animal was not done, because with experience, the quality and characteristics of the SE recordings (including corresponding pulsatile LH secretion) in each animal was indicative of successful cannula placement and transfection of the GCaMP. In a preliminary trial the green fluorescent protein (GFP) attached to the GCAMP was restricted to the caudal arcuate nucleus (n = 3 mice, preliminary trial), with little evidence of spread into the rostral or middle arcuate. GFP was seen exclusively ipsilaterally, with no GFP observed on the contralateral side. Cannula placement in these trial animals was in the caudal arcuate.</p>

<title>Monitoring the activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons across different reproductive stages in the same mice</title>
<p>Adult <italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice were 8-10 weeks of age at the beginning of experiments, and up to 12 months old by the time of final recording (n = 8 during pregnancy; n = 6 during lactation, 2 mice were euthanised due to dystocia). Monitoring of vaginal cytology and weight was continuous from 1 week pre-surgery till day 19 of pregnancy and resumed on day 3 of lactation until the end of experiment. All handling stopped on day 19 of pregnancy to avoid potential compromise of parturition and onset of maternal behaviour.</p>
<p>To investigate the activity of the arcuate kisspeptin population across different reproductive states in the same animal, the following recording protocol was followed for all <italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice, unless otherwise stated; diestrus NL, day 4 of pregnancy, day 14 of pregnancy, day 18/19 of pregnancy (overnight), day 7 of lactation, day 14 of lactation, day 18 of lactation, 24 hours after weaning, first diestrus after estrous cycles begin following weaning, and 10 days post-OVX. In addition, blood sample collection for paired LH measurement was done in diestrus NL state, on day 14 of pregnancy (in 4 mice, maximum of 6 samples were collected around small “peaks” in baseline), day 7 of lactation, and day 14 of lactation. During sampling, blood samples were taken at the usual 6 minute intervals previously described, however if a SE was observed and the next scheduled sampling was more than 3 minutes away, an extra blood sample was taken 2 minutes after the SE. Following this additional sampling, the next scheduled blood sample would be taken at its original time and then every 6 minutes after, till another SE was seen. Blood sampling was not carried out at additional time points as blood sampling was undertaken at least a week apart, and stress from repeated sampling was attempted to be kept at a minimum e.g., not blood sampling around the time of birth. Fibre photometry recordings were usually between 2-4 hours in length. The only longer recordings were undertaken on day 18/19 of pregnancy (14 hours) and 24 hours after weaning (8 hours). These particular recording sessions were extended to determine whether there were any longer-term changes occurring in the activity of the arcuate kisspeptin population in the lead up to parturition or following weaning of pups (states closely followed by postpartum estrus and resumption of normal estrous cycles, respectively).</p>

These were observed to be at a similar rate to that described previously in diestrous mice using GCaMP photometry in a different <italic>Kiss1</italic> mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), with periodic SEs occurring about once per hour (1.250±0.250/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>).</p>

On day 4 of pregnancy, SE frequency had markedly decreased (0.297±0.136/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), indicating an early reduction in activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons during pregnancy. By day 14 of pregnancy, no SEs were seen (0±0/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>) and this was confirmed by a lack of pulsatile LH secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). In late pregnancy (day 18), neuronal activity was monitored for 14 hours, during which time low amplitude, SEs were unexpectedly observed at similar frequencies to NL levels (2.043±0.940/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B-C</xref>). This unusual pattern of activity is illustrated in more detail in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> where, alongside the resurgence of low amplitude SEs, a marked increase in baseline activity was observed relative to recordings at other reproductive stages. This activity was reminiscent of the miniature SEs observed to be caused by activation of subgroups of arcuate kisspeptin cells using brain slice calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), but we are unable to resolve such SEs using the present methods. Since our aim was to continue longitudinal assessment of the arcuate kisspeptin population into lactation and weaning, mice were not disrupted by blood sampling immediately prior to parturition as we were concerned that this additional stressor might interfere with establishment of maternal behaviour. Hence, we are unable to report whether these low amplitude SEs and elevated baseline activity were associated with LH secretion.</p>

<p>Evaluation of activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons during lactation showed complete suppression of activity on day 7 of lactation with a corresponding absence of pulsatile LH secretion (0±0/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). This lactation-induced suppression of activity was partially relieved by day 14 of lactation (0.583±0.083/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), with low frequency SEs again corresponding to low frequency pulsatile LH secretion. Further increases in SE frequency were seen on day 18 of lactation (0.850±0.100/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), including an increase in baseline activity, similar to that seen in late pregnancy, and by 24 hours after weaning (day 22 postpartum) the frequency of SEs had returned to close to non-pregnant levels (1.375±0.114/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). SE frequency remained unchanged on the day of first diestrus following a return to estrous cycles after weaning (1.533±0.226/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Ten days post-OVX, clusters of high amplitude arcuate kisspeptin population activity was observed (4.778±0.222/hr; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), consistent with previous reports following OVX in nulliparous mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We demonstrate here that prolactin action in arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary for the maintained suppression of fertility during lactation in mice. Neuron-specific Prlr deletion (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) resulted in premature return to estrus in early lactation, even in the presence of ongoing suckling stimulus and the full metabolic consequences of milk production. Accompanying the resumption of estrus was an absence of the normal lactation-induced reduction in kisspeptin immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Pulsatile LH secretion was also observed on day 5 of lactation prior to the premature estrus when it would normally have been completely absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). To evaluate the specific role of kisspeptin neurons in mediating the prolactin-induced suppression of fertility, we have comprehensively mapped the activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons throughout a full reproductive cycle: pregnancy, lactation, and after weaning in individual animals. The data show an immediate suppression of activity of arcuate kisspeptin neuronal activity during pregnancy, and this is maintained throughout most of lactation, apart from a brief window of reactivation immediately prior to parturition. Deleting Prlr specifically from arcuate kisspeptin neurons (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) prevented the suppression of activity in early lactation, resulting in premature induction of episodic activation of kisspeptin neurons, and early onset of estrus. Combined, these data provide direct evidence that prolactin action on kisspeptin neurons is necessary for lactation-induced infertility in mice.</p>
<p>It is now well established that arcuate kisspeptin neurons form the GnRH “pulse generator”, and hence drive pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus and consequent pulsatile secretion of LH from the pituitary that is required for fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). This is the first study to monitor activity of the arcuate kisspeptin neurons across different reproductive states in the same animal, and the data largely match previously described patterns of LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). The frequency and dynamics of the SEs changed dramatically, initially due to the pregnancy-induced changes in ovarian hormones. The abrupt decrease in arcuate kisspeptin activity in early pregnancy is likely caused by rising levels of progesterone, known to profoundly suppress activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons and LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Progesterone is elevated throughout pregnancy, gradually increasing until luteolysis and progesterone withdrawal occurs in the lead up to parturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a transient reactivation of the arcuate kisspeptin neurons in the night between days 18 and 19 of pregnancy. This was characterised by frequent, low amplitude SEs, and increased baseline activity that may represent the intermittent synchroniszed activity of small subsets of arcuate kisspeptin neurons that have not yet transitioned to full synchroniszation of the whole population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). It seems likely that this pattern of activity is associated with progesterone withdrawal in late pregnancy and may be important in stimulating follicular growth leading up to a postpartum ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>).</p>
<p>In early lactation, episodic activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons was absent, with sporadic low-amplitude activity returning around day 14 of lactation. There was another period of increased baseline activity in late lactation, similar to that seen in late pregnancy, potentially representing a signature of reactivation of synchroniszed activity of the arcuate kisspeptin neurons. This increase in arcuate kisspeptin population activity during late lactation mirrors the increase in LH levels that has been reported as lactation progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Overall patterns of SE activity rapidly returned to normal diestrus levels soon after weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). However, in the absence of Prlr in arcuate kisspeptin neurons, SE activity re-appeared as early as day 5 of lactation, even in the presence of ongoing suckling. These data clearly show that prolactin action in arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary to sustain lactational infertility in mice. The observed disruption of lactational infertility in <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice is particularly remarkable given that Prlr deletion is restricted to arcuate kisspeptin neurons in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), and prolactin action on RP3V kisspeptin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) and on gonadotrophs in the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) are unaffected.</p>
<p>The indispensable role for prolactin in mediating lactation-induced infertility in the mouse is surprising, given the consensus of much work in other species concluding that other factors may be more important (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>)). This may reflect a level of redundancy amongst contributing factors across all species, including ovarian hormones, metabolic cues and neural inputs of suckling. Notably, the conditional deletion approach described here distinguishes prolactin action from the neurogenic effects of suckling without altering the process of lactation itself. Moreover, this approach avoids the potential confounding effects of using dopamine agonists to suppress prolactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), given that dopamine can directly inhibit GnRH neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).</p>
<p>While the effects of widespread neuronal deletion (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) on fertility were largely recapitulated by the arcuate kisspeptin-specific model (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>), it was apparent that the global deletion was more effective at inducing the return to estrus during lactation (in 100% of <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice by day 10), compared to the arcuate kisspeptin-specific model (63% by day 10, and 83% by day 19). This may be due to the absence of lactation-induced suppression of <italic>Kiss1</italic> expression in RP3V kisspeptin neurons of <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice. Similarly, we cannot rule out the possibility that other populations of prolactin-sensitive neurons, such as GABA or dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), may contribute to suppressing estrous cycles during lactation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our data collectively provide strong evidence that prolactin action on arcuate kisspeptin neurons is the primary factor mediating lactation-induced infertility in mice. Given that hyperprolactinemia induces infertility in many other mammalian species, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>), it is possible that a conserved mechanism could be contributing to lactational infertility in these species.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Hackwell and colleagues performed technically impressive, long-term, GCaMP fiber photometry recordings from Kiss1 neurons in the arcuate nucleus of mice during multiple reproductive states. The data show an immediate suppression of activity of arc Kiss1 neuronal activity during pregnancy that is maintained during lactation. In the absence of any apparent change in suckling stimulus or milk production, mice lacking prolactin receptors in arcuate Kiss1 neurons regained Kiss1 episodic activity and estrous cyclicity faster than control mice, demonstrating that direct prolactin action on Kiss1 neurons is at least partially responsible for suppressing fertility in this species. The effect of loss of prolactin receptors from CamK2a expressing neurons was even greater, indicating either that prolactin sensitivity in Kiss1 neurons of the RP3V contributes to lactational infertility or that other prolactin-sensitive neurons are involved. These data demonstrate the important role of prolactin in suppressing Kiss1 neuron activity and thereby fertility during the lactational period in the mouse.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is the first study to monitor activity of the GnRH pulse-generating system across different reproductive states in the same animal. Another strength in the study design is that it isolated the effects of prolactin by maintaining normal lactation and suckling (assessed indirectly using pup growth curves). The study also offers insight into the phenomenon of postpartum ovulation in mice. The results showed a brief reactivation of arcuate Kiss1 activity immediately prior to parturition, attributed to falling progesterone levels at the end of pregnancy. This hypothesis will be of interest to the field and is likely to inspire testing in future studies. With the exceptions mentioned below, the conclusions of the paper are well supported by the data and the aims of the study were achieved. This paper is likely to raise the standard for technical expectations in the field and spark new interest in the direct impact of prolactin on Kiss1 neurons during lactation in other species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness in the approach is the use of genetic models that do not offer complete deletion of the prolactin receptor from targeted neuronal populations. A substantial proportion of Kiss1 neurons in both models retains the receptor. As a result, it is not clear whether the partial maintenance of cyclicity during lactation in the genetic models is due to incomplete deletion or to the involvement of other factors. In addition, results showing no impact of progesterone on LH secretion during lactation are surprising, given the effectiveness of progesterone-containing birth control in lactating women. While the authors assert their findings may reflect an important role for prolactin in lactational infertility in other mammalian species, that remains to be seen. Hyperprolactinemia is known to suppress GnRH release, but its importance in the suppression of cyclicity during the lactation is controversial. Indeed, in several species, the stimulus of suckling is considered to be the main driver of lactational fertility suppression. Data from rats shows that exogenous prolactin was unable to suppress LH release in dams deprived of their pups shortly after birth; both suckling and prolactin were necessary to suppress a post-ovariectomy rise in LH levels. The duration of amenorrhea does not correlate with average prolactin levels in humans, and suckling but not prolactin was required to suppress the postpartum rise in LH in the rhesus monkey. The protocol of this or other studies might result in discordant results; alternatively, mice may be an outlier in their mechanism of cycle suppression.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>I remain enthusiastic about this article, which has been substantially improved in this revision. However, I didn't feel the authors responded to any of the points I raised previously in my public review (see Weaknesses), for example by adding to the manuscript's discussion section. These are the larger, conceptual issues that speak to the value of the paper in the context of the existing literature. The authors could also state they feel they have addressed the issues raised sufficiently in the text.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The overall goal of Eleni et al. is to determine if the suppression of LH pulses during lactation is mediated by prolactin signaling at kisspeptin neurons. To address this, the authors used GCaMP fiber photometry and serial blood sampling to reveal that in vivo episodic arcuate kisspeptin neuron activity and LH pulses are suppressed throughout pregnancy and lactation. The authors further utilized knockout models to demonstrate that the loss of prolactin receptor signaling at kisspeptin cells prevents the suppression of kisspeptin cell activity and results in the early reestablishment of fertility during lactation. The work demonstrates exemplary design and technique, and the outcomes of these experiments are sophistically discussed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript demonstrates exceptional skill with powerful techniques and reveals a key role for arcuate kisspeptin neurons in maintaining lactation-induced infertility in mice. In a difficult feat, the authors used fiber photometry to map the activity of arcuate kisspeptin cells into lactation and weaning without disrupting parturition, lactation, or maternal behavior. The authors used a knockout approach to identify if the inhibition of fertility by prolactin is mediated via direct signaling at arcuate kisspeptin cells. Although the model does not perfectly eliminate prolactin receptor expression in all kisspeptin neurons, results from the achieved knockdown support the conclusion that prolactin signaling at kisspeptin neurons is required to maintain lactational infertility. The methods are advanced and appropriate for the aims, the study is rigorously conducted, and the conclusions are thoughtfully discussed.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I recommend being explicit regarding how the animals were habituated to blood sampling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>On lines 109-111 we have added a more detailed explanation of how mice were habituated to blood sampling. This includes details that mice were held and had their tails palpated for approximately 5 minutes per day.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Were any mice excluded due to loss or movement of the implant over time? Any details to allow replication of long-term measurements like this should be included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No mice lost their cannulas during experimentation so we have added a sentence on this on lines 303 to 304 to this effect.  We have also noted that there was a slight decrease in signal over the months of experimentation. A statement on line 318 has also been added that clarifies two mice lost between the pregnancy and lactation stages of experiment were euthanised due to dystocia.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The text states that synchronized episodic activity reappeared as early as 3 days after birth, citing Figure 6c as evidence. There is no 6c. Figure 6b shows day 5 after birth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The methods state mRNA levels had to be &quot;above background&quot; to be counted as colocalization. At how many fold/what percent above background was a cell considered positive for expression?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Positive hybridisation was scored according to the manufacturer’s protocol and a statement to this effect has been added on line 144.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Please ensure figure titles or the data graphs explicitly give the genotype of the mice in all figures (or state the mice are wildtype).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Genotype has been added to figure titles where possible. Genotypes are always given in figure legends and tables and/or explicitly stated on the figure itself.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 4's title states events are &quot;perfectly&quot; correlated, which is a subjective term. I recommend saying &quot;consistently&quot; or &quot;temporally&quot; correlated, depending on your meaning.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been amended to read “consistently correlated”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The comments below aim to clarify the paper's methodology and results but do not detract from my overall enthusiasm for this work.</p>
<p>- Given past studies demonstrating prolactin action in the brain, particularly the MPOA/MPN, is essential for maternal behavior, can the authors please clarify why this behavior is retained in the cam2a prlr knockout mice? The authors mention that prlr in the MPOA is only knocked down 50% compared to WT controls. Is this sufficient to retain maternal behavior?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our experience 50% Prlr in the MPOA is sufficient to retain normal maternal behaviour in most animals including the ones in this experiment (our original paper describing this showed relatively normal behavior, for example, with a vGAT and vGlut-mediated knockouts, and even a double knockout – it was only when we achieved complete KO with an AAV-Cre that we saw failure of maternal behavior – Brown et al, PNAS 3;114(40):10779-10784 2017). We have added a statement on lines 157-159 regarding this.  We have an additional paper in preparation specifically characterising the maternal behaviour and lactation outcomes in this line of mice, and we find most animals display normal maternal behaviour, with slightly impaired milk production in later lactation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Supplementary Figure 1. Can the authors please clarify the criteria for a cell to be positive for prlr? The methods state that the signal must be &quot;above background level.&quot; How was the background measurement obtained? In the negative control?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As per above, scoring of positive hydribisation was done according to the manufacturer’s protocol and a statement to this effect has been added on line 144.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Lines 310-314: This sentence describes RNAscope analysis of prlr knockdown in kisspeptin cells and refers to Extended Figure 3 - but I believe this is in Supplementary Figure 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 3-4: When mice return to estrous cycles, the amplitude of episodic kisspeptin neuron activity is the same as 24 hours after weaning, which appears much lower than in virgin females. Does this reach significance? If so, do the authors know why kisspeptin activity is still suppressed, and can they comment on why this may not affect estrous cyclicity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This does not reach significance – see Supplementary Table 1 (4C) for statistics. Therefore, no further analysis was done. This question would need to be examined with a follow up experiment. Given the 5s on, 15 s off scheduled mode of recording used here, amplitude was not an extremely accurate measure and amplitude has been reported as relative within each mouse. There is also an additional issue of a gradual reduction in amplitude of signal over time in these long-term experiments – although it is true that much larger signals were detected after ovariectomy at the end of the experiment.  At present, we have not tried to interpret whether the changes in amplitude are informative.</p>

<p>- Fiber photometry studies: Please indicate whether a post-mortem examination of GCaMP transfection and fiber photometry placement was conducted, and what region of the ARC was imaged.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Brains from these mice were collected, however postmortem analysis of cannula placement of GCaMP6 transfection was not carried out in all mice. This was based on our experience with this method, in that the quality and characteristic pattern of activity seen, as well as corresponding LH secretion following an SE, was indicative of successful cannula placement and transfection.  Incorrectly placed cannular failed to show SEs. A trial was done with 3 mice and cannula placement was found to be in the caudal ARC (cARC) with GFP (attached to GCaMP) restricted to the cARC. A statement has been added on lines 306-313 regarding this.</p>

<p>- Were male mice removed before birth? Please add to the methods section if not included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, male mice were removed after a sperm plug was seen and were never present at parturition. We have inserted additional details on line 95 to this effect.</p>

<p>These are referring to different groups of mice. N=7-8 is referring to the group size of mice in Figure 2 that were given mifepristone or vehicle control. In contrast the Supplementary figure 2 n number refers to the mice in the pilot study. Additional n number for the pilot study has been added on line 194.</p>
