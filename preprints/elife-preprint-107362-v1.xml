<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a promising new drug modality for novel therapeutics. However, the cellular mechanisms and regulatory pathways underlying their activity are not fully understood. Here, we unveil the role of deubiquitinases (DUBs) in regulating PROTAC activity, by screening 97 human DUBs for their influence on degradation of cell-cycle kinase AURKA using siRNA-mediated knockdown. Our findings reveal that DUBs OTUD6A and UCHL5 counteract degradation of AURKA by small molecule PROTACs. Further investigation using orthogonal dTAG PROTACs indicates that the PROTAC-opposing effect of OTUD6A is target-specific for AURKA, while UCHL5 counteracts degradation triggered by other PROTACs dependent on ubiquitin ligase adaptor CRBN, but not VHL. Furthermore, we show that differential sensitivity of the nuclear pool of AURKA to PROTAC-mediated degradation is fully explained by the specific subcellular localisation pattern of OTUD6A. These findings enhance our understanding of cellular pathways underpinning the action of PROTACs and indicate that combinations of DUB inhibitors and PROTACs will lead to enhanced target degradation and potential improvement in therapeutic outcomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over recent years the field of targeted protein degradation (TPD) has exploded as a new therapeutic strategy, enabling selective degradation of proteins of interest (POIs). Proteolysis- targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are one of the leading modalities of TPD tools; PROTACs consist of distinct binding moieties for a POI and E3 ubiquitin ligase connected by a chemical linker. This induced proximity facilitates ubiquitination of the POI which serves as a signal for its proteasomal degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The majority of PROTACs to date have been designed to recruit the cullin-RING ligases CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> and CRL2<sup>VHL</sup>, although expansion of the E3 landscape is a key priority for current research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Over 20 PROTACs have now entered clinical trials, with advanced candidates estrogen receptor PROTAC ARV-471<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and androgen receptor degrader ARV-110<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> under investigation in phase III clinical trials (NCT03888612, NCT05654623).</p>
<p>Despite the advancement of many PROTACs into clinical trials, the cellular mechanisms and regulatory pathways influencing PROTAC efficacy remain incompletely understood. Target-specific factors, including subcellular localisation of targets, have been shown to play a role in determining the amenability of certain substrates to PROTAC-mediated degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. For example, our previous work demonstrated the cell-cycle kinase AURKA shows differential sensitivity to PROTAC-mediated degradation depending on its subcellular localisation; AURKA on the mitotic spindle was degraded efficiently by CRBN-recruiting small molecule PROTAC (PROTAC-D) whilst AURKA at the centrosome was resistant to PROTAC-mediated degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Other studies have also shown the importance of subcellular localisation of a target in determining its degradation by PROTACs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, although the mechanisms underpinning these observations remain largely unexplored.</p>
<p>Ubiquitination of substrates requires a coordinated cascade of ubiquitin-activating (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) and ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. It is widely accepted that K11/K48-linked ubiquitin chains serve as signals for proteasomal degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, although recent evidence highlighted the role of branched ubiquitin chains (e.g., K48/K63- and K29/K48-branched chains) in enhancing proteasomal degradation of substrates in response to PROTACs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Beyond the ubiquitination machinery, other components of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), such as the AAA+ ATPase p97<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, are critical for ubiquitin chain processing and play a role in determining the fate of a PROTAC substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The role of deubiquitinase enzymes (DUBs), in determining PROTAC efficacy remains largely unexplored. Given their ability to cleave ubiquitin chains from substrates and stabilise targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, it is likely that DUBs could rescue PROTAC targets from proteasomal degradation.</p>
<p>In this study, we test the hypothesis that DUBs could oppose PROTAC-mediated degradation of cellular targets, using AURKA as a model target previously shown to exhibit differential PROTAC sensitivity dependent on subcellular localisation. We screen a panel of 97 DUBs by siRNA-mediated depletion to identify those which modulate PROTAC-sensitivity of AURKA. Our validation of screen results reveals DUBs with varying levels of specificity for both target protein and E3 and identifies one DUB, OTUD6A, which selectively protects the cytoplasmic pool of AURKA from PROTAC-mediated degradation.</p>

<title>Forced nuclear-localised of AURKA enhances its sensitivity to degradation by PROTAC-D, independently of ternary complex formation</title>
<p>Previous studies from our lab demonstrated that distinct subcellular pools of AURKA exhibit differential sensitivity to degradation by PROTAC-D, an AURKA-targeting PROTAC that combines the AURKA inhibitor alisertib with pomalidomide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Notably, we observed that an N- terminally truncated version of AURKA-Venus (Δ67) was simultaneously more efficiently degraded by PROTAC-D and more strongly localised to the nuclear compartment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To explore how nuclear localisation influences PROTAC-D-induced degradation of AURKA, we engineered an AURKA-Neon construct tagged with a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) and expressed it alongside wild-type (WT) AURKA-Neon in U2OS FZR1<sup>KO</sup> cells (in which AURKA is insensitive to its cognate E3, the APC/C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Quantitative live-cell imaging confirmed the nuclear localisation of NLS-AURKA-Neon compared to WT-AURKA-Neon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>).</p>

<p>Following PROTAC-D treatment, single-cell time-lapse imaging showed significantly greater degradation of NLS-AURKA-Neon than WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, C</xref>). Ubiquitin pulldowns confirmed increased ubiquitination of NLS-AURKA-Neon, evidenced by an increase in the intensity of the ubiquitin smear, and upward shift of ubiquitinated NLS-AURKA-Neon to higher molecular weights (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>PROTAC-D recruits the CRL4 adaptor protein CRBN. Given prior literature suggesting a stronger nuclear localisation of CRBN in certain cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and correlations between ternary complex formation (TCF) and neosubstrate degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, we hypothesised that enhanced TCF in the nucleus might drive the increased degradation of nuclear-localised AURKA. To test this, we used the <italic>in-situ</italic> proximity ligation assay (<italic>is</italic>PLA) to measure TCF in single cells. U2OS FZR1<sup>KO</sup> cells transfected with AURKA-Neon constructs were treated with DMSO or PROTAC-D, and <italic>is</italic>PLA performed to detect interactions between mNeon and endogenous CRBN. A robust PROTAC-D-dependent increase in single-cell <italic>is</italic>PLA signal was observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, G</xref>). However, there was no difference in the <italic>is</italic>PLA signal measured when comparing WT- and NLS- AURKA-Neon transfected cells treated with PROTAC-D (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, I</xref>), indicating that enhanced degradation of nuclear AURKA depends upon events downstream of TCF.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Primary screen for DUBs modulating PROTAC-D activity</title>
<p>We concluded that differential degradation of subcellular pools of AURKA would depend upon post-ubiquitination regulation of the target, pointing to DUBs as candidate limiting factors in the activity of PROTAC-D. To identify DUBs influencing PROTAC-D activity, we conducted a systematic siRNA screen targeting 97 DUBs.</p>
<p>To facilitate high-throughput screening, we developed a doxycycline-inducible HiBiT-AURKA U2OS cell line (U2OS HiBiT-AURKA<sup>TO</sup>) for sensitive readout of AURKA levels in bioluminescence assays. The HiBiT-AURKA signal was dependent on treatment with doxycycline and addition of furimazine, the NanoLuc substrate, to the assay lytic buffer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We confirmed that PROTAC-D and PROTAC-DX (a structural analogue of PROTAC-D differing only in linker-length) caused significant decrease in HiBiT-AURKA levels after 4 hours, which was rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, confirming proteasome-dependent AURKA degradation by PROTACs in this assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The elevated levels of HiBiT-AURKA levels with MG132 compared to DMSO-treated cells likely reflects the normal proteasomal degradation of AURKA that occurs independently of PROTAC-D. The assay successfully reported on dose-dependent action of PROTAC-D and PROTAC-DX (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). At concentrations above 1 µM, both PROTACs displayed the characteristic ‘hook effect’, where bioluminescence levels increased due to excessive binary binding of PROTACs to either AURKA or CRBN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Importantly, no effect on cell viability was observed during the 4-hour treatment window, even at high doses of PROTAC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Although PROTAC-DX showed greater degradation of AURKA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), PROTAC- D was chosen for the screen as it showed less degradation of AURKB at the four-hour timepoint (28% versus 60%) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Using a library of 97 siRNA pools, we individually depleted DUBs in U2OS HiBiT-AURKA<sup>TO</sup> cells, then induced HiBiT-AURKA expression with doxycycline and treated the cells with DMSO or PROTAC-D for 4 hours before taking bioluminescence measurements (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Comparing PROTAC-induced degradation under DUB siRNA-treated and negative control siRNA-treated conditions revealed the DUBs affecting sensitivity of AURKA to PROTAC-D (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Unexpectedly, a large number of DUB siRNAs caused a decrease in basal HiBiT-AURKA levels in DMSO-treated cells, such that sensitivity to PROTAC-D appeared reduced in our assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). This is consistent with the high turnover of AURKA in cells, suggesting that these DUBs may either directly remove ubiquitin from AURKA under basal conditions to protect AURKA from proteasomal degradation, or have roles in cellular pathways that indirectly affect AURKA levels. A Venn-diagram summarises the top-scoring hits across these conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>

<p>Given that AURKA activity and stability fluctuates through the cell cycle according to presence of activating binding partners (highest in G2 and M phases) and activity of APC/C<sup>FZR1</sup>, which is higher in G1 phase than G2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we sought to exclude DUBs whose knockdown might affect PROTAC-D activity in our screen indirectly due to changes in cell cycle progression. We employed U2OS<sup>CDK2</sup> cells, a stable cell line expressing a cerulean-tagged CDK2 activity sensor, which allows visualisation of cell cycle phase based on localization of DHB-Cer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Correlation analysis between the median cytoplasmic:nuclear DHB-Cer ratio (which increases with cell cycle progression) and changes in PROTAC-D sensitivity of HiBiT-AURKA revealed a significant positive correlation (p=0.0175) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This supported our hypothesis that DUB knockdowns affecting cell cycle progression would confound measurements of PROTAC-D sensitivity. For example, USP40 and USP36 knockdowns led to both increased cytoplasmic:nuclear DHB-Cer ratios, indicative of shortened G1 phase, (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and increased PROTAC-D activity against AURKA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This correlation was consistent with the idea that higher levels of a target protein show greater sensitivity to PROTACs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> but could also reflect increasing AURKA activity at later stages of the cell cycle, with associated increase in accessibility of the ATP-binding pocket to PROTAC binding. We tested the effect of cell cycle progression on PROTAC-D activity by synchronising cell populations before PROTAC treatment and found a small but not significant increase in PROTAC-D-mediated degradation of AURKA in G2- or M-phase-synchronised cells, while serum-starved cells (G0/G1-enriched) showed a significant reduction in degradation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). Given this result, together with the marked effect of its knockdown on cytoplasmic:nuclear DHB-Cer ratio (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), we excluded USP36 from subsequent studies. Since USP40 knockdown had a less dramatic effect on cell cycle progression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), and is a little-known DUB, we included it in further analysis.</p>
<p>We note that a recent survey of DUB activities has identified USP36 as a ’high impact’ DUB in targeting almost 20% of the tested pool of ubiquitinated proteins, it may therefore prove an interesting candidate for future investigation of PROTAC-opposing DUBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We assessed the impact of our remaining DUB hits on endogenous AURKA levels in pre- anaphase mitotic cells, where AURKA is most biologically active, before and after PROTAC-D treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining revealed that knockdown of OTUD6A, USP20 or USP40 led to a reduction in AURKA levels even in the absence of PROTAC treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). OTUD6A has previously been identified as a DUB that deubiquitinates AURKA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and USP20 was reported as a hit from a previous screen for DUBs regulating AURKA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, USP40 has not previously been shown to regulate AURKA. PROTAC-D treatment led to a reduction in AURKA signal in the majority of experiments, compared to the DMSO control; however, knockdown of OTUD6A and UCHL5 significantly enhanced loss of endogenous AURKA. Under GL2i conditions, PROTAC-D treatment reduced the average AURKA intensity to 50% of that in DMSO-treated cells. This reduction increased to approximately 60% under UCHL5i and OTUD6Ai conditions. Knockdown of BAP1 and USP15 had no effect on endogenous AURKA levels whereas USP20 and USP40 siRNA appeared to reduce activity of PROTAC-D against endogenous AURKA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Overall, UCHL5 and OTUD6A emerged as the strongest candidate PROTAC-D-opposing activities, making them promising DUBs for further investigation.</p>

<title>UCHL5 opposes PROTAC-mediated degradation of AURKA and other CRBN-targeting substrates</title>
<p>To further characterise the role of UCHL5 in counteracting PROTAC activity, we evaluated the effect of UCHL5 knockdown on degradation of AURKA by other commercially available AURKA PROTACs. Specifically, we tested JB170, an AURKA-specific PROTAC comprised of alisertib linked to thalidomide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and TL12-186, a CRBN-dependent multi-kinase degrader<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. TL12-186 showed the most potent degradation of AURKA at 100 nM, while JB170 caused the least degradation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We tested the knockdown of UCHL5 using two individual oligos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and proceeded with oligo #2 which demonstrated superior knockdown efficiency. UCHL5 siRNA treatment led to enhanced degradation of HiBiT-AURKA in the presence of each of the three PROTACs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). To rule out potential off-target siRNA effects, we engineered UCHL5-Neon constructs with siRNA-resistant sequences and transfected them alongside UCHL5 siRNA into U2OS HiBiT-AURKA<sup>TO</sup> cells. The enhancement of PROTAC-D and TL12-16 activity upon UCHL5 knockdown was fully rescued by expression of siRNA-resistant UCHL5, confirming the specificity of UCHL5 siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The best characterised function of UCHL5 is its association with the proteasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and our results are consistent with the hypothesis that UCHL5 removes ubiquitin chains from substrates recruited to the proteasome, hence limiting their degradation (and in our experiments, the activity of AURKA PROTACs). Overexpression of UCHL5 did not affect PROTAC-D activity in our experiments (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>), consistent with the idea that the PROTAC-relevant pool of UCHL5 is stoichiometrically associated with the proteasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated whether the PROTAC-opposing effect of UCHL5 was selective for AURKA, or for CRBN-recruiting PROTACs, or for neither. To test this, we utilised the dTAG system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, whereby orthogonal dTAG PROTACs target FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-tagged constructs for degradation via either CRBN (dTAG-13) or VHL (dTAGv-1). HiBiT-FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> constructs were generated and validated, showing dose-dependent degradation that was dependent on the FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> tag. The hook effect was seen at higher concentrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Knockdown of UCHL5 enhanced the degradation of HiBiT-FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> by dTAG-13, indicating that UCHL5’s PROTAC- opposing effect extends beyond AURKA-targeting PROTACs to other CRBN-recruiting systems (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). However, knockdown of UCHL5 had no impact on the degradation of HiBiT- FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> by dTAGv-1, a VHL-recruiting PROTAC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). The differential effect of UCHL5 on CRBN- versus VHL-mediated dTAG-induced degradation may be attributed to variations in extent and topology of ubiquitin chains conferred by the distinct E3s that would affect the rate of processing of substrate at the proteasome. We hypothesised that VHL might confer more extensive (higher MW) ubiquitin chains but did not find any evidence for this in a ubiquitin pulldown experiment (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4B, C</xref>).</p>

<p>Overexpression of OTUD6A caused a significant decrease in PROTAC activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), an effect abolished by mutation of the catalytic site (OTUD6A<sup>C152A</sup>). We concluded that OTUD6A acts to stabilise AURKA against PROTAC-mediated degradation through its deubiquitination activity.</p>
<p>We next assessed, using dTAG PROTACs, whether OTUD6A’s PROTAC-opposing effect was specific to AURKA-targeting PROTACs or to CRBN-harnessing tools, or to neither. In contrast to UCHL5, OTUD6A knockdown had no significant effect on HiBiT-FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> degradation mediated by either CRBN-recruiting dTAG-13 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) or VHL-recruiting dTAGv-1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). We concluded that OTUD6A’s impact on PROTAC activity is specific to AURKA-targeting PROTACs.</p>
<p>In summary, while UCHL5 appears to exhibit generalised PROTAC-opposing activity against targets of CRBN-harnessing PROTACs, OTUD6A’s effect appears to selectively regulate AURKA degradation by PROTACs. We tested the effect of the two DUBs in ubiquitin pulldowns and found a striking enhancement of PROTAC-induced ubiquitin conjugates associated with AURKA-Neon-HA in OTUD6A siRNA conditions, suggesting OTUD6A removes ubiquitin from</p>

<p>To test our hypothesis, we measured the degradation of WT-AURKA-Neon and NLS-AURKA- Neon by PROTAC-D in U2OS FZR1<sup>KO</sup> cells under conditions of OTUD6A knockdown or overexpression. We found that OTUD6A knockdown significantly enhanced degradation of WT-AURKA-Neon, whereas degradation of NLS-AURKA-Neon was not affected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Moreover, under OTUD6A siRNA conditions the enhanced degradation of NLS-AURKA-Neon compared to WT-AURKA-Neon was abolished.</p>
<p>Under conditions of OTUD6A overexpression there was significantly reduced degradation of WT-AURKA-Neon by PROTAC-D but, again, there was no effect on degradation of NLS-AURKA- Neon (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>From these results we conclude that OTUD6A protects the cytoplasmic pool of AURKA from PROTAC-mediated degradation and that nuclear-localised AURKA is insensitive to OTUD6A levels. Indeed, our experiments show that the presence of OTUD6A is sufficient to explain enhanced degradation of the nuclear pool of wild-type AURKA. Our results therefore demonstrate that the subcellular compartmentalisation of ubiquitin pathway components, such as OTUD6A, can drive differential degradation of PROTAC targets depending on their subcellular localisation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nuclear localisation of AURKA has been implicated in its oncogenic activity in various cancers, where it has been associated with transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. These functions of AURKA are distinct from the well-characterised roles of AURKA kinase activity in mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> and may be kinase-independent. Motivated by the possibility of using PROTACs for therapeutic manipulation of kinase-independent AURKA functions, and our previous observation of enhanced PROTAC sensitivity of a nuclear-localised mutant of AURKA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, we sought to investigate the sensitivity of nuclear AURKA to PROTAC activity. We found that forced nuclear localisation of AURKA (NLS-AURKA) enhanced its sensitivity to degradation by PROTACs, both by those binding to AURKA directly, and orthogonally using the dTAG system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Since enhanced degradation of NLS-AURKA was not accompanied by any detectable increase in ternary complex formation between CRBN and NLS-AURKA (compared to WT-AURKA), we concluded that the increased degradation was most likely mediated through a post-ubiquitination step, such as the trimming or removal of ubiquitin chains by DUBs.</p>
<p>We therefore systematically investigated the effects of DUB knockdown on PROTAC-mediated degradation of AURKA. Previous studies have identified USP2 and OTUD6A as interactors and regulators of AURKA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and both hits appeared in our DUBs-wide siRNA screen. Our subsequent validations confirmed OTUD6A as a key determinant of both cellular levels, and PROTAC sensitivity, of AURKA. Our screen also identified the proteasomal DUB UCHL5 as a generalised limiting factor in PROTAC-mediated degradation. UCHL5 emerged as a broad regulator of PROTAC activity. Knockdown of UCHL5 enhanced the activity of all CRBN- recruiting PROTACs tested in our experiments (CRBN-recruiting AURKA-targeting PROTACs and dTAG-13) but had no effect on activity of VHL-recruiting dTAGv-1. UCHL5’s regulatory role may therefore depend on the type of ubiquitin chain topology induced by different E3s. These findings are consistent with the known proteasome-associated deubiquitinating activity of UCHL5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> acting to limit substrate processing for proteasomal degradation. While some previous studies have shown that UCHL5 knockdown can lead to enhanced degradation of substrates at the proteasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, more recent studies have found instead that UCHL5 acts to promote substrate processing and degradation through removal of branched ubiquitin chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Our identification of UCHL5 as an E3-dependent PROTAC-opposing DUB aligns with the idea that its role in substrate processing is chain topology-dependent and acts to limit degradation of substrates ubiquitinated in response to PROTAC.</p>
<p>In contrast to UCHL5, OTUD6A exerted target-specific effects on degradation of AURKA by PROTACs. Knockdown of OTUD6A enhanced degradation of AURKA by PROTAC-D and TL12-186 but had no significant effect on degradation of HiBiT-FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> by dTAGs. Our data also reveals that OTUD6A regulates the sensitivity of AURKA to degradation by PROTACs in a manner dependent on AURKA subcellular localisation. OTUD6A localises exclusively to the cytoplasm, where it acts to limit the activity of PROTACs in bringing about degradation of AURKA. Nuclear-localised AURKA, in contrast to the cytoplasmic pool, is not protected from degradation and the nuclear pool is therefore more efficiently degraded in response to PROTAC treatments.</p>
<p>This differential regulation of the neosubstrate AURKA by OTUD6A underscores the importance of subcellular compartmentalisation in determining PROTAC efficacy. In the case of AURKA, our findings serve to rationalise therapeutic targeting of the nuclear oncogenic pool of AURKA via TPD.</p>
<p>More generally, our findings have broad implications for the development of PROTACs as therapeutic agents. Firstly, in incorporating a knowledge of subcellular localisation and DUB- specific interactions in the initial selection of targets suitable for a PROTAC approach. Secondly, in highlighting the potential to exploit DUB-specific interactions to finetune PROTAC activity at the subcellular level. Finally, in identifying DUB regulators of PROTAC efficacy, offering new opportunities for improving PROTAC performance through combination strategies, for instance transient inhibition of DUBs to enhance degradation of otherwise resistant targets. Through our investigation of the enhanced sensitivity of nuclear AURKA to PROTAC activity, we therefore provide new insight into how the activity of PROTACs can be limited in the cellular environment. Such studies will be critical for understanding the determinants of target specificity and for rationally designing PROTACs with improved therapeutic profiles.</p>

<title>Plasmids and molecular Cloning</title>
<p>pEGFP-OTUD6A, pEGFP-UCHL5 and pEGFP-UCHL5<sup>C88A</sup> were the kind gifts of Prof Sylvie Urbé and Prof Stephen Jackson. The following sequences were obtained by gene synthesis (Genewiz from Azenta Life Sciences): siRNA-resistant OTUD6A, siRNA-resistant UCHL5, FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>. siRNA-resistant OTUD6A and siRNA-resistant UCHL5 were inserted into the MCS of the pNeonN1 backbone. pNeonN1-AURKA-FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> and pNeonN1- FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> were created by inserting the FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> fragment into the pNeonN1-AURKA and pNeonN1 backbones respectively. Plasmids containing NLS were created by inserting the SV40 NLS fragment (PKKKRKV) into the appropriate backbone using restriction enzymes. The mNeon in all constructs is HA tagged at the C-terminus. pEGFP-OTUD6A<sup>C152A</sup> was generated by round-the-horn site-directed mutagenesis of the pEGFP-OTUD6A plasmid using forward and reverse primers 5’-GCCATGTACCGCGCCATCCA-3’ and 5’-GTGGCCGTCGGCCGG-3’. NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli (High Efficiency) (C2987I, NEB) were used. Full cloning details available upon request.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors investigate the role of deubiquitinases (DUBs) in modulating the efficacy of PROTAC-mediated degradation of the cell-cycle kinase AURKA. Using a focused siRNA screen of 97 human DUBs, they identify UCHL5 and OTUD6A as negative regulators of AURKA degradation by PROTACs. They further offer a mechanistic explanation of enhanced AURKA degradation in the nucleus via OTUD6A expression being restricted to the cytosol, thereby protecting the cytoplasmic pool of AURKA. These findings provide important insight into how subcellular localization and DUB activity influence the efficiency of targeted protein degradation strategies, which could have implications for therapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript is well-structured, with clearly defined objectives and well-supported conclusions.</p>
<p>(2) The study employs a broad range of well-validated techniques - including live-cell imaging, proximity ligation assays, HiBiT reporter systems, and ubiquitin pulldowns - to dissect the regulation of PROTAC activity.</p>
<p>(3) The authors use informative experimental controls, including assessment of cell-cycle progression effects, rescue experiments with siRNA-resistant constructs to confirm specificity, and the application of both AURKA-targeting PROTACs with different warheads and orthogonal degrader systems (e.g., dTAG-13 and dTAGv-1) to differentiate between target- and ligase-specific effects.</p>
<p>(4) The identification of OTUD6A as a cytosol-restricted DUB that protects cytoplasmic but not nuclear AURKA is novel and may have therapeutic relevance for selectively targeting oncogenic nuclear AURKA pools.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Although UCHL5 and OTUD6A are shown to limit AURKA degradation, direct physical interaction was not assessed.</p>
<p>(2) Although the authors identify a correlation between DUB knockdown-induced cell cycle progression and enhanced PROTAC activity, only one DUB (USP36) is excluded on this basis. In addition, one DUB is shown in the correlation plot (Figure 3B) whose knockdown enhances PROTAC sensitivity without significantly altering cell cycle progression, but it is not identified/discussed.</p>
<p>(3) While the authors suggest that combining PROTACs with DUB inhibition could enhance degradation, this was not experimentally tested.</p>
<p>(4) The study identifies UCHL5 as a general antagonist of CRBN-recruiting PROTACs, yet the ubiquitin pulldown experiments (Figure 5G, H) show no change in AURKA ubiquitination upon UCHL5 knockdown. This raises questions about the precise step or mechanism by which UCHL5 exerts its protective effect.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors present a screening approach to identify deubiquitylases that may impact PROTAC efficacy/potency, specifically in this case using a previously reported AURKA PROTAC as an initial model. The authors claim that UCHL5 is able to control the level of degradation of both AURKA and dTAG when using CRBN-mediated PROTACs; however, VHL is not impacted by UCHL5 activity. They additionally claim that OTUD6A is able to control the extent of AURKA degradation in a target protein-specific manner and that this effect is specific to cytoplasm-located AURKA.</p>
<p>Overall, whilst the endeavour is of interest and importance, we found that the claims made were overly generalised, the effects observed when knocking down the respective DUBs were very small, the systems used are highly artificial, and the data is not presented in a way that makes understanding absolute changes transparent.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The topic is of high interest and relevance and explores an underappreciated and understudied area of the PROTAC mechanism of action. If findings could be better supported, they would certainly bring value to the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The overall effects observed are sometimes limited in real terms. Even if statistically significant, the data presented does not fully support that changes in degradation due to UCHL5 activity represent changes of functional relevance. The data provided often omits the absolute changes in protein abundance observed. Data on endogenous/less engineered systems and/or with higher resolution read-outs would greatly strengthen some conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cardno et al. &quot;test the hypothesis that DUBs could oppose PROTAC-mediated degradation of cellular targets, using AURKA as a model target&quot;. A screen with a panel of siRNA that depleted 97 DUBs in the presence and absence of AURKA targeted PROTAC-D identified DUBs that regulated AURKA and those that affected the sensitivity of PROTAC-D. Validation studies with DUBs, UCHL5, and OTU6A yielded mixed results. UCHL5 not only affected PROTAC-mediated AURKA degradation but also affected CRBN-associated substrates, OTUD6A, more specifically, affected PROTAC-mediated AURKA degradation, and the effects of OTUD6A were associated with the localisation of AURKA. The findings are interesting; the impact of the findings would be strengthened if the key results are validated in one or more cancer cell lines that have not been modified.</p>

<p>We therefore plan to make only a minor change to the manuscript to clarify a point raised by Reviewer 1: the DUB shown in the correlation plot in Fig 3B - whose knockdown enhances PROTAC sensitivity without significantly altering cell cycle progression - is BAP1. Since BAP1 subsequently showed no significant effect on endogenous AURKA levels (Fig 3E) it was excluded from further analysis.</p>
<p>In considering how the mechanistic aspects of our study could be strengthened, we point out that an interaction of AURKA with OTUD6A has been demonstrated elsewhere (Kim et al. 2021). We also argue that an interaction of AURKA with UCHL5 would not be expected since UCHL5 is a proteasomal DUB shown to act on substrates recruited to the proteasome via capture of ubiquitin chains by the ubiquitin receptors of the proteasome lid. We agree that mechanistically we have not provided complete evidence for a direct deubiquitinating activity of UCHL5 on AURKA. We cannot explain why there is no change in AURKA ubiquitination upon UCHL5 knockdown in our ubiquitin pulldown experiment, but indeed there is considerable uncertainty in the scientific literature on the precise role of UCHL5 at the proteasome.</p>
<p>In response to feedback on the size of effects we report, and whether they represent changes of functional relevance: We agree the differences are small. Nonetheless such changes <italic>may</italic> be functionally important and therefore relevant to design of future TPD strategies. Our previous characterization of PROTAC-D (Wang et al. 2021) provides evidence that differential degradation of subcellular pools can have functional relevance. We showed in our study that the lack of degradation of the centrosomal pool (even if this represents only a small fraction of the total pool) led to unexpected phenotypic consequences that were distinct from those observed upon treatment with ATP-competitive inhibitor or siRNA. Therefore we believe our specific finding of spatially restricted action of AURKA-selective OTUD6A to be of clear functional relevance to AURKA TPD strategies and of conceptual importance in establishing the paradigm of TPD modulation by DUBs.</p>
<p>As Reviewer 1 notes, we do not directly test our hypothesis that combining PROTACs with DUB inhibition could enhance degradation. We would have done so had there been suitable small molecule inhibitors available for OTUD6A or UCHL5 at the time of our study. We plan a broader study of OTUD6A mechanisms and its role in PROTAC sensitivity in cancer cell lines, and appreciate Reviewer 3’s suggestion that the impact of our findings would be strengthened if key results were validated in one or more cancer cell lines. The scope of this new study means we plan to report it in a separate, future publication.</p>
