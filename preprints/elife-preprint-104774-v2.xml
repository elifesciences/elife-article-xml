<title>Abstract</title><p>Aging increases the risk of a myriad of chronic diseases, which are expensive and difficult to treat owing to their various risk factors. Repurposing existing medications has accelerated the development of therapies aimed at slowing aging. In this study, we revealed that enalapril, a drug widely prescribed for hypertension, can improve both cellular senescence and individual health. Mechanistically, phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 act as pivotal mediators of the anti-senescence properties of enalapril. It stimulates downstream genes involved in cell cycle regulation and antioxidative defense, facilitating cell proliferation and diminishing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus increasing the antioxidative ability of enalapril. At the organismal level, enalapril has been shown to bolster the physiological performance of various organs; it notably enhances memory capacity and renal function and relieves lipid accumulation. Our work highlights the potential of enalapril to augment antioxidant defenses and combat the effects of aging, thereby indicating its promise as a treatment strategy for aging-associated diseases and its use for healthy aging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aging is a multifaceted process influenced by numerous factors, and its intricate mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Geroscience is a burgeoning field of study in which researchers hypothesize that aging is a significant risk factor for many chronic diseases. These findings suggest that interventions targeting the mechanisms of aging might delay the onset or slow the progression of these diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kirkland, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lopez-Otin, Blasco, Partridge, Serrano, &amp; Kroemer, 2023</xref>). Cellular senescence, a pivotal indicator of aging, is characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest triggered by cellular damage or stress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Khosla, Farr, Tchkonia, &amp; Kirkland, 2020</xref>). During cellular senescence, cells exhibit increased activity of the lysosomal enzyme senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), decreased proliferation marker Ki67 signals and increased senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) secretion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Coppe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dimri et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Senescence is the result of a complex interplay of endogenous and exogenous signaling pathways(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cohen et al., 2022</xref>). Currently, the activation of tumor suppressor pathways, such as p16<sup>INK4a</sup>/RB, is deemed essential for senescence-related cessation of proliferation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baker et al., 2011</xref>). The disruption of signaling pathways disrupts tissue homeostasis, leading to proinflammatory responses that are increasingly recognized as fundamental aspects of senescence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Coppe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shah et al., 2013</xref>). Researchers have suggested that the expression of p16 is suppressed by inhibitor of DNA-binding (ID) proteins. The expression of the <italic>ID1</italic> gene is downregulated by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), while it is upregulated by BMP-mediated phosphorylated SMAD signaling in various cell types(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liang, Brunicardi, &amp; Lin, 2009</xref>). SMADs are crucial transcriptional effector factors responsible for transmitting TGF-β/BMP signals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Urist, 1965</xref>). They convey signals from the TGF-β superfamily and homomeric serine/threonine kinases on the cell surface to the nucleus, directly regulating transcriptional programs critical for key events(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Miyazono, Maeda, &amp; Imamura, 2005</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway can modulate genes involved in the cell cycle, which affects the balance between cell proliferation and senescence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Genander et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>). Phosphorylated SMAD plays a crucial role in the induction and maintenance of pluripotency, helping maintain tissue homeostasis during aging(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Orlowski, 2017</xref>). However, dysregulation of BMP signaling during aging can lead to fibrosis, impaired wound healing, or excessive tissue calcification, which are detrimental to tissue function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lyu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rahman, Akhtar, Jamil, Banik, &amp; Asaduzzaman, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Owing to increasing insights into cellular and individual aging, novel aging mechanisms and signaling pathways have been identified, leading to the development of new therapeutic interventions. Senescent cells have recently been targeted in therapy given their substantial impact on aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Childs et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, eliminating senescent cells through pharmacological interventions, known as “senolytics”, may delay the onset or slow the progression of age-related diseases and enhance physiological function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Childs et al., 2017</xref>). Research has proven that specific senolytic drugs, such as dasatinib and quercetin, can eliminate senescent cells, reverse aging phenotypes and increase the survival rate of mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). However, the current senolytics are not universally effective across different cell types and display inconsistent sensitivities, thereby limiting their broad application(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yousefzadeh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to senolytics, researchers have explored pharmacological interventions that aim to ameliorate or reverse aging phenotypes without the need to eliminate senescent cells. This included both the repurposing of existing medications and the development of new ones(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bharath et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>). However, repurposing is particularly attractive due to its cost-effectiveness; these drugs have already undergone rigorous safety evaluations, allowing for quicker implementation in new contexts. For example, drugs such as metformin, which is typically used to treat type 2 diabetes, and rapamycin, an immunosuppressant, have shown promise in reducing aging phenotypes and extending the lifespan(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bharath et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>). This strategy is an innovative pharmacological intervention in which existing compounds target the aging process.</p>
<p>In this study, we employed a drug repurposing strategy to evaluate the anti-senescence potential of several FDA-approved drugs and identified enalapril as a promising candidate. Our investigation revealed that enalapril increases pSmad1/5/9 levels, which in turn upregulates key downstream genes involved in cell cycle regulation and antioxidative defense, thereby improving cell proliferation, reducing inflammation, and decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Our findings confirmed the anti-senescence mechanism of enalapril at both the cellular and organismal levels. Enalapril has the ability to ameliorate aging-related phenotypes of various organs, with notable effects on the brain, kidney, and liver. Furthermore, treating aged mice with enalapril improved spatial memory and anxiety behavior, alleviated lipid accumulation, and mitigated kidney aging-related phenotypes. Taken together, the potential of enalapril to extend the healthspan and ameliorate age-related diseases makes it a compelling candidate for research and development in the field of anti-aging therapeutics.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>IMR90 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, C11995500) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellmax, SA111) and 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco, 11140050) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. When the cell density in the in vitro culture reached 80–90% (usually within 2 or 3 days), cell passage was performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Drug preparation and addition</title>
<p>Enalapril (MCE, HY-B0331) was dissolved in DMSO to prepare a 10 mM stock solution. When used, it was diluted to 10 μM in the culture medium. After the cells adhered to the surface, enalapril was added for treatment, and RNA and protein were collected for analysis. Recombinant BMP4 protein (MCE, HY-P7007) was dissolved in sterile ddH<sub>2</sub>O to prepare a 100 μg/mL stock solution. When used, it was diluted to 50 ng/mL in the culture medium and added to the cells. The BMP receptor inhibitor (LDN193189, MCE, HY-12071) was dissolved in sterile ddH<sub>2</sub>O to prepare a 1 mM stock solution. When used, it was diluted to 1 μM or 0.5 μM in the culture medium. The ID inhibitor (Pimozide, MCE, HY-12987) was dissolved in DMSO to prepare a 10 mM stock solution. When used, it was diluted to 5 μM in the culture medium. After the cells adhered to the surface, drugs were added for a 3-day treatment, and samples were collected for analysis.</p>

<title>Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) Staining</title>
<p>SA-β-gal staining was performed using a Senescence β-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Sigma‒Aldrich, CAS0030). Briefly, 0.6 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded in a 6-well plate. The cells were fixed with fixation buffer and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. After the cells were washed three times with PBS, the prepared staining mixture was added to the 6-well plate, and the plate was incubated at 37°C overnight. The stained cells were observed and photographed under a microscope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Western blot</title>
<p>Proteins were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596018CN) and dissolved in 1% SDS, after which SDS‒PAGE was performed. The samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with 5% skimmed milk at room temperature for 30 minutes. The primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C, followed by three washes with PBST. The membranes were then incubated with secondary antibody at room temperature for two hours. The band signals were visualized using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Odyssey, LI-COR). All antibody information is provided in <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>.</p>

<title>RT-qPCR</title>
<p>Total RNA from cultured cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596018CN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DEPC-treated water-dissolved RNA was subsequently reverse transcribed into cDNA using the HiScript III All-in-one RT SuperMix Perfect for qPCR (Vazyme, R333) following the product manual. The cDNA levels of specific primers were analyzed using the LightCycler<sup>®</sup> 96 qPCR system (Roche), and the results were normalized to those of β-actin. The primers used in this analysis are listed in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>RNA-seq and data processing</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596018CN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted total RNA was then sent to Novogene for subsequent cDNA library construction. The library was sequenced with paired-end reads on the Illumina HiSeq PE150 platform.</p>
<p>For data processing, FastQC (version 0.11.5) software was first used for data quality control. Raw paired-end sequencing reads were trimmed by Trim Galore (version 0.6.10) software to remove adapter sequences and low-quality reads. The high-quality RNA-seq reads were mapped to the hg38/mm10 genome using HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) software(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kim, Paggi, Park, Bennett, &amp; Salzberg, 2019</xref>). SAMtools (version 1.17) software was then used to convert the generated SAM files to bam files(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2009</xref>). To qualify gene expression, the number of reads mapped to each gene was counted using featureCounts (version 2.0.1) software(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liao, Smyth, &amp; Shi, 2014</xref>). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were calculated by R package DESeq2 (version 1.34.0)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Love, Huber, &amp; Anders, 2014</xref>) with the cutoff values of Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 and |log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)| &gt; 0.5. The gene expression count matrix was converted into the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) matrix, followed by Z score normalization for visualization.</p>

<title>CUT&amp;Tag and data processing</title>
<p>For the CUT&amp;Tag experiments, 8 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were processed using the CUT&amp;Tag Kit (Vazyme, TD903). The cells were collected and incubated with ConA beads and then mixed with the primary antibody pSmad1/5/9 (CST, #13820) overnight at 4°C. After incubation with the secondary antibody for one hour, the cells were further incubated with pA/G-Tnp for one hour. The transposase was then activated for DNA fragmentation. Following DNA extraction, library amplification and purification were performed. The libraries were sequenced using paired-end reads on the Illumina HiSeq PE150 platform.</p>
<p>For data processing, raw CUT&amp;Tag data was trimmed using Trim Galore (version 0.6.10) software, and the clean reads were mapped to the human reference genome hg38 using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.1) software(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Langmead &amp; Salzberg, 2012</xref>) with the following parameters: “--very-sensitive --no-mixed --no-discordant -I 10 -X 1000”. The SAM files were transformed into bam files via SAMtools (version 1.17) software(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2009</xref>). The CUT&amp;Tag peaks were performed using the MACS2 (version 2.2.8) with the default parameters(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Differential peaks were calculated using the R package DiffBind (version 3.4.11) with the cutoff values of adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 and |log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)| &gt; 0.5 and annotated using the R package ChIPpeakAnno (version 3.28.0)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lihua, Claude, &amp; Nathan, 2010</xref>). To visualize the CUT&amp;Tag signal, the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) were calculated in each 50-bp bin size using DeepTools (version 3.5.2) software(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ramirez, Dundar, Diehl, Gruning, &amp; Manke, 2014</xref>), and the RPKM matrix was normalized using the Z score algorithm.</p>

<title>ChIP-qPCR</title>
<p>At room temperature, approximately 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> IMR90 cells were cross-linked with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding 0.125 M glycine for 6 minutes. The cells were then harvested and lysed on ice in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using a Bioruptor (Diagenode) to shear the chromatin.

<title>Enalapril restrains cellular replicative senescence</title>
<p>To identify drugs that are capable of delaying cellular senescence, we established an in vitro replicative senescence model using primary human embryonic lung fibroblasts (IMR90). Compared with young cells, long-term-cultured IMR90 cells presented a characteristic senescence phenotype, characterized by increased SA-β-gal staining, increased expression of the cell cycle arrest factors p16 and p21, and reduced expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A–C</xref>). Additionally, the release of SASP factors that significantly alter the cellular microenvironment, including the well-described factors <italic>IL-1β</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic>, and <italic>CXCL10,</italic> has also been reported to increase the degree of senescence (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Employing a drug repurposing strategy, we discovered that enalapril, an antihypertensive medication, delayed senescence. Notably, enalapril treatment at various concentrations reduced SA-β-gal staining and increased Ki67 positivity in IMR90 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A–B, D–E</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed a decrease in the senescence markers p16 and p21 with the optimal effect of 10 μM enalapril (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). To further analyze the effects of enalapril on transcriptome dynamics upon senescence entry, RNA-seq was performed across enalapril-treated cells at different concentrations. In general, we found that the expression of SASP genes decreased significantly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). The expression of cell cycle arrest factors typically increased during senescence; however, the expression of these factors decreased after exposure to enalapril, whereas the expression of cell cycle genes related to cell proliferation increased upon treatment with enalapril at the optimal concentration of 10 μM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). We therefore treated the cells with 10 μM enalapril via RT-qPCR and detected that many prominent SASP genes, such as <italic>IL-1β and IL-6</italic>, were significantly reduced compared with those in the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Moreover, enalapril treatment increased the cell growth rate and delayed the transition to the growth arrest phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Our comprehensive analysis underscores enalapril’s potential as an anti-senescence agent, warranting further exploration for its role in combating cellular senescence.</p>

<title>The function of enalapril depends on phosphorylated Smad1/5/9</title>
    <p>Given the potential of enalapril to decelerate senescence, we screened several important targets of the senescence-related pathway to identify the underlying mechanism of senescence entry. We found that enalapril notably elevated the phosphorylation level of Smad1/5/9 without affecting Smad2/3 phosphorylation, effectively reversing the decline of pSmad1/5/9 levels in senescent cells, suggesting a possible role for the BMP-pSmad1/5/9 pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref><bold>, </bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A, B</xref>). To validate the pathway alterations in the gene expression profile, GSEA confirmed that enalapril treatment increased BMP signaling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Concurrently, the level of the Smad4 protein, which is required for pSmad1/5/9 to enter the nucleus, also increased, suggesting that enalapril might facilitate the nuclear entry of pSmad1/5/9 and modulate downstream genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Guglielmi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Senft, Bikoff, Robertson, &amp; Costello, 2019</xref>). Notably, the expression of Smad4 was reduced in senescent cells, supporting the notion that enalapril reverses senescence-associated defects in BMP signaling (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). To further assess the impact on gene regulation, we employed CUT&amp;Tag analysis of pSmad1/5/9 and found that enalapril treatment increased the pSmad1/5/9 binding signals at the transcription start site (TSS) regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>To explore the potential role of pSmad1/5/9 in anti-senescence mechanisms, we experimentally manipulated its levels by supplementing with BMP4 to increase pSmad1/5/9 levels, or by reducing it using the BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 (LDN) and shRNA-mediated knockdown of the BMP receptor BMPR1A. Our findings revealed that BMP4 increased pSmad5 levels, which correlated with decreased p16 and p21, reduced β-gal staining and increased Ki67 positivity, indicating a mitigated senescent phenotype (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A–C</xref>). In contrast, when cells were treated with the BMP receptor inhibitor LDN or subjected to <italic>BMPR1A</italic> knockdown, the changes in pSmad1/5/9 levels and senescence markers were completely reversed, highlighting that the suppression of pSmad1/5/9 accelerates the progression of senescence (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A–G</xref>).</p>
<p>Encouraged by the observed association between pSmad1/5/9 and senescence, we tested whether pSmad1/5/9 mediates the anti-senescence effects of enalapril by co-treating with enalapril and either LDN or shRNA targeting <italic>BMPR1A</italic>. RNA-seq analysis revealed that LDN upregulated SASP genes and downregulated cell cycle genes. On the basis of these findings, the subsequent addition of enalapril did not reverse these changes, which suggests that the anti-senescence function of enalapril relies on pSmad1/5/9 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Furthermore, western blot results also revealed that in the presence of LDN, neither enalapril nor BMP4 restored Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation or the expression of p16 and p21 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Similarly, β-gal and Ki67 staining also revealed that enalapril failed to counteract the senescence-promoting effects induced by either LDN treatment or BMPR1A knockdown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, G</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4F, G</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that elevated pSmad1/5/9 could increase the expression of critical genes, thereby exerting a potent anti-senescence effect.</p>

<title>pSmad1/5/9 modulates the cell cycle and SASP secretion by upregulating <italic>ID1</italic></title>
<p>The ID family, which is recognized as a key downstream target of pSmad1/5/9, serves as a biomarker for Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation levels(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Genander et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ramachandran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ying, Nichols, Chambers, &amp; Smith, 2003</xref>).

<p>Prior studies have indicated that the ID family can suppress p16 and p21 expression, thus inhibiting cell cycle arrest and delaying cellular senescence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lyden et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ying et al., 2003</xref>). This prompted us to examine ID protein expression during senescence, where we observed a decrease in ID1 and ID2 levels (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). The knockdown of <italic>ID1</italic> and <italic>ID2</italic> via shRNA or an ID1 inhibitor resulted in a decreasing trend of ID1 or ID2 expression and a significant increase in p16 and p21 expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F, I</xref>). In addition, while β-gal increased the proportion of positively stained cells, the Ki67 proliferation signal decreased nearly fourfold after the knockdown of <italic>ID1</italic> or <italic>ID2</italic>, resembling the changes observed during senescence (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B, C</xref>). Given that enalapril reduced SASP factors while LDN increased them, we investigated whether ID1, which acts as a transcriptional repressor downstream of pSmad1/5/9, could modulate SASP expression. Indeed, the expression of traditional SASP factors, such as <italic>IL1β</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic>, which decrease with enalapril treatment, significantly increased after <italic>ID</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). By overlapping the genes downregulated by enalapril with those upregulated upon <italic>ID</italic> knockdown, several SASP genes, as well as <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>CDKN2B,</italic> were identified (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we found that SASP factor expression also increased in <italic>ID</italic> knockout mouse bone marrow cells in previously reported data (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5E</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Fei et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, <italic>ID</italic> knockdown did not affect pSmad1/5/9 levels, confirming that ID is a downstream effector of pSmad1/5/9, influencing the expression of genes such as p16, p21, and SASP-related genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>).</p>
<p>After validating the prosenescence effects of <italic>ID</italic> through shRNA targeting <italic>ID</italic> or the use of small molecule inhibitors, we next examined whether the anti-senescence effects of enalapril are mediated by ID proteins. The continued addition of enalapril to these <italic>ID</italic>-knockdown cells did not significantly alter β-gal or Ki67 signals compared with those in the <italic>ID</italic>-knockdown group without enalapril, implying that the benefits of enalapril may be ID dependent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K–L</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that enalapril elevates pSmad1/5/9 levels, which in turn upregulate <italic>ID1</italic> expression. This dual action has two key implications: first, it confirms that enalapril can modulate the expression of pSmad1/5/9 downstream genes. Second, by upregulating <italic>ID1</italic>, enalapril can suppress the expression of p16, p21, and SASP-related genes, thereby potentially restoring cell proliferation and reducing the expression of inflammatory factors. These findings suggest that the anti-senescence mechanism of enalapril involves the pSmad1/5/9-ID1 axis, highlighting a novel pathway for its therapeutic effects on aging.</p>

<title>Enalapril has antioxidative effects through pSmad1/5/9</title>
<p>Since an increase in pSmad1/5/9 after enalapril treatment was observed and pSmad1/5/9 is a transcription factor, to understand the in-depth mechanism of enalapril regulation, we further explored the downstream genes of pSmad1/5/9. Analysis of CUT&amp;Tag-upregulated peaks after enalapril treatment revealed that enalapril treatment led to enrichment of pSmad1/5/9 in the GO pathway associated with DNA replication, the cell cycle and the oxidative stress response, all of which are crucial for cell growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Moreover, transcriptome analysis revealed that the genes whose expression increased after enalapril treatment were also enriched in pathways related to the response to oxidative stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Notably, genes upregulated by enalapril in response to oxidative stress included antioxidative enzymes, electron transport chain components and lipid oxidation inhibitors, with a significant increase in pSmad1/5/9 at their TSS regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C</xref>). Specifically, we also examined the promoter regions of antioxidative genes, such as the antioxidative enzyme <italic>PRDX5</italic> and the lipid oxidation inhibitor <italic>TXN</italic>, and found increased pSmad1/5/9 enrichment along with upregulated gene expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, F–H</xref>).

<p>It has been reported that changes in the expression of antioxidative genes can affect the ROS level of cells; thus, we then used DCFH-DA probes to detect ROS levels in cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Coppe et al., 2008</xref>). The results revealed that cellular senescence increased ROS, whereas enalapril slowed the increase in ROS, indicating its ability to upregulate antioxidative genes and reduce ROS, thus affecting cellular senescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). Importantly, the continued addition of BMP receptor inhibitors LDN reversed the beneficial effects of enalapril on ROS and decreased pSmad1/5/9 enrichment at the promoters of these antioxidative genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G, I</xref>). Similarly, shRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>BMPR1A</italic> also led to decreased expression of antioxidative genes such as <italic>PRDX5</italic> and <italic>TXN</italic> (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D</xref>). Collectively, these results reinforce the notion that enalapril promotes the upregulation of antioxidative genes through pSmad1/5/9, reduces ROS levels and alleviates oxidative stress, thus playing a crucial role in delaying senescence.</p>

<title>Enalapril upregulates pSmad1/5/9 and improves physiological function in mice</title>
<p>Enalapril, which is known for its anti-senescence potential, was further investigated for its impact at the organ and individual levels in 12-month-old mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). After continuous feeding at a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day for 3 months, we conducted a comprehensive RNA-seq analysis of six key organs—brain, kidney, liver, heart, muscle, and spleen—to assess the impact of enalapril on the transcriptome. We found that enalapril induced organ-specific gene expression changes, thereby affecting the physiological functions of these genes. Moreover, GSEA revealed upregulated pathways related to forebrain and kidney development, long-chain fatty acid metabolism and other processes, indicating that enalapril has a beneficial effect on organ functions (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>). Additionally, enalapril reduced the expression of SASP factors in multiple organs, particularly the CCL, CXCL, and MMP families (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Serum SASP array analysis also revealed a decrease in the secretion of certain SASP proteins, such as CCL6, CCL11, CXCL13, IGFBP-1, and MMP3, suggesting that enalapril has anti-inflammatory effects in mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the known upregulation of pSmad1/5/9 levels and antioxidative genes in cellular models by enalapril, we measured Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation and the expression of the antioxidative genes <italic>Txn1</italic>, <italic>Txn2</italic>, and <italic>Prdx5</italic> in the tested organs. We observed increased pSmad1/5/9 levels, especially in the brain, kidney and liver, along with upregulated <italic>Id1</italic> and antioxidative genes, notably <italic>Txn1</italic> and <italic>Txn2</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>). Further analysis of BMP signaling and antioxidative stress-related pathways in these organs revealed increased gene expression after enalapril treatment, indicating the activation of this pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Building on these findings, intraperitoneal injection of the BMP inhibitor LDN reversed the effects of enalapril. Specifically, SASP factor levels in serum, which were reduced by enalapril, were significantly increased. Additionally, the elevated pSmad1/5/9 and antioxidative genes in the brain, kidney and liver were markedly downregulated upon LDN treatment (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A, B</xref>). These findings align with our cellular findings, implying that enalapril enhance the pSmad1/5/9-antioxidative gene axis to increase organ physiological function and delay individual aging.</p>

<p>Building on our finding of pSmad1/5/9 activation and antioxidative genes upregulation in multiple organs, we further investigated the broader phenotypic effects of enalapril in mice. After three months of enalapril feeding, behavioral experiments, serum tests, and tissue section staining were performed. Notably, enalapril had no significant effect on body weight in the mice, suggesting that the drug has no overt toxic side effects (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).

<p>During the aging process, the brain undergoes varying degrees of functional decline. To assess the impact of enalapril on brain function, we conducted Y-maze and open field tests. The Y-maze, which is frequently employed to assess short-term memory in mice by measuring spontaneous alternation as a marker of spatial working memory, indicates notable improvements. Under normal circumstances, mice prefer to explore new maze branches rather than return to previously visited branches. Several brain regions, including the hippocampus, septum, basal forebrain, and prefrontal cortex, contribute to this task, and the age-related decline in spontaneous alternation ability in mice is associated with degeneration or lesions in brain regions such as the hippocampus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Radulescu, Cerar, Haslehurst, Kopanitsa, &amp; Barnes, 2021</xref>). Enalapril promoted a substantial increase in the rate of spontaneous alternation in the mice, indicating enhanced spatial memory (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, C</xref>). As aging progresses, anxiety-like behaviors often increase with age in mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Radulescu et al., 2021</xref>). The open-field test, a valuable tool for assessing autonomous and exploratory behaviors in new environments, demonstrated that enalapril increased the number of central area crossings, suggesting a reduction in aging-related anxiety (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F, G</xref>). However, LDN treatment reversed the improvements in muscle endurance, spatial memory, and reduced anxiety behaviors conferred by enalapril (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A–F</xref>). In conclusion, these results suggest that enalapril has the potential to mitigate the deterioration of various behavioral aspects associated with aging through the activation of pSmad1/5/9.</p>

<title>Enalapril ameliorates aging-related pathological changes in aged mice</title>
<p>The results of these behavioral tests provided valuable insights. To further explore the effects of enalapril on pathological changes, our investigation was extended to serum analyses. This comprehensive analysis encompassed the evaluation of vital organ function, including the liver, kidneys, and heart, as well as an assessment of lipid content, specifically triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). After enalapril administration, there was no significant change in the serum alanine transaminase (ALT) level, indicating that no liver toxicity from enalapril occurred (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). Moreover, the level of creatinine (CREA), a key marker of kidney function, was significantly decreased in enalapril-treated mice, indicating potential functional recovery and improvement of renal function (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). A heart health indicator, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), was also reduced, indicating a positive cardiac effect of enalapril (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). These findings underscore the multifaceted effects of enalapril on various physiological parameters, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic intervention in aging-related conditions.</p>
<p>The transcriptomic data from the enalapril treatment group revealed an increase in long-chain fatty acid metabolism in the liver, suggesting that enalapril may play a positive role in lipid metabolism (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>). Accordingly, we analyzed serum lipid levels in enalapril-treated mice. Typically, aging leads to a decline in lipid metabolism in the serum, causing an accumulation of triglycerides (TGs) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), contributing to oxidative stress and conditions such as hyperlipidemia and fatty liver(A. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Johnson &amp; Stolzing, 2019</xref>). Following enalapril treatment, the mice presented significant reductions in TG and LDL levels and a noticeable increase in HDL levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K–M</xref>). These results suggest that enalapril has the potential to increase lipid metabolism in aged mice, thereby mitigating the increase in blood lipid levels.</p>
<p>To evaluate the improvements in the aging process induced by enalapril in various organ systems, we conducted pathological examinations of mouse tissues. A decrease in β-gal staining was observed in the brain, liver and spleen of enalapril-treated mice, suggesting an alleviation of aging-associated phenotypes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6N</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9A–C</xref>). Given the effects of enalapril on brain function, we further examined pathological markers in the brain. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, which is indicative of glycogen deposition, revealed a significant reduction in glycogen near the hippocampus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6O</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9D</xref>). Congo red staining, which detects amyloid protein deposition, also revealed reduced staining in the cerebral cortex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6P</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9E</xref>). In the kidney, sirius red staining, which highlights abnormal collagen fibers or fibrosis, revealed significant red staining around blood vessels in control mice. However, this staining was noticeably reduced in the kidneys of the mice treated with enalapril (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6Q</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9F</xref>). These findings suggest that enalapril has a beneficial effect on fibrosis in the kidneys of aged mice, which aligns with the observed improvement in plasma creatinine levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of spleen, kidney and liver sections from enalapril-treated mice revealed a reduction in Oil Red O staining, with the kidneys and liver showing the most significant changes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6R</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9G–I</xref>). This finding aligned with the consistent decrease in lipid-related molecular content in plasma, indicating that enalapril has a role in reducing age-related lipid accumulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K–M</xref>). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of the liver revealed a decrease in cavities and increased tissue density in mice treated with enalapril, suggesting its role in enhancing liver cell proliferation and regeneration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6S</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9J</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, enalapril significantly mitigated multiple pathological markers associated with aging, including lipid droplets, amyloid, glycogen deposition, and fibrosis, in the brain, kidneys, liver, heart and spleen of aged mice. These comprehensive improvements contribute to an overall amelioration of their aging status.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since the early 2000s, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been pioneering the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), an initiative aimed at harnessing existing drugs or small molecules to decelerate the aging process(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nadon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Strong et al., 2016</xref>). This approach repurposes established medications for novel uses, maximizing the potential of known compounds. It has accelerated the transition of anti-aging therapies from discovery to clinical application, ensures their safety and bolsters a comprehensive anti-aging drug screening strategy.</p>
<p>In our study, we discovered that enalapril, a commonly prescribed ACE inhibitor for hypertension, has significant anti-senescence effects at both the cellular and organismal levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Enalapril demonstrated a notable ability to attenuate aging-related physiological decline across multiple organs, including the brain, kidneys, and liver. This finding suggests its potential to reduce the risk of disease across multiple organs, slow the overall aging process and extend both the healthspan and lifespan of mice. This observation aligns with previous reports on the lifespan-extending effects of other ACE inhibitors, such as captopril, which have been shown to increase longevity in organisms such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Egan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kumar, Dietrich, &amp; Kornfeld, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Strong et al., 2022</xref>). However, our screening process revealed that enalapril outperformed captopril and other antihypertensive drugs in ameliorating senescent phenotypes, although captopril and other antihypertensive drugs also exhibited the ability to delay senescence. These findings indicate that enalapril may have unique or more potent mechanisms of action that contribute to its anti-senescence effects, warranting further mechanistic studies to better understand its molecular targets.</p>

    <p>It showing pSmad1/5/9-mediated combating cellular senescence of enalapril, and improvement of organ function in mice. Specifically, enalapril increases the level of pSmad1/5/9 and Smad4, promoting the expression of downstream genes, such as antioxidative and cell cycle related genes, thereby promoting cell proliferation and reducing ROS. Moreover, enalapril mitigates age-related degenerative changes, including enhanced memory, improved kidney function, increased liver metabolism and other organ functions.

<p>Mechanistically, our data revealed that enalapril enhances the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/9, a critical signaling pathway that regulates various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and the oxidative stress response. Phosphorylation of Smad1/5/9 facilitates its nuclear translocation, where it acts as a transcriptional regulator to upregulate downstream genes, such as those involved in cell cycle regulation and antioxidative responses. These findings suggest that the ability of enalapril to modulate the pSmad1/5/9 pathway contributes to its protective effects against oxidative stress, a well-established hallmark of aging. By reducing ROS levels and promoting cell proliferation, enalapril effectively delays the progression of cellular senescence and reduces organismal aging-related phenotypes. This finding not only highlights the potential of phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 as a therapeutic target for anti-senescence interventions but also reveals a novel antioxidative mechanism of enalapril action.</p>
<p>Several FDA-approved drugs have been repurposed for anti-aging applications, demonstrating a wide range of mechanisms and effects. These include rapamycin, metformin, and NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors. For example, rapamycin, which was originally used as an immunosuppressant to prevent organ transplant rejection, inhibits the mTOR pathway, which is associated with cell growth and metabolism(S. C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Johnson, Rabinovitch, &amp; Kaeberlein, 2013</xref>). It extends the lifespan of mice and shows potential anti-aging effects across various species(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>). Compared with other repurposed anti-aging drugs, enalapril offers distinct advantages because of its unique mechanism of action. As an ACE inhibitor, enalapril inherently targets the renin‒ angiotensin system, providing vascular protection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schmieder, Hilgers, Schlaich, &amp; Schmidt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yamamoto &amp; Rakugi, 2021</xref>). Compared with repurposed drugs such as rapamycin, which may have more pronounced side effects, such as immunosuppression, limiting their long-term use, enalapril has a well-established safety profile(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Janes &amp; Fruman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Saunders, Metcalfe, &amp; Nicholson, 2001</xref>). This can facilitate faster clinical translation for anti-aging applications. Moreover, our study revealed that enalapril reduces ROS through the pSmad1/5/9-antioxidant axis, highlighting its potential for antioxidation, a hallmark of aging that is less directly targeted by drugs such as rapamycin or metformin. Additionally, enalapril enhances multi-organ function, particularly in the brain, kidneys, and liver. Its well-established safety profile further supports enalapril as a promising candidate for clinical anti-aging applications, with the potential to complement existing therapies by promoting both vascular health and systemic antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Aging is a highly complex and multifactorial process(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jazwinski, 1996</xref>). It involves intricate interactions among various signaling pathways and crosstalk between tissues and organs, especially during individual aging(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jazwinski, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Munoz-Espin &amp; Serrano, 2014</xref>). Notably, enalapril is not uniform across all organs and tissues, as indicated by the differential improvement in aging phenotypes among various tissues. For example, enalapril significantly improved the physiological functions of the brain, muscle and other organs, but the specific pathways and mechanisms by which these effects are mediated might differ among organs. This observation suggests that the tissue-specific effects of enalapril may be mediated by differential activation of signaling pathways, including those beyond the Smad1/5/9 axis, which are known to play crucial roles in aging. Future studies should focus on delineating these tissue-specific mechanisms to fully understand the scope of the anti-aging effects of enalapril. Moreover, improvements in metabolic function in the liver could have downstream effects on brain function, as metabolic dysregulation is known to exacerbate neurodegenerative diseases. Similarly, enhanced vascular health resulting from the antihypertensive properties of enalapril may contribute to improved brain perfusion, reducing the risk of age-related cognitive decline. Therefore, exploring the systemic effects of enalapril and how improvements in one organ system may benefit others should be a priority for future research. Furthermore, given the established role of enalapril as an antihypertensive drug, assessing its potential side effects when it is repurposed for anti-aging purposes is essential. Identifying strategies to minimize these side effects while optimizing their anti-aging effects is an important area of investigation. In conclusion, our study identified enalapril as a promising candidate for repurposing as an anti-senescence drug with antioxidative and promoting effects on cell proliferation. These findings open avenues for the development of targeted therapies aimed at mitigating aging and promoting healthy longevity in clinical settings, providing a foundation for guiding future research in the realm of anti-aging drug interventions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors showed that enalapril was able to reduce cellular senescence and improve health status in aged mice. The authors further showed that phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 was significantly elevated and blocking this pathway attenuated the protection of cells from senescence. When middle-aged mice were treated with enalapril, the physiological performance in several tissues, including memory capacity, renal function and muscle strength, exhibited significant improvement.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of the study lies in the identification of pSMAD1/5/9 pathway as the underlying mechanism mediating the anti-senescence effects of enalapril with comprehensive evaluation both in vitro and in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness of the study is the in vivo data. Despite the evidence shown in the in vitro study, there is no data to show that blocking the pSmad1/5/9 pathway is able to attenuate the anti-aging effects of enalapril in the mice. In addition, the aging phenotypes mitigation by enalapril is not evidenced by the extension of lifespan. If it is necessary to show that NAC is able to attenuate enalapril effects in the aging mice. In addition, it would be beneficial to test if enalapril is able to achieve similar rescue in a premature aging mouse model.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript provided additional in vivo data that addressed my questions accordingly. I think the authors have done an excellent job in demonstrating that enalapril improved physiological phenotypes in aged mice through pSmad1/5/9 pathway.</p>
<p>Their response to my question regarding the test in HGPS mice was not satisfactory. Premature aging and physiological aging share substantial similarities in their pathways. Given that this is not the focus of current study and the manuscript does not provide data on HGPS mice, I think this does not affect the conclusion of the current study.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents an interesting study of enalapril for its potential impact on senescence through the activation of Smad1/5/9 signaling with a focus on antioxidative gene expression. Repurposing enalapril in this context provides a fresh perspective on its effects beyond blood pressure regulation. The authors make a strong case for the importance of Smad1/5/9 in this process, and the inclusion of both in vitro and in vivo models adds value to the findings. Below, I have a few comments and suggestions which may help improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>A major finding in the study is that phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 mediates the effects of enalapril. However, the manuscript focused on the Smad pathway relatively abruptly, and the rationale behind targeting this specific pathway is not fully explained. What makes Smad1/5/9 particularly relevant to the context of this study?</p>
<p>Furthermore, their finding that activation of Smad1/5/9 leads to a reduction of senescence appears somewhat contradictory to the established literature on Smad1/5/9 in senescence. For instance, studies have shown that BMP4-induced senescence involves activation of Smad1/5/8 (Smad1/5/9), leading to the upregulation of senescence markers like p16 and p21 (JBC, 2009, 284, 12153). Similarly, phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 has been shown to promote and maintain senescence in Ras-activated cells (PLOS Genetics, 2011, 7, e1002359). Could the authors provide more detailed mechanistic insights into why enalapril seems to reverse the typical pro-senescent role of Smad1/5/9 in their study?</p>
<p>While the authors showed that enalapril increases pSmad1/5/9 phosphorylation, what are the expression levels of other key and related factors like Smad4, pSmad2, pSmad3, BMP2, and BMP4 in both senescent and non-senescent cells? These data will help clarify the broader signaling effects.</p>
<p>They used BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 to pharmacologically inhibit BMP signaling, but it would be more convincing to also include genetic validation (e.g., knockdown or knockout of BMP2 or BMP4). This will help confirm that the observed effects are truly due to BMP-Smad signaling and not off-target effects of the pharmacological inhibitor LDN.</p>
<p>I don't see the results on the changes in senescence markers p16 and p21 in the mouse models treated with enalapril. Similarly, the effects of enalapril treatment on some key SASP factors, such as TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β, and IL-1α, are missing, particularly in serum and tissues. These are important data to evaluate the effect of enalapril on senescence.</p>
<p>Given that enalapril is primarily known as an antihypertensive, it would be helpful to include data on how it affects blood pressure in the aged mouse models, such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This will clarify whether the observed effects are independent of or influenced by changes in blood pressure.</p>

In accordance with your suggestion, we administered LDN193189 to investigate its suppressive effects on pSmad1/5/9 signaling in vivo. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of pSmad1/5/9 resulted in upregulation of enalapril-suppressed SASP factors, while conversely leading to marked decrease of downstream antioxidant genes expression across multiple organ systems (Revised Fig. S7). These analyses and corresponding sentences have been added in the Result section of the revised MS (Revised Fig.S7, Lines 222–223, 444–448).</p>
<p>Additionally, aging-related behavioral phenotypes were also examined following pSmad1/5/9 inhibition, including decreased muscle strength and endurance, impaired spatial memory and increased anxiety behaviors (Revised Fig. S8). These analyses and corresponding sentences have been added in the Result section of the revised MS (Revised Fig.S8, Lines 476–480). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the anti-aging effects of enalapril in mice are mediated through the pSmad1/5/9 pathway.</p>
<p>In this study, we focused exclusively on assessing the improvement in the health status of aged mice, which indicates that enalapril can extend the healthspan of aged mice. While we agree that lifespan extension is an important indicator of anti-aging potential, recent studies have emphasized that healthspan, rather than lifespan alone, provides a more relevant and translational measure of aging interventions, particularly in the context of chronic disease and quality of life in aged individuals (Kennedy et al., 2014; Lopez-Otin et al., 2023). Moreover, given the strong influence of genetic background, environmental factors and stochastic events on lifespan, focusing on functional rejuvenation and delayed onset of aging-related pathologies may offer a more practical and mechanistically informative approach. Our study aims to elucidate how enalapril enhances healthy phenotypes in aged mice, however, we acknowledge the critical need for direct lifespan evaluation and intend to address this limitation in subsequent research. We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns.</p>

<p>(2) If it is necessary to show that NAC is able to attenuate enalapril effects in the aging mice. In addition, it would be beneficial to test if enalapril is able to achieve similar rescue in a premature aging mouse model.</p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestion. We apologize for any confusion that may have arisen due to the wording in the original manuscript. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is widely reported as an antioxidant that scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Huang et al., 2020; Zafarullah et al., 2003). In our study, enalapril was also observed to reduce ROS levels. Therefore, NAC is unlikely to antagonize the effects of enalapril in this context, as both compounds act in a similar direction with respect to oxidative stress mitigation. To avoid potential misunderstanding, we have carefully reviewed the relevant statements in the MS and revised the text to clarify this point.</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate this valuable suggestion to evaluate enalapril in a premature aging mouse model; however, the premature aging mouse models represent a pathological form of aging, whereas the naturally aged mouse models used in our study reflect physiological aging processes. While we observed beneficial effects of enalapril in naturally aged mice, these effects may not necessarily extend to premature aging models due to fundamental differences in the underlying mechanisms and progression of aging. Natural aging is characterized by the gradual accumulation of cellular damage, driven by multifactorial processes such as inflammaging and mitochondrial dysfunction. In this context, enalapril appears effective, in part by modulating SASP factors and reducing oxidative stress through the BMP-Smad signaling axis (Revised Fig. 4, 5) (Lopez-Otin et al., 2023). In contrast, premature aging models are driven by distinct mechanisms like nuclear lamina defects, which may not respond similarly to BMP-Smad axis. Moreover, genetic background, strain variability, and specific model characteristics can significantly influence treatment outcomes (Mitchell et al., 2016). For instance, rapamycin extends lifespan in wild-type mice but shows limited effects on aging, underscoring the challenge of extrapolating findings across distinct aging models (Neff et al., 2013). We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns. Thank you again for your great efforts in advancing our research!</p>

<p>This manuscript presents an interesting study of enalapril for its potential impact on senescence through the activation of Smad1/5/9 signaling with a focus on antioxidative gene expression. Repurposing enalapril in this context provides a fresh perspective on its effects beyond blood pressure regulation. The authors make a strong case for the importance of Smad1/5/9 in this process, and the inclusion of both in vitro and in vivo models adds value to the findings. Below, I have a few comments and suggestions which may help improve the manuscript.</p>

<p>We appreciate your great efforts in advancing our research! Your comments are shown in bold font below, and specific concerns have been numbered. Our point-by-point answers are provided in standard blue font, with all modifications and additions to the MS highlighted in red text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) A major finding in the study is that phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 mediates the effects of enalapril. However, the manuscript focused on the Smad pathway relatively abruptly, and the rationale behind targeting this specific pathway is not fully explained. What makes Smad1/5/9 particularly relevant to the context of this study?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your informative guidance, and we regret for the unclear description. As stated in the MS, after we found that enalapril could improve the cellular senescence phenotype, we screened and examined key targets in important aging-related signaling pathways, such as AKT, mTOR, ERK, Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/9 (Revised Fig. S2A, Revised Fig. 2A). We found that only the phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/9 significantly increased after enalapril treatment. Therefore, the subsequent focus of this study is on pSmad1/5/9. We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Furthermore, their finding that activation of Smad1/5/9 leads to a reduction of senescence appears somewhat contradictory to the established literature on Smad1/5/9 in senescence. For instance, studies have shown that BMP4-induced senescence involves the activation of Smad1/5/8 (Smad1/5/9), leading to the upregulation of senescence markers like p16 and p21 (JBC, 2009, 284, 12153). Similarly, phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 has been shown to promote and maintain senescence in Ras-activated cells (PLOS Genetics, 2011, 7, e1002359). Could the authors provide more detailed mechanistic insights into why enalapril seems to reverse the typical pro-senescent role of Smad1/5/9 in their study?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Many thanks for your helpful comments! The downstream regulatory network of BMP-pSmad1/5/9 is highly complex. The BMP-SMAD-ID axis has been mentioned in many studies, and its downstream signaling inhibits the expression of p16 and p21 (Hayashi et al., 2016; Ying et al., 2003). Additionally, studies have also found that the Smad1-Stat1-P21 axis inhibits osteoblast senescence (Xu et al., 2022). In our study, enalapril was found to increase the expression of ID1, which is a classic downstream target of pSmad1/5/9 (Genander et al., 2014). Therefore, pSmad1/5/9 inhibits cellular senescence markers such as p16, p21 and SASP through ID1, thereby promoting cell proliferation (Revised Fig. 3). Furthermore, we also found that pSmad1/5/9 increases the expression of antioxidant genes and reduces ROS levels, exerting antioxidant effects (Revised Fig. 4). Together, ID1 and antioxidant genes enable pSmad1/5/9 to exert its anti-senescence effects. We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) While the authors showed that enalapril increases pSmad1/5/9 phosphorylation, what are the expression levels of other key and related factors like Smad4, pSmad2, pSmad3, BMP2, and BMP4 in both senescent and non-senescent cells? These data will help clarify the broader signaling effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your insightful suggestions. We observed an increase in pSmad1/5/9 and Smad4 expression, while the levels of pSmad2 and pSmad3 remained unchanged after enalapril treatment (Revised Fig. 2A). Consistently, we found that the levels of pSmad1/5/9 and Smad4 were markedly reduced in senescent cells, aligning with the upregulation of these proteins by enalapril (Revised Fig. S2B). In contrast, pSmad2 and pSmad3 showed a slight increase during senescence, while BMP2 and BMP4 were slightly decreased, though these changes were not statistically significant (Revised Fig. S2B). These findings suggest that enalapril primarily exerts its effects by enhancing pSmad1/5/9 and Smad4 levels, thereby regulating downstream target genes and contributing to the restoration of a more youthful cellular state. These analyses and corresponding sentences have been added in the Result section of the revised MS (Revised Fig.S2B, Lines 303–306, 311–313).</p>

<p>(4) They used BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 to pharmacologically inhibit BMP signaling, but it would be more convincing to also include genetic validation (e.g., knockdown or knockout of BMP2 or BMP4). This will help confirm that the observed effects are truly due to BMP-Smad signaling and not off-target effects of the pharmacological inhibitor LDN.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Many thanks for your careful reading and valuable comments! We used shRNA to knockdown the BMP receptor BMPR1A, which led to a reduction in Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation (Revised Fig. S4D, E). This was accompanied by senescence-associated phenotypes, including increased expression of p16 and SA-β-gal and decreased Ki67 staining (Revised Fig. S4F, G). Notably, the addition of enalapril failed to reverse these senescence phenotypes under BMPR1A knockdown conditions, mirroring the results observed with the BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 (Revised Fig. S4F, G, Revised Fig. 2F, G). Furthermore, knockdown of BMPR1A also resulted in a marked decrease in the expression of downstream targets, such as ID1 and antioxidative genes (Revised Fig. S4D). These findings strongly support the notion that enalapril exerts its anti-senescence effects through BMP-Smad signaling. These analyses and corresponding sentences have been added in the Result section of the revised MS (Revised Fig.S4D–G, Lines 323–329, 335–337, 348–351, 416–418).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) I don't see the results on the changes in senescence markers p16 and p21 in the mouse models treated with enalapril. Similarly, the effects of enalapril treatment on some key SASP factors, such as TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β, and IL-1α, are missing, particularly in serum and tissues. These are important data to evaluate the effect of enalapril on senescence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. As for the markers p16 and p21, we observed no change in p16, while the changes in p21 varied across different organs and tissues. Nevertheless, behavioral experiments and physiological and biochemical indicators at the individual level consistently demonstrated the significant anti-aging effects of enalapril (Revised Fig. 6).</p>
<p>We also examined the changes in SASP factors in the serum of mice after enalapril treatment. Notably, SASP factors such as CCL (MCP), CXCL and TNFRS11B showed significant decreases (Revised Fig. 5C). The expression changes of SASP factors varied across different organs. In the liver, kidneys and spleen, the expression of IL1a and IL1b decreased, while TNFRS11B expression decreased in both the liver and muscles (Revised Fig. 5B). Additionally, CCL (MCP) levels decreased in all organs (Revised Fig. 5B). We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Given that enalapril is primarily known as an antihypertensive, it would be helpful to include data on how it affects blood pressure in the aged mouse models, such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This will clarify whether the observed effects are independent of or influenced by changes in blood pressure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. While enalapril is primarily recognized for its antihypertensive properties, in our experimental setting involving aged, normotensive mice, we did not observe notable changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure following enalapril administration. This observation aligns with previous reports indicating that enalapril does not significantly affect blood pressure in similar non-hypertensive aging models (Keller et al., 2019). Based on these findings, we cautiously interpret that the beneficial effects of enalapril observed in our study are unlikely to be driven by changes in blood pressure. We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns. Again, thank you for the constructive comments to advance the understanding of our work!</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>This is an interesting study that reveals enalapril is able to elevate the pSmad1/5/9 pathway to reduce ROS and inflammation to improve the health status in vitro and in vivo. While the pathway is clearly shown in cells to be involved in the enalarpril-mediated mitigation of aging, little was done to demonstrate this pathway is responsible for the in vivo effects in the physiological improvements. This can be done by ROS-reduction chemicals such as NAC and also the use of BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 (LDN). It is critical to show the lifespan extension in enalapril-treated animals given that the significantly improved physiological functions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The term &quot;anti-aging&quot; appears frequently throughout the manuscript, including in the title. However, the study doesn't directly address lifespan or a comprehensive range of aging symptoms, which are also difficult to define and measure. Many of the observed effects appeared to be driven by senescence. To be more accurate, I recommend avoiding terms like &quot;anti-aging&quot; and &quot;mitigates aging&quot;, and instead replacing them with more specific phrases such as &quot;anti-senescence&quot;, &quot;senescence reduction/suppression&quot;, or &quot;mitigates age-related symptoms&quot; to better reflect the scope of the study and avoid overstating the findings.</p>
