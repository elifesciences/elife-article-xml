<title>Abstract</title><p>Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a gut-derived hormone secreted by intestinal L cells and vital for postprandial glycemic control. As open-type enteroendocrine cells, whether L cells can sense mechanical stimuli caused by chyme and thus regulate GLP-1 synthesis and secretion is unexplored. Our study showed expression of Piezo1 in intestinal L cells. Its level varied in different energy status and correlates with blood glucose and GLP-1 levels. Mice with L cell-specific loss of Piezo1 (<italic>IntL-Piezo1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) exhibited impaired glucose tolerance, increased body weight, reduced GLP-1 production and decreased CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway under normal chow diet or high fed diet. Activation of the intestinal Piezo1 by its agonist Yoda1 or intestinal bead implantation increased the synthesis and secretion of GLP-1, thus alleviated glucose intolerance in diet-induced-diabetic mice. Overexpression of Piezo1, Yoda1 treatment or stretching stimulated GLP-1 production and CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway, which could be abolished by knockdown or blockage of Piezo1 in primary cultured mouse L cells and STC-1 cells. These findings suggest a previously undiscovered mechano-regulation of GLP-1 production in L cells, which may shed new light on the treatments of diabetes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The gastrointestinal (GI) tract represents the largest endocrine organ in the human body. The enteroendocrine cells (EECs) located throughout the GI tract secrete a large number of gastrointestinal hormones to regulate a variety of physiological processes and are key regulators for energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bany Bakar et al., 2023</xref>). GLP-1 is one of the gut-derived peptide hormones essential for postprandial glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Song et al., 2019</xref>). It is produced from Proglucagon (Gcg) by proprotein convertase in the intestinal L cells, a group EECs predominantly situated in the distal gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Drucker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rouillé et al., 1997</xref>). The circulating GLP-1 levels rapidly increase after meal and reduce postprandial blood glucose fluctuations by augmenting insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon secretion and slowing gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Drucker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Willms et al., 1996</xref>). Nowadays, GLP-1-based therapy is well-recognized and commonly used in treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Saxena et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tan et al., 2022</xref>). Although GLP-1 analogs such as exenatide and liraglutide have been approved for clinical use in the treatment of T2DM, these drugs may lead to side effects such as pancreatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Elashoff et al., 2011</xref>), as well as potential risk of inducing medullary thyroid carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bezin et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, elucidation of the mechanism that regulates GLP-1 production is essential for the development of new drug targets for the treatment of diabetes.</p>
<p>EECs can be divided into two categories according to its morphology: open type and closed type. The open type EECs possess microvilli protruding into the gut lumen and have direct contact with the luminal contents. In contrast, the closed type EECs are located basolaterally without direct contact with the lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gribble &amp; Reimann, 2016</xref>). Both types of EECs synthesize and store peptides or hormones in secretory granules and release them by exocytosis at the basolateral membrane upon mechanical, chemical or neural stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atanga et al., 2023</xref>). As open-type cells, L cells received both chemical and mechanical signals from the luminal contents, and neural signals from the nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Furness et al., 2013</xref>). It has been well-documented that nutrients such as glucose, lipids, and amino acids in the intestinal lumen can stimulate the secretion of GLP-1 from L cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Diakogiannaki et al., 2012</xref>). GLP-1 secretion can also be stimulated by intrinsic cholinergic nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anini et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Drucker, 2006</xref>). However, whether and how L cells coordinate mechanical stimuli from intestinal lumen to regulate GLP-1 production remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Piezo channels, including Piezo1 and Piezo2 have recently been identified as a mechanosensitive ion channel that is involved in the sensation of multiple mechanical stimuli, such as shear stress, pressure, and stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gudipaty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Romac et al., 2018</xref>). They allow the influx of cations such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> in response to mechanical tension and converts mechanical stimuli into various electrical and chemical signals. Piezo1 plays a crucial role in blood pressure regulation, red blood cell volume regulation, bone homeostasis, pulmonary and cardiac functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have reported that Piezo1 is expressed in the intestinal epithelium, regulating barrier function, mucus secretion, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, accumulating evidence demonstrates the regulation of insulin secretion by Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deivasikamani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ye et al., 2022</xref>). Recent studies have also reported that Piezo2 is expressed in a population of EECs and convert force into serotonin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alcaino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Treichel et al., 2022</xref>). These findings suggest a critical role of Piezo channels in the mechano-regulation of hormone production. However, whether Piezo channels are expressed L cells and play a role in GLP-1 production remain unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we present evidence that Piezo1 channels on intestinal L cells mediate the mechanosensing from intestinal contents and trigger the synthesis and secretion of GLP-1 through CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway, thus regulating glucose homeostasis. Our research provides new insights for the treatment of T2DM and a new theoretical basis for hypoglycemic medicines targeting Piezo1.</p>

<title>Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test</title>
<p>Mice were fasted for 12 hours before measuring their fasting glucose levels. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed by administering 1.5 g/kg body weight of glucose. Blood glucose concentrations were measured at specified time points using a glucometer by collecting tail vein blood samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Insulin Tolerance Test</title>
<p>Mice were subjected to a 4-hour fast before measurement of fasting glucose were taken. Insulin tolerance tests (ITT) were conducted with a dose of 0.75 U/kg body weight of insulin. Blood glucose levels were measured at specified time points.</p>

<title>Intestinal Bead implantation</title>
<p>High-fat diet-induced type 2 diabetic C57BL/6J mice were fasted 6 to 8 h before the operation. Standard aseptic procedures were used throughout the operation. For bead implantation, a 1cm incision was made on the abdominal wall to expose the intestine. A 1 cm incision was made approximately 1cm above the ileocecal region. A 2.5 mm diameter bead was implanted into the ileum of the mouse through an incision. Then the wound was closed with suture. Finally, the abdominal wall was closed with suture. For sham operation, all the procedures were the same as the bead implantation except that the bead was not implanted.</p>

<title>Assessment of Piezo1 in human and mouse intestine in different energy status</title>
<p><italic>Piezo1</italic> mRNA was found to be highly expressed in both mouse ileal mucosa and STC-1 cells (Figure supplement 1A). Moreover, Piezo1 was co-localized with GLP-1 in immunofluorescent staining on NCD fed mouse ileal sections, indicating its expression in L cells (Figure supplement 1B). Interestingly, increased body weight and impaired glucose tolerance were observed in high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice, while Piezo1 and Proglucagon expression levels in the ileal mucosa of diabetic mice were significantly lower than that in mice feed with normal chow diet (Figure supplement 1C-F). Moreover, ileal mucosal <italic>Piezo1</italic> mRNA levels were positively correlated with <italic>Proglucagon</italic> mRNA levels (Figure supplement 1G), but negatively correlated with the AUC of glucose tolerance test (Figure supplement 1H). Obese T2MD patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery showed decreased BMI (Figure supplement 1I) and increased <italic>Piezo1</italic> and GLP-1 in ileal mucosa (Figure supplement 1J and K) compared to that before surgery. These findings indicated that Piezo1 is expressed in intestinal L cells and its level varies in different energy status.</p>

<title>Generation and characterization of <italic>IntL-Piezo1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice</title>
<p>To investigate the potential role of Piezo1 in GLP-1 production, we tried to knockout <italic>Piezo1</italic> in L cells by Cre-loxP system driven by an L cell-specific promoter. Proglucagon (encoded by <italic>Gcg</italic> gene) is mainly expressed in both L cells and pancreatic α cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jin, 2008</xref>). Villin-1 (encoded by <italic>Vil1</italic> gene) is expressed in gastrointestinal epithelium, including L cells, but not in pancreatic α cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Maunoury et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rutlin et al., 2020</xref>). Since neither Gcg nor Villin are specific markers for L cells, we tried to generate a new line of mice enabling loss of Piezo1 expression specifically in the intestine L cell by combination of Flp-Frt and Cre-loxP system. We inserted a Flippase (Flp) expression cassette in the 3’UTR of <italic>Vil1</italic> to generate a <italic>Vil1</italic> promoter-driven Flp mice (<italic>Vil-Flp</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Then, we generated Flippase-dependent Gcg promoter driven-Cre (<italic>FGC</italic>) mice by inserting an Frt-flanked Cre expression cassette in reverse orientation within the 3’- UTR of <italic>Gcg</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We further crossed the <italic>Vil-Flp</italic> mice with <italic>FGC</italic> mice to obtain L cell specific Cre mice (<italic>IntL-Cre</italic>), in which <italic>Vil1</italic> promoter-driven Flippase flipped the reverse Cre cassette into a correct orientation in Villin positive cells (including L cells, but not pancreatic α cells), and thus Cre can only be expressed under the <italic>Gcg</italic> promoter in L cells. The genotypes of the <italic>Vil-Flp</italic>, <italic>FGC</italic> and <italic>IntL-Cre</italic> mice were identified by PCR with specific primers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The flipping of the reverse Cre cassette was validated by PCR, which confirmed that the flipping only occurred the intestine, but not in the pancreas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To confirm the cell type specificity of Cre activity, we crossed <italic>IntL-Cre</italic> mice to <italic>mT/mG</italic> reporter mice. All tissues and cells of <italic>mT/mG</italic> mice express red fluorescence (membrane-targeted tdTomato; mT) at baseline, and switch to membrane-targeted EGFP in the presence of cell-specific Cre (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). EGFP expression was only observed scatteredly in the intestine, but not in the pancreas, indicating the L cell-specific Cre activity in the <italic>IntL-Cre</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).

<p>The intestine receives mechanical stimulation from the chyme, which may activate Piezo1 in the intestine epithelium, including L cells. To mimic the mechanical pressing and stretching induced by intestinal contents, a small silicon bead was implanted into the high-fat diet-induced diabetic mouse ileum. Intestinal bead implantation improved the impaired glucose metabolism in diabetic mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K and L</xref>). Body weight loss, activated ileal mucosal CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTOR signaling, increased mRNA and protein levels of ileal mucosal Piezo1 and Proglucagon, as well as the circulating levels of GLP-1 were observed in diabetic mice after operation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M-R</xref>). The above data suggest that mechanical stimuli induced by intestinal bead implantation activates ileal Piezo1 in diabetic mice, stimulating GLP-1 production via CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTOR signaling axis, thus improving glucose homeostasis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has been known for decades that GLP-1 secretion from the intestinal L cells is stimulated by meal intake and is essential for postprandial glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Drucker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Song et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of GLP-1 production is not completely understood. One of the problems that impeded the investigation of regulation mechanism of GLP-1 is the lack of an L cell-specific genetically engineered animal model. Here, we generated an L cell-specific Cre mouse line for the first time by combination of the Flp-Frt and Cre-LoxP systems, which allows genetic manipulation specifically in the L cells and thus creates a useful tool to investigate molecular mechanisms in L cells.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that L cells are able to sense nutrients in the intestinal lumen such as glucose and other carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids, which induce GLP-1 secretion through different mechanisms, including membrane depolarization-associated exocytosis, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tolhurst et al., 2011</xref>), cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yu &amp; Jin, 2010</xref>), mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) and AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>) signaling pathways. However, it is innegligible that as open type endocrine cells, L cells not only receive the chemical stimulations from the nutrients, but also mechanical stimulation when the chyme passing through the intestine, including stretching, pressure and shear force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sensoy, 2021</xref>). Here, we showed the expression of the mechano-sensitive ion channel Piezo1 in L cells of human and mouse intestinal sections, mouse primary L cell culture and an intestinal neuroendocrine cell line STC-1, suggesting the mechano-sensing ability of L cells and potential regulation of GLP-1 in response to mechanical stimulation. Indeed, our study showed that the mechano-regulation of GLP-1 secretion did exist as demonstrated by the increased GLP-1 secretion by intestinal bead implantation, intestinal tissue stretching or STC-1 cell stretching. Moreover, mice with selective loss of Piezo1 expression in intestinal L cell (<italic>IntL-Piezo1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) exhibited reduced circulating levels of GLP-1, increased body weight and impaired glucose homeostasis, while pharmacological activation of Piezo1 on mice, primary L cells and STC-1 cells did the reverse. More importantly, <italic>IntL-Piezo1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was unable to response to the tension-induced GLP-1 production. These further suggested a Piezo1-mediated mechanical sensing mechanism in L cells that regulates GLP-1 production and glucose metabolism by sensing the stimulation of intestinal luminal contents.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this intestinal Piezo1-mediated mechanical sensing mechanism may severely impaired in diabetic patients and rodents. We observed a decreased Piezo1 expression in the ileal mucosa of diet-induced diabetic mice accompanied by reduced GLP-1 production. When challenged with high-fat, <italic>IntL-Piezo1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited more severe symptoms of diabetes which was mitigated by Ex-4. These findings suggest that the impairment of Piezo1-midated mechanical sensing function in the intestine is an important mechanism for the pathogenesis of T2DM. It is noteworthy that RYGB, a commonly performed weight-loss and hypoglycemic surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cummings et al., 2004</xref>), significantly increased Piezo1 expression in L cells of obese diabetic patients. Yoda1 treatment or intestinal bead implantation enhanced GLP-1 production and improved glucose metabolism in the diet-induced diabetic mouse model, suggesting that restore the mechano-sensing or enhance the function of Piezo1 either pharmacologically or mechanically, may be a new strategy to improve the secretion of GLP-1, thus alleviate T2DM. However, in our study, the Piezo1-mediated regulation of GLP-1 production is only demonstrated in transgenic mice, mouse primary L cells and an intestinal neuroendocrine cell line derived from mouse. Whether Piezo1 plays the same role in human L cells awaits to be investigated. A number of studies have generated L cells culture from human intestinal organoid culture or human intestinal stem cell monolayer culture by manipulating the growth factors in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goldspink et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Villegas-Novoa et al., 2022</xref>). It is worthy to validate our finding in human L cells in order to prove its translational potential in T2DM treatment.</p>
<p>The intragastric balloon is a current noninvasive clinical weight loss measure that involves placing a space-occupying balloon in the stomach to reduce food intake and generate satiety signals, thus maintaining satiety. Investigations illustrated that intragastric balloon alter the secretion of hormones such as cholecystokinin and pancreatic polypeptide, delay the emptying of food in the stomach and reduce the appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mathus-Vliegen &amp; de Groot, 2013</xref>). Intragastric balloon provides a feasible weight loss intervention for obese people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, a new intestinal implantation surgery of beads was adopted, which may offer a novel approach for weight loss and glucose control by activating the intestinal Piezo1-GLP-1 signaling pathway in the future.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, our study suggest that Piezo1 regulates GLP-1 production through a CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTOR signaling pathway. CaMKKβ/CaMKIV has been reported to mediate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in many metabolic processes, including liver gluconeogenesis and de novo lipogenesis, adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity and β cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). mTOR plays a central role in nutrient and energy sensing and regulates cellular metabolism and growth in response to different nutrient and energy status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Howell &amp; Manning, 2011</xref>). Here we showed that mTOR can also response to mechanical stimuli through a mechano-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel mediated CaMKKβ/CaMKIV activation. Although we did not demonstrate direct phosphorylation of mTOR or S6K by CaMKIV in L cells, previous study reported that CaMKK2 could serve as a scaffold to assemble CaMKIV with key components of the mTOR/S6K pathway and promote liver cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lin et al., 2015</xref>), which lend support to the CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTOR signaling in our study. Recently, Knutson et. al. found that ryanodine and IP3-triggered calcium release from intracellular calcium store could amplified the initial Peizo2 - Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal triggered by mechanical stimulation, and was required for the mechanotransduction in the serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knutson et al., 2023</xref>). In our study, we also observed long-lasting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase triggered by Yoda1 in primary L cells and STC-1 cells, which also suggested an involvement of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> store in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> relay. Beside Ca<sup>2+</sup>, cyclic AMP (cAMP) is another signaling molecule that active <italic>Gcg</italic> gene expression and GLP-1 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Drucker et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Simpson et al., 2007</xref>). cAMP was found to play a critical role in nutrients-induced GLP-1 secretion, including glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ong et al., 2009</xref>), lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hodge et al., 2016</xref>), and amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tolhurst et al., 2011</xref>). Previous study reported that Ca<sup>2+</sup> can activate soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) to increase intracellular cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jaiswal &amp; Conti, 2003</xref>). Whether sAC-cAMP can be activated by Piezo1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and whether it is an alternative signaling pathway that mediates the Piezo1-regulated GLP-1 production remain to be explored.</p>
<p>In summary, our study reveals a previously undiscovered Piezo1-mediated mechano-sensing property of intestinal L cell, which plays an essential role in the regulation of GLP-1 production and glucose metabolism. This finding also suggests a new mechano-regulation in enteroendocrine cells, in addition to chemical and neuronal regulation, which may shed new light on the strategy for metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Huang and colleagues focuses on GLP-1 producing entero-endocrine (EEC) L-cells and their regulation of GLP-1 production by a mechano-gated ion channel Piezo1. The study describes Piezo1 expression by L-cells and uses an exciting intersectional mouse model (villin to target epithelium and Gcg to target GLP-1-producing cells and others like glucagon-producing pancreatic endocrine cells), which allows L-cell specific Piezo1 knockout. Using this model, they find an impairment of glucose tolerance, increased body weight, reduced GLP-1 content, and changes to the CaMKKbeta-CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway using a normal diet and then high-fat diet. Piezo1 chemical agonist and intestinal bead implantation reversed these changes and improved the disrupted phenotype. Using primary sorted L-cells and cell model STC-1, they found that stretch and Piezo1 activation increased GLP-1 and altered the molecular changes described above.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an interesting study testing a novel hypothesis that may have important mechanistic and translational implications. The authors generated an important intersectional genetics mouse model that allowed them to target Piezo1 L-cells specifically, and the surprising result of impaired metabolism is intriguing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, there are several critical limitations that require resolution before making the conclusions that the authors make.</p>
<p>(1) A potential explanation for the data, and one that is consistent with existing literature [see for example, PMC5334365, PMC4593481], is that epithelial Piezo1, which is broadly expressed by the GI epithelium, impacts epithelial cell density and survival, and as such, if Piezo1 is involved in L-cell physiology, it may be through regulation of cell density. Thus, it is critical to determine L-cell densities and epithelial integrity in controls and Piezo1 knockouts systematically across the length of the gut, since the authors do not make it clear which gut region contributes to the phenotype they see. Current immunohistochemistry data are not convincing.</p>
<p>(2) Calcium signaling in L-cells is implicated in their typical role of being gut chemo-sensors, and Piezo1 is a calcium channel, so it is not clear whether any calcium-related signaling mechanism would phenocopy these results.</p>
<p>(3) Intestinal bead implantation, while intriguing, does not have clear mechanisms - and is likely to provide a point of intestinal obstruction and dysmotility.</p>
<p>(4) Previous studies, some that are very important, but not cited, contradict the presented results (e.g., epithelial Piezo1 role in insulin secretion) and require reconciliation.</p>
<p>Overall, this study makes an interesting observation but the data are not currently strong enough to support the conclusions.</p>

<p>Current GLP-1-based therapies for diabetes use GLP-1 agonists/analogs. Although generally safe, there are some side effect or risks of GLP-1 agonists/analogs. We agree to the reviewer that a mechanistic study on the regulation of GLP-1 production will not directly lead to development of new drug targets for the treatment of diabetes. However, understanding the mechanism of GLP-1 production may shed light onto alternative treatment strategies for diabetes that targeting the production of GLP-1. In our previous studies, we have elucidated the role of mTOR/S6K pathway in regulating GLP-1 production in L cells. Using STC-1 cell line and different mouse models, including Neurog3-Tsc1−/− mice, rapamycin or L-lucine treatment to stimulate mTOR activity, we have demonstrated that mTOR stimulates proglucagon gene expression and thus GLP-1 production (Diabetologia 2015;58(8):1887-97； Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2015 Nov 15:416:9-18.). Based on our previous studies, we found that Piezo1 regulated mTOR/S6K pathway and thus proglucagon expression and GLP-1 production through Ca2+/CaMKKbeta/CaMKIV in our present study. Although we could not exclude involvement of other signaling pathways downstream of Piezo1 in regulating the cleavage of proglucagon, granule maturation and the final release of GLP-1, our present study provided evidence to support the involvement of the Ca2+/CaMKKbeta/CaMKIV/mTOR pathway in mediating the role Piezo1 in proglucagon expression and GLP-1 production. The reviewer also expressed concerns on the use of western blot to detect proglucagon expression. In fact, western blot is often used in detection of proglucagon. Here are some examples from other researchers: Diabetes. 2013 Mar;62(3):789-800. Gastroenterology. 2011 May;140(5):1564-74. 2004 Jul 23;279(30):31068-75. The proglucagon antibody we used in our study was purchased from abcam (Cat#ab23468), which can detect proglucagon of 21 kDa.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We agree that Piezo1 may affect L-cell density and epithelial integrity. We will do quantification of L-cell density and test the epithelial integrity by examining the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and Occludin) and determine the transepithelial resistance in different regions of the gut</p>

<p>To ascertain if intestinal bead implantation led to intestinal obstruction and dysmotility, we conducted a bowel transit time test. The results revealed no difference in bowel transit time between the sham-operated mice and those implanted with beads.</p>

<p>We will cite more previous studies on GLP-1 production and discuss the discrepancy between our study and others’ studies. The lack of changes in blood glucose seen in <italic>Villin-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice reported by Sugisawa et. al. is not surprising (Cell. 2020 Aug 6;182(3):609-624.e21.). Actually, in another recent study from our group, we found similar results when the <italic>Villin-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice <italic>Piezo1fl/fl</italic> control mice were fed with normal chow diet. Since Villin-1 is expressed in all the epithelial cells of the gut, including enterocytes and various types of endocrine cells, the effect of L-cell Piezo1 loss may be masked by other cell types under normal condition. However, impair glucose tolerance was seen in <italic>Villin-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice compared to the <italic>Piezo1fl/fl</italic> control mice after high fat diet for 8 weeks. We further found that Piezo1 in enterocytes exerted a negative effect on the glucose and lipid absorption. Loss of Piezo1 in enterocytes led to over-absorption of nutrients under high-fat diet （Tian Tao, Qing Shu, Yawen Zhao, Wenying Guo, Jinting Wang, Yuhao Shi, Shiqi Jia, Hening Zhai, Hui Chen, Cunchuan Wang*, Geyang Xu*, Mechanical regulation of lipid and sugar absorption by Piezo1 in enterocytes, Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B , Accepted, 2024，<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2024.04.016">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2024.04.016</ext-link>）.</p>
