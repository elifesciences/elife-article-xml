<title>Abstract</title><p>The mammalian heart is formed from multiple mesoderm-derived cell lineages. However, it remains largely unknown when and how the specification of mesoderm towards cardiac lineages is determined. Here, we systematically depict the transcriptional trajectories toward cardiomyocyte in early mouse embryo, and characterize the epigenetic landscapes underlying the early mesodermal lineage specification by single-cell multi-omics analyses. The analyses also reveal distinct core regulatory networks (CRN) in controlling specification of mesodermal lineages. We further demonstrate the essential role HAND1 and FOXF1 in driving the earliest cardiac progenitors specification. These key transcription factors occupy at distinct enhancers, but function synergistically and hierarchically to regulate the expression of cardiac-specific genes. In addition, HAND1 is required for exiting from the nascent mesoderm program, while FOXF1 is essential for driving cardiac differentiation during MJH specification. Our findings establish transcriptional and epigenetic determinants specifying the early cardiac lineage, providing insights for the investigation of congenital heart defects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heart development requires coordinated specification of multiple lineages, each characterized by serial cell fate determination events. Identifying the developmental trajectories is the key to understanding heart formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Buckingham et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kelly 2023</xref>). In past decades, a stepwise determination of early cardiac lineage hierarchy has been primarily established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Parameswaran and Tam 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abu-Issa and Kirby 2007</xref>). The current model designates cardiac progenitor cells into discrete pools, including the first and second heart field (FHF and SHF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Buckingham et al. 2005</xref>), and a newly classified juxta-cardiac field (JCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tyser et al. 2021</xref>). FHF mainly contributes to the left ventricle (LV) and the atria. SHF, located in a dorsal-medial region to FHF, progressively develops into cells in the right ventricle (RV), the outflow tract (OFT) and the atria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cai et al. 2003</xref>). Interestingly, JCF contributes to not only epicardium and pericardium, but also cardiomyocytes (CMs) of LV and the atria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tyser et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Cardiac progenitors are mostly generated from the <italic>Mesp1</italic>-expressing (<italic>Mesp1<sup>+</sup></italic>) nascent mesoderm (NM) cells during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Saga et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Devine et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lescroart et al. 2014</xref>). Pioneering work has revealed that the developmental capacities of each cardiac progenitor pool are highly related to the spatial-temporal constriction during the specification of NM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lescroart et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ivanovitch et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>). Temporally inducible lineage tracing indicates that E6.5 <italic>Mesp1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells mostly contribute to LV, whereas E7.25 <italic>Mesp1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells give rise to RV, atria, OFT, and inflow tracts (IFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lescroart et al. 2018</xref>). It seems that early-streak stage NM cells differentiate into FHF pools, while late-streak stage NM cells relate to SHF progenitors. Interestingly, JCF population is also derived from the <italic>Mesp1<sup>+</sup></italic> NM cells in the gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>). Recent studies on single-cell transcriptomic data of the late headfold stage embryos have revealed that JCF shares a number of molecular markers with FHF, but lacks <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> expression and exhibits specific <italic>Mab21l2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tyser et al. 2021</xref>). However, unlike FHF cells, JCF cells are largely located at the embryonic-extraembryonic mesodermal interface, as revealed by the <italic>Mab21l2</italic> expression, rostrally to the <italic>Nkx2-5</italic> positive cardiac crescent region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tyser et al. 2021</xref>). It remains unclear the molecular signaling underlying the early specification of NM cells into JCF and FHF population.</p>
<p>In this study, by bridging the transcriptional landscapes between the gastrula and the headfold stage in early mouse embryos, we systematically depict the transcriptional trajectories leading to CMs during early mouse development, and characterize the epigenetic landscapes that underlie early mesodermal lineage specification. The analyses reveal two dinstinct developmental trajectories towards CMs, namely the MJH trajectory (the <italic>Hand1</italic>-expressing early extraembryonic <underline>m</underline>esoderm ‚Äì <underline>J</underline>CF and F<underline>H</underline>F ‚Äì CM) and the PSH trajectory (the <underline>p</underline>haryngeal mesoderm cells ‚Äì <underline>SH</underline>F ‚Äì CM). Through single-cell multi-omics analysis, the core regulatory network (CRN) in MJH is identified, consisting of transcription factors (TFs) GATA4, TEAD4, HAND1 and FOXF1. Further functional analysis indicates that HAND1 and FOXF1 are activated sequentially, and both required for mesodermal specification and the expression of the MJH specific genes. Taken together, our study unveils the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics during early cardiac specification, demonstrates the crucial roles of HAND1 and FOXF1 in driving early cardiac specification, and provides insights for the investigation of congenital heart defects.</p>

<title>Transcriptional dynamics during the specification of early cardiac progenitors</title>
<p>To delineate the origin of cardiac progenitors, we constructed the E6.5-8.5 developmental trajectories using the published mouse gastrulation cell atlas by performing the Waddington-Optimal-Transport (WOT) analysis to infer ancestor-descendant fates of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schiebinger et al. 2019</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Pijuan-Sala et al. 2019</xref>). CMs were used as trajectory endpoints and traced back to the E6.5 epiblast. Clear trajectory separation was observed within E7.5-7.75 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Besides the pharyngeal mesoderm (PM) cell cluster at E7.75, a subset of E7.5 early extraembryonic mesoderm (EEM) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>) was specifically identified in a distinct developmental trajectory. PM population was marked by the expression of <italic>Isl1</italic>, <italic>Sfrp1</italic>, <italic>Tcf21</italic>, <italic>Tbx1</italic> and <italic>Irx3</italic>, suggesting its relationship with the SHF progenitors; the EEM cells exhibited highly expressing <italic>Hand1</italic>, <italic>Pmp22</italic>, <italic>Foxf1</italic> and <italic>Spin2c</italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). In addition, cells along the EEM trajectory also expressed higher levels of the FHF signature genes, including <italic>Tbx5</italic> and <italic>Hcn4</italic>, suggesting their contribution to the FHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>). Compared with the PM trajectory, the EEM trajectory was mainly composed of cells in the later stages of cardiac development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref>). By the heart looping stage (E8.5), the two trajectories indeed exhibited distinct contributions to cardiac structures LV and OFT, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Thus, we here refer to these two transcriptional trajectories as EE<underline>M</underline>-<underline>J</underline>CF/F<underline>H</underline>F (MJH) and <underline>P</underline>M-<underline>SH</underline>F (PSH) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The spatial correlation of these two trajectories with heart fields was confirmed using the dataset from manually micro-dissected mesodermal cells in cardiac regions of E7.75-8.25 mouse embryos (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tyser et al. 2021</xref>). The MJH and PSH trajectories contained overlapping but temporally distinct cell types (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The separation of the two trajectories can be observed as early as E7.0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). NM cells, marked by <italic>Mesp1</italic> and <italic>Lefty2</italic>, at E7.0 were more likely to be the multipotent progenitors of the PSH trajectory; whereas mixed mesoderm (MM) cells, marked by <italic>Hand1</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic>, in later developmental stage and EEM cells tended to contribute to the MJH trajectory (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We then systematically characterized the stage specific marker genes in the MJH and PSH trajectories. These two trajectories exhibited discrete and dynamic gene expression profiles during development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We also observed relatively similar inhibitory Wnt and Nodal, as well as active Fgf and Notch, signaling activities along the two trajectories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2A</xref>). Interestingly, the early stage of the MJH trajectory seems show higher Bmp and Yap signaling activities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).

<title>Epigenetic signatures of the early MJH and PSH progenitors</title>
<p>To investigate the epigenetic regulation during cardiac cell fate decisions, we performed multi-omic analysis by combining single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and scATAC-seq to generate paired, cell type specific transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiles of 13,226 cells in E7.0 mouse embryos. The single-cell transcriptomic data were integrated with the published E7.0 mouse embryo cell atlas data, followed by label transfer and gene expression-based cell type identification (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3B</xref>). For the scATAC-seq data, we scored the genome-wide ATAC activities with bin sizes of 10 kb prior to UMAP analysis, which yielded cell clusters similar to transcriptome-based analysis (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>).</p>
<p>9 clusters of cells were identified through clustering analysis at both transcriptional and epigenetic levels, which are NM cells (Clusters 0, 1 and 2), primordia germ cells (PGC, Cluster 4), hematoendothelial progenitors (Haem, Clusters 5 and 6), and EEM cells (Clusters 3, 7 and 8) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A, 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3C</xref>). RNA velocity also supported the four possible trajectories mentioned above for the earliest mesodermal cell specification (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). WOT analysis revealed that Clusters 3, 7, and 8 showed intermediate to high probabilities of belonging to the MJH trajectory; pseudotime analysis indicated that Cluster 8 represented the late differentiated EEM populations (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). Although Cluster 2 represented the relatively late stage of NM cell population by pseudotime analysis, Cluster 1, 0 and 2 demonstrated similar probabilities of belonging to the PSH trajectory (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). Thus, the analyses further indicated that EEM cells and hematoendothelial progenitors were clearly separated from the mesoderm, while the PSH trajectory related cells still remained at the early NM stage at E7.0.</p>

<p>We further analyzed the chromatin accessibilities of these cell clusters. Total 90,661 chromatin accessible elements (CAEs) were detected, 7,206 of which were differentially accessible elements (DAEs) across the 9 clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). The DAEs were annotated to their target genes by enhancer-promoter (EP) pairing analysis. Consistent with the clustering analysis based on gene expression (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>), DAVID functional term analysis revealed that the DAE target genes in Clusters 3, 7 and 8, such as <italic>Hand1</italic>, <italic>Foxf1</italic>, <italic>Bmp4</italic> and <italic>Msx1</italic>, were mainly associated with heart morphogenesis, that those in Clusters 5 and 6, like <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Lmo2</italic> and <italic>Fli1</italic>, were related to angiogenesis and vasculature development, and that those in Clusters 0, 1, 2, for examples, <italic>T</italic>, <italic>Zic2</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic> and <italic>Gata6</italic>, were enriched in gastrulation and mesoderm development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>).</p>
<p>To characterize the spatiotemporal chromatin dynamics of the DAEs in MJH and PSH, we quantified the occupancies of the enhancer marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, as well as the promoter mark H3K4me3 at these DAEs across the E6.5-7.5 developmental stages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yang et al. 2019</xref>). MJH/Cluster 8 and PSH/Cluster 2 specific DAEs could potentially function as enhancers and become activated at anterior regions of E7.5 embryos, as the DAEs were generally marked by H3K27ac and H3K4me1, but not H3K4me3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The enrichment of H3K4me1 at E7.0 and even earlier at E6.5 stage, along with the higher levels of H3K27ac at these DAEs at E7.5 stage, suggested that many of these DAEs could be dormant or inactive enhancers during earlier stages like E6.5, but primed for later activation during lineage specification (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Indeed, the integrated analysis on chromantin accessibility of the DAEs, shown by ATAC-seq, and their target gene expression levels supported that a large portion of the MJH/Cluster 8 DAEs were primed before the full activation of their target genes, like <italic>Bmp4</italic>, <italic>Hand1</italic> and <italic>Foxf1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). For example, seven DAEs associated with the <italic>Bmp4</italic> gene were identifited, three of which were primed at E7.0 as marked by low levels of H3K27ac but high levels of H3K4me1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Taken together, the combined transcriptome and chromatin accessability analysis further supported the early lineage segregation of MJH and the epigenetic priming at gastrulation stage for early cardiac genes.</p>

<title>Identification of lineage specific key TFs</title>
<p>An integrated analysis of motif enrichment at the DAEs and TF expression data allowed us to identify potential lineage specific key TFs. The PSH/Cluster 2 specific DAEs showed motif enrichment similar to the recognition sequences of known NM specific TFs, including GATA4, ZIC3, EOMES, OTX2, and LHX1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). Binding sites for hematoendothelium-related TFs, such as GATA2, FLI1, JUNB, and SOX7, were enriched in the hematoendothelial progenitors/Cluster 6 DAEs. In contrast, the binding motifs of GATA4, HAND1, FOXF1 and TEAD4 were highly over-represented in the MJH/Cluster 8 specific DAEs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Among those MJH-related TFs, GATA4 and TEAD4 showed similar expression and motif activities at Clusters 2, 7, 8 of both MJH and PSH lineages. HAND1 and FOXF1 demonstrated both strong motif activities and specific expression at Cluster 7 and Cluster 8. Interestingly, the expression of HAND1 and FOXF1 seemed relatively transient at NM and EEM cells, and then became downregulated at CM of E7.75 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on E7.0 single-cell multi-omics data analysis, we predicted a core regulatory network (CRN) centering on the four TFs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Functional enrichment analyses indicated that this CRN could control key aspects of MJH specification, including Wnt signaling, epithelium cell migration, cell number maintenance, mesenchyme development, and cardiac development. In the CRN, GATA4 and TEAD4 controlled larger gene sets related to the transition from epiblast to mesodermal status, necessary for both MJH and PSH. HAND1 and FOXF1 co-regulated functionally more specific gene sets critical for differentiation to EEM status (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Consistently, most HAND1 and FOXF1 target genes were specifically expressed in EEM, in contrast to GATA4 and TEAD4 target genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>).</p>
<p>We also performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis to profile the chromatin occupancies of HAND1 and FOXF1 in mesoderm (MES) and cardiac progenitor (CP) cells derived from the step-wise directed cardiomyocyte differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wamstad et al. 2012</xref>).

Direct comparison of ChIP-seq occupancy profiles with DAEs confirmed the specific enrichment of GATA4, HAND1, and FOXF1 at clusters 7 and 8 of MJH lineages, Fli1 at Clusters 5 and 6, while MESP1 is specifically enrichment at mesoderm cell clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).

First of all, over 90% of the cluster specific genes were detected in the control MES transcriptome, indicating that the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation model could be a reliable tool to study the regulation of these cluster specific signature genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<title>Mutual regulation between HAND1 and FOXF1 in driving cardiac specific gene expression</title>
<p>We found that around 50% of the dysregulated genes in <italic>Foxf1</italic> KO MES cells were also dysregulated in <italic>Hand1</italic> KO MES cells, suggesting their synergistic function in transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). For example, the key MJH specific genes, including <italic>Hand1</italic>, <italic>Foxf1</italic>, <italic>Bmp4</italic>, <italic>Tbx20</italic> and <italic>Pmp22</italic> were significantly down-regulated, while the epiblast genes <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, <italic>Sema6a</italic> and <italic>Fst</italic>, and the NM specific genes <italic>Otx2</italic> and <italic>Zic2</italic> were substantially up-regulated in both KO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5E</xref>).

<p>The functional relevance between HAND1 and FOXF1 in target gene regulation could be attribuited to the enrichment of HAND1 at the <italic>Foxf1</italic> enhancers, and vice versa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We then used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete the putative enhancers of <italic>Hand1</italic> and <italic>Foxf1</italic> (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figures S6E-F</xref>). Indeed, deletion of the HAND1-bound <italic>Foxf1</italic> enhancer (<italic>Foxf1</italic>-eH) abolished the activation of <italic>Foxf1</italic>; deletion of the FOXF1-bound <italic>Hand1</italic> enhancer (<italic>Hand1</italic>-eF) also significantly reduced the expression of <italic>Hand1</italic> during cardiac differentiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>).

<p>To assess how <italic>Hand1</italic> loss affects early mesoderm development <italic>in vivo</italic>, we analyzed the single-cell transcriptomics of control and <italic>Hand1</italic> CKO embryos at E7.0. Integrated analysis indicated the loss of EEM cells, but the abnormal accumulation of primitive streak (PS), NM and MM cells in <italic>Hand1</italic> CKO embryos (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>), which suggested that specific deletion of <italic>Hand1</italic> in mesodermal cells strongly affected early mesoderm differentiation. Detailed analysis regarding the percentage of each cell type revealed the specific reduction of cell numbers from EEM, hematoendothelial progenitors, and ExE ectoderm cell clusters in <italic>Hand1</italic> CKO embryos (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). We then compared the gene expression pattern for each cell cluster and calculated the significantly affected genes between Control and <italic>Hand1</italic> CKO embryos (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Consistently, EEM cell cluster was the most affected clusters upon <italic>Hand1</italic> loss (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7C</xref>). Although the percentages of hematoendothelial progenitors and ExE ectoderm cells were reduced, the expression of both cell type specific marker genes did not seem affected drastically. To further illustrate the developmental progression of the mesodermal lineage, we performed paired URD lineage inference analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Farrell et al. 2018</xref>), further confirming the specific development block of NM specification towards EEM in MJH (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). We also performed label transfer analysis to identify MJH and PSH cells from the E7.0 scRNA-seq data (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7D</xref>). Our analysis showed that the fraction of MJH cells increased by over 2-fold, whereas the fraction of PSH cells remained unchanged (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figures S7E</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7F</xref>), supporting that <italic>Hand1</italic> deletion driven by MESP1-CRE blocked the MJH direction of mesoderm differentiation.</p>
<p>The abnormal accumulation of PS, NM and MM cells in <italic>Hand1</italic> CKO embryos appeared to be consistent with the phenotypes observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> mesoderm differentiation of <italic>Hand1</italic> KO mESCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).

In addition, cell migration related genes were also affected in <italic>Hand1</italic>-depleted MES and embryos. To further validate this phenotype, we performed sequential DAPI staining on cryo-sectioned E7.0 control and <italic>Hand1</italic> CKO embryos, followed by cellular segmentation and cell density measurement (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). The analysis revealed that the mesoderm cells near the extraembryonic region in <italic>Hand1</italic> CKO embryos were more compacted (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7B</xref>‚Äô‚Äô, 7C‚Äô‚Äô, and 7D), while the distal region of the <italic>Hand1</italic> CKO embryos showed no obvious difference from the control embryos (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7B</xref>‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô and 7C‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we described the transcriptional trajectories and epigenetic landscapes of early cardiac specification event in mouse embryos, and identified the CRNs underlying the early mesodermal lineage specification. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that this earliest cardiac MJH specification event was tightly regulated by HAND1 and FOXF1. HAND1 and FOXF1 were mutually regulated, but also performed their respective functions in MJH cell fate determination. <italic>In vitro</italic> differentiation and <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model analyses indicated that HAND1 was essential for exiting from NM program during cardiac specification. Depletion of FOXF1 impaired the capacity of mesodermal cells in cardiac specification (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). In sum, our findings provided new insights into the transcriptional determinants that specify the early cardiac progenitors, paving the way for the identification of potential therapeutic targets for treating congenital heart defects.</p>
<p>Recent studies using scRNA-seq have reported the roadmaps of mammalian embryonic lineage development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Pijuan-Sala et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mittnenzweig et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Qiu et al. 2022</xref>). Together with studies which focus on cardiac progenitors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">de Soysa et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tyser et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>), several models have been proposed to explain the multi-lineage process of heart formation. In this study, we found significant distinction between the MJH and PSH trajectories at E7.5-7.75 and performed forward-backward tracing to achieve two non-overlapping trajectories. The two trajectories are consistent with the previous clonal analysis and also the HAND1+ cells lineage tracing by Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Meilhac et al. 2004</xref>). Importantly, we here identified specific trajectory-related gene cohorts throughout the whole process, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms by which HAND1 is crucial for promoting the exit of NM program during the early MJH specification process.</p>
<p>MESP1 serves as a master regulator in the establishment of the cardiac lineage. An analysis of previously published MESP1-regulated genes revealed that GATA4, HAND1 and FOXF1 were directly controlled by MESP1. GATA4 was rapidly induced by MESP1 within 12 hours, while HAND1 and FOXF1 were activated after 24 hours of MESP1 induction. On a pseudotime scale, we noticed a sequential-temporal expression pattern of GATA4, HAND1 and FOXF1 in MJH. Our transcriptional and epigenomic analyses suggested a sequential activation model of MESP1-GATA4-HAND1-FOXF1. However, it should be noted that MESP1 and GATA4 were activated in both MJH and PSH. The process of cardiac lineage segregation is a complex one that may involve TF regulatory networks and signaling pathways. It has been reported that BMP signaling activated the expression of <italic>Hand1</italic> during heart formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zheng et al. 2021</xref>). Since Bmp4 displayed higher specificity for MJH, it might explain the activation of <italic>Hand1</italic>, and subsequent <italic>Foxf1</italic> activation in MJH, but not the PSH. Thus, HAND1 and FOXF1 might be subject to feed-forward activation by MESP1 and GATA4 in concert with BMP signalling, thereby promoting MJH cardiac specification. Future studies are worthwhile to further investigate how TFs work together with signaling pathways to promote cardiac lineage segregation.</p>
<p>We further demonstrated the synergistic roles of HAND1 and FOXF1 in early cardiac specification. <italic>Foxf1</italic>-/- mice were not able to survive beyond E10.0, with incomplete separation of splanchnic and somatic mesoderm, leading to abnormal coelom formation. Interestingly, FOXF1 marked the mesothelium lining (a monolayer epithelial lining of the exocoelomic cavity), the anterior distal part of which extends to the presumptive cardiac mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fleury et al. 2015</xref>). Such an expression pattern is coincident with that of HAND1 in JCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tyser et al. 2021</xref>). Our studies showed that FOXF1 was indispensable for the specification of mesoderm toward early cardiac progenitors, through binding the MJH progenitor specific enhancers for their later activation. Together, the combined analyses on the developmental route of CMs and their transcriptional determinants will further enhance our understanding of the etiology behind congenital heart defects, ultimately providing insights into potential regenerative strategies for heart disease treatment.</p>

To obtain post-implantation embryos, female mice at 7.0 or 9.5 days post-coitum (d.p.c.) were executed and the uteri were dissected and transferred to a petri dish with PBS. For 7.0 d.p.c embryos, each decidua was carefully freed from the uterine muscle layers using properly sharpened forceps. Then the embryos were carefully separated from decidua. Reichart‚Äôs membrane and the ectoplacental cone were also removed from the 7.0 d.p.c embryos. The uteri surrounding the 9.5 d.p.c embryos were cut open with a small incision, the embryos were genetly squeezed out, and then the amniotic membranes were removed. Images of the embryo were acquired on a stereo microscope (Mshot, MZ62; Olympus, SC180).</p>

<p>snRNA-seq datasets of the current study include: (1) E6.5-8.5 whole mouse embryos; (2) micro-dissected anterior cardiac regions of mouse embryos at early crescent to linear heart tube (‚àºE7.75-8.25) stages. (3) GEX part of the single cell multi-omics data of E7.0 mouse embryos. (4) Control and <italic>Hand1</italic> CKO E7.0 mouse embryos.</p>
<p>We used R package ‚ÄòSeurat‚Äô for QC and normalization purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hao et al. 2021</xref>). Cells with abnormal sequencing depth (nFeature_RNA &lt; 2000 or nCount_RNA &gt; 1e5) or with high mitochondrial ratio (percent.mt &gt; 5) were excluded. We used the ‚ÄòSCTransform‚Äô to perform normalization, variance stabilization, and regression of cell cycle scores (using the ‚ÄòCellCycleScoring‚Äô function). For dataset (1), we selected E7.0 samples, removed cells labelled as ‚Äòdoublet‚Äô or ‚Äòstripped‚Äô and regressed out sequencing batches.</p>

<title>snATAC-seq data</title>
<p>Bam files of snATAC-seq from multiome data were processed using Snaptools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Fang et al. 2021</xref>) function ‚Äòsnap-pre‚Äô to remove low-quality fragments (MAPQ &lt; 30), over-sized fragments (length &gt; 1,000 bp), secondary alignments and PCR duplicates. This function also generates cell-by-bin matrices of variable resolution (bin sizes: 1kb, 5kb, 10kb) for downstream analysis. The range of fragment coverage for bin selection was set between 500 and 20,000.</p>

<title>ChIP-seq data analysis</title>
<p>Adapter sequences were removed from Fastq files using trim_galore (v0.6.7) with default parameters. After trimming, ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the mm10 mouse genome using Bowtie2 (v2.3.5.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Langmead and Salzberg 2012</xref>) with ‚Äò--no-mixed‚Äô and ‚Äò--no-discordant‚Äô parameters. The aligned files were sorted and converted to BAM format using SAMtools (v1.9). BigWig files were subsequently generated using deepTools bamCoverage (v3.5.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ramirez et al. 2016</xref>), employing CPM normalization and ignoring duplicates. Peak calling was performed with MACS3 (3.0.0a6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al. 2008</xref>) for HAND1 (<italic>Q</italic>-value &lt; 1e-5) and FOXF1 (<italic>Q</italic>-value &lt; 1e-10) ChIP-seq data.</p>

<title>Tracing the CM, MJH and PSH trajectories</title>
<p>The trajectories of each in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> were inferred using the Waddington-OT Python package (v1.0.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schiebinger et al. 2019</xref>) with a predefined starting cell set (E8.5 CM cells for tracing the CM trajectory, E7.5 EEM cells in the CM trajectory for tracing MJH trajectory, and E7.75 pharyngeal mesoderm cells in the CM trajectory for tracing the PSH trajectory), and cells of each trajectory are selected if WOT score &gt; 0.0001. To specifically distinguish between MJH and PSH, the difference in the WOT score of the two trajectories was calculated, and if the difference is greater than 0, it belongs to the MJH trajectory and vice versa to the PSH trajectory. The WOT package was used with default parameters as in the Waddington-OT online tutorial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/wot/tutorial/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/wot/tutorial/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Spatial mapping of single cells</title>
<p>Locations of mouse E7.0/7.5 mesodermal cells were inferred by comparison with the GEO-seq data, where each sample represents 5‚Äì40 cells with defined spatial locations. Transfer component analysis (TCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Pan et al. 2011</xref>) was performed to achieve shared representation of scRNA-seq and GEO-seq samples. Single cells were mapped to GEO-seq locations with the highest correlation coefficients.</p>

<title>Identification of pseudotime-dependent genes</title>
<p>Single-cell pseudotime trajectory analysis was performed using R package Monocle 2 (v2.22.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Trapnell et al. 2014</xref>) according to the online tutorials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/">http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/</ext-link>). Monocle object was directly constructed using Monocle implemented new Cell Data Set function from Seurat (v4.1.1) object, and Monocle implemented differentialGeneTest function was used to find highly variable genes for ordering. Based on these, we selected key and specific genes in MJH and PSH trajectory, respectively, and further visualized them in the heatmap using cell bin-by-gene matrix.</p>

<title>snRNA-seq data integration and label transfer</title>
<p>This research included data integration for the following datasets (dataset numbers in ‚ÄòData processing and quality control: snRNA-seq data‚Äô): (1) and (2) for comparison of the predicted trajectories and MJH cells; (1) and (3) for cell-type annotation of multiome single cells; (1) and (4) for cell-type annotation of Ctrl/<italic>Hand1</italic> CKO single cells. For multiome dataset, integration was performed by two steps: 1) whole embryo integration; 2) according to the predicted cell types of (1), mesoderm specific integration was done by selecting relevant cell types (NM, MM, EEM, Haem, PGC).</p>
<p>The integration and label transfer process follows the pipeline provided by Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hao et al. 2021</xref>): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_introduction.html">https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_introduction.html</ext-link>. 4,000 genes were selected for integration based on variable gene sets of individual datasets.

<title>Clustering analysis of snRNA-seq data</title>
<p>We performed clustering analysis for cells of the integrated mesodermal lineage. Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hao et al. 2021</xref>) function ‚ÄúFindNeighbors‚Äù and ‚ÄúFindClusters‚Äù were applied to the Top 20 principle compoments with the following parameter setting: annoy.metric = ‚Äúcosine‚Äù, resolution = 0.95.

<title>FHF and SHF gene signature scores</title>
<p>For each gene set, we defined the average z-score normalized expression levels as the signature score per cell.

<title>snATAC-seq data analysis</title>
<p>snATAC-seq bam files were combined for each cluster, C0-8, for identification of accessible elements (AE). AEs were then collected as a basic set of peak annotation. We used Snaptools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Fang et al. 2021</xref>) function ‚Äòadd_pmat‚Äô to generate a cell-by-peak matrix (pmat), where the value of each element represent the accessibility per cell per peak. Diffusion map followed by UMAP analysis was performed to generate the snATAC-seq version of 2D data visualization.</p>
<p>Cluster specific AEs were identified using SnapATAC function ‚ÄòfindDAR‚Äô. For analysis of C2-8 specific AEs, we used C1, which represents the least differentiated cell group, as the background cluster. For C0-1, we used cells from all other clusters as background. Cluster specific AEs were provided to HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Heinz et al. 2010</xref>) function ‚ÄòfindMotifsGenome.pl‚Äô for motif analysis, and to deepTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ramirez et al. 2016</xref>) for plotting heatmaps of ChIP-seq data.</p>

<title>Definition of enhancer regulated target genes</title>
<p>Enhancer-promoter (EP) pairs were predicted by SnapATAC function ‚ÄòpredictGenePeakPair‚Äô (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Fang et al. 2021</xref>). This method performs logistic regression using peak accessibility (snATAC-seq) and expression (snRNA-seq) of neighboring genes to identify EP links. Candicate EP pairs need to be less than 50kb apart. Cluster specific target genes were defined as EP-associated genes of cluster specific AEs. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using R package clusterProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wu et al. 2021</xref>) (‚ÄòcompareCluster‚Äô function, ontology was selected as ‚ÄòBP‚Äô).</p>

<title>Analysis of TF activity</title>
<p>We analyzed TF activity, defined as the relative accessibility of AEs containing the motif sequence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Schep et al. 2017</xref>) of a TF, using R package chromVAR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://greenleaflab.github.io/chromVAR/articles/Introduction.html">https://greenleaflab.github.io/chromVAR/articles/Introduction.html</ext-link>). SnapATAC-generated cell-by-peak matrices were converted to ‚ÄòSummarizedExperiment‚Äô format as the input of chromVAR. The TF activity is calculated by the ‚ÄòcomputeDeviations‚Äô function by comparing the accessibility of motif-containing AEs with background peaks with similar GC content. Genomic coordinates of motifs were acquired by the ‚ÄògetMatrixSet‚Äô function and R package ‚ÄòJASPAR2020‚Äô. Synergy scores between TF pairs were computed by the ‚ÄògetAnnotationSynergy‚Äô function.</p>

<title>Classification of activation modes of gene-enhancer pairs</title>
<p>We performed pseudotime trajectory analysis for E7.0 MJH trajectory (C0, C3, C7 and C8) in multiome using the abovementioned method. To further explore the underlying mesoderm developmental mechanism of enhancer clusters in regulating gene expression, we first built gene-enhancer pairs for preselected clusters based on snATAC-seq and snRNA-seq datasets. Secondly, we partitioned cells from E7.0 mesoderm lineage into pseudotime bins and calculated the cell bin-by-gene matrix of snRNA-seq and the cell bin-by-peak matrix of snATAC-seq, respectively. Finally, we divided activation modes of gene-enhancer pairs into three groups, fast, sync., and slow, according to the order of bins corresponding to their activation time.</p>

<title>Inference for URD lineage tree</title>
<p>To reconstruct branching developmental trajectory trees for E7.0 mesoendodermal cells (Ctrl and <italic>Hand1</italic> CKO), we used URD (v1.1.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Farrell et al. 2018</xref>). We used all cells assigned as epiblast as the root of the tree, and cells of clusters that contained the most differentiated cell-types at the latest pseudotime as the tips, where the CM branch was divided into MJH and PSH trajectories. By the movement of coordinates, the cells of Ctrl and <italic>Hand1</italic> KO are located on either side of the branch, respectively.</p>

<title>CRN construction and in silico KO</title>
<p>The CRNs based on multi-omics (scRNA + snATAC) data was constructed by SCENIC+ (v1.0.1) (ref) (details available via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scenicplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc_multiome_tutorial.html">https://scenicplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc_multiome_tutorial.html</ext-link>). CRN-based in-silico KO was conducted by SCENIC + module ‚Äúscenicplus.simulation‚Äù. In this step the expression level of a TF was set to zero and SCENIC + propagates the effect through CRN in an iterative manner to obtain the perturbed expression matrix. Cell-state transition vectors were generated and projected to the tSNE map using ‚Äúplot_perturbation_effect_in_embedding‚Äù function.</p>

<title>Cell nucleus segmentation</title>
<p>We employed the cellpose (V2.1.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Stringer et al. 2021</xref>)algorithm for segmentation of DAPI staining for embyo transverse sections. The pre-trained CP model (--pretrained_model CP) was used to obtain the masks of images. We used option ‚Äú--diameter 8‚Äù to resize the image to conform to the input parameters of the pre-trained model. We utilized the MorphoLibJ plugin of Fiji to obtain morphological metrics of the segmented nuclei. Finally, we utilized the VAA3D (2.938) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Peng et al. 2014</xref>) software to perform partitioning of the embryo, to identify cells belonging to the endoderm, mesoderm or epiblast.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors identified and described the transcriptional trajectories leading to CMs during early mouse development, and characterized the epigenetic landscapes that underlie early mesodermal lineage specification.</p>
<p>The authors identified two transcriptomic trajectories from a mesodermal population to cardiomyocytes, the MJH and PSH trajectories. These trajectories are relevant to the current model for the First Heart Field (FHF) and the Second Heart Field (SHF) differentiation. Then, the authors characterized both gene expression and enhancer activity of the MJH and PSH trajectories, using a multiomics analysis. They highlighted the role of Gata4, Hand1, Foxf1, and Tead4 in the specification of the MJH trajectory. Finally, they performed a focused analysis of the role of Hand1 and Foxf1 in the MJH trajectory, showing their mutual regulation and their requirement for cardiac lineage specification.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors performed an extensive transcriptional and epigenetic analysis of early cardiac lineage specification and differentiation which will be of interest to investigators in the field of cardiac development and congenital heart disease. The authors considered the impact of the loss of Hand1 and Foxf1 in-vitro and Hand1 in-vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors used previously published scRNA-seq data to generate two described transcriptomic trajectories.</p>
<p>(1) Details of the re-analysis step should be added, including a careful characterization of the different clusters and maker genes, more details on the WOT analysis, and details on the time stamp distribution along the different pseudotimes. These details would be important to allow readers to gain confidence that the two major trajectories identified are realistic interpretations of the input data.</p>
<p>The authors have also renamed the cardiac trajectories/lineages, departing from the convention applied in hundreds of papers, making the interpretation of their results challenging.</p>
<p>(2) The concept of &quot;reverse reasoning&quot; applied to the Waddington-OT package for directional mass transfer is not adequately explained. While the authors correctly acknowledged Waddington-OT's ability to model cell transitions from ancestors to descendants (using optimal transport theory), the justification for using a &quot;reverse reasoning&quot; approach is missing. Clarifying the rationale behind this strategy would be beneficial.</p>
<p>(3) As the authors used the EEM cell cluster as a starting point to build the MJH trajectory, it's unclear whether this trajectory truly represents the cardiac differentiation trajectory of the FHF progenitors:</p>
<p>
- This strategy infers that the FHF progenitors are mixed in the same cluster as the extra-embryonic mesoderm, but no specific characterization of potential different cell populations included in this cluster was performed to confirm this.</p>
<p>- The authors identified the EEM cluster as a Juxta-cardiac field, without showing the expression of the principal marker Mab21l2 per cluster and/or on UMAPs.</p>
<p>- As the FHF progenitors arise earlier than the Juxta-cardiac field cells, it must be possible to identify an early FHF progenitor population (Nkx2-5+; Mab21l2-) using the time stamp. It would be more accurate to use this FHF cluster as a starting point than the EEM cluster to infer the FHF cardiac differentiation trajectory.</p>
<p>These concerns call into question the overall veracity of the trajectory analysis, and in fact, the discrepancies with prior published heart field trajectories are noted but the authors fail to validate their new interpretation. Because their trajectories are followed for the remainder of the paper, many of the interpretations and claims in the paper may be misleading. For example, these trajectories are used subsequently for annotation of the multiomic data, but any errors in the initial trajectories could result in errors in multiomic annotation, etc, etc.</p>
<p>(4) As mentioned in the discussion, the authors identified the MJH and PSH trajectories as non-overlapping. But, the authors did not discuss major previously published data showing that both FHF and SHF arise from a common transcriptomic progenitor state in the primitive streak (DOI: 10.1126/science.aao4174; DOI: 10.1007/s11886-022-01681-w). The authors should consider and discuss the specifics of why they obtained two completely separate trajectories from the beginning, how these observations conflict with prior published work, and what efforts they have made at validation.</p>
<p>(5) Figures 1D and E are confusing, as it's unclear why the authors selected only cells at E7.0. Also, panels 1D 'Trajectory' and 'Pseudotime' suggest that the CM trajectory moves from the PSH cells to the MJH. This result is confusing, and the authors should explain this observation.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the PSH trajectory, it's unclear how the authors can obtain a full cardiac differentiation trajectory from the SHF progenitors as the SHF-derived cardiomyocytes are just starting to invade the heart tube at E8.5 (DOI: 10.7554/eLife.30668).</p>
<p>The above notes some of the discrepancies between the author's trajectory analysis and the historical cardiac development literature. Overall, the discrepancies between the author's trajectory analysis and the historical cardiac development literature are glossed over and not adequately validated.</p>
<p>(7) The authors mention analyzing &quot;activated/inhibited genes&quot; from Peng et al. 2019 but didn't specify when Peng's data was collected. Is it temporally relevant to the current study? How can &quot;later stage&quot; pathway enrichment be interpreted in the context of early-stage gene expression?</p>
<p>(8) Motif enrichment: cluster-specific DAEs were analyzed for motifs, but the authors list specific TFs rather than TF families, which is all that motif enrichment can provide. The authors should either list TF families or state clearly that the specific TFs they list were not validated beyond motifs.</p>
<p>(9) The core regulatory network is purely predictive. The authors again should refrain from language implying that the TFs in the CRN have any validated role.</p>
<p>Regarding the in vivo analysis of Hand1 CKO embryos, Figures 6 and 7:</p>
<p>(10) How can the authors explain the presence of a heart tube in the E9.5 Hand1 CKO embryos (Figure 6B) if, following the authors' model, the FHF/Juxta-cardiac field trajectory is disrupted by Hand1 CKO? A more detailed analysis of the cardiac phenotype of Hand1 CKO embryos would help to assess this question.</p>
<p>(11) The cell proportion differences observed between Ctrl and Hand1 CKO in Figure 6D need to be replicated and an appropriate statistical analysis must be performed to definitely conclude the impact of Hand1 CKO on cell proportions.</p>
<p>(12) The in-vitro cell differentiations are unlikely to recapitulate the complexity of the heart fields in-vivo, but they are analyzed and interpreted as if they do.</p>
<p>(13) The schematic summary of Figure 7F is confusing and should be adjusted based on the following considerations:</p>
<p>
(a) the 'Wild-type' side presents 3 main trajectories (SHF, Early HT and JCF), but uses a 2-color code and the authors described only two trajectories everywhere else in the article (aka MJH and PSH). It's unclear how the SHF trajectory (blue line) can contribute to the Early HT, when the Early HT is supposed to be FHF-associated only (DOI: 10.7554/eLife.30668). As mentioned previously in Major comment 3., this model suggests a distinction between FHF and JCF trajectories, which is not investigated in the article.</p>
<p>
(b) the color code suggests that the MJH (FHF-related) trajectory will give rise to the right ventricle and outflow tract (green line), which is contrary to current knowledge.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) How genes were selected to generate Figure 1F? Is this a list of top differentially expressed genes over each pseudotime and/or between pseudotimes?</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Figure 1G, it's unclear how inhibited signaling can have an increased expression of underlying genes over pseudotimes. Can the authors give more details about this analysis and results?</p>
<p>(3) How do the authors explain the visible Hand1 expression in Hand1 CKO in Figure S7C 'EEM markers'? Is this an expected expression in terms of RNA which is not converted into proteins?</p>
<p>(4) The authors do not address the potential presence of doublets (merged cells) within their newly generated dataset. While they mention using &quot;SCTransform&quot; for normalization and artifact removal, it's unclear if doublet removal was explicitly performed.</p>

<p>Summary of goals:</p>
<p>The aims of the study were to identify new lineage trajectories for the cardiac lineages of the heart, and to use computational and cell and animal studies to identify and validate new gene regulatory mechanisms involved in these trajectories.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study addresses the long-standing yet still not fully answered questions of what drives the earliest specification mechanisms of the heart lineages. The introduction demonstrates a good understanding of the relevant lineage trajectories that have been previously established, and the significance of the work is well described. The study takes advantage of several recently published data sets and attempts t use these in combination to uncover any new mechanisms underlying early mesoderm/cardiac specification mechanisms. A strength of the study is the use of an in vitro model system (mESCs) to assess the functional relevance of the key players identified in the computational analysis, including innovative technology such as CRISPR-guided enhancer modulations. Lastly, the study generates mesoderm-specific Hand1 LOF embryos and assesses the differentiation trajectories in these animals, which represents a strong complementary approach to the in vitro and computational analysis earlier in the paper. The manuscript is clearly written and the methods section is detailed and comprehensive.</p>
<p>Comments and Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall: The computational analysis presented here integrates a large number of published data sets with one new data point (E7.0 single cell ATAC and RNA sequencing). This represents an elegant approach to identifying new information using available data. However, the data presentation at times becomes rather confusing, and relatively strong statements and conclusions are made based on trajectory analysis or other inferred mechanisms while jumping from one data set to another. The cell and in vivo work on Hand1 and Foxf1 is an important part of the study. Some additional experiments in both of these model systems could strongly support the novel aspects that were identified by the computational studies leading into the work.</p>
<p>(1) Definition of MJH and PSH trajectory:</p>
<p>
The study uses previously published data sets to identify two main new differentiation trajectories: the MJH and the PSH trajectory (Figure 1). A large majority of subsequent conclusions are based on in-depth analysis of these two trajectories. For this reason, the method used to identify these trajectories (WTO, which seems a highly biased analysis with many manually chosen set points) should be supported by other commonly used methods such as for example RNA velocity analysis. This would inspire some additional confidence that the MJH and PSH trajectories were chosen as unbiased and rigorous as possible and that any follow-up analysis is biologically relevant.</p>
<p>(2) Identification of MJH and PSH trajectory progenitors:</p>
<p>
The study defines various mesoderm populations from the published data set (Figure 1A-E), including nascent mesoderm, mixed mesoderm, and extraembryonic mesoderm. It further assigns these mesoderm populations to the newly identified MJH/PSH trajectories. Based on the trajectory definition in Figure 1A it appears that both trajectories include all 3 mesoderm populations, albeit at different proportions and it seems thus challenging to assign these as unique progenitor populations for a distinct trajectory, as is done in the epigenetic study by comparing clusters 8 (MJH) and s (PSH)(Figure 2). Along similar lines, the epigenetic analysis of clusters 2 and 8 did not reveal any distinct differences in H3K4m1, H3K27ac, or H3K4me3 at any of the time points analyzed (Figure 2F). While conceptually very interesting, the data presented do not seem to identify any distinct temporal patterns or differences in clones 2 and 8 (Figure 2H), and thus don't support the conclusion as stated: &quot;the combined transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis further supported the early lineage segregation of MJH and the epigenetic priming at gastrulation stage for early cardiac genes&quot;.</p>
<p>(3) Function of Hand1 and Foxf1 during early cardiac differentiation:</p>
<p>
The study incorporated some functional studies by generating Hand1 and Foxf1 KO mESCs and differentiated them into mesoderm cells for RNA sequencing. These lines would present relevant tools to assess the role of Hand1 and Foxf1 in mesoderm formation, and a number of experiments would further support the conclusions, which are made for the most part on transcriptional analysis. For example, the study would benefit from quantification of mesoderm cells and subsequent cardiomyocytes during differentiation (via IF, or more quantitatively, via flow cytometry analysis). These data would help interpret any of the findings in the bulk RNAseq data, and help to assess the function of Hand1 and Foxf1 in generating the cardiac lineages. Conclusions such as &quot;the analysis indicated that HAND1 and FOXF1 could dually regulate MJH specification through directly activating the MJH specific genes and inhibiting PSH specific genes&quot; seem rather strong given the data currently provided.</p>
<p>(4) Analysis of Hand1 cKO embryos:</p>
<p>
Adding a mouse model to support the computational analysis is a strong way to conclude the study. Given the availability of these early embryos, some of the findings could be strengthened by performing a similar analysis to Figure 7B&amp;C and by including some of the specific EEM markers found to be differentially regulated to complement the structural analysis of the embryos.</p>
<p>(5) Current findings in the context of previous findings:</p>
<p>
The introduction carefully introduces the concept of lineage specification and different progenitor pools. Given the enormous amount of knowledge already available on Hand1 and Foxf1, and their role in specific lineages of the early heart, some of this information should be added, ideally to the discussion where it can be put into context of what the present findings add to the existing understanding of these transcription factors and their role in early cardiac specification.</p>

<p>(1) In Figure 1A, could the authors justify using E8.5 CMs as the endpoint for the second lineage and better clarify the chamber identities of the E8.5 CMs analysed? Why are the atrial genes in Figure 1C of the PSH trajectory not present in Table S1.1, which lists pseudotime-dependent genes for the MJH/PSH trajectories from Figure 1F?</p>
<p>(2) Could the authors increase the resolution of their trajectory and genomic analyses to distinguish between the FHF (Tbx5+ HCN4+) and the JCF (Mab21l2+/ Hand1+) within the MJH lineage? Also, clarify if the early extraembryonic mesoderm contributes to the FHF.</p>
<p>(3) The authors strongly assume that the juxta-cardiac field (JCF), defined by Mab21l2 expression at E7.5 in the extraembryonic mesoderm, contributes to CMs. Could the authors explain the evidence for this? Could the authors identify Mab21l2 expression in the left ventricle (LV) myocardium and septum transversum at E8.5 (see Saito et al., 2013, Biol Open, 2(8): 779-788)? If such a JCF contribution to CMs exists, the extent to which it influences heart development should be clarified or discussed.</p>
<p>(4) Could the authors distinguish the Hand1+ pericardium from JCF progenitors in their single-cell data and explain why they excluded other cell types, such as the endocardium/endothelium and pericardium, or even the endoderm, as endpoints of their trajectory analysis? At the NM and MM mesoderm stages, how did the authors distinguish the earliest cardiac cells from the surrounding developing mesoderm?</p>
<p>(5) Could the authors contrast their trajectory analysis with those of Lescroart et al. (2018), Zhang et al., Tyser et al., and Krup et al.?</p>
<p>(6) Previous studies suggest that Mesp2 expression starts at E8 in the presomitic mesoderm (Saga et al., 1997). Could the authors provide in situ hybridization or HCR staining to confirm the early E7 Mesp2 expression suggested by the pseudo-time analysis of the second lineage.</p>
<p>(7) Could the authors also confirm the complementary Hand1 and Lefty2 expression patterns at E7 using HCR or in situ hybridization? Hand1 expression in the first lineage is plausible, considering lineage tracing results from Zhang et al.</p>
<p>(8) Could the authors explain why Hand1 and Lefty2+ cells are more likely to be multipotent progenitors, as mentioned in the text?</p>
<p>(9) Could the authors comment on the low Mesp1 expression in the mesodermal cells (MM) of the MJH trajectory at E7 (Figure 1D)? Is Mesp1 transiently expressed early in MJH progenitors and then turned off by E7? Have all FHF/JCF/SHF cells expressed Mesp1?</p>
<p>(10) Could the authors clarify if their analysis at E7 comprises a mixture of embryonic stages or a precisely defined embryonic stage for both the trajectory and epigenetic analyses? How do the authors know that cells of the second lineage are readily present in the E7 mesoderm they analysed (clusters 0, 1, and 2 for the multiomic analysis)?</p>
<p>(11) Could the authors further comment on the active Notch signaling observed in the first and second lineages, considering that Notch's role in the early steps of endocardial lineage commitment, but not of CMs, during gastrulation has been previously described by Lescroart et al. (2018)?</p>
<p>(12) In cluster 8, Figure 2D, it seems that levels of accessibility in cluster 8 are relatively high for genes associated with endothelium/endocardium development in addition to MJH genes. Could the authors comment and/or provide further analysis?</p>
<p>(13) Can the authors clarify why they state that cluster 8 DAEs are primed before the full activation of their target genes, considering that Bmp4 and Hand1 peak activities seem to coincide with their gene expression in Figure 2G?</p>
<p>(14) Did the authors extend the multiomic analysis to Nanog+ epiblast cells at E7 and investigate if cardiac/mesodermal priming exists before mesodermal induction (defined by T/Mesp1 onset of expression)?</p>
<p>(15) In the absence of duplicates, it is impossible to statistically compare the proportions of mesodermal cell populations in Hand1 wild-type and knockout (KO) embryos or to assess for abnormal accumulation of PS, NM, and MM cells. Could the authors analyse the proportions of cells by careful imaging of Hand1 wild-type and KO embryos instead?</p>
<p>(16) Could the authors provide high-resolution images for Figure 7 B-C-D as they are currently hard to interpret?</p>
