<title>Abstract</title><p>Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity. <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form, which have distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor <italic>CcTRPM</italic> regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle. In this study, we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Firstly, we identified <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> as two typical subunits of Bursicon in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, which were regulated by low temperature (10°C) and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>. Subsequently, <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosyntheis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. In summary, these findings reveal the novel function of neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into insect Bursicon and its receptor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polyphenism is a fascinating phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity, where a single genome produces multiple distinct phenotypes in response to environmental cues (Simpson and Sword, 2011). In recent years, polyphenism has garnered increasing attention and has become a focal point of research in cutting-edge fields, such as ecology, evolutionary biology, epigenetics, and entomology. Nature presents us with numerous remarkable examples of polyphenism. For instance, we observe seasonal polyphenism in psylla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Butt and Stuart, 1986</xref>) and butterflies (Emily et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baudach and Vilcinskas, 2021</xref>), sexual and wing polyphenism in aphids and planthoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Shang et al., 2020</xref>), caste polyphenism in ants and honeybees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kucharski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonasio et al., 2012</xref>), sex determination in reptiles and fish regulated by temperature and social factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Janzen and Phillips, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), and environmentally induced polyphenism in plants (Gratani, 2014). Undoubtedly, polyphenism plays a major contributor to the population dynamics of insects worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Noor et al., 2008</xref>). Numerous studies have reported that insect polyphenism is influenced by a range of external environment factors, such as temperature, population density, photoperiod, and dietary nutrition (Simpson and Sword, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">An et al., 2012</xref>;). Additionally, internal neuro-hormones, including insulin, dopamine, and ecdysone, have been found to play crucial roles in insect polyphenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Uehara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>). However, the specific molecular mechanism underling polyphenism still require further clarification.</p>
<p><italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> (Yang &amp; Li) is a pear psylla belonging to Hemiptera order, which causes severe damage to trees and fruits in the major pear production areas across East Asian countries, including China and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hildebrand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). This phloem-sucking psylla inflicts harm on young shoots and leaves in both adult and nymph stages, leading to stunted and withered pear trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ge et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>C. chinensis</italic> secretes a substantial amount of honeydew and acts as a vector for plant pathogenic microorganisms, such as the phytoplasma of pear decline disease and <italic>Erwinia amovora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hildebrand et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, this pest demonstrates strong adaptability to its environment and exhibits seasonal polyphenism, manifesting as summer-form (SF) and winter-form (WF), which display significant differences in morphological characteristics throughout the seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). The summer-form has a lighter body color and causes more severe damage, while the winter-form, in contrast, has a brown to dark brown body color, a larger body size, and stronger resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tougeron et al., 2021</xref>). In a previous study, Zhang et al. demonstrated that a low temperature of 10°C and the temperature receptor <italic>CcTRPM</italic> regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by affecting cuticle thickness and chitin content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Up to now, no insect hormones or neuropeptides underling this seasonal polyphenism in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> have been identified.</p>
<p>Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, was initially discovered in the 1960s through neck-ligated assays. It serves a highly conserved function in insects by inducing the clerotization and melanization of the new cuticle in larvae and facilitating wing expansion in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dewey et al., 2004</xref>). Bursicon is a heterodimer neuropeptide composed of two subunits, Bursicon-α and Bursicon-β, which exert their effects through the leucine-rich repeats-containing G-protein-coupled receptor, also known as the Bursicon receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Luo et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, flies with mutated Bursicon receptor, such as the <italic>rk</italic> gene, or deficient in one of Bursicon subunits, exhibit improper tanning and altered body shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Luan et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, in the model insect <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, RNA interference experiments have demonstrated that the Bursicon receptor (<italic>Tcrk</italic>) is not only required for cuticle tanning, but also crucial for the development and expansion of integumentary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai and Palli, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, it has been reported that Bursicon homodimers can activate the NF-kB transcription factor <italic>Relish</italic>, leading to the induction of innate immune and stress genes during molting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">An et al., 2012</xref>). In cold environments, insects generally taken longer to complete their development than those of the same species raised in warmer conditions (Nyamaukondiwa et al., 2011). Consequently, insects exposed to cold conditions exhibit larger body size and darker cuticular melanization than those reared in warmer environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Shearer et al., 2016</xref>). Given this background, Bursicon and its receptor are expected to play a significant role in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are approximately 23 nucleotides in length and belong to a class of small noncoding RNAs, play a crucial role in the regulation of posttranscriptional gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lucas and Raikhel, 2013</xref>). Increasing studies have shown that miRNAs are important in insect polyphenism, such as miR-31, miR-9, and miR-252, as well as hormone signaling, for examples, miR-133 in dopamine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Shang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). However, there have been no reports on miRNAs targeting Bursicon and its receptor. Therefore, studying the molecular mechanism of miRNA regulation of the Bursicon receptor at the post-transcriptional level would be highly innovation. In this study, we conducted bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, and Western blot to identify two Bursicon subunits (<italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>) and their association with low temperature of 10°C. We then employed RNAi, cuticle staining, and transmission electron microscopy to study the effects of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> on cuticle content, cuticle thickness, and the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Furthermore, we identified <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> as the Bursicon receptor and investigated its role in the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, through <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, we discovered that miR-6012 targets <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and is involved in the seasonal polyphenism. These efforts not only shed light on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, but also enhance our understanding of the neuroendocrine basis of insect seasonal polyphenism.</p>

<title>Molecular identification of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> in <italic>C. chinensis</italic></title>
<p>Sequence analysis showed that the open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> (GenBank: OR488624) was 480 bp long, encoding a predicted polypeptide of 159 amino acids. The polypeptide had a molecular weight of 17.45 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point (<italic>pI</italic>) of 6.13. The complete ORF of <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> (GenBank: OR488625) was 405 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 134 amino acids residues. The predicated molecular weight of <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> was 15.21 kDa and a theoretical <italic>pI</italic> of 5.24. Amino acid sequence alignment analysis revealed that CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β shared high amino acid identity with homologs from other selected insect species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Both subunits contained eleven conserved cysteine residues, marked with red stars. Phylogenetic analysis (Figure S1A and S1B) indicated that <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> was most closely related to the <italic>DcBurs-α</italic> homologue (<italic>Diaphorina citri</italic>, XP_008468249.2), while <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> was most closely related to <italic>DcBurs-β</italic> (<italic>D. citri</italic>, AWT50591.1) among the selected species. The potential tertiary protein structure and molecular docking of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> were constructed using the Phyre<sup>2</sup> server and PyMOL-v1.3r1 software (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To investigate the identities of homodimer and heterodimer of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, SDS-PAGE with reduced and non-reduced gels was used. When expressed as individual subunits, they formed α+α and β+β homodimers, as the molecular size of α or β doubled in the non-reduced gel compared to the reduced gel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). When co-expressed, most α and β subunits formed the <italic>CcBurs-α+β</italic> heterodimer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>The temporal expression profile revealed that both <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> were ubiquitous in all developmental stages, with lower expression in eggs and nymphs and higher expression in adults of both summer-form and winter-form (Figure S2A-S2D). The mRNA levels of both <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> were higher in each developmental stage of the winter-form than in the summer-form, suggesting a potentially more important role in the winter-form. Spatially, <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> were detected in all investigated nymph tissues and were expressed most prominently in the head (Figure S2E and S2F). In addition to the midgut, both <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> showed higher expression in other selected tissues of the winter-form compared to the summer-form, especially in the head and cuticle. Results from temperature treatment exhibited that the mRNA expression of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> significantly increased after 10°C treatment for 3, 6, and 10 days compared to 25°C treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Meanwhile, qRT-PCR results indicated that the transcription levels of both <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> were noticeably down-regulated after successful knockdown of the temperature receptor <italic>CcTRPM</italic> by RNAi at 3, 6, and 10 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>, S3). These data suggest that <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> are regulated by a low temperature of 10°C and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>, and may serve as down-stream signals involved in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p>

<p>To investigate the role of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> in the transition from summer-form to winter-form of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, newly hatched 1st instar nymphs of summer-form were fed with dsCcBurs-α, dsCcBurs-β, or dsEGFP. qRT-PCR results exhibited that feeding dsCcBurs-α or dsCcBurs-β extremely reduced the expression of the target gene under 10°C condition. The RNAi efficiencies of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> were approximately 66-78% and 69-79% at 3, 6, and 10 days compared to dsEGFP feeding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).</p>

<p>After successful knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic>, <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, or both, the UV absorbance of total pigment extraction at a wavelength of 300 nm in dsCcBurs-α-treated (0.18), dsCcBurs-β-treated (0.19), and dsCcBurs-α+β-treated (0.07) nymphs was dramatically lower than that in dsEGFP-treated nymphs (0.85) under 10°C condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This finding indicates that <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> play a prominent role in cuticle pigment formation in the winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Moreover, both the results of cuticle chitin content determination and cuticle ultrastructure observation indicated that knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic>, <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, or both markedly reduced the cuticle chitin content (about 0.33, 0.32, 0.14) and cuticle thicknesses (about 1.44, 1.53, 0.73 μm) compared with dsEGFP-treated nymphs (1.00, 3.39 μm) under 10°C condition, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Interestingly, the results of pigmentation absorbance and cuticule thickness after <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> or <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> knockdown were similar to those after <italic>CcTRPM</italic> knockdown (Table S2). Additionally, dsCcBurs-α feeding (25.48%), dsCcBurs-β feeding (26.03%), or both feeding (11.84%) obviously decreased the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form compared to dsEGFP feeding (84.02%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the two subunits of Bursicon, <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, are essential for the transition from summer-form to winter-form of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by affecting cuticle contents and thickness.</p>

<p>To study the role of neuropeptide Bursicon in seasonal polyphenism, we identified a leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor and named it as Bursicon receptor <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> (GenBank: OR488626).

<p>Development expression pattern indicated that <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> had relatively lower levels of expression in eggs and nymphs, but extremely higher levels in adult stages (Figure S4A-B). The mRNA level of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> was higher in each developmental stage of winter-form than summer-form, suggesting its important role in the transition from summer-form to winter-form. In terms of tissue-specific expression, <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> was found to be present in all determined tissues, with relatively higher expression in five tissues (head, cuticle, midgut, wings, and foot) of winter-form than summer-form (Figure S4C). To confirm that <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> is the Bursicon receptor of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, we determined the effect of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> or <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> knockdown on its mRNA expression. qRT-PCR results showed that RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> or <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> significantly decreased <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression after dsRNA feeding at 3, 6, and 10 days compared to the dsEGFP group under 10°C condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>).

<p>To determine if miRNAs are involved in the regulation of Bursicon hormone in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, we amplified the 3’UTR of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and predicted relevant miRNAs.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Polyphenism is a conserved adaptive mechanism in species ranging from insects to mammalian, and evidence is mounting that it also extends to many nematode and fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Stockton et al., 2018</xref>; Yang and Pospisilik, 2019). Seasonal polyphenism can provide overwintering species with better adaptability to extreme climates through beneficial shifts in morphology, physiology, or behavior (Simpson and Sword, 2011). Physiological studies have shown that the neuroendocrine hormone system communicates environmental signals to facilitate downstream morphology and physiology transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zera and Denno, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Overgaard and MacMillan, 2017</xref>). Having a good model is extremely important for answering specific scientific questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhardwaj et al., 2020</xref>). To clarify the role of neuropeptide Bursicon in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, we identified two Bursicon subunits, <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, in this study. The SDS-PAGE results of non-reduced and reduced gels showed that <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> can form both homodimers (α+α or β+β) and a heterodimer (α+β) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Temporal expression patterns showed that <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> have very similar gradually increasing expression trends and higher expression in winter-form than summer-form (Figure S1C-1D), indicating that Bursicon may play a significant role in winter-form. This result is consistent with the report on gypsy moths, where transcript levels of <italic>Ldbursicon</italic> in adult stages were higher than in larvae (Zhang et al., 2022b). The transcript levels of both subunits were higher in the head and cuticle of winter-form compare to summer-form, implying a potential role of Bursicon in seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> (Figure S1E-1F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Luan et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As the transition of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> from summer-form to winter-form is regulated by a low temperature of 10°C and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>, we next determined the effect of 10°C treatment and <italic>CcTRPM</italic> RNAi on the expression of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>. As expected, 10°C treatment significantly increased the expression of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, while <italic>CcTRPM</italic> RNAi markedly decreased their mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). This is the first report on the relationship between the neuropeptide Bursicon and low temperature. Further results from RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic>, <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, or both showed that Bursicon prominently regulates the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by affecting cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). In many insects, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, Bursicon is believed to be the main hormone responsible for cuticle tanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Luo et al., 2005</xref>; Bai et al., 2010). However, knockdown of Bursicon subunits did not cause visible defects in cuticle sclerotisation or pigmentation of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> and <italic>Lymantria dispar</italic> adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; Zhang et al., 2022b). These researches indicate that Bursicon may not be necessary for cuticle tanning in all insects. Although the reactions involved in cuticle tanning are well-known, further studies are needed to understand how Bursicon mediates the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the role of the Bursicon signal in seasonal polyphenism, we identified the Bursicon receptor of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Temporal and spatial expression patterns of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> were very similar to those of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, and it also had higher expression in winter-form than summer-form (Figure S4). By comparing its expression profiles with those in other insects, we can conclude that the spatio-temporal expression of Bursicon receptor is related to the specificity of insect species. A recent study indicated that silencing of <italic>Burs-α</italic>, <italic>Burs-β</italic>, or its receptor significantly affected the reproduction of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (Bai et al., 2010). Knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic>, <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, or both obviously decreased the expression of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, while feeding the heterodimer protein of α+β fully rescued <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression after knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> together, which further confirmed the relationship between subunits and the receptor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). 10°C treatment clearly improved the expression of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, but <italic>CcTRPM</italic> RNAi sharply reduced its mRNA level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>). Notably, elimination of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> obviously affected cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness, leading to the failure of the transition from summer-form to winter-form (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). Feeding the α+β heterodimer protein fully rescued the defect in the transition percent and morphological phenotype after <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). Therefore, these findings strongly support our hypothesis that Bursicon and its receptor are essential for the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Actually, seasonal polyphenism is a complex process that may be regulated by multiple cascade reaction. Further studies are needed to clarify the regulatory mechanism of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p>
<p>In animals, miRNAs are essential for tissue development and behavioral evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lucas and Raikhel, 2013</xref>). Previous studies have reported that many miRNAs function upstream of the neurohormone signaling pathway in insect polyphenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Suderman et al., 2006</xref>). For example, miR-133 controls behavioral aggregation by targeting the dopamine synthesis gene in Locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), and miR-9b targets insulin receptor to mediate dimorphism and wing development in aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we identified miR-6012 as a regulator of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in the Bursicon hormone signaling pathway for the first time. We found that miR-6012 was inhibited by a low temperature of 10 °C and targeted <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> by binding to its 3’UTR. When nymphs were treated with agomir-6012, they exhibited lower cuticle pigment content, reduced cuticle chitin content, and thinner cuticle thickness compared to the agomir-NC control under 10 °C condition. In addition, agomir-6012 treatment markedly decreased the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form and affected the morphological phenotype compared to the control. The significantly decreased in <italic>CcTre1</italic> and <italic>CcCHS1</italic> expression after agomir-6012 treatment suggested that miR-6012 also functions as the up-stream regulator of chitin biosynthesis signaling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study uncovered a novel role of Bursicon and its receptor in regulating the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, in addition to their known functions in cuticle-hardening of larvae and wing expansion of adults. In <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, we proposed a molecular working model to describe this novel mechanism. Under 10 °C condition, Bursicon signaling pathway is first activated in the head of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by low temperature and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>. Then, <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> form a heterodimeric neuropeptide that acts on its receptor <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> to mediate the transition from summer-form to winter-form by affecting cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness. Moreover, miR-6012 targets <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> to modulate the function of Bursicon signaling pathway in this seasonal polyphenism. As a result, the 1st instar nymphs of summer-form develop into 3rd instar nymphs of winter-form to better adapt to low-temperature adversity. Future research will focus on: (1) studying the combined effect of Bursicon with other neuro-hormones on the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, (2) identifying the down-stream signaling of Bursicon in mediating this phenomenon through multi-omics and RNAi approaches.</p>

<caption><title>Schematic model of the novel functions of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> in response to low temperature.</title><p>Under 10°C condition, low temperature significantly upregulated the expression of Bursicon signaling pathway. <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> then formed a heterodimeric neuropeptide to activate their receptor <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, which mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by acting on the chitin biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, low temperature inhibited the expression of miR-6012, relieving its inhibitory effects on <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>. miR-6012 directly targeted <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, contributing to the novel function of Bursicon signaling in seasonal polyphenism.

<title>Insect rearing</title>
<p><italic>C. chinensis</italic> populations of summer-form and winter-form were collected in June and December 2018, respectively, from pear orchards in Daxing, Beijing, China. The nymphs and adults of summer-form were reared on host plants in a greenhouse under condition of 25 ± 1°C, a photoperiod of 12L:12D, and a relative humidity of 65 ± 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Meanwhile, the nymphs and adults of winter-form were reared at 10 ± 1°C with a photoperiod of 12L:12D and a relative humidity of 25 ± 5% in an artificial incubator. Unless otherwise specified, the photoperiod of all subsequent treatments was 12L: 12D. Korla fragrant pear seedlings, 2-3 years old with a height of 50-80 cm, were used as host plants and received conventional water and fertilizer management.</p>

<title>Gene identification and sequence analysis</title>
<p>From the transcriptome database of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, we obtained the predicted sequences of Bursicon subunits and its receptor.

<title>Bursicon protein expression and determination</title>
<p>To express the Bursicon proteins in HEK293T cells, we first inserted the ORF sequences of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> or <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> into the modified vector pcDNA3.1-his-P2A-mCherry to construct the recombinant vectors of pcDNA3.1-CcBurs-α-his-P2A-mCherry and pcDNA3.1-CcBurs-β-his-P2A-mCherry using the <italic>pEASY</italic>-Basic Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (Cat# CU201, TransGen, Beijing, China) (Table S1).

<title>qRT-PCR for mRNA and miRNA</title>
<p>Samples for the temporal expression profile were collected at different developmental stages of summer-form and winter-form, including egg; nymphs of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th instar; and adults of the 1st, 3rd, and 7th day. For the tissue expression pattern, six types of tissue (head, cuticle, midgut, fat body, wings, and foot) were dissected from both summer-form and winter-form of 5th instar nymphs. To examine the effect of different temperatures treatments on the expression of mRNAs and miRNAs, the newly hatched 1st instar nymphs of summer-form were treated at 25°C and 10°C, respectively. Samples were collected on the 3rd, 6th, and 10th day after different temperatures treatments. For the effect of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> knockdown on the transcription level of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic>, <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, and <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> under 10°C conditions, the newly hatched 1st instar nymphs of summer-form were fed with <italic>CcTRPM</italic> dsRNA, and the samples were collected on the 3rd, 6th, and 10th day after dsRNA feeding. Each sample was performed in three replications, with approximately 100 individuals for each replication of egg samples and at least 50 insects were included for each nymph or adult sample. All samples were immediately stored at –80°C for total RNA extraction.</p>
<p>Total RNAs were isolated from the above <italic>C. chinensis</italic> samples using TRNzol Universal (Cat# DP424, TIANGEN, Beijing, China) and miRcute miRNA isolation kit (Cat# DP501, TIANGEN, Beijing, China) for mRNA and miRNA, respectively, based on the manufacturer’ protocol. The first-strand cDNA of mRNA or mature miRNA was synthesized from 500 ng or 1 μg of total RNAs using PrimeScript<sup>™</sup> RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Cat# RR047A, Takara, Kyoto, Japan) or miRcute Plus miRNA First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Cat# KR211, TIANGEN, Beijing, China) according to the instruction manual. The relative gene expression was quantified using TB Green<sup>®</sup> <italic>Premix Ex Taq</italic><sup>™</sup> II (Tli RNaseH Plus) (Cat# RR820A, Takara, Kyoto, Japan) or miRcute Plus miRNA qPCR Detection Kit (Cat# FP411, TIANGEN, Beijing, China) in a total 20 μL reaction mixture on a CFX96 Connect<sup>TM</sup> Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The conditions were as follows: denaturation for 3 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 10s, and then 60°C for 30s. <italic>Ccβ-actin</italic> (GenBank accession number: OQ658571) or U6 snRNA was used as the internal reference gene for qRT-PCR in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). To check for specificity, melting curves were analyzed for each data point (Figure S2-S5).

<title>dsRNA synthesis and RNAi experiments</title>
<p>The synthesis of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the stem-leaf device for dsRNA feeding were conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, MEGAscript™ RNAi kit (AM1626, Ambion, California, USA) was used to synthesize dsRNA in vitro using primers ligated with T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequences at both ends (Table S1). The dsRNAs were further purified with the phenol/chloroform method, air dried, dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated nuclease-free water, and stored at –80°C for later used. The purity and concentration of dsRNA were measured using ultraviolet spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p>For RNAi experiments, newly hatched 1st instar nymphs of summer-form were fed with dsRNAs (500 ng/μL) targeting different genes and then divided into three groups. (1) Samples were collected at 3, 6, and 10 d after dsRNAs feeding under 10°C condition for the RNAi efficiency analysis and gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR. (2) Nymph samples were collected at 12-15 d after dsRNA feeding for total cuticle pigment analysis, comparison of cuticle ultrastructure, cuticle chitin staining with WGA-FITC, and determination of cuticle chitin content under 10°C condition using the following methods. (3) Morphological characteristics were observed every two days, and the number of summer-form and winter-form individuals was counted until the 3rd instar under 10°C condition, following the previous description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>miRNA prediction and target validation with <italic>CcBurs-R</italic></title>
<p>To study the post-translation function of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, the 3’UTR sequence of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> was amplified using the specific primers (Table S1) and the 3’-Full RACE Core Set with PrimeScript RTase kit (Cat# 6106, Takara, Kyoto, Japan). Two software programs, miRanda and Targetscan, were employed to predict miRNAs targeting <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, following previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). The following methods were used to validate the target relationship between miRNAs and <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> luciferase reporter gene assays: The full sequence of the 3’UTR or 3’UTR sequence with binding sites removed from <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> was amplified and inserted downstream of the luciferase gene in the pmirGLO vector (Promega, Wisconsin, USA) to construct recombinant plasmids. Agomir-6012 and antagomir-6012, chemically synthesized and modified RNA oligos with the same sequence or anti-sense oligonucleotides of miR-6012, were obtained from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). Agomir-NC and antagomir-NC, provided by the manufacture, were used as negative controls. Approximate 500 ng of the recombinant plasmid and 275 nM of agomir were co-transfected into HEK293T cells using the Calcium Phosphate Cell Transfection Kit (Cat# C0508, Beyotime, Nanjing, China). After 24 h of co-transfection, the activity of the luciferase enzymes was determined following the protocol of Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Cat# E1910, Promega, Wisconsin, USA).</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assay (RIP): The RIP assay was performed using the Magna RIP Kit (Cat# 17–704, Merck, Millipore, Germany) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Fifty nymphs were collected after feeding with agomir-6012 or agomir-NC for 24 h, and crushed with an auto homogenizer in ice-cold RIP lysis buffer. Magnetic beads were incubated with 5 μg of Ago-1 antibody (Merck, Millipore, Germany) or IgG antibody (Merck, Millipore, Germany) to form a magnetic bead-antibody complex. The target mRNAs were pulled down by the magnetic bead-antibody complex from the supernatants in the RIP lysates. The immunoprecipitated RNAs were released by digestion with protease K and quantification of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and miR-6012. Each experiment had six replicates.</p>
<p>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH): The antisense nucleic acid probes for <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> (5’-GCGCUUGUGCUGCUUCUGCU-3’) were labeled with FAM, and miR-6012 (5’-UGACCGACUAGAGUAGCGGCUU-3’) was labeled with FITC (GenePharma, Shanghai, China). In short, nymph samples at different stages were immersed in Carnoy’s fixative for 24-48 h at room temperature. After washing and decolorization, the samples were pre-hybridized three times using the hybridization buffer without the probes keep in dark. For co-localization, two fluorescent probes (1 μM) were combined to hybridize the samples for about 12 h in the dark. DAPI (1 μg/mL) was used to stain cell nuclei. The signals were observed and the images were recorded using a Leica SP8 confocal microscopy (Weztlar, Germany). To exclude false positive, RNAi-treated samples or no-probe samples were used as negative controls.</p>

<title>Analysis of total cuticle pigment and cuticle chitin contents</title>
<p>To compare the difference in cuticle contents between summer-form and winter-form nymphs, the total cuticle pigment and cuticle chitin contents were determined. For the measurement of total cuticle pigment, the cuticle of dsRNA-treated nymphs were dissected and treated with acidified methanol (with 1% concentrated hydrochloric acid). The cuticle tissues were then pestled and placed in a thermostatic oscillator at 200 rpm for 24 h under 25°C condition. The total pigment extraction was obtained after filtering and centrifuging the supernatants through a 0.45 μm filter membrane. The UV absorbance of the total pigment extraction at different wavelengths was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).</p>
<p>For the analysis of cuticle chitin content, WGA-FITC staining was conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Xie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, nymph samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to a gradient concentration dehydration with sucrose solution (10%, 20%, 30%). The dehydrated samples were then embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Cat# 4583, SAKURA, Ningbo, China) after the pre-embedding stages at –25°C. Ultra-thin sections (approximately 70 nm thickness) of the embedded material were cut using a Leica freezing ultra-cut microtome (CM1850, Leica, Weztlar, Germany). The sections were stained with WGA-FITC (50 μg/mL) and DAPI (10 μg/mL) for 15 min, followed by rinsing three times with sterile PBS buffer. Fluorescence images were acquired using a Leica SP8 confocal microscopy (Weztlar, Germany). To further quantify the cuticle chitin content, a chitin Elisa kit (Cat# YS80663B, Yaji Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was used according to the previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

In short, nymph samples without heads were fixed in 4% polyformaldehyde (PFA) for 48 h, followed by post-fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 h. The samples were then dehydrated in a standard ethanol/acetone series, infiltrated, and embedded in spurr medium. Subsequently, superthin sections (−70 nm) of the thorax were cut and stained with 5% uranyl acetate followed by Reynolds’ lead citrate solution.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bursicon is a key hormone regulating cuticle tanning in insects. While the molecular mechanisms of its function are rather well studied--especially in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster, its effects and functions in different tissues are less well understood. Here, the authors show that bursicon and its receptor play a role in regulating aspects of the seasonal polyphenism of Cacopsylla chinensis. They found that low temperature treatment activated the bursicon signaling pathway during the transition from summer form to winter form and affect cuticle pigment and chitin content, and cuticle thickness. In addition, the authors show that miR-6012 targets the bursicon receptor, CcBurs-R, thereby modulating the function of bursicon signaling pathway in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. This discovery expands our knowledge of the roles of neuropeptide bursicon action in arthropod biology.</p>
<p>However, the study falls short of its claim that it reveals the molecular mechanisms of a seasonal polyphenism. While cuticle tanning is an important part of the pear psyllid polyphenism, it is not the equivalent of it. First, there are other traits that distinguish between the two morphs, such as ovarian diapause (Oldfield, 1970), and the role of bursicon signaling in regulating these aspects of polyphenism were not measured. Thus, the phenotype in pear psyllids, whereby knockdown bursicon reduces cuticle tanning seems to simply demonstrate the phenotypes of Drosophila mutants for bursicon receptor (Loveall and Deitcher, 2010, BMC Dev Biol) in another species (Fig. 2I, 4H). Second, the study fails to address the threshold nature of cuticular tanning in this species, although it is the threshold response (specifically, to temperature and photoperiod) that distinguishes this trait as a part of a polyphenism. Whereas miR-6012 was found to regulate bursicon expression, there no evidence is provided that this microRNA either responds to or initiates a threshold response to temperature. In principle, miR-6012 could regulate bursicon whether or not it is part of a polyphenism. Thus, the impact of this work would be significantly increased if it could distinguish between seasonal changes of the cuticle and a bona fide reflection of polyphenism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study convincingly identifies homologs of the genes encoding the bursicon subunits and its receptor, showing an alignment with those of another psyllid as well as more distant species. It also demonstrates that the stage- and tissue-specific levels of bursicon follow the expected patterns, as informed by other insect models, thus validating the identity of these genes in this species. They provide strong evidence that the expression of bursicon and its receptor depend on temperature, thereby showing that this trait is regulated through both parts of the signaling mechanism.</p>
<p>Several parallel measurements of the phenotype were performed to show the effects of this hormone, its receptor, and an upstream regulator (miR-6012), on cuticle deposition and pigmentation (if not polyphenism per se, as claimed). Specifically, chitin staining and TEM of the cuticle qualitatively show difference between controls and knockdowns, and this is supported by some statistical tests of quantitative measurements (although see comments below). Thus, this study provides strong evidence that bursicon and its receptor play an important role in cuticle deposition and pigmentation in this psyllid.</p>
<p>The study identified four miRNAs which might affect bursicon due to sequence motifs. By manipulating levels of synthetic miRNA agonists, the study successfully identified one of them (miR-6012) to cause a cuticle phenotype. Moreover, this miRNA was localized (by FISH) to the cuticle, body-wide. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstrated function for this miRNA, and this study provides a good example of using a gene of known function as an entry point to discovering others influencing a trait. Thus, this finding reveals another level of regulation of cuticle formation in insects.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The introduction to this manuscript does not accurately reflect progress in the field of mechanisms underlying polyphenism (e.g., line 60). There are several models for polyphenism that have been used to uncover molecular mechanisms in at least some detail, and this includes seasonal polyphenisms in Hemiptera. Therefore, the justification for this study cannot be predicated on a lack of knowledge, nor is the present study original or unique in this line of research (e.g., as reviewed by Zhang et al. 2019; DOI: 10.1146/annurev-ento-011118-112448). The authors are apparently aware of this, because they even provide other examples (lines 104-108); thus the introduction seems misleading as framed.</p>
<p>(2) The data in Figure 2H show &quot;percent of transition.&quot; However, the images in 2I show insects with tanned cuticle (control) vs. those without (knockdown). Yet, based on the description of the Methods provided, there appears to be no distinction between &quot;percent of transition&quot; and &quot;percent with tanning defects&quot;. This an important distinction to make if the authors are going to interpret cuticle defects as a defect in the polyphenism. Furthermore, there is no mention of intermediate phenotypes. The data in 2H are binned as either present or absent, and these are the phenotypes shown in 2I. Was the phenotype really an all-or-nothing response? Instead of binning, which masks any quantitative differences in the tanning phenotypes, the authors should objectively quantify the degree of tanning and plot that. This would show if and to what degree intermediate tanning phenotypes occurred, which would test how bursicon affects the threshold response. This comment also applies to the data in Figures 4G and 6G. Since cuticle tanning is present in more insect than just those with seasonal polyphenism, showing how this responds as a threshold is needed to make claims about polyphenism.</p>
<p>(3) This study also does not test the threshold response of cuticle phenotypes to levels of bursicon, its receptor, or miR-6012. Hormone thresholds are the most widespread and, in most systems where polyphenism has been studied, the defining characteristic of a polyphenism (e.g., Nijhout, 2003, Evol Dev). Quantitative (not binned) measurements of a polyphenism marker (e.g., chitin) should be demonstrated to result as a threshold titer (or in the case of the receptor, expression level) to distinguish defects in polyphenism from those of its component trait.</p>
<p>(4) Cuticle issue:</p>
<p>
(a) Unlike Fig. 6D and F, Figs. 2D and F do not correspond to each other. Especially the lack and reduction of chitin in ds-a+b! By fluorescence microscopy there is hardly any signal, whereas by TEM there is a decent cuticle. Additionally, the dsGFP control cuticle in 2D is cut obliquely with a thick and a thin chitin layer. This is misleading.</p>
<p>
(b) In Figs. 2F and 3F, the endocuticle appears to be missing, a portion of the procuticle that is produced post-molting. As tanning is also occurring post-molting, there seems to be a general problem with cuticle differentiation at this time point. This may be a timing issue. Please clarify.</p>
<p>
(c) To provide background information, it would be useful analyze cuticle formation in the summer and winter morphs of controls separately by light and electron microscopy. More baseline data on these two morphs is needed.</p>
<p>
(d) For the TEM study, it is not clear whether the same part of the insect's thorax is being sectioned each time, or if that matters. There is not an obvious difference in the number of cuticular layers, but only the relative widths of those layers, so it is difficult to know how comparable those images are. This raises two questions that the authors should clarify. First, is it possible that certain parts of the thoracic cuticle, such as those closer to the intersegmental membrane, are naturally thinner than other parts of the body? Second, is the tanning phenotype based on the thickness or on the number of chitin layers, or both? The data shown later in Figure 4I, J convincingly shows that the biosynthesis pathway for chitin is repressed, but any clarification of what this might mean for deposition of chitin would help to understand the phenotypes reported. Also, more details on how the data in Fig. 2G were collected would be helpful. This also goes for the data in Fig. 4 (bursicon receptor knockdowns).</p>
<p>(5) Tissue issue:</p>
<p>
The timed experiments shown in all figures were done in whole animals. However, we know from Drosophila that Bursicon activity is complex in different tissues. There is, thus, the possibility, that the effects detected on different days in whole animals are misleading because different tissues--especially the brain and the epidermis, may respond differentially to the challenge and mask each other's responses. The animal is small, so the extraction from single tissue may be difficult. However, this important issue needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>(6) No specific information is provided regarding the procedure followed for the rescue experiments with burs-α and burs-β (How were they done? Which concentrations were applied? What were the effects?). These important details should appear in the Materials and Methods and the Results sections.</p>
<p>(7) Pigmentation</p>
<p>
(a) The protocol used to assess pigmentation needs to be validated. In particular, the following details are needed: Were all pigments extracted? Were pigments modified during extraction? Were the values measured consistent with values obtained, for instance, by light microscopy (which should be done)?</p>
<p>
(b) In addition, pigmentation occurs post-molting; thus, the results could reflect indirect actions of bursicon signaling on pigmentation. The levels of expression of downstream pigmentation genes (ebony, lactase, etc) should be measured and compared in molting summer vs. winter morphs.</p>
<p>(8) L236: &quot;while the heterodimer protein of CcBurs α+β could fully rescue the effect of CcBurs-R knockdown on the transition percent (Figure 4G 4H)&quot;. This result seems contradictory. If CcBurs-R is the receptor of bursicon, the heterodimer protein of CcBurs α+β should not be able to rescue the effect of CcBurs-R knockdown insects. How can a neuropeptide protein rescue the effect when its receptor is not there! If these results are valid, then the CcBurs-R would not be the (sole) receptor for CcBurs α+β heterodimer. This is a critical issue for this manuscript and needs to be addressed (also in L337 in Discussion).</p>
<p>(9) Fig. 5D needs improvement (the magnification is poor) and further explanation and discussion. mi6012 and CcBurs-R seem to be expressed in complementary tissues--do we see internal tissues also (see problem under point 2)? Again, the magnification is not high enough to understand and appreciate the relationships discussed.</p>
<p>(10) The schematic in Fig. 7 is a useful summary, but there is a part of the logic that is unsupported by the data, specifically in terms of environmental influence on cuticle formation (i.e., plasticity). What is the evidence that lower temperatures influence expression of miR-6012? The study measures its expression over life stages, whether with an agonist or not, over a single temperature. Measuring levels of expression under summer form-inducing temperature is necessary to test the dependence of miR-6012 expression on temperature. Otherwise, this result cannot be interpreted as polyphenism control, but rather the control of a specific trait.</p>
