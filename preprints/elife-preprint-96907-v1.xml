<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by incomplete vascularization of the peripheral retina and associated symptoms that can lead to vision loss. However, the underlying genetic causes of approximately 50% of FEVR cases remain unknown. Here, we report two heterozygous variants, c.88C&gt;T (p.Arg30Ter) and c.247C&gt;T (p.Leu83Phe), in calcyphosine like (<italic>CAPSL</italic>), from four patients in two unrelated FEVR-affected families. Both variants exhibited compromised CAPSL protein expression. Vascular endothelial cell-specific inactivation of <italic>Capsl</italic> in postnatal mice resulted in defective sprouting, delayed radial/vertical vascular progression, compromised endothelial proliferation, and impaired cell migration, recapitulating the human FEVR phenotypes. <italic>CAPSL</italic>-depleted human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs) exhibited impaired tube formation, decreased cell proliferation, disrupted cell polarity establishment and filopodia/lamellipodia formation, as well as disrupted collective cell migration <italic>in vitro</italic>. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of <italic>CAPSL</italic>-depleted HRECs revealed that <italic>CAPSL</italic> abolition inhibited the MYC signaling axis, in which the expression of core MYC targeted genes were profoundly decreased. Furthermore, a combined analysis of <italic>CAPSL</italic>-depleted HRECs and <italic>c-MYC</italic>-depleted human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) uncovered similar transcription patterns. Collectively, this study reports a novel FEVR-associated candidate gene, <italic>CAPSL</italic>, which provides invaluable information for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis of FEVR. This study also reveals that compromised CAPSL function causes FEVR through MYC axis, shedding light on the potential involvement of MYC signaling in the pathogenesis of FEVR.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A well-organized vascular system is crucial for the proper development of most tissue and organ morphogenesis<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup>. Consequently, angiogenic defects have been associated with several congenital human diseases<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]</sup>. Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a heritable vitreoretinopathy characterized by defective retinal angiogenesis and various complications, such as extensive neovascularization, exudation, retinal folds and detachments, and vision loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Based on an ocular screening of over sixty thousand Chinese newborns, the estimated prevalence of FEVR is around 0.46%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Due to the significant genetic heterogeneity, FEVR displays all Mendelian forms of inheritance: autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), or X-linked recessive (XR)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]</sup>. To date, mutations in 17 genes and 1 locus have been identified to cause FEVR, including Norrin (<italic>NDP</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, frizzled 4 (<italic>FZD4</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 (<italic>LRP5</italic>)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup>, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (<italic>LRP6</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, tetraspanin-12 (<italic>TSPAN12</italic>)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]</sup>, α-catenin (<italic>CTNNA1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, β-catenin (<italic>CTNNB1</italic>)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]</sup>, p120-catenin (<italic>CTNND1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, zinc finger protein 408 (<italic>ZNF408</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, kinesin family member 11 (<italic>KIF11</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, atonal homolog 7 (<italic>ATOH7</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, exudative vitreoretinopathy 3 (<italic>EVR3</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, integrin-linked kinase (<italic>ILK</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, jagged canonical Notch ligand 1 (<italic>JAG1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 1 (<italic>DLG1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (<italic>TGFBR2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, sorting nexin 31 (<italic>SNX31</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and ER membrane protein complex subunit 1 (<italic>EMC1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, these mutations can explain only approximately 50% of FEVR cases<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Calcyphosine like (<italic>CAPSL</italic>) is a protein-coding gene whose function remains elusive. In 2019, Julia Schreml pointed out that <italic>CAPSL</italic> is a promising candidate gene for multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL), a rare adipose tissue disorder of largely unknown etiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which CAPSL regulates cell processes and signaling cascades have yet to be elucidated.</p>
<p><italic>MYC</italic> gene family is one of the most widely investigated cancer-causing genes, being implicated in the formation, maintenance, and progression of several different cancer types, such as breast cancer, lymphoma, and prostatic cancer<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]</sup>. <italic>c-MYC</italic> is a master regulator in MYC signaling, which participates in cell metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The important role of <italic>c-Myc</italic> in vascularization and angiogenesis during tumor development has already been reported in mouse models<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]</sup>. Vascular endothelial cell (EC)-specific knockout of <italic>c-Myc</italic> in mice leads to impaired vascular expansion, thinned and poorly branched vascular, and reduced endothelial proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Conversely, EC-specific <italic>c-Myc</italic> over-expression caused sustained vascular outgrowth, increased endothelial cell proliferation, and vessel density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. These studies indicate that c-MYC is a regulating factor in coordinating endothelial cell behavior and vessel development.</p>
<p>In the current study, from a large cohort of FEVR patients, we identified a missense mutation and a stop-gain mutation in the <italic>CAPSL</italic> gene from four FEVR patients by whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis. Furthermore, the endothelial cell (EC)-specific <italic>Capsl</italic> knockout mouse model exhibited FEVR-like retinal vascular defects, emphasizing the indispensable role of <italic>Capsl</italic> for the retinal vascular architecture. Knockdown of <italic>CAPSL</italic> led to compromised proliferation of stalk ECs and retarded migration of tip ECs by regulating the MYC signaling axis. Collectively, this study not only identifies <italic>CAPSL</italic> as a candidate gene for FEVR, but also presents that a compromised MYC signaling axis might constitute a previously unrecognized factor contributing to FEVR.</p>

<title>WES analysis revealed two CAPSL variants in FEVR patients</title>
<p>To evaluate the causative variants that account for FEVR, we applied WES on genomic DNA samples from FEVR families. Sanger sequencing was further applied to validate the variants and genotype-phenotype co-segregation analysis. Thus, two novel candidate variants in the <italic>CAPSL</italic> gene (NM_144647) were identified in patients with FEVR, and the variants were predicted to be pathogenic by Mutation taster, Polyphen-2, and PROVEAN (Table S1). In family 3036, a heterozygous c.88C&gt;T (p.R30X) variant was identified in an infant (age 0-5 years old) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). His father was a heterozygous carrier and manifested vascular defects in the retina, including peripheral neovascularization area and leakage by fundus fluorescein angiography, whereas the wild-type mother showed normal vision (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B and D</xref>). The affected amino acid is highly conserved among different species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The proband (II:1) in the 3104 family has been diagnosed with FEVR and identified with a heterozygous variant c.247C&gt;T (p.L83F) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). His father has also been identified as a carrier of this heterozygous variant, manifested with FEVR symptoms, according to the medical records.</p>

<p>To determine the pathogenesis of <italic>CAPSL</italic> variants for FEVR, we first investigated the effect of variants on the expression of <italic>CAPSL</italic>. Wild-type and mutant coding sequences of <italic>CAPSL</italic> were introduced to the GFP-tagged pcDNA3.1 vector, and an IRES2 box was inserted to prevent the fusion expression of CAPSL and GFP. Immunoblot analysis of cells transfected with plasmids revealed that the CAPSL<italic>-</italic>R30X protein was undetectable, and the L83F variant resulted in a considerably reduced protein level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref> and F). Conversely, neither variant influenced the mRNA levels of <italic>CAPSL</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1G</xref>). Thus, these variants may cause FEVR by impairing CAPSL expression.</p>

<title>Depletion of Capsl in vascular endothelial cells caused FEVR-liked phenotypes</title>
<p>We, generated an inducible endothelial (EC)-specific <italic>Capsl</italic>-knockout mouse by breeding mice carrying a loxp-flanked allele of <italic>Capsl</italic> with tamoxifen-inducible <italic>Pdgfb-iCreER</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> transgenic animals to determine whether depletion of <italic>Capsl</italic> in mouse endothelial cells could cause FEVR-like phenotypes (Fig.S1A). <italic>Capsl<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic>, <italic>Pdgfb-CreER</italic> mice (hereafter named <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic>) and their control littermates (<italic>Capsl<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic> and <italic>Pdgfb-CreER</italic>, hereafter named Ctrl) were induced by consecutive intraperitoneal injection of 50 µg tamoxifen per pup at postnatal day 1 (P1) to P3 before sacrifice (Fig.S1B and C). <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> mice showed indistinguishable overall appearance compared to their Ctrl littermates. The efficiency of EC-specific deletion of <italic>Capsl</italic> was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis of P35 mouse lung tissues (Fig.S1D). The results showed a pronounced reduction in CAPSL expression, at both mRNA and protein levels, in <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> mice compared to Ctrl littermates.</p>
<p>To assess the role of <italic>CAPSL</italic> in the growth and patterning of retinal vasculature, we employed flat-mount analysis to visualize the retinal vessels at different postnatal ages. As expected, the radial vascular growth, as well as vessel density and vascular branching, are dramatically reduced in P5 <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> retina relative to Ctrl mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref> and D-F). The number of retinal vascular tip cells, which leads EC migration toward high VEGFA by extending filopodia at the angiogenic front<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, was considerably decreased and sparsely distributed in <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> retinae compared to that of control littermates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>-C and G-H).</p>

<p>The onset of mouse retinal vascular development occurs postnatally at P0, coinciding with the regression of the hyaloid vasculature<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]</sup>. Reproducing the hyaloid phenotypes observed in the FEVR-associated mouse model, the hyaloid vasculature in <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> at P10 displayed delayed regression in comparison to the Ctrl littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>). Following the expansion of the superficial vessel plexus at around P8, retinal vessels extend perpendicularly into the deep retina, forming secondary and deep third capillary layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. To investigate whether the depletion of <italic>Capsl</italic> hinders deep capillary vascular development, we conducted immunostaining on P10 retinal sections. The results revealed a delayed development of deep retinal vessels in <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> mouse retinae compared to that of Ctrl (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B</xref>). In addition, immunostaining of P14 flat-mount retina confirmed an incomplete architecture of the deep vascular layer in <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> mouse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>).</p>

<p>The development of retinal vasculature is a complex process encompassing not only the coordinated behavior of endothelial cells but also the intricate interactions among different cell types and cytokines within the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Astrocytes form a mesh as a template prior to vascular growth and guide angiogenic expansion by secreting gradient distributed VEGFA<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]</sup>. Abnormal activation of astrocytes and subsequent inflammatory responses have been observed in multiple FEVR mouse models<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]</sup>. To explore whether the gradient and expression level of VEGFA were affected by the depletion of <italic>Capsl</italic>, we conducted immunostaining of VEGFA on the retina. However, the results showed no alteration of VEGFA (Fig.S2A). Meanwhile, the activation state and the pattern of the vascular template for EC outgrowth formed by astrocytes remained normal, indicated by GFAP (Fig.S2B). Pericyte recruitment is necessary for vessel stability and maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. The immunostaining of Desmin or NG2 staining exhibited no difference between Ctrl and <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> mice (Fig.S2C). To assess the integrity of the retinal vascular barrier, we performed the intraperitoneal injection of biocytin-TMR (869 Da), a small-molecular-weight fluorescent tracer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. The results showed no notable leakage in the <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> retina, suggesting the intact blood barrier despite the depletion of ECs-<italic>Capsl</italic> (Fig.S2D). The extracellular matrix (ECM) coordinates the behavior of ECs by regulating cell-cell communication processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. The deficiency and abnormal accumulation of ECM can both disrupt the adhesion, proliferation, and migration of the endothelial cells, leading to defects in blood vessel architecture<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]</sup>. We thus analyzed the extracellular matrix accumulation using fibronectin 1, and the result showed normal deposition of ECM (Fig.S2E). In conclusion, endothelial cell-specific knockout of <italic>Capsl</italic> may mainly lead to defects in retinal vascular ECs rather than other vascular cells.</p>

<title>CAPSL controls vascular proliferation and migration</title>
<p>Considering the compromised vascular progression and decreased vessel density in <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> mouse retinae, we first performed the EdU assay on retina flat-mounts co-stained with ETS transcription factor ERG (endothelial cell nuclear marker) to assess the proliferation of ECs. The results showed a strongly reduced proliferation of <italic>Capsl</italic>-defective ECs compared to that of Ctrl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>). As previously reported, the regressed retinal vessels exhibited sleeve-like positivity for basement matrix component Collagen IV and negativity for Isolectin IB4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. To compare the vascular regression between <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> and Ctrl retinae, we conducted co-staining of the Collagen IV and IB4. The results revealed that depletion of <italic>Capsl</italic> leads to an increased vascular regression, evidenced by a significant increase in collagen IV basal membrane sleeves lacking IB4 both in the capillary plexus and angiogenic front (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4B</xref>).</p>

<p>Additionally, considering the pivotal role of tip cells in the direction of vascular development, we then asked whether depletion of <italic>Capsl</italic> impairs the polarity of tip cells by analyzing the morphology of cell nuclei at the angiogenic front. This analysis was based on the observation that the nuclei of actively migrating tip cells are elliptical and exhibit increased sphericity (decreased ellipticity) in static tip cells<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]</sup>. In Ctrl mice retinae, the nuclei of tip ECs were predominantly elliptical, pointing towards the avascular area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4C</xref>). Conversely, in the retinae of <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> mice, the nuclei of tip ECs appeared more spherical and did not orient towards the avascular area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4C</xref>). These findings suggest that CAPSL is critical for EC proliferation, vascular regression, and cell polarity.</p>

<title>Endothelial CAPSL is required for cell polarity and filopodia/lamellipodia formation</title>
<p>To investigate the functional mechanism and signaling cascade by which CAPSL regulates EC behaviors, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments on primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs). Stable <italic>CAPSL</italic> knockdown HRECs were generated using the lentivirus-mediated shRNA system. RT-qPCR analysis showed that the mRNA level of <italic>CAPSL</italic> was significantly decreased (Fig.S1E). In line with the overall reduced vascular coverage in <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> mice retina, <italic>CAPSL</italic>-knockdown HRECs (sh<italic>CAPSL</italic>-ECs) exhibited considerably impaired tube formation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5A</xref>). EdU labeling also revealed decreased cell proliferation of sh<italic>CAPSL</italic>-ECs compared to that of shCtrl-ECs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5B</xref>). We further conducted flow cytometry to determine whether cell cycle arrest occurred upon depletion of <italic>CAPSL</italic> in HRECs. The redistribution of cell cycle phases indicated that the cell cycle was arrested during the G0/G1 phase in the sh<italic>CAPSL</italic>-ECs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5C</xref>-D). To further investigate the role of CAPSL in EC migration, we performed the scratch-wound assay in confluent sh<italic>CAPSL</italic>-ECs and shCtrl-ECs, as previously reported<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]</sup>. Nine hours after scratching, ECs were co-stained with GM130 and phalloidin to visualize the Golgi apparatus and the cytoskeleton. The results indicated that the nuclei of sh<italic>CAPSL</italic>-ECs were more spherical than those of shCtrl-ECs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5E</xref>-F). Given that the axial polarity can reflect the direction and migration of ECs<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]</sup>, we further measured the cell polarity (nucleus-to-Golgi polarity axis) of ECs at the wound edge<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]</sup>. As a result, the Golgi apparatus of shCtrl-ECs was predominantly positioned around the wound edge, while that of sh<italic>CAPSL</italic>-ECs showed more random positioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5H</xref>).</p>

<p>At the angiogenic front, the dynamic behaviors of tip cells largely rely on the rearrangement and organization of the actin cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Tip cells extend actin-driven filopodia and lamellipodia to probe chemotactic guidance cues, providing direction and migration for the developing vascular network<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]</sup>. Notably, sh<italic>CAPSL</italic>-ECs exhibited fewer filopodia, smaller lamellipodia, and significantly impaired wound closure compared to shCtrl-ECs at the wound scratch edge (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5I</xref>). Also, as expected, sh<italic>CAPSL</italic>-ECs exhibited significantly impaired wound closure at the same time point after scratching relative to shCtrl-ECs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5J</xref>). Small Rho GTPases, including CDC42 and Rac, are essential for lamellipodial extension and cell migration<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]</sup>.

<title>CAPSL regulates endothelial cell proliferation through the MYC signaling axis</title>
<p>Given the fact that FEVR is predominantly characterized by the compromised Norrin/β-catenin signaling pathway as its main causative factor<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</sup>, we first asked whether loss of CAPSL function causes FEVR through Norrin/β-catenin signaling. TopFlash reporter gene system was used to determine the activity of the Norrin/β-catenin signaling pathway. Knocking down <italic>CAPSL</italic> expression in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) SuperTopFlash (STF) cells led to similar luciferase activity, compared to cells transfected with shCtrl (Fig.S3A). Furthermore, transfection of <italic>shRNA</italic>-resistant CAPSL plasmid (WT, R30X, or L83F) in <italic>CAPSL</italic>-knockdown 293STF cells resulted in no significant difference in luciferase activity (Fig.S3B). These results indicated that <italic>CAPSL</italic> was not a major player in Norrin/β-catenin signaling to regulate retinal vascular development.</p>
<p>We next performed unbiased transcriptomic and proteomic analyses on the control and <italic>CAPSL</italic>-knockdown HRECs to explore the underlying mechanism by which <italic>CAPSL</italic> regulates EC proliferation and migration. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identified 1961 up-regulated genes and 2205 down-regulated genes in sh<italic>CAPSL</italic>-ECs compared to shCtrl-ECs (logFC&gt;0.58, Pvalue&lt;0.05), 1342 up-regulated genes and 1218 down-regulated genes in ECs overexpressing CAPSL (LentiOE-ECs) compared to Ctrl-ECs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6A</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on transcriptomic data showed multiple down-regulated signaling axes upon the depletion of <italic>CAPSL</italic>, including E2F targets (NES=-3.2944438, P value=0), G2/M checkpoints (NES=-3.2851038, Pvalue=0), MYC targets (NES=-2.8795638, P value=0), and mitotic spindle (NES=-2.646523, Pvalue=0) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6B</xref>-C). In line with this, overexpression of CAPSL in HRECs also caused a significant increase in E2F targets (NES=2.7765026, P value=0), G2/M checkpoints (NES=2.6528199, Pvalue=0), and MYC targets (NES=2.6528199, Pvalue=0) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6D</xref>-E). Meanwhile, proteomic profiling showed similar expression patterns with that of transcriptomic profiling upon knockdown or overexpression of <italic>CAPSL</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6F</xref>-I). Furthermore, we applied correlation analysis on the transcriptomic and proteomic data, which divided the genes into 9 quadrants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). GSEA analysis was performed on genes in the third and seventh quadrants, which were regulated at the transcriptional level (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K</xref>). Interestingly, the down-regulated signaling pathways are highly consistent with those observed in GSEA analysis of both transcriptomic and proteomic analyses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6K</xref>). Given that the c-MYC was an established driver of cell growth and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, and that the genes in the MYC signaling were down-regulated upon <italic>CAPSL</italic>-depletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6L</xref>), we speculated that CAPSL might play a pivotal role in MYC signaling in HRECs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Over the last decades, major progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying FEVR, and 17 FEVR-causing genes have been identified<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup>. However, the pathogenic genes and mechanisms underlying approximately 50% of clinical cases remain elusive<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup>. In this study, we report a new FEVR candidate gene <italic>CAPSL</italic> and uncover the pivotal roles of CAPSL in retina vascular development. The EC-specific <italic>Capsl</italic>-knockout mouse model exhibited FEVR phenotypes, including delayed vascular progression, retarded hyaloid vessel regression, and decreased vessel density. Deficiency of CAPSL in ECs resulted in compromised cell proliferation and defective EC migration, providing insights into the regulatory roles of CAPSL in retina vascularization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>-5).</p>
<p>During retinal development, angiogenesis comprises various processes such as endothelial cell (EC) specification, adhesion, proliferation, migration, and pruning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. The regulation of angiogenesis entails the control of EC behaviors and the interactions between ECs, extracellular matrix (ECM), and other types of retinal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. In this study, we observed impaired radial expansion and vertical invasion, as well as the increased pruning of the retinal vascular ECs upon inactivating endothelial <italic>Capsl</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>-3). However, neither the expression level nor the gradience of VEGFA was disturbed in <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> mice, which could be attributed to the intact blood barrier in the <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> retina (Fig.S2). In addition, the loss of <italic>Capsl</italic> resulted in the presence of more spherical tip cell nuclei, which were directed more randomly to the avascular area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4</xref>). These results provide evidence that CAPSL acts as a novel regulator for collective EC behavior.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> functional studies demonstrated that depletion of <italic>CAPSL</italic> impaired tube formation, EC proliferation ability, and EC polarity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>). Moreover, the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia is also disturbed by the depletion of <italic>CAPSL</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>). Using the unbiased transcriptomic and proteomic sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, and western blot assay, we demonstrated that the defects in <italic>CAPSL</italic> affect EC function by down-regulating the MYC signaling cascade (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6</xref>-7). c-MYC has been shown to be a critical mediator of anabolic metabolism, cell growth, and migration<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]</sup>. Aberrant upregulation of the MYC signaling pathway is frequently observed in many types of cancers<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]</sup>. Interestingly, the phenotypes of retinal vessels in <italic>Capsl<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> mice resemble the vascular defects in <italic>c-Myc<sup>iECKO/iECKO</sup></italic> mice, exhibiting FEVR-like phenotypes, such as impaired vascular progression, decreased branch points, and reduced EC proliferation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The Norrin/β-catenin signaling pathway is a subset of Wnt signaling pathway that is specifically activated during vascular development of the central nervous system<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]</sup>. Although several signaling pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of FEVR, variants in crucial components of Norrin/β-catenin signaling account for most of the FEVR cases<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</sup>. It is worth mentioning that c-MYC is widely recognized as a downstream target of Wnt signaling, which is transcriptionally regulated during Wnt activation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]</sup>. However, to our knowledge, there is a lack of literature reporting on the correlation between the MYC signaling pathway and FEVR. Interestingly, here we proved that the absence of CAPSL leads to a decrease in c-MYC protein level, which down-regulates MYC signaling without affecting Norrin/β-catenin signaling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7</xref> and S3). Consequently, we propose c-MYC as a potential therapeutic target for FEVR, a hypothesis that warrants substantiation through subsequent investigations.</p>
<p>Additionally, the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, which is reported to be intimately related to the actomyosin dynamics and the activity of small Rho GTPases such as CDC42<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]</sup>, is significantly reduced in <italic>CAPSL</italic>-defective HRECs. In our study, we confirmed that the knockdown of <italic>CAPSL</italic> led to a significant reduction of CDC42, which might be the causative mechanism behind the disturbed formation of filopodia and lamellipodia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our study demonstrated that <italic>CAPSL</italic> is potentially a novel candidate gene associated with FEVR. We also demonstrated that variants in the <italic>CAPSL</italic> gene, independently of canonical Norrin/β-catenin signaling, cause FEVR through inactivating MYC signaling, expanding FEVR-involved signaling pathway and providing a potential therapeutic target for the intervention of FEVR.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The author presents the discovery and characterization of CAPSL as a potential gene linked to Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), identifying one nonsense and one missense mutation within CAPSL in two distinct patient families afflicted by FEVR. Cell transfection assays suggest that the missense mutation adversely affects protein levels when overexpressed in cell cultures. Furthermore, conditionally knocking out CAPSL in vascular endothelial cells leads to compromised vascular development. The suppression of CAPSL in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells results in hindered tube formation, a decrease in cell proliferation, and disrupted cell polarity. Additionally, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of these cells indicates alterations in the MYC pathway.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is nicely designed with a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches, and the experimental results are good quality.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My reservations lie with the main assertion that CAPSL is associated with FEVR, as the genetic evidence from human studies appears relatively weak. Further careful examination of human genetics evidence in both patient cohorts and the general population will help to clarify. In light of human genetics, more caution needs to be exercised when interpreting results from mice and cell models and how is it related to the human patient phenotype.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work identifies two variants in CAPSL in two-generation familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) pedigrees, and using a knockout mouse model, they link CAPSL to retinal vascular development and endothelial proliferation. Together, these findings suggest that the identified variants may be causative and that CAPSL is a new FEVR-associated gene.</p>

<p>The authors' data provides compelling evidence that loss of the poorly understood protein CAPSL can lead to reduced endothelial proliferation in mouse retina and suppression of MYC signaling in vitro, consistent with the disease seen in FEVR patients. The study is important, providing new potential targets and mechanisms for this poorly understood disease. The paper is clearly written, and the data generally support the author's hypotheses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Both pedigrees described appear to suggest that heterozygosity is sufficient to cause disease, but authors have not explored the phenotype of Capsl heterozygous mice. Do these animals have reduced angiogenesis similar to KOs? Furthermore, while the p.R30X variant protein does not appear to be expressed in vitro, a substantial amount of p.L83F was detectable by western blot and appeared to be at the normal molecular weight. Given that the full knockout mouse phenotype is comparatively mild, it is unclear whether this modest reduction in protein expression would be sufficient to cause FEVR - especially as the affected individuals still have one healthy copy of the gene. Additional studies are needed to determine if these variants alter protein trafficking or localization in addition to expression, and if they can act in a dominant negative fashion.</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript nicely shows that loss of CAPSL leads to suppressed MYC signaling in vitro. However, given that endothelial MYC is regulated by numerous pathways and proteins, including FOXO1, VEGFR2, ERK, and Notch, and reduced MYC signaling is generally associated with reduced endothelial proliferation, this finding provides little insight into the mechanism of CAPSL in regulating endothelial proliferation. It would be helpful to explore the status of these other pathways in knockdown cells but as the authors provide only GSEA results and not the underlying data behind their RNA seq results, it is difficult for the reader to understand the full phenotype. Volcano plots or similar representations of the underlying expression data in Figures 6 and 7 as well as supplemental datasets showing the differentially regulated genes should be included. In addition, while the paper beautifully characterizes the delayed retinal angiogenesis phenotype in CAPSL knockout mice, the authors do not return to that model to confirm their in vitro findings.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure S2D, the result of this vascular leak experiment is unconvincing as no dye can be seen in the vessels. What are the kinetics for biocytin tracers to enter the bloodstream after IP injection? Why did the authors choose the IP instead of the IV route for this experiment? Differences in the uptake of the eye after IP injection could confound the results, especially in the context of a model with vascular dysfunction as here.</p>
<p>(4) In Figure 5, it is unclear how filipodia and tip cells were identified and selected for quantification. The panels do not include nuclear or tip cell-specific markers that would allow quantification of individual tip cells, and in Figure 5C it appears that some filipodia are not highlighted in the mutant panel.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Liu et al. presents a case that CAPSL mutations are a cause of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). Attention was initially focused on the CAPSL gene from whole exome sequence analysis of two small families. The follow-up analyses included studies in which CAPSL was manipulated in endothelial cells of mice and multiple iterations of molecular and cellular analyses. Together, the data show that CAPSL influences endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Molecularly, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses suggest that CAPSL influences many genes/proteins that are also downstream targets of MYC and may be important to the mechanisms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This multi-pronged approach found a previously unknown function for CAPSLs in endothelial cells and pointed at MYC pathways as high-quality candidates in the mechanism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Two issues shape the overall impact for me. First, the unreported population frequency of the variants in the manuscript makes it unclear if CAPSL should be considered an interesting candidate possibly contributing to FEVR, or possibly a cause. Second, it is unclear if the identified variants act dominantly, as indicated in the pedigrees. The studies in mice utilized homozygotes for an endothelial cell-specific knockout, leaving uncertainty about what phenotypes might be observed if mice heterozygous for a ubiquitous knockout had instead been studied.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the following scientific issues are specific weaknesses that should be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) Please state in the manuscript the number of FEVR families that were studied by WES. Please also describe if the families had been selected for the absence of known mutations, and/or what percentage lack known pathogenic variants.</p>
<p>(2) A better clinical description of family 3104 would enhance the manuscript, especially the father. It is unclear what &quot;manifested with FEVR symptoms, according to the medical records&quot; means. Was the father diagnosed with FEVR? If the father has some iteration of a mild case, please describe it in more detail. If the lack of clinical images in the figure is indicative of a lack of medical documentation, please note this in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(3) The TGA stop codon can in some instances also influence splicing (PMID: 38012313). Please add a bioinformatic assessment of splicing prediction to the assays and report its output in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(4) More details regarding utilizing a &quot;loxp-flanked allele of CAPSL&quot; are needed. Is this an existing allele, if so, what is the allele and citation? If new (as suggested by S1), the newly generated CAPSL mutant mouse strain needs to be entered into the MGI database and assigned an official allele name - which should then be utilized in the manuscript and who generated the strain (presumably a core or company?) must be described.</p>
<p>(5) The statement in the methods &quot;All mice used in the study were on a C57BL/6J genetic background,&quot; should be better defined. Was the new allele generated on a pure C57BL/6J genetic background, or bred to be some level of congenic? If congenic, to what generation? If unknown, please either test and report the homogeneity of the background, or consult with nomenclature experts (such as available through MGI) to adopt the appropriate F?+NX type designation. This also pertains to the Pdgfb-iCreER mice, which reference 43 describes as having been generated in an F2 population of C57BL/6 X CBA and did not designate the sub-strain of C57BL/6 mice. It is important because one of the explanations for missing heritability in FEVR may be a high level of dependence on genetic background. From the information in the current description, it is also not inherently obvious that the mice studied did not harbor confounding mutations such as rd1 or rd8.</p>
<p>(6) In my opinion, more experimental detail is needed regarding Figures 2 and 3. How many fields, of how many retinas and mice were analyzed in Figure 2? How many mice were assessed in Figure 3?</p>
<p>(7) I suggest adding into the methods whether P-values were corrected for multiple tests.</p>
