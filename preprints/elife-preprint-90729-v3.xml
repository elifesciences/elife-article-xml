<title>Abstract</title><p>Human endometrial receptivity is a critical determinant of pregnancy success; however, in vivo studies of its features and regulation are particularly challenging due to ethical restriction. Recently, the development of human endometrial assembloids has provided a powerful model to examine this intricate biological process. In this study, we established a specialized human window-of-implantation (WOI) endometrial assembloid system that mimics the in vivo receptive endometrium. It recapitulates not only the structural attributes of pinopodes and cilia, but also molecular characteristics of mid secretory endometrium. Furthermore, the WOI endometrial assembloid exhibits hormone responsiveness, energy metabolism with larger and enhanced functional mitochondria, increased ciliary assembly and motility, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as promising potential for embryo implantation. As such, WOI assembloids hold great promise as a platform to unravel the intricate mechanisms governing endometrial receptivity regulation, maternal-fetal interactions, and associated diseases, ultimately driving impactful advancements in the field.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>(a) Organizing the Logic and Highlighting Key Findings: We have revised the manuscript to emphasize key findings (especially the distinctions between the SEC and WOI groups) according to the following logic: constructing a receptive endometrial organoid, comparing its molecular characteristics with those of the receptive endometrium, highlighting its main features (hormone response, enhanced energy metabolism, ciliary assembly and motility, epithelial-mesenchymal transition), and exploring the function involved in embryo interaction.
(b) Clarity and Better Description of Bioinformatic Analyses: We have revised the sections involving bioinformatic analyses to provide a more streamlined and comprehensible explanation. Instead of overwhelming the reader with excessive details, we focused on the most important findings, and performed additional experimental validation.
(c) Rationale for Gene Selection: We have clarified the rationale for selecting certain genes and pathways for inclusion in the analysis and manuscript. The associated gene expression data for all figures have been provided in the attached Dataset.
(d) In the response letter, we have provided the detailed presentation of the methodological optimization for constructing this endometrial assembloids, along with optimization and comparison of endometrial organoid culture media. Furthermore, in the Limitations section, we have explicitly stated that stromal cells and immune cells gradually diminish with increasing passage numbers. Therefore, this study primarily utilized endometrial assembloids within the first three passages for all investigations.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human endometrium, comprising various cell types, experiences shedding (menstrual phase), regeneration (proliferative phase), and differentiation (secretory phase) under the regulation of estrogen and progesterone during the menstrual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). A brief window, called the “window-of-implantation (WOI)” or mid-secretory phase, allows for embryo implantation into the endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The endometrium at the embryo implantation site contains diverse cells, including ciliated epithelial cells, decidualized stromal cells and immune cells. Cyclic endometrial changes akin to those in humans are exclusive to apes, Old World monkeys, molossid bats, and spiny mice, but not mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), rendering typical mouse models insufficient for accurately simulating human endometrium. Existing endometrial cell lines, such as Ishikawa and HEEC cells, consist solely of a single cell type, thus failing to reproduce the intricate physiological structure and function of the endometrium.</p>
<p>Replicating and reconstructing human organs has become essential for exploring tissue physiology and function. O rganoid, a self-assembled 3D structure, closely resemble in vivo tissue or organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). They offer high expansibility, phenotypic, and functional properties, emerging as powerful tools for investigating tissue physiology and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In 2017, the first long-term and hormone-responsive human endometrial organoid was established using adult stem cells from endometrial biopsy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Based on this, Margherita Y. Turco, et al developed noninvasive methods to construct endometrial organoids from menstrual flow(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Takahiro Arima et al. developed polar reversal endometrial organoids to study embryo implantation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Apart from adult stem cells, pluripotent stem cells were also induced to endometrial stromal fibroblasts and epithelium, and then cocultured to form organoids(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), which offered vigorous proliferative capacity but lacked immune cells and other components of the microenvironment. There are also studies that add immune cells to endometrial organoids for co-culture(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In efforts to mimic human endometrial cell types in vitro, the endometrial organoids progressed from epithelial organoids(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), to assemblies of epithelial and stromal cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) and then to stem cell-laden 3D artificial endometrium(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), which were solely closer but not completely identical to the endometrium. Additionally, pathological endometrial organoid models have been established for conditions like endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia, Lynch syndrome, and endometrial cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). These organoids simulated endometrial morphology, hormone responsiveness, and physiological and pathological processes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), facilitating the study of physiological phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), pathogenic mechanisms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and drug screening(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Although various regulators have been suggested to be involved in WOI, we are far from understanding how embryo implantation occurs during the WOI due to ethical limitations and fewer in vitro receptive endometrial model. Transforming from proliferative to receptive endometrium involves dynamic changes like decidualization, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and ciliated epithelial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), which have not been reconstructed in most in vitro model to date. Here, we successfully established a receptive endometrial assembloid system regulated by hormones and reflecting the in vivo WOI endometrial features, providing a platform for studying physiological and pathological endometrium and maternal-fetal interactions.</p>

<title>Developing receptive endometrial assembloids in vitro</title>
<p>To establish endometrial assembloids in vitro, pre-receptive endometrium from reproductive-age women was dissociated into single cells or small cell masses. These cells then self-assembled into assembloids induced by various small molecules, such as Noggin, EGF, FGF2, WNT-3A and R-Spondin1 in expansion medium (ExM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A∼B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S1A</xref>). The assembloids derived from the first generation are used for experiments (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S1B</xref>). The endometrial assembloids consist of vesicle-like glands and fibrous stromal cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>, Video S1∼S4). The epithelium marker E-cadherin, stromal cell marker vimentin, and endometrial gland marker FOXA2 were expressed in the cultured endometrial assembloid, which resembled the endometrium morphologically (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>). Moreover, the endometrial assembloids exhibited substantial expression of the proliferation marker Ki67, while the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 was undetectable, signifying the assembloids’ robust proliferative capacity (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1E</xref>).</p>

<p>Functionally, endometrial assembloids effectively secreted glycogen into the lumen, mirroring the in vivo endometrial activity, thereby providing nourishment for embryo implantation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>). Moreover, after two days of estrogen (E2) treatment followed by fourteen days of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and cAMP administration, the assembloids exhibited a significant upregulation of progesterone receptor (PRA/B) expression, a modest increase in estrogen receptor α (ERα), and enhanced expression of estrogen-responsive genes <italic>EGR1</italic> and <italic>OLFM4</italic>, along with progesterone-responsive genes <italic>PGR</italic> and <italic>PAEP</italic> at the transcriptional level (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1F</xref>∼<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1G</xref>). It reflected a comparable hormonal responsiveness in the in vivo endometrium.</p>
<p>To identify hormonal regimens that induce implantation window, pregnancy-related hormones were supplemented into the culture system following the two-day E2. E2 and MPA promote the transition of endometrial assembloids into the secretory phase, while pregnancy hormones can promote the further differentiation. Prolactin (PRL) promotes immune regulation and angiogenesis during implantation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) improves endometrial thickness and receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Human placental lactogen (hPL) promotes the development and function of endometrial glands(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Hormone dosage was primarily based on peri-pregnant maternal body or localized endometrium levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). A comparison of multiple groups revealed similar counts, area, and average intensity of assembloids over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S1H</xref>). However, only the final recipe (i.e., a combination of E2, MPA, cAMP, PRL, hCG and hPL) exhibited an endometrial receptivity-related gene expression profile, which highly expressed genes positively correlated with endometrial receptivity, and lowly expressed genes negatively correlated with receptivity, compared to the other hormone formulations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>). The assembloids induced with this scheme were defined as WOI assembloids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast, endometrial assembloids maintained in ExM constituted the “control (CTRL)” group, whereas assembloids treated with E2 for two days, followed by E2, MPA, and cAMP for an additional six days, were induced to the secretory phase as previously reported(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), and designated as the “secretory (SEC)” group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). There was no significant difference in the morphology of assembloids among the three groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>), but when comparing receptivity markers, WOI assembloids exhibited high expression of IGFBP1, MAOA, and DPP4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), with increased glycogen secretion (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S1I</xref>). Theoretically, the WOI assembloids are initially in the secretory phase, thus sharing characteristics with the SEC assembloids. More importantly, they are expected to display traits typical of the mid-secretory phase.</p>

<p>Single-cell transcriptomics analysis identified the presence of epithelium, stromal cells, and immune cells in WOI assembloids with reference to CellMarker, PanglaoDB, Human Cell Atlas, Human Cell Landscape, and scRNASeqDB, and previous endometrium related studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>∼<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>). The WOI assembloids exhibited similarities to the mid-secretory endometrium in terms of glandular and luminal epithelium, secretory epithelium, LGR5 epithelium, ciliated epithelium, and EMT-derived cells, as evidenced by comparisons of scRNA-seq data from our assembloids and the mid-secretory endometrium as described by Stephen R.

<p>The WOI assembloids displayed characteristic features of the receptive endometrium. On the one hand, the WOI assembloids secreted more glycogen into the lumen (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1I</xref>). On the other hand, the WOI assembloids possessed various characteristic microstructure of implantation window, including elongated microvilli and increased glycogen, pinopodes, and especially cilia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, we concentrated on the comparison of gene expression and transcriptional regulation during the mid-secretory phase, as this phase marks the implantation window and involves substantial transcriptional alterations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2G</xref>∼<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). We referred to the scRNA-seq data of the mid-secretory phase from Stephen R. Quake 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Pathways related to mitochondrial energy metabolism and cell adhesion exhibited upregulation in both the WOI assembloid and mid-secretory endometrium in comparison to the CTRL and SEC assembloids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). The crucial transcription factors (TFs) found in the secretory epithelium and EMT-derived cells, which are implicated in implantation, revealed similarities between WOI assembloids and mid-secretory endometrium. Specifically, the secretory epithelium exhibited comparable TFs related to hypoxia response (such as previously reported HIF1A(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)), embryo implantation (such as FBLN1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>)), lipid metabolism (such as VMP1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>)), cell migration, and cell junction (such as TJP1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Similarly, EMT-derived cells also expressed similar TFs involved in endometrial decidualization (such as S100A10(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)), EMT (such as FAT1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and FOXF2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>)), and receptivity (such as NEAT1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), SERPINB9(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), SOX17(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) and SOX4(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>)) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>).</p>
<p>We then conducted the endometrial receptivity test (ERT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) to further assess the receptive state of WOI assembloids. ERT is a kind of gene analysis-based method for detecting endometrial receptivity, which combines high-throughput sequencing and machine learning to analyze the expression of endometrial receptivity-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). It is currently used in clinical practice to determine endometrial receptivity and guide personalized embryo transfer. The WOI assembloids derived from pre-receptive endometrium were observed to transit into the receptivity phase (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1J</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results demonstrated that the WOI assembloids closely resemble the in vivo endometrium during the implantation window in terms of structures and molecular characteristics.</p>

<p>WOI assembloids exhibited a robust hormone response, as demonstrated by the upregulation of PGR at the transcriptome level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Integrated analysis of the transcriptome and proteome data identified 179 upregulated genes/proteins in WOI assembloids compared to the CTRL group, with most of these genes/proteins implicated in the estrogen response (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3F</xref>∼<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3G</xref>). Furthermore, the analysis of progesterone response levels using PRA/B immunostaining indicated the highest levels in the WOI group, accompanied by an upregulation of the estrogen responsive protein OLFM4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). FOXO1, a crucial marker of endometrial receptivity reliant on PGR signaling, exhibited significantly elevated expression in WOI assembloids compared to CTRL assembloids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D</xref>, Video S5), suggesting the involvement of progesterone signaling in the establishment of WOI assembloids. These findings collectively demonstrated a strong response of WOI assembloids to estrogen and progesterone.</p>
<p>Hormone response increased secretory epithelium and decreased proliferative epithelium in the SEC and WOI assembloids, suggesting the transformation from proliferation to secretory phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The secretory epithelium, critical for the implantation window, contributed to cellular metabolic processes and HIF-1 signaling pathway response to hypoxia at the single-cell level (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>∼<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2F</xref>). The secretory epithelium of WOI assembloids exhibited enhanced peptide metabolism and mitochondrial energy metabolism compared to the SEC group, supporting endometrial decidualization and embryo implantation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Proliferative epithelium differentiates into secretory epithelium under the regulation of branch nodal genes between state 5 and state 6, such as the KRT19, MALAT1, MT2A, RPL and RPS families, as revealed by single-cell trajectory (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2H</xref>∼<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2J</xref>). The WOI assembloids showed more thoroughly differentiation from proliferative to secretory epithelium in relation to the SEC assembloids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>).</p>

<p>To further investigate this trend, the Mfuzz algorithm was utilized to analyze gene expression across these three groups, focusing on gene clusters that were progressively upregulated or downregulated.

<p>Transcriptomic analysis further confirmed the upregulation of genes involved in ciliary assembly (<italic>NEK2</italic>), ciliary basal body (<italic>CFAP36</italic>), and motile cilia (<italic>DNAH9 and TPPP</italic>) in WOI endometrial assembloids, with <italic>NEK2</italic> showing the most significant difference (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5B</xref>).

Acetyl-α-tubulin (cilia marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>)) were highly expressed in the WOI assembloids (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed hormone treatment increased ciliated epithelium and decreased unciliated epithelium in SEC and WOI groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Ciliated epithelium functioned in protein binding, cilium organization and assembly, while unciliated epithelium acted on actin cytoskeleton and translation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E∼F</xref>). The WOI assembloids’ ciliated epithelium regulated vasculature development and displayed higher transcriptional activity than the SEC group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Ciliated-unciliated epithelium transition occurred during the menstrual cycle, which was regulated by key genes, such as GAS5, JUN, RPL and RPS families (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig.S2K</xref>∼<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2M</xref>).

<title>Receptive endometrial assembloids experienced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)</title>
<p>The WOI assembloids displayed upregulated cell differentiation not only at assembloid level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) but also at cellular level, which is represented by EMT. EMT is a common and crucial biological event in the endometrium during the implantation window(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). During the EMT process, epithelial cells lose their epithelial characteristics while gaining migratory and invasive properties of fibroblasts. Synthetic analysis of the transcriptome and proteome revealed increased EMT in WOI assembloids (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3G</xref>).</p>
<p>EMT-derived cells, exhibiting gene expression patterns typical of epithelial and stromal cells, as well as EMT, are more abundant in the SEC and WOI groups, and act on protein binding, cell cycle, organelle organization, and reproduction (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>). They performed enhanced lamellipodium-mediated cell migration, cell junction and cytoskeleton regulation in the WOI assembloids compared to the SEC assembloids (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). The WOI assembloids exhibited more thoroughly differentiation from proliferative epithelium to EMT-derived cells than the SEC assembloids, which was regulated by key genes such as DOC2B, FXYD3, and LPCAT3 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>∼<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4D</xref>). EMT-derived cells and epithelium cooperated during the implantation window (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E</xref>). We found that NRP1 and SLC7A1 were highly expressed by EMT-derived cells, and their receptors (SEMA3A and CSF1) were more upregulated in the epithelium of WOI group than SEC group (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4G</xref>). NRP1-SEMA3A has been reported to promote vascularization and responds to hypoxia(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). SLC7A1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) and CSF1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) both support receptivity establishment, embryo implantation and development. Compared with common stromal cells, EMT-derived cells communicate slightly differently with epithelial or immune cells. CD44 and CD46, known for their roles in cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) and immunoregulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), are highly expressed in stromal cells and EMT-derived cells, respectively, and bind separately with SPP1 and JAG1 in epithelial and stromal cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E</xref>∼<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4G</xref>).</p>

<p>We further investigated the key biological function of the implantation window, specifically embryo implantation, using the assembloids. Given the rarity and ethical constraints associated with human embryos, we employed blastoids (corresponding to the human embryo at 6 days post-fertilization, referred to as “Day 6”) for implantation into the endometrial assembloids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6A</xref>). By Day 9, we observed that the blastoids could grow within the endometrial assembloids and interact with them (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6B</xref>). The co-cultured blastoids displayed normal tri-lineage differentiation, characterized by markers for the epiblast (OCT4), hypoblast (GATA6), and trophoblast (KRT18) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6C</xref>). Additionally, we conducted a comparative analysis of the survival rates of blastoids and their interaction rates with endometrial assembloids across the CTRL, SEC and WOI assembloids. Remarkably, the survival and interaction rates of blastoids in the WOI endometrial assembloids were significantly higher compared to the CTRL and SEC groups, with survival rates of 66%, 19%, and 28%, and interaction rates of 90%, 47%, and 53% respectively, indicating the promising potential for embryo implantation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6D∼E</xref>). This demonstrates that we have provided an innovative and supportive model suitable for embryo implantation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our study, we constructed the WOI endometrial assembloids, and observed the remarkable resemblance in structure and function to the in vivo endometrium. The assembloids consist of three primary types of endometrial cells, specifically epithelial, stromal, and immune cells, with epithelial cells assembling into glands and surrounded by immune cells and stromal cells. This similarity in cellular composition and tissue architecture to the endometrium lays the foundation for simulating receptive endometrium.</p>
<p>Although previous studies treated endometrial assembloid with E2, P4, and cAMP to induce a transition to the secretory phase, the methodology to accurately simulate the implantation window or mid-secretory endometrium remains elusive and warrants further investigation. Previous research suggested that placental signals could further promote the differentiation of endometrial assembloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), and PRL, hCG and HPL have been implicated in processes such as decidualization, implantation, immunoregulation, and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Detailly, PRL, synthesized by the adenohypophysis, endometrium, and myometrium, plays a vital role in implantation, immunoregulation, and angiogenesis, with the secretory endometrium producing PRL in response to MPA and E2, leading to ciliated cell formation and stromal cell decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). HCG, secreted by trophoblasts in early pregnancy, influences decidual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and improves endometrial thickness and receptivity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The introduction of hCG has been shown to elevate the expression of critical factors associated with endometrial receptivity, such as endocytosis proteins, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), chemokines, and glycodelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). HPL contributes to the development and function of uterine glands(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Consequently, the additional supplementation of PRL, hCG and HPL in our system augmented hormone responsiveness and receptivity, while promoting cell differentiation, ultimately yielding a model more representative of the receptive endometrium.</p>
<p>Here, the WOI assembloid exhibited the characteristic ultra-structures, such as cilia. During the human menstrual cycle, motile cilia are present in the epithelium of the endometrium(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). These hair-like organelles extend from the cell surface and beat rhythmically, facilitating cell and tissue movement while driving fluid transport across the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). During the decidualization of the endometrium, the number and length of cilia increase, a process driven by the two primary regulatory factors for embryo implantation: estrogen and progesterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). However, with aging, the expression of cilia-related genes in the endometrium is downregulated(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). In patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF), ciliary defects in the endometrium are observed, leading to abnormal decidualization and repeated implantation failure(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Thus, cilia play a crucial role in endometrial decidualization and embryo implantation. Consistently, the WOI assembloid exhibited increased ciliated epithelium, along with enhanced assembly and motility of cilia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the WOI assembloid demonstrated energy and lipid metabolism patterns resembling those of the in vivo receptive endometrium. Enhanced energy metabolism involves monocarboxylic acid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Monocarboxylic acids, exemplified by lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies, are vital metabolites in most mammalian cells. During the implantation window, elevated lactate levels mobilize endometrial monocarboxylic acid metabolism and function as a pregnancy-related signal, stimulating secretion in the epithelium. Subsequently, ATP, the primary product of energy metabolism, induces neighboring epithelial cells to release IL8, promoting decidualization of stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). It was also observed that WOI assembloids indeed possessed larger and functionally active mitochondria, producing much more ATP and IL8 than CTRL and SEC assembloids. Lipid metabolism, responsible for energy storage, signal transduction, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and membrane trafficking, plays a crucial role in endometrial receptivity and implantation, although the precise mechanisms are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Thus, the WOI assembloids possessed metabolic characteristics of in vivo implantation window.</p>
<p>However, our WOI endometrial assembloids also exhibit some limitations. It is undeniable that the assembloids cannot perfectly replicate the in vivo endometrium, which comprises functional and basal layers with a greater abundance of cell subtypes, under superior regulation by systemic hormones and nutrients. Stromal cells and immune cells are difficult to pass down stably and their proportion is lower than that in the in vivo endometrium. We are looking forward to combining stem cell induction, 3D printing technology, and microfluidic systems to alter the culture environment in order to optimize the existing model.</p>
<p>In summary, we developed a receptive endometrial assembloid that mimics the features of in vivo implantation-window endometrium (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). With typical ultra-structures of the implantation window, including pinopodes and cilia, it not only demonstrated hormonal responsiveness and characteristic glycogen secretion functions, but also recapitulated the processes such as decidualization, metabolic changes and EMT, while retaining the potential for embryo implantation. This receptive endometrial assembloid serves as a platform to investigate peri-implantation endometrial physiology and pathology, maternal-fetal interactions, with potential practical applications and clinical translation.</p>

<title>Hormone treatment of endometrial assembloids</title>
<p>The hormone regimen for inducing endometrial secretory phase, as described by Thomas E. Spencer et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), consisted of estradiol for 2 days followed by a combination of estradiol (Sigma E2758), medroxyprogesterone acetate (Selleck S2567) and N6,2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt (cAMP) (Sigma D0627) for 6 days.</p>
<p>To simulate the endometrium of implantation window, we developed a model by incorporating various pregnancy-related hormones. The hormone regimen included estradiol for the first two days, followed by a combination of estradiol, medroxyprogesterone acetate, cAMP, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) (Livzon Pharmaceutical Group Inc), Human Placental Lactogen (HPL) (R&amp;D Systems 5757-PL), and prolactin (Peprotech 100-07) for 6 days. The CTRL group was cultured in ExM without the addition of hormones. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (Table S2)</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study generated 3D cell constructs from endometrial cell mixtures that were seeded in the Matrigel scaffold. The cell assemblies were treated with hormones to induce a &quot;window of implantation&quot; (WOI) state. Although many bioinformatic analyses point in this direction, there are major concerns that must be addressed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The addition of 3 hormones to enhance the WOI state (although not clearly supported in comparison to the secretory state).</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors did their best to revise their study according to the Reviewers' comments. However, the study remains unconvincing, incomplete and at the same time still too dense and not focused enough.</p>

<p>Zhang et al. have developed an advanced three-dimensional culture system of human endometrial cells, termed a receptive endometrial assembloid, that models the uterine lining during the crucial window of implantation (WOI). During this mid-secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, the endometrium becomes receptive to an embryo, undergoing distinctive changes. In this work, endometrial cells (epithelial glands, stromal cells, and immune cells from patient samples) were grown into spheroid assembloids and treated with a sequence of hormones to mimic the natural cycle. Notably, the authors added pregnancy-related factors (such as hCG and placental lactogen) on top of estrogen and progesterone, pushing the tissue construct into a highly differentiated, receptive state. The resulting WOI assembloid closely resembles a natural receptive endometrium in both structure and function. The cultures form characteristic surface structures like pinopodes and exhibit abundant motile cilia on the epithelial cells, both known hallmarks of the mid-secretory phase. The assembloids also show signs of stromal cell decidualization and an epithelial mesenchymal transition, like process at the implantation interface, reflecting how real endometrial cells prepare for possible embryo invasion.</p>
<p>Although the WOI assembloid represents an important step forward, it still has limitations: the supportive stromal and immune cell populations decrease over time in culture, so only early-passage assembloids retain full complexity. Additionally, the differences between the WOI assembloid and a conventional secretory-phase organoid are more quantitative than absolute; both respond to hormones and develop secretory features, but the WOI assembloid achieves a higher degree of differentiation due to the addition of &quot;pregnancy&quot; signals. Overall, while it's a reinforced model (not an exact replica of the natural endometrium), it provides a valuable in vitro system for implantation studies and testing potential interventions, with opportunities to improve its long-term stability and biological fidelity in the future.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<p>We have thoroughly addressed all the reviewers’ comments and meticulously revised the manuscript. Key modifications include the following:</p>
<p>(a) Organizing the Logic and Highlighting Key Findings: We have revised the manuscript to emphasize key findings (especially the distinctions between the SEC and WOI groups) according to the following logic: constructing a receptive endometrial organoid, comparing its molecular characteristics with those of the receptive endometrium, highlighting its main features (hormone response, enhanced energy metabolism, ciliary assembly and motility, epithelial-mesenchymal transition), and exploring the function involved in embryo interaction.</p>
<p>(b) Clarity and Better Description of Bioinformatic Analyses: We have revised the sections involving bioinformatic analyses to provide a more streamlined and comprehensible explanation. Instead of overwhelming the reader with excessive details, we focused on the most important findings, and performed additional experimental validation.</p>
<p>(c) Rationale for Gene Selection: We have clarified the rationale for selecting certain genes and pathways for inclusion in the analysis and manuscript. The associated gene expression data for all figures have been provided in the attached Dataset.</p>
<p>(d) In the response letter, we have provided the detailed presentation of the methodological optimization for constructing this endometrial assembloids, along with optimization and comparison of endometrial organoid culture media. Furthermore, in the Limitations section, we have explicitly stated that stromal cells and immune cells gradually diminish with increasing passage numbers. Therefore, this study primarily utilized endometrial assembloids within the first three passages for all investigations.</p>
<p>Below, we provide a point-by-point response to each comment, with all modifications highlighted in the revised manuscript. We respectfully hope that these revisions effectively address the concerns raised by the reviewers.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This study generated 3D cell constructs from endometrial cell mixtures that were seeded in the Matrigel scaffold. The cell assemblies were treated with hormones to induce a &quot;window of implantation&quot; (WOI) state. The authors did their best to revise their study according to the reviewers' comments. However, the study remains unconvincing and at the same time too dense and not focused enough.</p>
<p>(1) The use of the term organoids is still confusing and should be avoided. Organoids are epithelial tissue-resembling structures. Hence, the multiplecell aggregates developed here are rather &quot;coculture models&quot; (or &quot;assembloids&quot;). It is still unexpected (unlikely) that these structures containing epithelial, stromal and immune cells can be robustly passaged in the epithelial growth conditions used. All other research groups developing real organoids from endometrium have shown that only the epithelial compartment remains in culture at passaging (while the stromal compartment is lost). If authors keep to their idea, they should perform scRNA-seq on both early and late (passage 6-10) &quot;organoids&quot;. And they should provide details of culturing/passaging/plating etc that are different with other groups and might explain why they keep stromal and immune cells in their culture for such a long time. In other words, they should then in detail compare their method to the standard method of all other researchers in the field, and show the differences in survival and growth of the stromal and immune cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) We appreciate your feedback and have revised the term 'organoids' to 'assembloids'. 2)</p>
<p>I. Due to budget constraints, this study did not perform scRNA-seq on both early and late passages (P6-P10). Instead, immunofluorescence staining confirmed the persistence of stromal cells at passage 6 (as shown below).</p>

<p>II. Improvements in this study include the following.</p>
<p>a. Optimization of endometrial tissue processing: The procedures for tissue collection, pretreatment, digestion, and culture were refined to maximize the retention of endometrial epithelial cells, stromal cells, and immune cells (detailed optimizations are provided in Response Table 1).</p>
<p>b. Enhanced culture medium formulation: Based on previous protocols, WNT3A was added to promote organoid development and differentiation (PMID: 27315476), while FGF2 was supplemented to improve stromal cell survival (PMID: 35224622) (see Response Table 2 for medium comparisons). Representative culture outcomes are shown in the figure below.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the stromal and immune cells in this system still exhibit differences compared to their in vivo counterparts. In this study, we utilized the first three passages, which offer optimal cell diversity and viability, to meet experimental needs. However, replicating and maintaining the full complexity of endometrial cell types in vitro remains a major challenge in the field—one that we are actively working to address.</p>

<p>(2) The paper is still much too dense, touching upon all kind of conclusions from the manifold bioinformatic analyses. The latter should be much clearer and better described, and then some interesting findings (pathways/genes) should be highlighted without mentioning every single aspect that is observed. The paper needs a lot of editing to better focus and extract take-home messages, not bombing the reader with a mass of pathways, genes etc which makes the manuscript just not readable or 'digest-able'. There is no explanation whatever and no clear rationale why certain genes are included in a list while others are not. There is the impression that mass bioinformatics is applied without enough focus.</p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestions. We have made improvements and revisions in the following areas:</p>
<p>(a) Clarity and Better Description of Bioinformatic Analyses: We have revised the sections involving bioinformatic analyses to provide a more streamlined and comprehensible explanation. Instead of overwhelming the reader with excessive details, we focused on the most important findings.</p>
<p>(b) Organizing the Logic and Highlighting Key Findings: We have revised the manuscript to emphasize key findings according to the following logic: constructing a receptive endometrial organoid, comparing its molecular characteristics with those of the receptive endometrium, highlighting its main features (hormone response, enhanced energy metabolism, ciliary assembly and motility, epithelial-mesenchymal transition), and exploring the function involved in embryo interaction.</p>
<p>(c) Rationale for Gene Selection: We have clarified the rationale for selecting certain genes and pathways for inclusion in the analysis and manuscript.</p>
<p>We hope these revisions address your concerns and improve the overall quality and clarity of the manuscript. Thank you once again for your valuable input.</p>

<p>(3) The study is much too descriptive and does not show functional validation or exploration (except glycogen production). Some interesting findings extracted from the bioinformatics must be functionally tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions. We have restructured the logic and revised the manuscript, incorporating functional validation. The focus is on the following points: highlighting its main features (hormone response, enhanced energy metabolism, ciliary assembly and motility, epithelial-mesenchymal transition), and exploring the functions involved in embryo interaction.</p>

<p>(4) In contrast to what was found in vivo (Wang et al. 2020), no abrupt change in gene expression pattern is mentioned here from the (early-) secretory to the WoI phase. Should be discussed. Although the bioinformatic analyses point into this direction, there are major concerns which must be solved before the study can provide the needed reliability and credibility for revision.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To further investigate the abrupt change, the Mfuzz algorithm was utilized to analyze gene expression across the three groups, focusing on gene clusters that were progressively upregulated or downregulated. It was observed that mitochondrial and cilia-related genes exhibited the highest expression levels in WOI endometrial organoids, as well as cell junction and negative regulation of cell differentiation were downregulated (Figure 4A).</p>

<p>(5) All data should be benchmarked to the Wang et al 2020 and Garcia-Alonso et al. 2021 papers reporting very detailed scRNA-seq data, and not only the Stephen R. Quake 2020 paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion. By integrating data from Garcia-Alonso et al. (2021) (shown in the figure below), we observed that both WOI organoids and SEC organoids exhibit increased glandular secretory epithelium and developed ciliated epithelium, mirroring features of mid-secretory endometrium. The findings exhibit parallels when contrasting these two papers.</p>

<p>(9) All quantification experiments (of stainings etc) should be in detail described how this was done. It looks very difficult (almost not feasible) when looking at the provided pictures to count the stained cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>a. Manual Measurement:</p>
<p>For TEM-observed pinopodes, glycogen particles, microvilli, and cilia, manual region-of-interest (ROI) selection was performed using ImageJ software for quantitative analysis of counts, area, and length. Twenty randomly selected images per experimental group were analyzed for each morphological parameter.</p>
<p>b. Automated Measurement:</p>
<p>We quantified the fluorescence images using ImageJ. Firstly, preprocess them by adjusting brightness and contrast, and removing background noise with the “Subtract Background” feature.</p>
<p>Secondly, set the threshold to highlight the cells, then select the regions of interest (ROI) using selection tools. Thirdly, as for counting the cells, navigate to Analyze &gt; Analyze Particles. AS for measuring the influence intensity and area, set the “Measurement” options as mean gray value. Adjust parameters as needed, and view results in the “Results” window. Save the data for further analysis and ensure consistency throughout your measurements for reliable results.</p>
<p>For 3D fluorescence quantification, ZEN software (Carl Zeiss) was exclusively used, with 11 images analyzed per experimental group. This part has been incorporated into “Supporting Information”</p>
<p>Line 94-100.</p>
<p>c. Normalization Method：</p>
<p>For fluorescence quantification, DAPI was used as an internal reference for normalization, where both DAPI and target fluorescence channel intensities were quantified simultaneously. The normalized target signal intensity (target/DAPI ratio) was then compared across experimental groups. A minimum of 15 images were analyzed for each parameter per group. This part has been incorporated into “Supporting Information” Line 101-104.</p>

<p>(10) Fig. 3C: it is unclear how quantification can be reliably done. Moreover, OLFM4 looks positive in all cells of Ctrl, but authors still see an increase?</p>

<p>(a) Fluorescence images were quantitatively analyzed using ImageJ by measuring the mean gray values. For normalization, DAPI staining served as an internal reference, with simultaneous measurement of mean gray values in both the target fluorescence channel and the DAPI channel. The relative fluorescence intensity was then calculated as the ratio of target channel to DAPI signal for inter-group quantitative comparisons.</p>
<p>(b) OLFM4 is an E2-responsive gene. Its expression in endometrial organoids of the CTRL group is physiologically normal (PMID: 31666317). However, its fluorescence intensity (quantified as mean gray value) was significantly stronger in both the SEC and WOI groups compared to the CTRL group (quantitative method as described above).</p>

<p>(13) WoI organoids show an increased number of cilia. However, some literature shows the opposite, i.e. less ciliated cells in the endometrial lining at WoI (to keep the embryo in place). How to reconcile?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this question. We conducted a statistical analysis of the proportion of ciliated cells across endometrial phases.</p>
<p>(a) Based on the 2020 study by Stephen R. Quake and Carlos Simon’s team published in Nature Medicine (PMID: 32929266), the mid-secretory phase (Days 19–23) exhibited a higher proportion of ciliated cells compared to the early-secretory (Days 15–18) and late-secretory phases (Days 24– 28) (Fig. R13 A).</p>
<p>(b) According to the 2021 study by Roser Vento-Tormo’s team in Nature Genetics, ciliated cell abundance peaked in the early-to-mid-secretory endometrium across all phases (Fig. R13 B-C).</p>

<p>(14) How are pinopodes distinguished from microvilli? Moreover, Fig. 3 does not show the typical EM structure of cilia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this insightful question.</p>
<p>(a) Pinopodes are large, bulbous protrusions with a smooth apical membrane. Under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it can be observed that the pinopodes contain various small particles, which are typically extracellular fluid and dissolved substances.</p>
<p>Microvilli are elongated, finger-like projections that typically exhibit a uniform and orderly arrangement, forming a &quot;brush border&quot; structure. Under transmission electron microscopy, dense components of the cytoskeleton, such as microfilaments and microtubules, can be seen at the base of the microvilli.</p>
<p>(b) You may refer to the ciliated TEM structure shown in the current manuscript's Fig. 2E (originally labeled as Fig. 2H in the draft). The cilium is composed of microtubules. The cross-section shows that the periphery of the cilium is surrounded by nine pairs of microtubules arranged in a ring. The longitudinal section shows that the cilium has a long cylindrical structure, with the two central microtubules being quite prominent and located at the center of the cilium.</p>

<p>Thank you for your review. Here, we propose that this WOI organoid serves as an alternative research platform for studying endometrial receptivity and maternal-fetal interactions, compared to current secretory-phase organoids. In the revised manuscript, we have supplemented the data by co-culturing this WOI organoid with blastoid, demonstrating its robust embryo implantation potential.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this research, Zhang et al. have pioneered the creation of an advanced organoid culture designed to emulate the intricate characteristics of endometrial tissue during the crucial Window of Implantation (WOI) phase. Their method involves the incorporation of three distinct hormones into the organoid culture, coupled with additives that replicate the dynamics of the menstrual cycle. Through a series of assays, they underscore the striking parallels between the endometrial tissue present during the WOI and their crafted organoids. Through a comparative analysis involving historical endometrial tissue data and control organoids, they establish a system that exhibits a capacity to simulate the intricate nuances of the WOI. The authors made a commendable effort to address the majority of the statements. Developing an endometrial organoid culture methodology that mimics the window of implantation is a game-changer for studying the implantation process. However, the authors should strive to enhance the results to demonstrate how different WOI organoids are from SEC organoids, ensuring whether they are worth using in implantation studies, or a proper demonstration using implantation experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestions. The WOI organoids differ from SEC organoids in the following aspects.</p>
<p>(1) Structurally, WOI endometrial organoids exhibit subcellular features characteristic of the implantation window: densely packed pinopodes on the luminal side of epithelial cells, abundant glycogen granules, elongated and tightly arranged microvilli, and increased cilia (Figure 2F).</p>
<p>(2) At the molecular level, WOI organoids show enlarged and functionally active mitochondria, enhanced ciliary assembly and motility, and single-cell signatures resembling mid-secretory endometrium.</p>
<p>Specifically, mitochondrial- and cilia-related genes/proteins are most highly expressed in WOI organoids (Figure 4A,B). TEM analysis revealed that WOI organoids have the largest average mitochondrial area (Figure 4C). Mitochondrial-related genes display an increasing trend across the three organoid groups, and WOI organoids produce more ATP and IL-8 (Figure 4D,E).</p>
<p>For cilia, WOI organoids upregulate genes/proteins involved in ciliary assembly, basal bodies, and motile cilia, while downregulating non-motile cilia markers (Figure 5A-C).</p>
<p>Single-cell analysis further confirms that WOI organoids recapitulate mid-secretory endometrial traits in mitochondrial metabolism and cell adhesion (Figure 2G).</p>
<p>(3) Functionally, WOI organoids demonstrate superior embryo implantation potential. Given the scarcity and ethical constraints of human embryos, we used blastoids for implantation assays (Figure 6A). These blastoids successfully grew within endometrial organoids, established interactions (Figure 6B), and exhibited normal trilineage differentiation (epiblast: OCT4; hypoblast: GATA6; trophoblast: KRT18) (Figure 6C). WOI organoids achieved significantly higher blastoid survival (66% vs. 19% in CTRL and 28% in SEC) and interaction rates (90% vs. 47% in CTRL and 53% in SEC), confirming their robust embryo-receptive capacity (Figure 6D,E).</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In conclusion, it is needed to first meet all the concerns of the reviewers and then submit an appropriately adapted and comprehensive paper (also showing the robustness of the &quot;organoids&quot; and functionality of the findings) instead of this still fully descriptive paper. Further comments are included in the rebuttal document of the authors and will be provided by the editor as PDF.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors made a good effort to reply all the statements. However, there are some points that the authors need to address.</p>
<p>• There is an inconsistency in the manuscript regarding the number of passages in which the organoids are used; in the response to the reviewers, it mentions 5 passages, while in the Materials and Methods section, it states 3 passages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate your thorough review. In this study, organoids within the first three passages were used. To address the reviewer's question comprehensively, we have now provided a detailed account of the organoid passage history in our response.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• We agree that the difference between SEC and WOI organoids may be subtle, but in response to this, the authors should explain what they mean by &quot;the most notable differences lie in the more comprehensive differentiation and varied cellular functions exhibited by WOI organoids...&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the original manuscript, this statement indicated that, at the single-cell level, WOI endometrial organoids exhibited more functionally mature and thoroughly differentiated characteristics compared to SEC endometrial organoids (See details below).</p>
<p>In the revised version, we have restructured this section to focus on following aspects: hormone response, energy metabolism, ciliary assembly and motility, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and embryo implantation potential. Consequently, the &quot;the most notable differences lie in the more comprehensive differentiation and varied cellular functions exhibited by WOI organoids...&quot;has been removed.</p>
<p>(1) Varied cellular functions:</p>
<p>a. Secretory Epithelium: Compared to SEC organoids, WOI organoids exhibit enhanced peptide metabolism and mitochondrial energy metabolism in their secretory epithelium, supporting endometrial decidualization and embryo implantation (Figure 3F).</p>
<p>b. Proliferative Epithelium: Compared to SEC organoids, WOI organoids demonstrate enhanced GTPase activity, angiogenesis, cytoskeletal assembly, cell differentiation, and RAS protein signaling in their proliferative epithelium (Figure S2G).</p>
<p>c. Ciliated Epithelium: The ciliated epithelium of WOI endometrial organoids is associated with the regulation of vascular development and exhibits higher transcriptional activity compared to SEC organoids (Figure 5E).</p>
<p>d. Stromal Cells: Compared to SEC organoids, WOI organoids exhibit enhanced cell junctions, cell migration, and cytoskeletal regulation in EMT-derived stromal cells (Figure S4A right panel). Similarly, cell junctions are also strengthened in stromal cells (Figure S4A left panel).</p>
<p>(2) comprehensive differentiation:</p>
<p>a. Compared to SEC organoids, WOI organoids exhibit more complete differentiation from proliferative epithelium to secretory epithelium (Figure 3G).</p>
<p>b. The WOI organoids demonstrate more robust ciliary differentiation compared to SEC organoids (Figure 5F).</p>
<p>c. The proliferative epithelium progressively differentiates into EMT-derived cells. Compared to SEC organoids, WOI organoids are predominantly localized at the terminal end of the differentiation trajectory, indicating more complete differentiation (Figure S4B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• What do the authors mean by &quot;average intensity&quot; when referring to the extra reagents added to the WOI? The results that the authors show in response to Reviewer 2's Q1 must be included as part of the results and explain how it was done in the materials and methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This parameter indicates the growth status of organoids. It measures the gray value of organoids through long-term live-cell tracking. When organoids undergo apoptosis, they progressively condense into denser solid spheres, leading to an increase in gray value (average intensity). This content has been incorporated into the Results section (Line 129) and is further explained in the Supporting Information &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; (Lines 70-77).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• In panel 1C, it is not possible to see the stromal cells around because they are brightfield images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>You are partly right. Bright-field images alone indeed make it difficult to distinguish stromal cells. However, by combining whole-mount immunofluorescence staining with the characteristic elongated spindle-shaped morphology of stromal cells, we were able to roughly determine their distribution in the bright-field images.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Responding to Reviewer 2's question Q7, the authors indicate how they establish the cluster. However, they do not specify whether they extrapolate the data from a database or create the cluster themselves based on the literature. It should be stated from which classification list (or classification database) the extrapolation has been made.</p>

<p>• Regarding Reviewer 2's question Q8, if the authors have not been able to make comparisons with, at least, SEC organoids, unfortunately, the ERT loses much of its strength and should not serve as support.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with you at this point. These results have been moved to the supplementary figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• If the differences in the transcriptome and proteome between SEC and WOI organoids are not significant, the result does not support the authors' model. If there are barely any differences at the proteome and transcriptome level between SEC and WOI organoids, why would anyone choose to use their model over SEC organoids?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate your valuable feedback. In this revised manuscript, we have further integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, revealing that WOI organoids exhibit enlarged and functionally active mitochondria, along with enhanced cilia assembly and motility compared to SEC organoids. Additionally, using a blastoid model, we demonstrated that WOI organoids possess superior embryo implantation potential, significantly outperforming SEC organoids. Our research group aims to develop an embryo co-culture model. Through systematic comparisons of structural, molecular, and co-culture characteristics between SEC and WOI organoids, we ultimately confirmed the superior performance of WOI organoids.</p>

<p>• SEC and WOI organoids must be different enough to establish a new model, and the authors do not demonstrate that they are.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. In the revised manuscript, we have emphasized the distinctions between SEC and WOI organoids in terms of structure, molecular characteristics, and functionality (co-culture with blastoid), as detailed below.</p>
<p>(1) Structurally, WOI endometrial organoids exhibit subcellular features characteristic of the implantation window: densely packed pinopodes on the luminal side of epithelial cells, abundant glycogen granules, elongated and tightly arranged microvilli, and increased cilia (Figure 2F).</p>

<p>Specifically, mitochondrial- and cilia-related genes/proteins are most highly expressed in WOI organoids (Figure 4A,B). TEM analysis revealed that WOI organoids have the largest average mitochondrial area (Figure 4C). Mitochondrial-related genes display an increasing trend across the three organoid groups, and WOI organoids produce more ATP and IL-8 (Figure 4D,E).</p>
<p>For cilia, WOI organoids upregulate genes/proteins involved in ciliary assembly, basal bodies, and motile cilia, while downregulating non-motile cilia markers (Figure 5A-C).</p>
<p>Single-cell analysis further confirms that WOI organoids recapitulate mid-secretory endometrial traits in mitochondrial metabolism and cell adhesion (Figure 2G).</p>
<p>(3) Functionally, WOI organoids demonstrate superior embryo implantation potential. Given the scarcity and ethical constraints of human embryos, we used blastoids for implantation assays (Figure 6A). These blastoids successfully grew within endometrial organoids, established interactions (Figure 6B), and exhibited normal trilineage differentiation (epiblast: OCT4; hypoblast: GATA6; trophoblast: KRT18) (Figure 6C). WOI organoids achieved significantly higher blastoid survival (66% vs. 19% in CTRL and 28% in SEC) and interaction rates (90% vs. 47% in CTRL and 53% in SEC), confirming their robust embryo-receptive capacity (Figure 6D,E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Regarding Q16, Boretto et al. 2017 and Turco et al. 2017 also manage to isolate stromal cells, but they lose them between passages. It's not a matter of isolating them from the tissue or not, but rather how they justify their maintenance in culture. In the images added by the authors, it can be seen that the majority of stromal cells are lost from P0 to P1 after thawing. I still believe that the epithelial part can be passed and maintained, but the rest cannot, and that should be mentioned in the paper as a limitation. However, the authors can demonstrate the maintenance of stromal cells by performing immunostaining with vimentin from passages 4, 5, and 6.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We have added the statement 'Stromal cells and immune cells are difficult to pass down stably and their proportion is lower than that in the in vivo endometrium' to the Limitations section (Line 364-365). Additionally, we performed immunostaining with vimentin starting from passage 6 and confirmed the presence of Vimentin+ F-actin+ stromal cells (as shown in Author response image 1).</p>
