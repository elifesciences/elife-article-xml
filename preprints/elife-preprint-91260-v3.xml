<title>Abstract</title><p>HIV disease remains prevalent in the USA and chronic kidney disease remains a major cause of morbidity in HIV-1-positive patients. Host double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) is a sensor for viral dsRNA, including HIV-1. We show that PKR inhibition by compound C16 ameliorates the HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) kidney phenotype in the Tg26 transgenic mouse model, with reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction. Combined analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data revealed that oxidative phosphorylation was one of the most downregulated pathways and identified signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) as a potential mediating factor. We identified in Tg26 mice a novel proximal tubular cell cluster enriched in mitochondrial transcripts. Podocytes showed high levels of HIV-1 gene expression and dysregulation of cytoskeleton-related genes; and these cells dedifferentiated. In injured proximal tubules, cell-cell interaction analysis indicated activation of the profibrogenic PKR-STAT3-platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-D pathway. These findings suggest that PKR inhibition and mitochondrial rescue are potential novel therapeutic approaches for HIVAN.</p>

<p>This work identified mitochondrial dysfunction in transgenic mice manifesting HIV-associated nephropathy mice kidney, using combination of single-nuclear and bulk RNA-seq analysis. Kidney damage was ameliorated by the PKR inhibitor C16, and mitochondrial rescue was shown by transcriptomic profiling and functional assay.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in 2020, ∼1.5 million people became newly HIV positive, ∼37 million people were living with HIV, and ∼680,000 people globally died from HIV-related causes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> HIV remains prevalent in the USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and even more highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in East and Southern Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a major co-morbidity in HIV positive individuals, even with availability of combined anti-retroviral therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> The most severe form of CKD in persons with untreated or undertreated HIV infection is HIV-nephropathy (HIVAN), collapsing glomerulopathy. Therapy for HIVAN includes combined anti-retroviral therapy, coupled with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, to prevent CKD progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Tg26 transgenic is a widely-used HIVAN model. The HIV-1 transgene expresses in kidney cells and the model manifests histological features similar to those of human HIVAN, including collapsing glomerulopathy, microtubular dilatation and interstitial fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> The mice develop progressive renal dysfunction and progress to terminal uremia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diverse therapeutic approaches are effective in Tg26 kidney disease, including inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Notch inhibition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> renin-angiotensin system inhibition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> sirtuin1 agonist or overexpression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> STAT3 activation reduction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> retinoic acid receptor agonist,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and NF-kB inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Recent reports have identified several injury pathways, including NLRP3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and mitochondrial dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> Bulk multi-omics approaches using mRNA microarrays and protein-DNA arrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> identified homeo-domain interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) as a regulator of Tg26 renal pathology; this was confirmed in recent reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> A mRNA microarray approach characterized bulk transcriptional profiles during progressive renal disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> While these reports have provided novel insights into tissue transcriptional dynamics, studies have not been performed at single-cell or single-nucleus resolution.</p>
<p>Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) is a sensor for dsRNA and is activated in response to viral infections, including HIV-1. In the US and globally, HIV remains an important problem that disproportionately affects marginalized groups, including the Black/African-American community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> <italic>APOL1</italic> risk variants, exclusively present in individuals with recent sub-Saharan ancestry, damage podocytes through various mechanisms including PKR activation by <italic>APOL1</italic> mRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> The PKR-inhibiting oxoindole/imidazole compound C16 is beneficial in neuroinflammatory disease models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>We hypothesized that PKR activation is a mechanistic pathway shared by HIV- and APOL1-mediated nephropathies, considering the high odds ratio for HIVAN among African Americans (OR 29) and South Africans (OR 89) carrying two <italic>APOL1</italic> risk alleles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> We investigated the effects of PKR inhibition in the Tg26 HIVAN mouse model, which expresses HIV regulatory and accessory genes. We used single-nucleus and bulk RNA-sequencing methods to identify transcriptional changes between study groups and to uncover associated molecular mechanisms in an unbiased fashion.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Mice</title>
<p>Hemizygous (Tg26<sup>+/-</sup>) male mice were bred with wild type FVB/N female mice to generate Tg26 hemizygous mice. Transgenic mice were identified by PCR genotyping. We studied both male and female mice, aged 6–12 weeks. Mice in treatment groups were matched for sex.</p>
<p>For PKR inhibition treatment, the C16 treatment group mice received 10 µg/kg body weight of C16 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 0.5% DMSO-PBS (10 ml/kg body weight), administered intraperitoneally three times weekly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> from 6 weeks to 12 weeks of age. Urine collection (in 24-hour metabolic cages) and body weight measurements were performed at 6 weeks of age before treatment and 12 weeks of age after treatment. Mice were euthanized and plasma, serum and kidney samples were collected at age of 12 weeks.</p>

<title>Mouse kidney pathological evaluation, In situ hybridization (ISH) and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Mouse kidney tissues were fixed with 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4-5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid Schiff, and picrosirius red. Chromogenic <italic>in situ</italic> detection of RNA was performed using RNAscope 2.5 HD Reagent Kit (catalog # 322310, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Biotechne, Minneapolis, MN) with the RNA probes Mm-mt-Co1, Mm-mt-Atp6, dabB (negative control), Mm-Ppib (positive control) (catalog # 517121, 544401, 310043, 313911).</p>
<p>For immunohistochemistry, tissue sections were deparaffinized/rehydrated, antigens were retrieved by citrate buffer, and non-specific binding was blocked. Sections were incubated with primary antibody against phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) (#9145, 1:100 dilution, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), phopho-PKR (Thr 446) (#sc16565, 1:50 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-D (ab181845, Abcam, 1:100 dilution, Cambridge, UK). Detailed methods including estimation of glomerular podocyte count by PodoCount<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> are described in the Supplemental Methods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Tissues were lysed in a radioimmunopreciptation assay (RIPA) buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) containing a protease inhibitor/ phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (#78440, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (gradient gel 4-12%, MOPS buffer) and the proteins subjected to Western blotting and blocked for one hour in Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Blots were incubated following the iBind protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primary antibodies were Phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) (#9145, 1:2000 dilution, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), Stat3 (#9139, 1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling), β-actin (#47778, 1:5000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Total OXPHOS Rodent (#ab110413, 1:250 dilution, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), VDAC (# 4661, 1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling). Blots were imaged using the Odyssey infrared scanner (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Bulk RNA-sequencing</title>
<p>Mouse kidney outer cortex tissues were dissected and homogenized in QIAzol (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD). Total RNA samples were extracted using RNeasy Plus Universal Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s protocol including removal of genomic DNA step. RNA samples were pooled and sequenced on NovaSeq6000 S1 flowcell using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep and paired-end sequencing with read length 101bps (2×101 cycles). The samples had 46 to 72 million pass filter reads and more than 92% of bases calls were above a quality score of Q30. Sample reads were trimmed for adapters and low-quality bases using Cutadapt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. The trimmed reads were mapped to a reference genome (Mouse - mm10). Transcripts were annotated by Ensembl v96 using STAR aligner. Gene expression quantification analysis was performed for all samples using STAR/RSEM tools. DESeq2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> was used for differential expression analysis from raw count data and normalized data were used for Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA v4.1.0).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> Pathway analysis including upstream regulator analyses were generated using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing</title>
<p>Nuclei from frozen mouse kidney outer cortex tissue samples and glomeruli-enriched samples were prepared at 4°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Tissue fragments (∼ 8 mm<sup>3</sup>) were cut by razor blades in EZlysis buffer (#NUC101-1KT, Sigma-Aldrich) and homogenized 30 times using a loose Dounce homogenizer and 5 times by tight pestle. After 5 min of incubation, homogenates were passed through 40 µm filters (PluriSelect, El Cajon, CA) and centrifuged at 500g at 4°C for 5 min. Pellets were washed with EZlysis buffer and again centrifuged at 500g at 4°C for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in DPBS with 1% FBS and passed through 5 µm filters (PluriSelect) to make final nuclei preparations for loading on to 10xChromium Chip G (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) and formation of gel beads in emulsion (GEM).</p>
<p>Single nuclear isolation, RNA capture, cDNA preparation, and library preparation were accomplished following the manufacturer’s protocol (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit, v3.1 chemistry, 10x Genomics). Prepared cDNA libraries were sequenced. Analysis was performed with the Cell Ranger software using the default parameters with pre-mRNA analysis turned on. The reference was built from mm10 reference genome complemented with HIV-1 viral sequences.</p>

<title>Single-nucleus RNA-seq Analysis</title>
<p>SoupX (version 1.5.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> was used to remove ambient RNA, following the default protocol by “autoEstCont” and “adjustCounts” functions. Doublets were identified and removed by DoubletFinder (version 2.0.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.

<title>PKR inhibition ameliorates kidney injury in Tg26 mice</title>
<p>The trans-activating regions (TAR) RNA in the HIV-1 long terminal repeats (LTRs) at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the HIV genome form double stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures and induce PKR autophosphorylation, thereby activating PKR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> As PKR is a potent driver of many stress response pathways, including translational shutdown, apoptosis, inflammation and metabolism, we hypothesized that PKR inhibition by the PKR-specific oxoindole/imidazole inhibitor C16 might rescue kidney injury in Tg26 mice. We administered C16 to Tg26 and wild-type mice from 6 to 12 weeks of age, and we evaluated the kidney phenotype. C16-treated Tg26 mice had lower serum creatinine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), reduced albuminuria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, 1C</xref>) and reduced pPKR abundance (<bold>Supplemental Figure 1A-D</bold>) compared to control Tg26 mice.

<title>Downregulation of mitochondrial genes in Tg26 kidneys</title>
<p>GSEA results of bulk RNA-seq showed that mitochondrial-related pathways were the most downregulated pathway in Tg26 mice when compared with WT mice, suggesting that mitochondrial gene transcription (for both nuclear-genome and mitochondrial genome-encoded genes) was significantly downregulated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

<title>Novel proximal tubular cell cluster with high mitochondrial gene expression</title>

<p>As the PT-Mito cluster was observed in both WT and Tg26 kidney in similar ratios, this new cluster could be a conserved tubular cell cluster, likely not previously reported due to mitochondrial gene filtering criteria implemented in single-nucleus RNA-seq analytic pipelines. Pathway analysis of snRNA-seq data showed that oxidative phosphorylation genes were downregulated in this PT-Mito cluster in Tg26 mice, compared to wild-type mice, with a Z-score of −4.123. These genes were also downregulated in other many cell types (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These findings suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction represents a prominent mechanistic pathway that was dysregulated in majority of cell clusters in Tg26 mice, and that mitochondrial dysfunction was pronounced in the PT-Mito cluster.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This work, applying combined analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data, highlight the role of PKR activation in the Tg26 HIVAN mouse model and show mitochondrial dysfunction to be one of the most dysregulated pathways. Mitochondrial dysfunction in Tg26 mouse glomeruli and myocytes has been previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> The present study demonstrated by single-nucleus RNA-seq and Seahorse bioenergetics assay that mitochondrial dysfunction is induced in various cell types in Tg26 kidney, especially proximal tubular cells and endothelial cells. It is likely that HIVAN tubular pathology is mediated, at least in part, by mitochondrial dysfunction in proximal tubular cells, and that glomerular mitochondrial dysfunction is mainly confined to endothelial cells. Further, PKR activation may be one of several processes that contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction in HIVAN. A recent report using tubular cell-specific Vpr overexpression mouse model has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in tubular injury. Our findings are congruent with this report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>Further, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of Tg26 kidney cortex identified a novel mitochondrial gene-enriched proximal tubular cell population (PT-Mito). This cell population had not been previously recognized, likely due to filtering criteria routinely employed to reduced mitochondrial genome-encoded transcript levels in single-cell/single nucleus datasets. It has been well established that a high percentage of mitochondrial transcripts captured in single-cell RNA-seq studies suggests stressed cells, and these cells are typically excluded from analysis. However, in single-nucleus RNA-seq data sets, mitochondrial gene percentage is generally low following the nuclear purification. Most nuclei captured have mitochondrial transcripts levels of &lt;1% of the total transcripts captured. Therefore, we did not filter out mitochondrial transcripts entirely from the analysis but excluded nuclei with &gt;20% mitochondrial transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> By not filtering out mitochondrial genes in the analysis, we found dysregulation of these transcripts, providing clues to pathogenesis.</p>
<p>We further demonstrated by ISH the presence of mitochondrial transcripts in nuclei whose cells were identified in single-nuclei analysis of the same tissue samples. Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of having captured some mitochondria during nuclear preparation, we confirmed expression of nuclear genes, such as <italic>Gpx1</italic> and <italic>Gpx3</italic>, which were also highly expressed in this PT-Mito cluster. A relatively high abundance of mitochondrial transcripts in the PT-Mito cluster may indicate the existence of mitochondrial transcripts that were transported into nuclei. This PT-Mito cluster might have remained previously undetected because of the similarity of its transcripts with that of those other proximal tubules and the lack of cell type-specific markers. Considering the high mitochondrial gene expression levels and corresponding mitochondrial pathway dysregulation in Tg26 mice, this PT-Mito cluster may represent the most metabolically active cells, which are also the most highly vulnerable cell type in proximal tubules. Nevertheless, considering the downregulation of both nuclear and mitochondrial encoded genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; mitochondrial dysfunction likely plays a major role in the pathology of HIVAN.</p>
<p>Another novel finding arose from investigating HIV-1 gene expression in the Tg26 mouse. Transcripts for all transgene-encoded HIV-1 genes were detected in all cell types examined, albeit some transcripts were present at low expression levels. This included transcripts for <italic>nef</italic> and <italic>vpr</italic> that are, according to current understanding, the main contributors to HIVAN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> Podocytes showed the highest levels of transgene expression, which is consistent with the prominent pathology observed in podocytes. This finding suggests a shared but unknown mechanism in virus-related nephropathies with podocyte damage. One possible explanation for podocytes not showing overt mitochondrial gene dysregulation despite high HIV-1 gene expression (compared to proximal tubular cells and endothelial cells) is a possible tighter regulation of mitochondrial gene expression in podocytes, as suggested by Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> With regard to S phase-specific genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, we did not find a consistent expression change in cells including podocytes from the glomerular sample (<bold>Supplemental Figure 3G</bold>).</p>
<p>Further, we identified a putative activated pathway involving PKR - STAT3 - PDGF-D - PDGFR-B in injured proximal tubules. The PKR-STAT3-PDGF signaling cascade has been reported in PKR-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> PDGF-D and PDGFR-B contribute to fibrosis in glomeruli and the tubulointerstitium in experimental animal studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Inhibiting this pathway may offer an avenue to reduce kidney injury in HIVAN. Further studies will be needed to confirm whether this mechanism is shared with human HIVAN or other RNA virus-associated kidney diseases.</p>
<p>The present study has limitations. First, the Tg26 mouse model involves a partial HIV-1 transgene that may not recapitulate all aspects of clinical HIVAN. Second, gene expression changes after C16 treatment may include changes secondary to the attenuated renal injury, in addition to the direct effect of C16. Third, we acknowledge possibility of a non-specific effect of C16 as an inhibitor of PKR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, by combining single-nucleus RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq analysis, we identified mitochondrial dysfunction as the central mechanism for proximal tubule injury in the Tg26 HIVAN mouse model. This process that was largely reversed by treatment with the PKR inhibitor C16. Further studies of HIVAN-associated mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to targeted therapeutics.</p>

A series of <bold>compelling</bold> experiments demonstrated that PKR inhibition can ameliorate HIVAN with reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction (mainly confined to endothelial cells), a prominent feature shared in other kidney diseases.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>HIV associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is a rapidly progressing form of kidney disease that manifests secondary to untreated HIV infection and is predominantly seen in individuals of African descent. Tg26 mice carrying an HIV transgene lacking gag and pol exhibit high levels of albuminuria and rapid decline in renal function that recapitulates many features of HIVAN in humans. HIVAN is seen predominantly in individuals carrying two copies of missense variants in the APOL1 gene, and the authors have previously shown that APOL1 risk variant mRNA induces activity of the double strand RNA sensor kinase PKR. Because of the tight association between the APOL1 risk genotype and HIVAN, the authors hypothesized that PKR activation may mediate the renal injury in Tg26 mice, and tested this hypothesis by treating mice with a commonly used PKR inhibitory compound called C16. Treatment with C16 substantially attenuated renal damage in the Tg26 model as measured by urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, urinary NGAL/creatinine ratio and improvement in histology. The authors then performed bulk and single-nucleus RNAseq on kidneys from mice from different treatment groups to identify pathways and patterns of cell injury associated with HIV transgene expression as well as to determine the mechanistic basis for the effect of C16 treatment. They show that proximal tubule nuclei from Tg26 mice appear to have more mitochondrial transcripts which was reversed by C16 treatment and suggest that this may provide evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in this model. They explore this hypothesis by showing there is a decrease in the expression of nuclear encoded genes and proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation as well as a decrease in respiratory capacity via functional assessment of respiration in tubule and glomerular preparations from these mouse kidneys. All of these changes were reversed by C16 treatment. The authors propose the existence of a novel injured proximal tubule cell-type characterized by the leak of mitochondrial transcripts into the nucleus (PT-Mito). Analysis of HIV transgene expression showed high level expression in podocytes, consistent with the pronounced albuminuria that characterizes this model and HIVAN, but transcripts were also detected in tubular and endothelial cells. Because of the absence of mitochondrial transcripts in the podocytes, the authors speculate that glomerular mitochondrial dysfunction in this model is driven by damage to glomerular endothelial cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this study include the comprehensive transcriptional analysis of the Tg26 model, including an evaluation of HIV transgene expression, which has not been previously reported. This data highlights that HIV transcripts are expressed in a subset of podocytes, consistent with the highly proteinuric disease seen in mouse and humans. However, transcripts were also seen in other tubular cells, notably intercalated cells, principal cells and injured proximal tubule cells. Though the podocyte expression makes sense, the relevance of the tubular expression to human disease is still an open question.</p>
<p>The data in support of mitochondrial dysfunction are also robust and rely on combined evidence from downregulation of transcripts involved in oxidative phosphorylation, decreases in complex I and II as determined by immunoblot, and assessments of respiratory capacity in tubular and glomerular preparations. These data are largely consistent with other preclinical renal injury model reported in the literature as well as previous, less thorough assessments in the Tg26 model.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The authors have revised the manuscript to acknowledge the potential limitations of the C16 tool compound used and have performed some additional analyses that suggest the PT-Mito population can be identified in samples from KPMP. The authors added some control images for the in situ hybridizations, which are helpful, though they don't get to the core issue of limited resolution to determine whether mitochondrial RNA is present in the nuclei of injured PT cells. Some additional work has been done to show that C16 treatment results in a decrease in phospho-PKR, a readout of PKR inhibition. These changes strengthen the manuscript by providing some evidence for the translatability of the PT-mito cluster to humans and some evidence for on-target activity for C16. It would be helpful if the authors could quantify the numbers of cells in IHC with nuclear transcripts as well as pointing out some specific examples in the images provided, as comparator data for the snRNAseq studies in which 3-6% of cortex cells had evidence of nuclear mitochondrial transcripts.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Numerous studies by the authors and other groups have demonstrated an important role for HIV gene expression kidney cells in promoting progressive chronic kidney disease, especially HIV associated nephropathy. The authors had previously demonstrated a role for protein kinase R (PKR) in a non-HIV transgenic model of kidney disease (Okamoto, Commun Bio, 2021). In this study, the authors used innovative techniques including bulk and single nuclear RNAseq to demonstrate that mice expressing a replication-incompetent HIV transgene have prominent dysregulation of mitochondrial gene expression and activation of PKR and that treatment of these mice with a small molecule PKR inhibitor ameliorated the kidney disease phenotype in HIV-transgenic mice. They also identified STAT3 as a key upstream regulator of kidney injury in this model, which is consistent with previously published studies. Other important advances include identifying the kidney cell types that express the HIV transgene and have dysregulation of cellular pathways.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Major strengths of the study include the use of a wide variety of state-of-the-art molecular techniques to generate important new data on the pathogenesis of kidney injury in this commonly used model of kidney disease and the identification of PKR as a potential druggable target for the treatment of HIV-induced kidney disease. The authors also identify a potential novel cell type within the kidney characterized by high expression of mitochondrial genes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Though the HIV-transgenic model used in these studies results in a phenotype that is very similar to HIV-associated nephropathy in humans, the model has several limitations that may prevent direct translation to human disease, including the fact that mice lack several genetic factors that are important contributors to HIV and kidney pathogenesis in humans. Additional studies are therefore needed to confirm these findings in human kidney disease.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript would be strengthened with the following key revisions mostly having to do with image quality:</p>
<p>(1) It is very difficult in Figure 4B to see which nuclei actually have evidence of mitochondrial transcripts. It might be helpful to provide arrows to specific cells and also to provide some estimate of the percentage of cells with nuclear mt-transcripts as measured by ISH compared to the 3-6% of cortex cell estimate seen in the snRNAseq analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, now we have added arrows to help readers to see the signals in nuclei. The detection threshold of ISH and single-nucleus RNA-seq should be different, and therefore, measuring estimates of PT-Mito by ISH would not be reliable.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The phospho-PKR images provided as evidence of C16 activity (Supplemental Figure 1) are too dim to be very useful. Could brighter images be provided?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now adjusted the LUTs of images in Supplemental Figure 1.</p>
