<title>Abstract</title><p>Sirtuins are the major players in host immuno-metabolic regulation. However, the role of sirtuins in the modulation of the immune metabolism pertaining to Salmonellosis is largely unknown. Here, our investigation focussed on the role of two important sirtuins, SIRT1 and SIRT3, shedding light on their impact on intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic>’s metabolic switch and pathogenesis establishment. Our study indicated the ability of the live <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium to differentially regulate the levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3 for maintaining the high glycolytic metabolism and low fatty acid metabolism in <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Perturbing SIRT1 or SIRT3 through knockdown or inhibition, resulted in a remarkable shift in intracellular <italic>Salmonella’s</italic> metabolism to high fatty acid oxidation and low glycolysis. This switch led to decreased proliferation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the macrophages. Further, <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced higher levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3 led to a skewed polarization state of the macrophages from a pro- inflammatory M1 state toward an immunosuppressive M2 making it more conducive for the intracellular life of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Alongside, governing immunological functions by modulating p65 NF-κB acetylation, SIRT1, and SIRT3 also skew <italic>Salmonella-</italic>induced host metabolic switch by regulating the acetylation status of HIF-1α and PDHA1. Interestingly, though knock- down of SIRT1/3 attenuated <italic>Salmonella</italic> proliferation in macrophages, in <italic>in vivo</italic> mice-model of infection, inhibition or knockdown of SIRT1/3 led to more dissemination and higher organ burden which can be attributed to enhanced ROS and IL-6 production. Our study hence reports for the first time that <italic>Salmonella</italic> modulates SIRT1/3 levels to maintain its own metabolism for successful pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>In this revised version, we have incorporated several revised data concerning the lactate assay and the animal experiments. In Figure-5-D-E, the lactate assay has been repeated and replotted to its present form with significant outcomes. In Figure-4E and Figure-7J, statistically significant data has been presented. In Figure 1A and 1B the qPCR data of both SIRT1 and SIRT3 has been revised and replotted to obtain significant differences in fold change expression. In Supplementary Figure Fig. S1C and D, the graph has been re-plotted with statistical significance.
To overcome the concern regarding the animal data, the number of replicates has been raised to 8 per cohort and presented in Figure 8 B which previously showed a limited number of animal usage. Likewise, in Figure 8 E-G, the data has been presented with an increased number of replicates per cohort with at least 5 mice per cohort (n=5).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent deacetylases that are present in all forms of life. Sirtuins comprise a conserved core catalytic domain that removes acetyl moiety from the lysine residues of proteins in presence of NAD+ as a cofactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] giving rise to 2’O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and free nicotinamide as products[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Free nicotinamide acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of sirtuins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. They possess variable N terminal and C terminal domains that confer different subcellular localization, substrate specificity, and functions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Mammals have seven sirtuins that are responsible for regulating various biological functions such as cell survival, apoptosis, oxidative stress, metabolism, and inflammation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. SIRT1,6 and 7 have nuclear localization, SIRT2 is cytoplasmic and SIRT 3,4 and 5 comprise the mitochondrial SIRTs. In addition to their deacetylase activity, they possess ADP ribosylation (SIRT1, SIRT4, and SIRT6), desuccinylation and demalonylation (SIRT5), delipoylation (SIRT4), and demyristoylation and depalmitoylation (SIRT6) enzymatic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that SIRT1 gets activated in response to acute immune response and it deacetylates RelA/p65 component of NFκB thereby mediating its proteasomal degradation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. On the other hand, it activates RelB component of NFκB pathway. RelB causes heterochromatinization of pro-inflammatory genes like TNF-α and IL-β[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. SIRT1 activates Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) mediating a metabolic switch from glycolysis toward fatty acid oxidation. SIRT1-mediated RelB activation, in turn, activates SIRT3 causing the promotion of mitochondrial bioenergetics[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. PGC-1α, a major player in mitochondrial biogenesis, activates SIRT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] which in turn causes activation of PGC-1α, thereby fuelling a positive feedback loop. SIRT3 accounts for the major mitochondrial deacetylase orchestrating several metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation, promotion of the TCA cycle, and inhibition of ROS production[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular Gram-negative enteric pathogen, causing a wide array of infections ranging from self-limiting gastroenteritis to diarrhea in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi cause systemic infection in humans with typhoidal symptoms. Recent reports reported incidences of 21 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] typhoid cases and 93 million of non-typhoidal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] cases round the year. The virulence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> is majorly regulated by two pathogenicity islands, namely, SPI-1 and SPI-2. It uses SPI-1 encoded T3SS and the effector proteins to invade host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Inside the macrophages, they harbour within the <italic>Salmonella</italic> containing vacuoles (SCV) by virtue of its SPI-2 effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils are responsible for successful dissemination throughout the body through the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Macrophages, serving as an intracellular niche for <italic>Salmonella,</italic> exhibit several continua of polarization states. At the two extreme ends of the spectrum lie the classically polarized M1 macrophages and alternatively activated M2 macrophages. M1 macrophages comprise of the proinflammatory antimicrobial state producing IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α,IL-12, IFN-γ cytokines and exhibit enhanced expression of CD80, CD86 surface markers. The anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages promote bacterial persistence by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL- 10,TGF-β and show increased expression of Arg-1, CD206 surface markers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. To sustain the continuous production of proinflammatory cytokines M1 macrophages rely on glycolysis for their energy requirements. On the other hand, M2 macrophages are fuelled by enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation (FAO)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].It has been previously reported that sirtuins mediated attuning of metabolism impact polarization of macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic>. SIRT1 has the ability to promote the polarization of M2 macrophages and inhibit inflammation in macrophages of adipose tissue[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. SIRT3 suppresses ROS by deacetylating and activating MnSOD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Several bacteria are known to subvert the host immune system toward an immunosuppressive state. <italic>Salmonella</italic> or <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> have evolved mechanisms to counteract the M1 state of the host macrophage. <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium uses its SPI-2 effectors to inhibit the recruitment of NADPH oxidase to the SCV, thereby preventing oxidative burst mediated microbicidal activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> bacillus Calmette-Guérin prevents NOS2 recruitment to phagosomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. <italic>Salmonella</italic> Dublin causes inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine like IL-18 and IL-12p70[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>Mycobacteria</italic> inhibits NFκB signalling and IFN-γ mediated downstream pathways[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> elicits an M2 response by inducing Arginase-1 expression and TGFβ1 and IL- 4production[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. <italic>Yersinia</italic> TTSS effector LcrV induces an M2 phenotype supposedly by IL-10 production[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Since SIRT1 and SIRT3 are the major modulators of the immuno-metabolic paradigm, we intend to decipher the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in influencing host and <italic>Salmonella</italic> metabolism. This study highlights the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in intracellular pathogen survival by promoting <italic>Salmonella</italic> glycolysis and concomitantly driving host metabolism towards fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, <italic>Salmonella</italic> trigger an immunosuppressive M2 environment conducive to its intravacuolar proliferation by modulating SIRT1 and SIRT3 levels. Here, we have shown that SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown cause decreased M2 surface marker expression such as CD206 along with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS generation, together amounting to attenuated bacterial intracellular proliferation within the infected macrophages. Moreover, SIRT1 mediated p65 NF-κB deacetylation played a vital role in immune function regulation within the <italic>Salmonella</italic> infected macrophages with increased interaction of SIRT1 with p65 NF-κB. SIRT1 knockdown or inhibition resulted in hyperacetylation of p65 NF-κB thereby leading to enhanced pro-inflammatory response in <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infected macrophages. Further, SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown or inhibition skewed the <italic>Salmonella-</italic>induced host metabolic shift by regulating acetylation status of HIF-1α and PDHA. This caused increased host glycolysis and reduced fatty acid oxidation. However, the <italic>Salmonella</italic> shows the opposing metabolic profile with increased fatty acid oxidation and reduced glycolysis upon SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibition. In the contrary to the macrophages, in <italic>in vivo</italic> mice-model of infection, SIRT1 and SIRT3 inhibition resulted in increased pathogen loads in organs and triggered enhanced bacterial dissemination, together leading to increased susceptibility of the mice to <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection owing to increased ROS and IL-6 production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report implying the ability of host Sirtuins in impacting intracellular bacterial metabolism crucial for successful pathogenesis.</p>

<title><italic>Salmonella</italic> modulates SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression along its course of infection in macrophages</title>
<p>Upon infection of RAW 264.7 murine macrophages with wildtype <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium strain 14028S, we observed an increased expression level of SIRT 1 and SIRT3 at initial and middle phases of infection, precisely at 2hr and 6hr post infection through qPCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1, A</xref> and B). The SIRT1 expression level declined at later phases of infection. On the other hand, the SIRT3 transcript levels remained elevated at all time points with respect to uninfected control with marked increment at 16hr time point post infection which subsided at 20hr post infection. We even monitored the expression profile of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in primary macrophages like peritoneal macrophages of C57BL/6 mice and observed a similar trend of elevated expression at initial (2hr), middle (6hr) and late (16hr) time points post infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1, C</xref> and D). In Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CSLM) studies, we observed a similar increase in SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression at 6hr post infection within the infected macrophages RAW264.7 macrophages. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1, E-H</xref>). Immunoblotting revealed increased protein expression of both SIRT1 and SIRT3 at 2hr post-infection in comparison to the uninfected control (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). However, SIRT1 expression exhibits a gradual decline at the late phase of infection (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A,C</xref>). In line with the confocal microscopy data, SIRT3 immunoblotting data shows an increased protein expression profile at 6hr and 16hr post-infection (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1, B-D</xref>). Subsequently, to ascertain whether indeed <italic>Salmonella</italic> could modulate SIRT1 or SIRT3 expression levels, we evaluated the SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression profile within RAW264.7 macrophages upon infection with wildtype <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and SPI-1 (Δ<italic>invC</italic>) (InvC- protein export apparatus) or SPI-2 (Δ<italic>ssaV</italic> and <italic>ΔsteE</italic>) (SsaV- Structural component of SPI-2 needle apparatus, SteE- SPI-2 effector protein involved in driving M2 polarization) mutants of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. Our results depict the ability of wildtype <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium to induce the expression of both SIRT1 and SIRT3 within the infected RAW264.7 macrophages. However, infection with either SPI-1 or SPI-2 mutant abrogates the induction of SIRT1 whereas only SPI-2 mutants (Δ<italic>ssaV</italic> and Δ<italic>steE</italic>) and not SPI-1 mutant infection caused reduction in SIRT3 transcript level expression in the infected macrophages, implicating the role of SPI-1 and SPI- 2 genes in triggering SIRT1 and SIRT3 in the infected macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, I-J</xref>). Further, we examined the transcript level profile of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in M1 or M2 polarized RAW264.7 macrophages and we observed 20-fold and 5-fold increase in SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression in M2 polarized infected macrophages as opposed to 0.5-fold and 0.4 fold downregulation in M1 polarized infected macrophages (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1E,F</xref>). Thus, an increase in expression profile both at transcript and protein levels indicate their role in <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis.</p>

<title>SIRT1 and SIRT3 play crucial role in intracellular bacterial proliferation in infected murine macrophages</title>
<p>As our previous SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression data in the polarized macrophages, hinted at the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in driving polarization of macrophages in the infected macrophages. We validated the intracellular replication of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium within the infected polarized macrophages. <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium exhibited increased intracellular fold proliferation within anti- inflammatory M2 polarized macrophages in comparison to the pro-inflammatory M1 polarized RAW264.7 macrophages (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 G,H</xref>). To evaluate the role of SIRT 1 and SIRT3 in intracellular proliferation of the bacteria within murine macrophages, we have undertaken knock down of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in RAW 264.7 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>) macrophages through PEI mediated transfection of shRNA plasmids directed against SIRT1 and SIRT3. Post 48hr of transfection, the transfected cells were infected with MOI=10 of wildtype <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and gentamicin protection assay was performed. Intracellular proliferation of the bacteria was quantified by plating the cell lysate at 2hr and 16hr post-infection. <italic>Salmonella</italic> exhibits compromised intracellular survival in SIRT1 and SIRT3 knock-down RAW264.7 macrophages in comparison to the un-transfected and scrambled controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2, A</xref>). Further, we have assessed the intracellular proliferation in peritoneal macrophages isolated from thioglycolate treated adult C57BL/6 mice post SIRT1 (EX-527) and SIRT3 (3TYP) inhibitor treatment. SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibitor treated macrophages exhibited attenuated intracellular replication in comparison to the untreated peritoneal macrophages (Fig,2, B). Together, our results depict the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in controlling intracellular <underline>proliferation</underline> of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium.</p>

<title>SIRT1 and SIRT3 inhibition contribute to skewed inflammatory host responses upon <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection</title>
<p>Several reports indicate the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in modulation of host immune responses pertaining to infection scenario[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Therefore, we intend to check whether SIRT1 or SIRT3 regulate immune functions in <italic>Salmonella</italic> infected macrophages. To delineate the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in the modulation of immune responses, we wished to investigate the production of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in knock down (KD) RAW 264.7 macrophages upon <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection. Post 48hr transfection, cells were subjected to wildtype <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection at an MOI of 10. At the indicated time points, cell free supernatant was harvested and evaluated for pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production by ELISA. Inhibition of both SIRT1 and SIRT3 resulted in increase in production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 significantly at 2hr and 20hr post infection (Fig.S3, A). Nevertheless, there was only significant reduction in anti-inflammatory IL-10 production upon SIRT3 KD at 2hr and 20hr post infection but knockdown of SIRT1 did not show any effect on anti-inflammatory cytokine production, IL-10 (Fig.S3, B). In peritoneal macrophages upon SIRT1(EX-527-1µM) or SIRT3(3-TYP-1µM) chemical inhibitor treatment, an increase in IL-6 cytokine levels were observed at 6hr post infection (Fig.S3, C). This indicates the possible role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in regulation of cytokine production upon <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Immune functions are an important determinant of macrophage polarization. Since, SIRT1 and SIRT3 played an immune-modulatory role in <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, we investigated whether <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection is associated with shift in macrophage polarization status. To assess the ability of the pathogen to alter the polarization state of the macrophage, we have undertaken gene expression profiling of various M1 and M2 markers using nanoString nCounter technology along the course of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium infection at the indicated time points in RAW 264.7 macrophages. A gradual shift from pro-inflammatory M1 toward the anti- inflammatory M2 state was observed with the progression of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Along the course of infection there was a reduction in the expression of M1 markers like NOS2, CD40,CD86, TNF-α, Nfkb2,IL-6 and a corresponding increase in the expression of the M2 markers such as Arg-1, CCL-17, CD 206, IL4ra with an exception of Tgf-β (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3, A</xref>).In order to validate the polarization potency of the pathogen, FACS was performed using a pro- inflammatory M1 surface marker, CD86 tagged with PE. The data suggests a distinct decrease in CD86 positive population in the infected sets in comparison to the uninfected and the fixed dead bacteria control along the course of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3, B</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4, A</xref>). Thus, the live pathogen has a propensity to skew the polarization state of the macrophage toward an anti-inflammatory M2 state to subvert the initial acute inflammatory response mounted by the host immune system.</p>

<p>To assess the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in macrophage polarization, we determined anti- inflammatory CD206 surface marker profiling of the infected macrophages through flow cytometry. Knockdown of SIRT1 or SIRT3 in infected RAW 264.7 macrophages resulted in reduction in anti-inflammatory CD206 surface marker expression at 16hr post infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C, Fig</xref>. S4, B). Moreover, SIRT1 or SIRT3 knockdown led to enhanced intracellular ROS generation within the infected macrophages in comparison to the scrambled or the untransfected control (Fig.S5). Further, the Haematoxylin and Eosin staining of the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infected mice liver tissue sections depicted exacerbated signs of inflammation in the SIRT1 (EX-527) or SIRT3 (3TYP) inhibitor treated cohorts in comparison to the untreated controls with multiple necrotic foci and increased influx of inflammatory cell inflates. Moreover, these acute inflammatory signs of the liver sections gets ameliorated in the SIRT1 (SRT1720) activator treated infected cohort (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8, M-N</xref>) (Data described later). Together, these data suggest the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in modulation of host inflammatory response. Previous literature reports have shown that SIRT1 physically interacts with p65 subunit of NF- κB and inhibits transcription by deacetylating p65 at lysine 310 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Moreover, SIRT1 mediated deacetylation of the p65 subunit of the master regulator of the inflammatory response, NF-κB, results in the reduction of the inflammatory responses mediated by this transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. To evaluate the immune regulatory mechanism of SIRT1 in the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (STM) infection scenario, we undertook SIRT1 immunoprecipitation in the infected RAW264.7 macrophages at 16h post infection alongside the uninfected macrophages and probed for NF-κB p65 interaction. We observed an increased interaction of SIRT1 with NF- κB p65 in the infected macrophages in comparison to the uninfected control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4, A</xref>). Further, the knockdown of SIRT1 resulted in increased acetylation status of the NF-κB p65 upon infection in comparison to the scrambled, infected control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4, B</xref>, C). To understand whether the enzymatic domain of SIRT1 possess any role in mediating this interaction, we carried out NF-κB p65 immunoprecipitation in infected RAW264.7 macrophages in presence or absence of SIRT1 catalytic chemical inhibitor, EX-527(1µM) treatment at 16h post-infection. We observed an increased interaction of NF-κB p65 with SIRT1 in the infected untreated macrophages when compared to the untreated uninfected control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4, D</xref>). However, the interaction of NF-κB p65 with SIRT1 gets abrogated under the EX-527 inhibitor treatment in the infected macrophages thereby implying the function of the catalytic domain in mediating the interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4, D</xref>). Moreover, an increased acetylation status of NF-κB p65 was observed in the EX-527 treated infected macrophages in comparison to the untreated infected macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E).</p>

<title>SIRT1 and SIRT3 relieve oxidative stress in infected macrophages and alleviation of the intracellular ROS generation restores intracellular survival of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium within the SIRT1 or SIRT3 knockdown macrophages</title>
<p>Previous reports have suggested the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in oxidative stress conditions. They are known to act in concert as anti-oxidants by reducing ROS production[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Moreover, enhanced ROS production is also a prototype of the classically activated macrophages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Here, we examined the effect of SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown in intracellular ROS generation in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infected RAW264.7 macrophages through DCFDA staining in FACS. Results depicted significant enhancement in the production of ROS at 16hr post infection upon knockdown of SIRT1 or SIRT3 in comparison to untransfected or scrambled control (Fig.S5, A,B). Upon detection of extracellular ROS generation through Phenol Red Hydrogen Peroxidase assay, we detected higher ROS generation upon SIRT3 KD at 6hr post infection and greater ROS production at 16hr and 20hr time points in SIRT1 knockdown macrophages (Fig.S5,C). Therefore, SIRT1 and SIRT3 play an important role in mitigating the oxidative burst in <italic>Salmonella</italic> infected macrophages. Our previous findings depicted decreased intracellular burden of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium within the SIRT1 or SIRT3 knockdown macrophages along with increase in intracellular ROS generation. Therefore, we speculated that the decreased intracellular proliferation within the SIRT1 or SIRT3 knockdown macrophages might be on account of increased intracellular ROS production which might lead to increased killing of the intracellular bacteria. This hypothesis led us to evaluate the intracellular bacterial burden within the infected SIRT1 or SIRT3 knockdown RAW264.7 macrophages or SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibitor treated peritoneal macrophages (isolated from C57BL/6 adult mice post 5<sup>th</sup> day of thioglycolate injection) in presence of a ROS inhibitor named N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC). NAC acts as a scavenger of ROS by antagonizing the activity of proteasome inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. The attenuated intracellular proliferation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium within the knockdown or the chemical inhibitor treated macrophages got restored upon 1mM treatment of ROS scavenger, NAC (Fig.S6). Therefore, intracellular ROS production within the knockdown murine macrophages is one of the reasons for the attenuated survival of the bacteria.</p>

<title>SIRT1 and SIRT3 play crucial role in mediating metabolic switch in infected macrophages</title>
<p>Macrophage polarization is not only governed by immunological changes but also contributed by metabolic reprogramming[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Since previous data suggested progression of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection with the shift in polarization state of the macrophage, we decided to investigate alteration of the metabolic state of the macrophages as macrophage polarization is governed by immune-metabolic shift. In pursuit of fulfilling such requirement, we performed gene expression studies of various metabolic genes through nanoString nCounter technology in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infected RAW 264.7 macrophages. Analysis of the gene profile revealed upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidization and tricarboxylic acid cycle and corresponding downregulation of genes involved in glycolysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5, A</xref>). To validate the findings, we carried out qRTPCR to quantitatively measure the expression of a fatty acid oxidation gene, PPARδ in infected RAW 264.7 macrophages. We found that mRNA level was elevated to 2-fold at 2hr and 6hr post infection. At late phase of infection, 16hr post infection around 6-fold upregulation in mRNA transcript was noted (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5, B</xref>). Lactate estimation assay of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infected RAW264.7 macrophages at the initial time point of 2hr and at the late time point of 16hr post infection revealed decline in lactate (glycolysis end product) production at 16hr in comparison to 2hr post-infection timepoint (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Together, these results suggest the capability of the pathogen to drive a shift in metabolic status of the infected macrophages toward fatty acid oxidation. Next, we evaluated the function of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in influencing the metabolic switch in the infected macrophages through qRT PCR with several host fatty acid oxidizing genes (<italic>Acox</italic>, <italic>Hadha, Pdha</italic>, <italic>and AcadL)</italic> and glycolytic gene (<italic>PfkL</italic>) in SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown macrophages (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7, A</xref>) and via lactate production assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D-E</xref>). Lactate estimation assay in SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown condition revealed enhanced lactate production at 16hr post infection in comparison to the scrambled control which further authenticate the increased host glycolysis upon SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown scenario (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D-E</xref>). SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown RAW 264.7 infected macrophages showed decreased expression of fatty acid oxidizing genes and increased expression of glycolytic <italic>PfkL</italic> gene in comparison to the scrambled infected control (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7, A</xref>). Similar results were obtained in the infected peritoneal macrophages under the SIRT1 or SIRT3 catalytic inhibitor treatment (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig"><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7, B-D</xref></xref>) Moreover, qRT PCR mediated metabolic gene profiling of liver and spleen isolated from wildtype <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infected macrophages revealed decreased transcript level expression of murine fatty acid oxidation genes upon treatment with SIRT1 (EX-527) or SIRT3 (3TYP) catalytic inhibitors which got reversed upon SIRT1 activator (SRT1720) treatment (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7, E-F</xref>). Moreover, SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown or catalytic inhibition in RAW264.7 macrophages resulted in increased protein expression of host glycolytic genes such as Phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk), Phosphofructokinase (Pfk) with concomitant reduction in protein expression of TCA cycle gene like Pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdha1) and fatty acid oxidation genes such as Hadha and Acox1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5, F</xref>). Fatty acid oxidation assay in the RAW264.7 macrophages under SIRT1 or SIRT3 knockdown condition or inhibition treatment revealed significant decrease in fatty acid β oxidation activity of the infected macrophages in comparison to the scrambled or the untreated control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5, G</xref>). To investigate whether the host metabolic switch toward increased fatty acid oxidation is being driven by the pathogen, we performed fatty acid β oxidation activity assay under wildtype <italic>S</italic>.

<title>Mechanism behind SIRT1 or SIRT3 mediated metabolic switch</title>
<p>As per our previous findings, SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibition led to increased host glycolysis and decline in fatty oxidation in the infected macrophages. HIF1α is a master regulator of glycolysis in host during stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Previous reports have suggested HIF1α to be a target of deacetylation by SIRT1 at Lys 674 which contribute to metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. During hypoxia, downregulation of SIRT1 leads to increased acetylation and activation of HIF1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Additionally, in CD4+ T cells, ectopic expression of SIRT1 inhibited IL-9 production and glycolysis by negatively regulating HIF1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. To delve into the mechanism behind SIRT1 mediated modulation of metabolic responses, we assessed the interaction of SIRT1 with HIF-1α in infected RAW264.7 macrophages. The immunoprecipitation studies of SIRT1 showed increased interaction of the SIRT1 with HIF1α in the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection scenario with respect to the uninfected control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7, A</xref>). Further, we evaluated the acetylation status of HIF1α in the SIRT1 knockdown status of the infected macrophages. We found that SIRT1 knockdown showed increased acetylation of HIF1α in the infected macrophages in comparison to the scrambled infected control at 16hr post infection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, B</xref>,C). Immunoprecipitation studies under SIRT1 (EX-527) inhibitor treatment in RAW264.7 macrophages revealed increased acetylation of HIF1-α along with reduced interaction of HIF-1α with SIRT1, thereby indicating the probable role of the catalytic domain in influencing the interaction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D-F). Together, our results implicate the role of SIRT1 in governing glycolytic shift in the infected macrophages by deacetylating HIF1α. Upon SIRT1 knockdown or inhibition, HIF1α gets hyperacetylated which cause activation of the downstream glycolytic genes. Alternatively, several key literatures suggest the role of SIRT3 in modulating metabolic programming by deacetylating several proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. PDHA1 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1 subunit alpha) is a key enzyme linking glycolysis to TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. SIRT3 regulates PDHA1 acetylation by deacetylating PDHA1 at lysine 385 residue, thereby playing a key role in metabolic reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. PDHA1 acetylation coincides with PDH activity and increased PDHA1 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the role of SIRT3 in the modulation of the host fatty acid oxidation upon <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection in RAW264.7 macrophages. To do so, we immunoprecipitated PDHA1 and checked for its interaction with SIRT3 or SIRT1 under knockdown condition of SIRT3 or upon SIRT3 inhibitor treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7</xref> G-H). We observed an increased interaction of PDHA1 with SIRT3 in the infection scenario in comparison to the uninfected control which gets eventually abolished under the knockdown condition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7</xref> G-H) and under the chemical inhibitor treatment of SIRT3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7, I-K</xref>) suggesting the role of the SIRT3 in mediating the interaction with PDHA1. Alongside the decreased interaction of PDHA1 with SIRT3, increased acetylation of PDHA1 was detected upon SIRT3 inhibitor treatment in infected macrophages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7, I-K</xref>).</p>

<title>SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibition enhances bacterial burden in mice <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>6-8 weeks old adult male C57BL/6 mice were treated with SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527, SIRT3 inhibitor 3TYP and SIRT1 activator SRT1720 at a dose of 1mg/kg each via intraperitoneal injection (every alternate Day) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Following the inhibitor treatment, the mice were orally gavaged with 10<sup>7</sup> cfu of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium 14028S for organ burden evaluation or with 10<sup>8</sup> cfu of wildtype <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium for survival studies. On day 5<sup>th</sup> post infection, mice were sacrificed, and the liver, spleen and Mesenteric Lymph Node (MLN) were harvested for enumeration of the organ burden. The SIRT1 inhibitor, EX-527 and SIRT3 inhibitor, 3TYP treated mice cohorts exhibited increased organ loads in liver, spleen and MLN in comparison to the vehicle control. On the contrary, the SRT1720 treated mice group showed organ burden comparable to that of the vehicle control (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, B</xref>). Moreover, the SIRT1 and the SIRT3 inhibitor treated mice cohorts died earlier than the vehicle treated control mice group or the the SIRT1 activator treated group (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, C</xref>). Further, the SIRT1 and the SIRT3 inhibitor treated mice cohorts showed increased splenic length in comparison to the vehicle treated mice group and the SIRT1 activator treated mice cohort (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, D</xref>). The increased organ burden in the EX- 527 or 3TYP treated group might be due to increased bacterial dissemination in blood. To assess bacterial dissemination, blood was collected from infected mice post inhibitor treatment at specific days post infection retro-orbitally and plated onto <italic>Salmonella Shigella</italic> (SS) agar plates for bacterial enumeration. Indeed, increased bacterial dissemination was observed in the blood of mice treated with SIRT1 inhibitor, EX-527 or SIRT3 inhibitor, 3TYP at day 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- post infection in comparison to the vehicle treated mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, E</xref>). Further, we wanted to examine whether the increased bacterial dissemination was due to increased ROS production or due to the presence of elevated inflammatory cytokine levels like IL-6 in the serum. In the wildtype C57BL/6 mice treated with SIRT3 inhibitor 3TYP showed heightened bacterial burden in blood at 5<sup>th</sup> day post infection in comparison to the vehicle control. Nevertheless, the <italic>gp91phox</italic>-/- mice group lacking the catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase did not depict significant variation in the bacterial load among the different mice treatment cohorts (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, F</xref>). Further, the EX-527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) and the 3TYP (SIRT3 inhibitor) treated mice possessed elevated levels of serum IL-6 and showed increased intracellular ROS burden in infected liver tissues in comparison to the vehicle treated control and the SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator) treated mice group (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, G-H</xref>). The increased mouse serum IL-6 production was in similar line with the increased IL-6 cytokine generation in EX-527 or 3TYP treated peritoneal macrophages under infection scenario (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3, C</xref>). However, contrary to the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies wherein SIRT1 or SIRT3 knockdown or inhibition resulted in attenuated intracellular proliferation, here in <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model of infection, we observed increased bacterial organ loads owing to increased bacterial dissemination. To delineate this observation further, we evaluated the bacterial load within splenocytes isolated from control or inhibitor treated C57BL/6 mice infected with GFP expressing <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium at 5<sup>th</sup> day post-infection via flow cytometry. We observed heightened bacterial load in the EX-527 or the 3TYP treated mice cohorts (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, I-J</xref>). However, when we enumerated the bacterial count within the F4/80+ macrophage population of the infected splenocytes, we noticed decreased bacterial loads in the EX-527 or 3TYP treated mice group in comparison to the vehicle treated control group or the SRT-1720 activator treated group (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, K-L</xref>). This opposing phenotype could be attributed to the increased IL-6 cytokine storm and elevated ROS production upon the SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibitor treatment which in turn resulted in bacterial dissemination <italic>in vivo</italic> and concomitantly restricted the <italic>in vitro</italic> intracellular proliferation within macrophages. To validate this observation, we estimated the ROS levels within the liver and spleen tissues harvested from <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infected C57BL/6 mice, treated with specific catalytic inhibitor, activator or vehicle via DCFDA staining using flow cytometry at 5<sup>th</sup> day post infection. We detected escalated levels of ROS within both the infected liver and spleen tissues of the EX-527 or 3TYP treated mice groups in comparison to the vehicle treated or the SRT1720 treated mice cohorts (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, H</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8</xref>). Haematoxylin and eosin staining of the liver sections (harvested at 5<sup>th</sup> day post infection) revealed increased inflammation with multiple areas of severe acute hepatic necrosis with complete loss of hepatic architecture in the EX-527 and 3-TYP treated liver samples in comparison to the vehicle treated control and SRT-1720 treated liver samples (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, M-N</xref>). In line with the inhibitor-treated studies, the increased organ loads, and systemic dissemination driven heightened susceptibility of mice toward <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection were replicated in <italic>in vivo</italic> SIRT1 and SIRT3 adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) mediated knockdown mice model which showed elevated IL-6 production in comparison to the scrambled control treated mice cohort (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, O-Q</xref>). Simultaneously, the haematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of the liver tissues harvested from the shSIRT1 or shSIRT3 mice cohorts depicted increased pathological scoring with multiple necrotic areas and severely damaged liver tissue architecture in comparison to the scrambled mice control (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, R</xref>). Altogether, our results implicate the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in controlling <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several studies have confirmed the propensity of <italic>Salmonella</italic> to skew the polarization state of the infected macrophages toward an immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory state[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. We have validated such findings and further elaborated it by depicting the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in the modulation of host immune responses as well as host-bacterial metabolism. <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium infection modulates the expression profile of both SIRT1 and SIRT3 in the infected macrophages at both mRNA and protein level via its SPI-2 effector. Downregulation of SIRT1 and SIRT3 through shRNA mediated knockdown resulted in heightened pro-inflammatory immune responses with increased production of IL-6 cytokine and decreased surface expression of anti-inflammatory CD206. SIRT1 and SIRT3 downregulation also resulted in increased intracellular ROS production in the infected macrophages. SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown macrophages not only show altered host immune status but also depicted shift in the metabolic state with increased glycolytic shift. This altered host metabolism upon SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown condition influence the outcome of infection by regulating the intracellular bacterial metabolism which show reduced bacterial glycolysis and increased fatty acid oxidation. All these outcomes account for attenuated intracellular bacterial proliferation in the SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown macrophages. However, in murine model of infection, SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibitor treatment led to increased organ burden and triggered bacterial dissemination (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>). Overall, our study highlights the crucial role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in governing the host immune-metabolic shift during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection which in turn is vital for maintaining <italic>Salmonella</italic> metabolism.</p>
<p>Previous reports have elucidated the role of SIRT1 and SIRT2 pertaining to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Ganesan et al., have depicted the role of SIRT1 in autophagy in <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection scenario[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Gogoi et al., have demonstrated SIRT2 mediated modulation of immune responses in dendritic cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Till date, there is no report highlighting the role of SIRT3 governing the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis. The function of SIRT3 in infection scenario has been explored quite recently. In <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection condition, SIRT3 control mitochondrial function and autophagy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. SIRT3 downregulation in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infected macrophages is associated with dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism and increased cell death[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. In this study we have explored the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in mediating host immune-metabolic switch in <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium infected macrophages which further govern intracellular bacterial metabolism and pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in mediating polarization of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> infected macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory state. Upon knockdown of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in the infected macrophages we detect robust pro-inflammatory response and oxidative burst. This is in line with the findings by S.Elsela et al., wherein SIRT1 knockout RSV(Respiratory Syncytial Virus) - infected BMDCs showed significant increase in <italic>Il1β</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Il23</italic> expression and ROS generation in comparison to the wild type RSV-infected BMDCs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Also, Kim et al., showed presence of aggravated inflammatory responses in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infected SIRT3-/- BMDMs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. This heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine and oxidative burst restrict the intracellular survival of the pathogen as detected by the lower intracellular bacterial burden in the SIRT1 and SIRT3 knockdown murine macrophages. <italic>Salmonella</italic> showed enhanced proliferation in the M2 macrophages owing to the reduced arsenals in terms of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS production. Moreover, the M2 macrophages are fuelled by increased fatty acid oxidation and reduced glycolysis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. This might facilitate enhanced bacterial proliferation as the host un-utilized intracellular glucose can be readily up taken by the pathogen and used to support its own glycolysis. Similarly, M1 or pro-inflammatory macrophages resort to glycolysis to meet their energy demands[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>] thereby limiting the glucose availability for the intracellular pathogen[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. In such condition, bacteria show enhanced fatty acid metabolism to sustain their energy demand[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. In our study, we found that wild type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection drive host metabolism toward increased fatty acid oxidation via its SPI-2 effector protein with concomitant increase in the bacterial glycolysis. SIRT1 and SIRT3 inhibition abrogates the metabolic switch and triggers increase in host glycolysis which in turn skew the bacterial metabolism from increased glycolysis to enhanced fatty acid oxidation and reduced glycolysis. Together, these findings implicate the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in reprograming the host metabolism which in turn affect the intracellular nutrient niche of the pathogen thereby influencing intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic> proliferation. However, our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings in the murine model of infection show increased bacterial burden upon SIRT1 or SIRT3 inhibition. This increased burden could be attributed to increased dissemination from the macrophages into the bloodstream owing to the increased level of serum IL-6 levels. This is in concert with previous findings in <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> infection in mice wherein increased inflammatory response upon HIF-1α activation induces bacterial dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Further correlation analysis of immune responses to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection revealed that increased innate immune “cassette” opposes the adaptive immune arm leading to increased bacterial load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. Future studies might explore the host and bacterial interacting partners of SIRT1 and SIRT3 through mass spectrometry analyses in <italic>Salmonella</italic> infected macrophages which might hint at the underlying mechanism of their action and regulation. Together, this study highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of host-pathogen interactions, and the need for further research to fully understand the role of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in the context of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> knockdown</title>
<p>For in vivo knockdown adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) was used. AAV6 viruses were produced in HEK293T cells. Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with AAV plasmid encoding shRNAs targeting SIRT1, SIRT3 and scramble control under U6 promoter together with helper plasmid using PEI Max 40000 (Polysciences USA). Next day transfection medium was removed, and fresh culture medium was added. Forty-eight hours later, medium was collected, and fresh culture medium was added and incubated for next forty-eight hours. Again, culture medium was collected and cells were harvested by trypsinization. Collected medium containing secreted AAV viral particles was incubated with 40% PEG 8000 overnight. Precipitated viral particles were then collected by centrifugation and re-suspended in PBS. Cells containing AAV viral particles were then lysed with citrate buffer and incubated with 40% PEG 8000 and processed similarly to medium for viral particle precipitation. Precipitated viral particles were then cleaned with chloroform and loaded on iodixanol gradient for further cleaning using ultracentrifugation. Cleaned viral particles were collected from the forty percent gradient and loaded on Amicon 100K cut-off columns. Purified AAV particles were then titrated by real-time PCR. For infection of AAV6, the mice were intravenously injected with a volume of 200 μl containing approximately 10<sup>12</sup> viral particles harbouring the respective scrambled or shRNA constructs. The mice were infected at 7<sup>th</sup> day after injection of the virus with 10<sup>6</sup> cfu units of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium orally. Fifth day post-infection, mice were euthanized, and dissected out for organ harvesting and blood collection.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The current manuscript by Hajra et al deals with the role of the prominent Sirtuins SIRT1 and -3 during infection of macrophages with Salmonella Typhimurium (ST). Apparently, ST infection induces upregulation of host cell SRTs to aid its own metabolism during the intracellular lifestyle and to help reprogramming macrophage polarization. The manuscript has two parts, namely one part that deals with Salmonella infection in cells, where RAW 264.7 murine macrophage-like cells, sharing some features with primary macrophages, were employed. Infected RAW cells displayed a tendency to polarize towards wound-healing M2 and not inflammatory M1 macrophages, which was dependent on SRT. Consequently, the inflammatory response in RAW was more robust in the absence of SRT. Moreover, loss of SRTs leads to impaired bacterial proliferation in these cells, which was attributed to defects in metabolic adaption of the bacteria in the absence of SRT-activity and to the increased M1 inflammatory response.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the line of argumentation remains incomplete because corresponding assays in mice showed the opposite result as compared to the experiments using RAW 264.7 cells. i.e. loss of SRTs leads to increased bacterial load in animals (versus impaired proliferation in RAW 264.7 cells). The authors cannot explain this discrepancy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Extensive analysis of Salmonella infection in RAW macrophage-like cells and mice in the context of SRT1/3 function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Lack of connection between the cell-based and organismic data, which are not supportive of each other.</p>

<p>Dipasree Hajra et al demonstrated that Salmonella was able to modulate the expression of Sirtuins (Sirt1 and Sirt3) and regulate the metabolic switch in both host and Salmonella, promoting its pathogenesis. The authors found Salmonella infection induced high levels of Sirt1 and Sirt3 in macrophages, which were skewed toward the M2 phenotype allowing Salmonella to hyper-proliferate. Mechanistically, Sirt1 and Sirt3 regulated the acetylation of HIF-1alpha and PDHA1, therefore mediating Salmonella-induced host metabolic shift in the infected macrophages. Interestingly, Sirt1 and Sirt3-driven host metabolic switch also had an effect on the metabolic profile of Salmonella. Counterintuitively, inhibition of Sirt1/3 led to increased pathogen burdens in an in vivo mouse model. Overall, this is a well-designed study. There are a few comments below that would further strengthen the current study.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>
In the in vivo study (lines 436-446) - the authors noticed increased pathogen burden in the EX-527 or the 3TYP-treated mice cohorts but decreased pathogen burden within the F4/80+ macrophage population. What are the other cell types that have increased pathogen burden in splenocytes from EX-527 or the 3TYP treated? Can this be further explored and explained?</p>
<p>While the authors indicated that IL-6 cytokine storm and elevated ROS production could result in bacterial dissemination in vivo, one could also argue that Sirt1/3 inhibitors might have an impact on gut function and/or gut microbiota (PMID: 22115311). Did Sirt1/3 inhibitors also lead to increased pathogen burdens in the gut? If so, the potential effect of these in vivo treatments on gut microbiota/colonization resistance should be discussed.</p>
<p>Minor comment:</p>
<p>
Sirt1 has been shown to be degraded during Salmonella infection (PMID: 28192515), which is different from the current study. An explanation should be provided for this.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this paper, Hajra et al have attempted to identify the role of Sirt1 and Sirt3 in regulating metabolic reprogramming and macrophage host defense. They have performed gene knockdown experiments in RAW macrophage cell lines to show that depletion of Sirt1 or Sirt3 enhances the ability of macrophages to eliminate Salmonella Typhimurium. However, in mice, inhibition of Sirt1 resulted in dissemination of the bacteria but the bacterial burden was still reduced in macrophages. They suggest that the effect they have observed is due to increased inflammation and ROS production by macrophages. They also try to establish a weak link with metabolism. They present data to show that the switch in metabolism from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation is regulated by acetylation of Hif1a, and PDHA1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The strength of the manuscript is that the role of Sirtuins in host-pathogen interactions has not been previously explored in-depth making the study interesting. It is also interesting to see that depletion of either Sirt1 or Sirt3 results in a similar outcome.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The major weakness of the paper is the low quality of data, making it harder to substantiate the claims. Also, there are too many pathways and mechanisms being investigated. It would have been better if the authors had focussed on either Sirt1 or Sirt3 and elucidated how it reprograms metabolism to eventually modulate host response against Salmonella Typhimurium. Experimental evidence is also lacking to prove the proposed mechanisms. For instance, they show correlative data that the knockdown of Sirt1-mediated shift in metabolism is due to HIF1a acetylation but this needs to be proven with further experiments.</p>
