<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Reports indicate that an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 could be widely involved in water efflux of exocrine glands, suggesting that the interaction could play a role in perspiration. In secretory cells of sweat glands present in mouse foot pads, TRPV4 clearly colocalized with cytokeratin 8, anoctamin 1 (ANO1) and aquaporin-5 (AQP5). Mouse sweat glands showed TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases that was inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type, but not TRPV4-deficient mice, and was inhibited by menthol. Sweating could be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads, and this possibility is supported by the finding that wild-type mice climbed up a slippery slope more easily than TRPV4-deleted mice. Furthermore, TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with AIGA (acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA. Collectively, TRPV4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with anoctamin 1, and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 complex would be targets to develop agents that regulate perspiration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sweating is a vital physiological process.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Shibasaki &amp; Crandall, 2010</xref>) There are two basic types of sweating: thermoregulatory and emotional sweating, in addition to gustatory sweating, largely localized to the face and neck regions, that occurs while consuming some foods, particularly pungent foods.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Lee, 1954</xref>) Most sweat glands are of the eccrine type, and they produce a thin secretion that is hypotonic to plasma. Although eccrine sweat glands are distributed all over the body, their density is highest in the axillary region and on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. In humans, the main function of eccrine sweat glands is body temperature regulation. Meanwhile, apocrine sweat glands are found primarily in the axillae and urogenital regions. These scent glands become active during puberty and secrete a viscous fluid that is associated with body odor.</p>
<p>Body temperature regulation is important to maintain a homeostasis. Body temperature is poorly controlled in patients with hypohidrosis. Meanwhile, patients affected by hyperhidrosis can have difficulty in social and professional situations due to increased sweat production, and the resulting subjective perception of illness at an individual level may be substantial.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cohen &amp; Solish, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Schlereth et al., 2009</xref>) However, the molecular mechanisms of perspiration are not clearly understood.</p>
<p>We previously reported the functional interaction between TRP channels and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, anoctamin 1 (ANO1, also known as TMEM16A). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Derouiche et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Takayama et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2015</xref>) TRP channels have high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gees et al., 2012</xref>) Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering cells through TRP channels activates anoctamin 1 leading to Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux that promotes formation of a physical complex in cells with high intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations. The Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux may drive water efflux through water channels in exocrine gland acinar cells that increases exocrine function, and causes primary sensory neuron depolarization that increases nociception. For skin keratinocytes that have relatively low intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations, interaction between TRPV3 and ANO1 causes Cl<sup>-</sup> influx, followed by increased cellular movement/proliferation in response to cell cycle modulation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Yamanoi et al., 2023</xref>) Thus, direction of Cl<sup>-</sup> movement through ANO1 is simply determined by the balance between equilibrium potentials of Cl<sup>-</sup> and membrane potentials in each cell.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Takayama et al., 2019</xref>)</p>
<p>Involvement of TRPV4 in exocrine gland function prompted us to examine the functional interaction in perspiration, because TRPV4 is expressed in human eccrine sweat glands.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Delany et al., 2001</xref>) Although sweat glands are innervated by sympathetic neurons, acetylcholine is released from the nerve endings.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Hu et al., 2018</xref>) We show that the functional interaction of TRPV4 and ANO1 is involved in temperature-dependent sweating and increased friction force.</p>

<title>Expression of TRPV4, anoctamin 1 and AQP5 in mouse sweat glands</title>
<p>We detected expression of TRPV4, ANO1 and the water channel aquaporin-5 (AQP5) in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads. The secretory coil is located in the deep dermis and a relatively straight duct opens to the skin surface. We first validated an anti-TRPV4 antibody that we generated. This anti-TRPV4 antibody conspicuously labeled the basal layer of the epidermis, secretory eccrine gland cells, and duct cells only in skin from wild-type (WT) mice, but not in skin from TRPV4-deficient (TRPV4KO) mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating the antibody specificity. TRPV4 was clearly localized in secretory glands as confirmed by positivity for cytokeratin 8 (CK8), a secretory cell marker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The duct cells were not labeled by ANO1 and CK8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). TRPV4-immunoreactivity was stronger in duct cells near the secretory region and gradually diminished in the distal excretory ducts toward the epidermis. Bilayered sweat ducts showed TRPV4 labeling in basal cells but not suprabasal cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Secretory cells in human eccrine glands are classified into two types: clear cells that mainly secrete water and electrolytes, and dark cells that secrete macromolecules like glycoproteins. We found that TRPV4-expressing secretory cells were positive for the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a dark cell marker, and were heterogeneously labeled (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This result is consistent with earlier studies showing that mouse eccrine glands have a more primitive structure than human glands, and have only one type of secretory cell that resembles human clear cells but also has dark cell characteristics.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bovell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kurosumi &amp; Kurosumi, 1970</xref>)</p>

<p>To explore TRPV4 subcellular localization, we observed tissues using Airyscan super-resolution imaging. TRPV4 was heterogeneously labeled in the gland cells, and showed apparent localization in basal and apical membranes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). TRPV4 was absent in myoepithelial cells. Conspicuous co-labeling of TRPV4 and ANO1 or AQP5 with filamentous actin (F-actin) was seen at the apical site (luminal side) of the secretory cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These close topological relationships clearly suggest that TRPV4, ANO1 and AQP5 would be able to form a complex that promotes sweat secretion in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads. These results also suggest that TRPV4-expressing secretory cells are involved in secretion of macromolecular components as well as secretion of water and ions.</p>

<title>Functional expression of TRPV4 in acinar cells of mouse sweat glands</title>
<p>Next, we examined functional TRPV4 expression. WT mouse sweat glands responded to the TRPV4 agonist, GSK (500 nM) and to acetylcholine (Ach, 10 μM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). No cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase induced by GSK was observed in sweat glands from TRPV4KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the GSK-induced increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was significantly inhibited by menthol (5 μM) in WT mouse sweat glands, suggesting that menthol inhibited TRPV4 function. Meanwhile, menthol alone caused no change in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These data indicated functional expression of TRPV4 in secretory cells.</p>

<title>TRPV4 involvement in perspiration in mice</title>
<p>To examine the functional interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 in mouse sweat glands <italic>in vivo</italic>, stimulated sweating induced by Ach (100 μM, 2 min) in mouse hind paws at 25 °C and 35 °C was investigated using an iodine and starch reaction to measure secreted amylase.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Nejsum et al., 2002</xref>) At 25 °C, no difference in stimulated sweating was seen between WT and TRPV4KO. However, at 35 °C, stimulated sweating tended to increase in WT mice with no similar increase seen for TRPV4KO, although the difference between WT and TRPV4KO mice did not statistically differ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Temperature-dependent basal sweating without stimulation for 15 min was also observed for WT mice, but not in TRPV4KO mice and this difference was statistically significant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref>). Menthol inhibits both TRPV4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) and ANO1 function.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Takayama et al., 2017</xref>) The ability of menthol to inhibit both TRPV4 and ANO1 suggests that menthol would inhibit sweating. Accordingly, we compared stimulated sweating with either ethanol vehicle (used for menthol dilution) or menthol treatment for 2 min. Menthol treatment caused a significantly lower degree of sweating than ethanol treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>). This result could indicate that menthol inhibits sweating by inhibiting the function of both TRPV4 and ANO1.</p>

<title>Physiological significance of TRPV4-mediated sweating</title>
<p>Mice do not sweat to control body temperature, so the physiological significance of hind paw sweating is unclear. In humans, fingertip moisture is known to be optimally modulated during object manipulation through regulation of friction force.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">André et al., 2010</xref>) The same mechanism might promote for traction of hind paws when mice climb slippery slopes. Here we constructed a slope covered with slippery vinyl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and compared climbing behaviors of WT and TRPV4KO for 1 hour at 26-27 °C with 35-50% humidity. The total number of climbing attempts was the same for WT and TRPV4KO mice (25.6 ± 2.5 for WT, n = 5; 24.7 ± 3.9 for TRPV4KO, n = 4) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), but a higher percentage of WT mice successfully climbed to the top of the slope than did TRPV4KO mice (79.5 ± 6.4% for WT; 41.8 ± 2.8% for TRPV4KO; p &lt; 0.01) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4CD</xref>) (Suppl. video). And WT mice easily came down the slippery slope. These data suggest that WT mice might produce more hind paw sweat (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) that increases traction on the slope.</p>

<title>TRPV4 expression in human sweat glands</title>
<p>We next examined whether TRPV4 also plays a role in human perspiration. Patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) have acquired impairment in total body sweating even when exposed to heat or engaging in exercise.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Munetsugu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Nakazato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Sano et al., 2017</xref>) We compared TRPV4 expression in sweat glands from patients with melanocytic nevus (n = 10, ages; 15 – 63) as controls and patients with AIGA (n = 10, ages; 24 -55). All patients with AIGA were male, which is consistent with the gender distribution of AIGA, while two of the 10 controls were female. Representative TRPV4 staining is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B</xref>. Although signals for TRPV4 staining were high in normohidrotic skin from a patient with AIGA and were equivalent to those of controls, levels in anhidrotic skin from the same patient with AIGA were very low.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering cells through TRP channels is known to be involved in various Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated events, particularly in non-excitable cells, whereas cation influx-induced depolarization is important for excitation of primary sensory neurons through activation of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Derouiche et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Takayama et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2015</xref>) Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering cells is instantaneously chelated to maintain low intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. However, high Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions can persist for longer periods just beneath the plasma membrane. We reported that several TRP channels including TRPV1, TRPV3, TRPV4 and TRPA1 can form a complex with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, ANO1, and activate ANO1 via Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering cells through TRP channels.<sup>5–7</sup> Interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 causes Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux, followed by water efflux, suggesting that the complex could be involved in exocrine gland functions including secretion of cerebrospinal fluid, saliva and tears.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Derouiche et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Takayama et al., 2014</xref>) We demonstrated that the TRPV4-ANO1 interaction is also involved in water efflux associated with the exocrine function during sweating in this study. Digestive secretion could also involve this interaction. Notably, the TRPV4, ANO1 and AQP5 complex is confined to acinar cells in secretory sweat glands, whereas TRPV4 is also expressed at other sites in skin tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This result could indicate a specific function for the complex in water efflux occurring in exocrine glands.</p>
<p>Several human diseases involve hypohidrosis or hyperhidrosis.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cheshire, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cohen &amp; Solish, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Schlereth et al., 2009</xref>) Patients with hypohidrosis have difficulty regulating body temperature in response to high temperatures and can experience dizziness, muscle cramps, weakness, high fever or nausea that is typically not serious. However, patients with hypohidrosis sometimes have heatstroke, which is the most serious complication; the incidence of heatstroke has recently increased with global warming. Furthermore, some patients with collagen diseases like Sjögren’s syndrome, an autoimmune exocrinopathy, suffer from hypohidrosis as well as dry mouth and dry eye that is not easily treated.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Katayama, 2018</xref>) AIGA is also characterized by hypohidrosis without clear etiology.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Munetsugu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Nakazato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Sano et al., 2017</xref>) In Japan, both Sjögren’s syndrome and AIGA are classified as designated intractable diseases (No. 53 and 163, respectively). Problems with exocrine gland function in Sjögren’s syndrome patients as well as the low TRPV4 expression levels in patients with AIGA suggest that TRPV4 could be a key molecule involved in these diseases and that novel treatment strategies could target TRPV4 and/or ANO1.</p>
<p>The application of menthol to the skin produces a cool sensation that is generally thought to result from the activation of the menthol receptor TRPM8. However, the finding here that menthol inhibits both TRPV4 and ANO1 suggests that transient reduction in sweating by inhibiting formation of the TRPV4-ANO1 complex also contributes to the cool sensation. On the other hand, patients with hyperhidrosis can sweat enough to soak their clothing or have sweat drip off their hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cohen &amp; Solish, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Schlereth et al., 2009</xref>). Hyperhidrosis can occur as a primary or secondary effect after infections or with some endocrine diseases. Others can experience hyperhidrosis on the palms of their hands when nervous. Development of chemicals targeting TRPV4, ANO1 or the complex could be a new therapeutic strategy for these conditions, for which there are currently no effective treatments.</p>
<p>Many TRP channels have high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering cells through TRP channels in turn activates more Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated proteins including other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated ion channels such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels. This interaction could expand the importance of TRP channels in physiological functions, and complexes between TRP channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated proteins would be novel targets for drug development.</p>

<title>Mouse immunostaining</title>
<p>Experiments were performed using 8-to 21-wk-old male and female mice. Mice (n = 4 per group) were anesthetized with a combination of hydrochloric acid medetomidine (0.75mg/kg; Kyoritsu Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan), butorphanol (5mg/kg; Meiji Seika Pharma, Tokyo, Japan), and midazolam (4mg/kg, Maruishi, 21-3981), and perfused transcardially with heparinized PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The hind paw pad skin was dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 3 h at 4 °C, cryoprotected with 20% sucrose overnight and then embedded in OCT compound. For immunohistochemistry, 5μm-thick frozen sections were made with a NX50 cryostat. Sections were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated with a blocking solution, PBS supplemented with 0.3% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% sodium azide and 5% normal donkey serum for 45 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies: guinea pig anti-TRPV4 (2 μg/mL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Kitsuki et al., 2020</xref>), rabbit anti-ANO1 (1:100, Abcam, ab53213), rabbit anti-AQP5 (1:200, Millipore, 178615), rabbit anti-CGRP (1:2000, Amersham International, RPN.1842), rat anti-cytokeratin 8 (CK8) (1:100, Millipore, MABT329), and rat anti-E-cadherin (1:200, Takara Bio, M108).

<p>TRPV4 is a unique cation channel that has been demonstrated to play a role in a variety of sensory processes. The authors provide <bold>useful</bold> new data to indicate that TRPV4 activation occurs in eccrine gland cells.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Makiko Kashio et al aimed to uncover a potential role of exocrine gland-expressing TRPV4 in perspiration. Pharmacological and genetic tools were employed to verify a TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increase, which may contribute to sweat in mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors identified a functional expression of TRPV4 in sweat glands.</p>
<p>
(2) The lower expression of TRPV4 in anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA suggested a potential role of TRPV4 in perspiration.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Measurement of secreted amylase could be seen as direct evidence of sweating, however, how to determine the causal relationship between climbing behavior and sweating? Friction force may also be reduced when there is too much fingertip moisture.</p>
<p>(2) For the human skin immunostaining, did the author use the same TRPV4 antibody as used in the mouse staining? Did they validate the specificity of the antibody for the human TRPV4 channel?</p>
<p>(3) In lines 116-117, the authors tried to determine &quot;the functional interaction of TRPV4 and ANO1 is involved in temperature-dependent sweating&quot;, however, they only used the TRPV4 ko mice and did not show any evidence supporting the relationship between TRPV4 and ANO1.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 3-4 is quite confusing. At 25˚C, no sweating difference was observed between TRPV4 and wt mice (Fig 3A-3D), suggesting both Ach-induced sweating and basal sweating are TRPV4-independent at 25˚C, however, the climbing test was done at 26-27 ˚C and the data showed a climbing deficit in TRPV4 ko mice. How to interpret the data is unclear.</p>
<p>(5) Was there any gender differences associated with sweating in mice? In Figure 3, the mouse number for behavior tests should be at least 5.</p>
<p>(8) 8- to 21-week-old mice were used in the immunostaining, the time span is too long.</p>
<p>(6) The authors used homozygous TRPV4 ko mice for all experiments. What are control mice? Are they littermates of the TRPV4 ko mice?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Kashio et al examined the role of TRPV4 in regulating perspiration in mice. They find coexpression of TRPV4 with the chloride channel ANO1 and aquaporin 5, which implies possible coupling of heat sensing through TRPV4 to ion and water excretion through the latter channels. Calcium imaging of eccrine gland cells revealed that the TRPV4 agonist GSK101 activates these cells in WT mice, but not in TRPV4 KO. This effect is reduced with cold-stimulating menthol treatment. Temperature-dependent perspiration in mouse skin, either with passive heating or with ACh stimulation, was reduced in TRPV4 KO mice. Functional studies in mice - correlating the ability to climb a slippery slope to properly regulate skin moisture levels - reveal potential dysregulation of foot pad perspiration in TRPV4 KO mice, which had fewer successful climbing attempts. Lastly, a correlation of TRPV4 to hypohydrosis in humans was shown, as anhidrotic skin showed reduced levels of TRPV4 expression compared to normohidrotic or control skin.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The functional studies of mice climbing slippery slopes is a novel method to determine mechanisms of functional perspiration in mice. Since mice do not perspire for thermoregulation, other functional readouts are needed to study perspiration in mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The coexpression data needs additional controls. In the TRPV4 KO mice, there appears to be staining with the TRPV4 Ab in TRPV4 KO mice below the epidermis. This pattern appears similar to that of the location of the secretory coils of the sweat glands (Fig 1A). Is the co-staining the authors note later in Figure 1 also seen in TRPV4 KOs? This control should be shown, since the KO staining is not convincing that the Ab doesn't have off-target binding.</p>
<p>2. Are there any other markers besides CGRP for dark cells in mice to support the conclusion that mouse secretory cells have clear cell and dark cell properties?</p>
<p>3. The authors utilize menthol (as a cooling stimulus) in several experiments. In the discussion, they interpret the effect of menthol as potentially disrupting TRPV4-ANO1 interactions independent of TRPM8. Yet, the role of TRPM8, such as in TRPM8 KO mice, is not evaluated in this study.</p>
<p>4. Along those lines, the authors suggest that menthol inhibits eccrine function, which might lead to a cooling sensation. But isn't the cooling sensation of sweating from evaporative cooling? In which case, inhibiting eccrine function may actually impair cooling sensations.</p>
<p>5. The climbing assay is interesting and compelling. The authors note performing this under certain temperature and humidity conditions. Presumably, there is an optimal level of skin moisture, where skin that is too dry has less traction, but skin that is too wet may also have less traction. It would bolster this section of the study to perform this assay under hot conditions (perhaps TRPV4 KO mice, with impaired perspiration, would outperform WT mice with too much sweating?), or with pharmacologic intervention using TRPV4 agonists or antagonists to more rigorously evaluate whether this model correlates to TRPV4 function in the setting of different levels of perspiration.</p>
<p>6. There are other studies (PMID 33085914, PMID 31216445) that have examined the role of TRPV4 in regulating perspiration. The presence of TRPV4 in eccrine glands is not a novel finding. Moreover, these studies noted that TRPV4 was not critical in regulating sweating in human subjects. These prior studies are in contradiction to the mouse data and the correlation to human anhidrotic skin in the present study. Neither of these studies is cited or discussed by the authors, but they should be.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors set out to determine the extent to which the cation channel TRPV4 is expressed in secretory cells of sweat glands and the effect of blocking TRPV4 activity on sweat production, mediated via effects on the chloride channel anoctamin 1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study makes use of a diverse array of techniques, including super-resolution microscopy, live-cell calcium imaging, behavioral tests, and immunohistochemistry of human tissues in support of the claim that functional TRPV4 expression is detectable in sweat glands, and that TRPV4-deficient mice do not show respond to stimulation of sweat production (acetylcholine).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Figure 2: The calcium imaging-based approach shows average traces from 6 cells per genotype, but it was unclear if all acinar cells tested with this technique demonstrated TRPV4-mediated calcium influx, or if only a subset was presented.</p>
<p>Figure 4: The climbing behavioral test shows a significant reduction in climbing success rate in TRPV4-deficient mice. The authors ascribe this to a lack of hind paw 'traction' due to deficiencies in hind paw perspiration, but important controls and evidence that could rule out other potential confounds were not provided or cited.</p>
<p>In general, the results support the authors' claims that TRPV4 activity is a necessary component of sweat gland secretion, which may have important implications for controlling perspiration as well as secretion from other glands where TRPV4 may be expressed.</p>
