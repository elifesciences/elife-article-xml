<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of α-synuclein (α-syn) such as acetylation and phosphorylation play important yet distinct roles in regulating α-syn conformation, membrane binding, and amyloid aggregation. However, how PTMs regulate α-syn function in presynaptic terminals remains unclear. Previously, we reported that α-syn clusters synaptic vesicles (SV) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, and neutral phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) can mediate this clustering <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Here, based on our previous findings, we further demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation, which occurs under physiological condition and is irreversible in mammalian cells, significantly enhances the functional activity of α-syn in clustering SVs. Mechanistic studies reveal that this enhancement is caused by the N-acetylation-promoted insertion of α-syn’s N-terminus and increased intermolecular interactions on the LPC-containing membrane. Our work demonstrates that N-acetylation fine-tunes α-syn–LPC interaction for mediating α-syn’s function in SV clustering.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>α-Syn is a highly abundant presynaptic protein in neuron. It is involved in synaptic vesicle (SV) clustering and the assembly of soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor receptor (SNARE) complex for mediating SV trafficking and neurotransmitter release <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Abnormal amyloid aggregation of α-syn and deposition into Lewy Bodies (LBs) is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Different types of post-translational modifications (PTMs), e.g. acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation have been identified to modify α-syn under physiological and pathological conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation of S129 and Y39 is elevated, and this PTM-modified α-syn accumulates in LBs, implying a direct relationship between PTMs and α-syn pathology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Rather than disease-related PTMs, additional PTMs e.g. N-acetylation and O-GlcNAcylation of α-syn were found also under normal condition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Specifically, N-acetylation can influence the conformation and increase the helicity of the N-terminal area of α-syn, alters its membrane-binding behavior, and is critical for oligomer formation and amyloid aggregation kinetics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, it remains unknown whether N-acetylation directly regulates the physiological function of α-syn in clustering SVs.</p>

<title>N-terminal acetylation enhances SV clustering induced by α-syn</title>
<p>In this study, we sought to investigate whether N-acetylation could modulate α-syn’s function in promoting SV clustering. Firstly, we prepared recombinant N-terminally acetylated α-syn (Ac-α-syn) as well as unmodified α-syn (un-α-syn). N-terminal acetylation leads to a significant chemical shift perturbation of the first nine residues and H50 of α-syn in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, left</bold>). Intriguingly, in-cell NMR experiments show that all of the un-α-syn is N-terminally acetylated once it is transfected into HEK-293T cells by electroporation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, right</bold>), which is in consistent with a previous report <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. This result confirms the physiological relevance of N-terminal acetylation of α-syn. Notably, N-terminal acetylation is believed to be irreversible in mammalian cells due to lack of a known N-terminal de-acetyltransferase. Hence, it is crucial to investigate the impact of N-acetylation on the function of α-syn. To further probe the influence of N-acetylation on α-syn-mediated SV clustering, we incubated mouse SVs with various α-synuclein variants (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>, upper</bold>). We next measured the extent of SV clustering by utilizing dynamic light scattering (DLS) to monitor alterations in particle diameters, as well as using negatively stained transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>, middle and lower</bold>). Notably, N-acetylation significantly amplified α-syn’s capacity to cluster SVs, which requires the N-terminal 30 residues (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c-d</xref></bold>). These findings imply that N-acetylation augments SV clustering.</p>

<title>LPC mediates the enhancement of vesicle clustering by N-terminal acetylation of α-syn</title>
<p>In our previous work, we found that α-syn can bind to both negatively charged dioleoyl-phosphoserine (DOPS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and neutral lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Building on this, we sought to examine how N-acetylation affects SV clustering that arises from the interaction between α-syn and either of these lipids. To assess clustering functionality with specific lipid compositions, we synthesized liposomes mimicking SVs that contained either LPC or DOPS. We then used a single-vesicle clustering assay to track the clustering mediated by Ac-α-syn and un-α-syn (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref></bold>). Importantly, we observed that N-acetylation considerably boosted the clustering ability of α-syn with LPC-containing liposomes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold>). In contrast, N-acetylation did not increase the clustering of liposomes containing DOPS (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref></bold>). Therefore, LPC is responsible for the increased SV clustering activity by N-terminally acetylated α-syn.</p>

<title>N-terminal acetylation increases the α-syn–LPC interaction</title>
<p>The interaction between α-syn and lipids is crucial for clustering SVs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. To elucidate the structural basis of how N-acetylation impacts the α-syn−LPC interaction, we employed NMR measurements and coarse-grained dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations. First, we carried out solution NMR titration analyses to examine the α-syn−LPC interaction with residue-specific resolution. Adding increasing concentrations of pure LPC micelles to unmodified α-syn resulted in a dose-dependent and continuous attenuation of signals for the first 100 residues of α-syn, indicating these residues can interact with LPC (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, upper</bold>). Notably, N-acetylation significantly elevated the binding affinity of the N-terminal segment (residues 1-30), particularly the initial 10 residues, towards LPC, leading to a rapid binding pattern during titration (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, lower</bold>). Moreover, Ac-α-syn demonstrated a sequential binding behavior with LPC, where the N-terminal region (residues 1-30) bound initially, succeeded by the central region (residues 30-100) as the LPC/Ac-α-syn ratio increased (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, lower</bold>). Similar trends were observed in NMR titrations using DOPC/LPC-mixed liposomes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref></bold>). On the other hand, N-acetylation only slightly weakened the interaction between the N-terminal region (residues 1-30) and DOPS, particularly at low DOPS/α-syn ratios, resulting in a continuous signal attenuation for the first 100 residues (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref></bold>). These findings reveal that N-acetylation considerably enhances the N-terminal region’s binding affinity, particularly the first 10 residues, to LPC, while modestly reducing the same region’s affinity to DOPS.</p>

<p>To provide insights that are more relevant to physiological conditions, we extended our investigation to examine how Ac-α-syn interacts with SV membranes. By utilizing a protocol established before <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, we prepared monodisperse SVs isolated from normal mouse brains and titrated them with Ac-α-syn at an SV/α-syn ratio of 260:3000, which is a physiologically relevant ratio within presynaptic terminals as determined in previous work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The HSQC spectrum revealed signal attenuation, notably in the N-terminal region and specifically within the first 10 residues of α-syn (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref></bold>). These findings closely mirrored those observed when Ac-α-syn was titrated with LPC micelles and DOPC/LPC-mixed liposomes at low lipid/α-syn ratios of 10:1 and 100:1, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref></bold>). These results further substantiate the critical role played by the N-terminal region of Ac-α-syn in SV membrane binding.</p>

<title>Ac-α-syn binding on LPC shows high intermolecular interactions</title>
<p>The intermolecular interactions between α-syn monomers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> or between α-syn and VAMP2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> are also essential for clustering SVs. To further characterize the accessibility of α-syn to LPC and DOPS, we performed cross-linking experiments coupled with mass spectrometry (XL-MS). We mixed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>N-labeled and unlabeled Ac-α-syn at a 1:1 ratio, and selected the cross-linked fragments containing both <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>N-labeled and unlabeled Ac-α-syn to map the intermolecular cross-linking pattern. We found the accessibility of α-syn to LPC to be much higher than that to DOPS (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref></bold>). The number of cross-linked peptide pairs, indicative of their close-interaction, detected in LPC-induced multimers was over twice more than that of DOPS (<bold>Table S1-6</bold>). This result demonstrates high intermolecular interactions between Ac-α-syn and LPC.</p>

<p>In summary, the interaction between α-syn and lipids plays a crucial role in both the protein’s physiological functions in SV trafficking and its pathological aggregation, as observed in neurodegenerative conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Understanding how PTMs like N-acetylation modulate these interactions and their subsequent effects is a critical area of study. Notably, in addition to in-cell NMR findings that demonstrate spontaneous acetylation of α-syn, N-acetylated α-syn has been observed in PD patients’ brain tissue, underscoring its physiological relevance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Our research reveals that N-acetylation enhances the binding of the N-terminal region of α-syn to LPC, thereby facilitating its association with SVs. LPC is a neutral lipid with an inverted-cone shape, known to create high membrane curvature and more lipid packing defects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. N-acetylation effectively neutralizes the positive charge of α-syn’s N-terminus, fostering its insertion into LPC-rich membranes through hydrophobic interactions. Conversely, N-acetylation significantly reduces the affinity of α-syn’s N-terminal region for negatively charged PS-containing membranes, where the interaction is mainly electrostatic in nature. Furthermore, compared to DOPS, the interaction between N-terminally acetylated α-syn and LPC also triggers more intermolecular interactions that support the functional α-syn for SV clustering (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Most recently, we reported that α-syn also interacts with the neutral phospholipid LPC, which could be enriched in synaptosomes. LPC can facilitate α-syn to perform its function on clustering SVs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, the importance of the α-syn–LPC interaction remains unclear. Since α-syn is N-terminally acetylated in mammalian cells, the involvement of LPC, not anionic phospholipids, in N-acetylation-enhanced SV clustering demonstrates the importance of our recently reported α-syn–LPC interaction for mediating α-syn’s function in SV trafficking. Furthermore, the amount of anionic phospholipids on SVs could changes with aging and disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, which may alter bindings modes of α-syn. The α-syn–LPC interaction enhanced by N-acetylation could serve as an alternative mechanism for maintaining the SV clustering function of α-syn.</p>

<p>⍺-synuclein (syn) is a critical protein involved in many aspects of human health and disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that post-translational modifications (PTMs) play an important role in regulating the structural dynamics of syn. However, how post-translational modifications regulate syn function remains unclear. In this manuscript, Wang et al. reported an exciting discovery that N-acetylation of syn enhances the clustering of synaptic vesicles (SVs) through its interaction with lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Using an array of biochemical reconstitution, single vesicle imaging, and structural approaches, the authors uncovered that N-acetylation caused distinct oligomerization of syn in the presence of LPC, which is directly related to the level of SV clustering. This work provides novel insights into the regulation of synaptic transmission by syn and might also shed light on new ways to control neurological disorders caused by syn mutations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors provide evidence that posttranslational modification of synuclein by N-acetylation increases clustering of synaptic vesicles in vitro. When using liposomes the authors found that while clustering is enhanced by the presence of either lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) or phosphatidylcholine in the membrane, N-acetylation enhanced clustering only in the presence of LPC. Enhancement of binding was also observed when LPC micelles were used, which was corroborated by increased intra/intermolecular cross-linking of N-acetylated synuclein in the presence of LPC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is known for many years that synuclein binds to synaptic vesicles but the physiological role of this interaction is still debated. The strength of this manuscript is clearly in the structural characterization of the interaction of synuclein and lipids (involving NMR-spectroscopy) showing that the N-terminal 100 residues of synuclein are involved in LPC-interaction, and the demonstration that N-acetylation enhances the interaction between synuclein and LPC.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Lysophosphatides form detergent-like micelles that destabilize membranes, with their steady-state concentrations in native membranes being low, questioning the significance of the findings. Oddly, no difference in binding between the N-acetylated and unmodified form was observed when the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylserine was included. It remains unclear to which extent binding to LPC is physiologically relevant, particularly in the light of recent reports from other laboratories showing that synuclein may interact with liquid-liquid phases of synapsin I that were reported to cause vesicle clustering.</p>
