<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Viral inclusion bodies (IBs) are commonly formed during the replication of Ebola virus (EBOV) in infected cells, but their role in viral immune evasion has rarely been explored. Here, we found that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), but not TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) or IκB kinase epsilon (IKKε), was recruited and sequestered in viral IBs when the cells were infected by EBOV transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs). NP/VP35-induced IBs formation was critical for IRF3 recruitment and sequestration, probably through STING interaction. Consequently, the association of TBK1 and IRF3, which plays a vital role in type I interferon (IFN-I) induction, was blocked by EBOV trVLPs infection. Additionally, IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation induced by Sendai virus (SeV) or poly(I:C) stimulation were also suppressed by EBOV trVLPs. Furthermore, downregulation of STING significantly attenuated VP35-promoted IRF3 accumulation in IBs. Viral proteins by which IBs-like structures could be formed were demonstrated to be much more potent in IFN-I antagonism than the expression of the IFN-I antagonist VP35 only. These results suggested a novel immune evasion mechanism by which EBOV evades host innate immunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ebola virus disease is the deadliest infectious disease caused by infection with Ebola virus (EBOV), an enveloped, nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Feldmann, Jones, Klenk, &amp; Schnittler, 2003</xref>). The 19-kb viral genome comprises seven genes encoding the nucleoprotein (NP), virion protein 35 (VP35), VP40, glycoprotein (GP), VP30, VP24 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mahanty &amp; Bray, 2004</xref>). Inclusion bodies (IBs) formed in EBOV-infected cells are specialized intracellular compartments that serve as sites for EBOV replication and the generation of progeny viral RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hoenen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Nanbo, Watanabe, Halfmann, &amp; Kawaoka, 2013</xref>). In IBs, the EBOV genome is replicated and transcribed by viral polymerase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Misasi &amp; Sullivan, 2014</xref>). VP35 serves as a cofactor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and contributes to viral replication by homo-oligomerization through a coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Reid, Cardenas, &amp; Basler, 2005</xref>), in addition to its recently discovered presence of phosphorylation and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">van Tol et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Innate interferon responses constitute the first lines of host defense against viral infection. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors, including RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, play pivotal roles in the response to RNA virus infection. After the recognition of RNA virus infection, RIG-I is recruited to the mitochondrial antiviral adaptor protein (MAVS) through the caspase activation and recruitment domain. The activation of MAVS recruits multiple downstream signaling components to mitochondria, leading to the activation of inhibitor of κ-B kinase ε (IKKε) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which in turn phosphorylate IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Phosphorylated IRF3 forms a dimer that translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of type I interferon (IFN-I) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fitzgerald et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>To promote viral replication and persistence, viruses have evolved various strategies to evade or subvert host antiviral responses. For example, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) has developed a mechanism to evade host immune responses through the interaction between nonstructural proteins and IFN-I induction proteins, including TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lee &amp; Shin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), sequestering them inside SFTSV-induced cytoplasmic structures known as IBs. In addition to inhibiting IFN-I induction, SFTSV nonstructural proteins can hijack STAT1 and STAT2 in IBs to suppress IFN-I signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ning et al., 2015</xref>). These studies highlight the role of viral IBs as virus-built “jails” that sequester some crucial host factors and interfere with the corresponding cellular processes.</p>
<p>EBOV uses various approaches to evade the host immune response, including antagonizing IFN production, inhibiting IFN signaling, and enhancing IFN resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Basler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">McCarthy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Reid et al., 2006</xref>). VP35 is an IFN-I inhibitor that antagonizes host innate immunity by interacting with TBK1 and IKKε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Basler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Prins, Cardenas, &amp; Basler, 2009</xref>), suppressing RNA silencing and inhibiting dendritic cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Haasnoot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Yen, Mulder, Martinez, &amp; Basler, 2014</xref>). Here, we report that viral IBs in EBOV trVLPs-infected cells appear to play a role in immune evasion by sequestering IRF3 into IBs and preventing the interaction of IRF3 with TBK1 and IKKε.</p>

<title>IRF3 is hijacked into cytoplasmic IBs in EBOV transcription and replication-competent virus-like particles infected cells</title>
<p>When HepG2 cells were infected with EBOV transcription and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hoenen, Watt, Mora, &amp; Feldmann, 2014</xref>), which authentically model the complete virus life cycle, IBs with a unique structure and viral particles formed in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 – figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that a substantial percentage of endogenous IRF3 was trapped in viral IBs in EBOV trVLP-infected cells with large IBs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), while no detectable TBK1 or IKKε, the essential upstream components of IRF3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fitzgerald et al., 2003</xref>), was sequestered in the viral IBs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). These results suggested that IRF3 was specifically compartmentalized in viral IBs, and this compartmentalization spatially isolated IRF3 from its upstream activators TBK1 and IKKε.</p>

<p>IBs sequestration of IRF3 was further investigated at different hours post infection (hpi) of EBOV trVLPs. Detectable IRF3 puncta colocalized with viral proteins were apparent at 36 hpi in infected cells and correlated significantly with the size and shape of the viral IBs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). As the size of IBs increased at 48 hpi, nearly all IRF3 colocalized with viral IBs, whereas the IRF3 distribution was completely different in the uninfected cells nearby (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Using a fluorophore line of interest analysis, we assessed the intensity profiles of cytoplasmic IRF3 intensity in IBs as well as the increase in the diameter of the aggregates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). As infection proceeded, the intensity of the IRF3 signal in the puncta increased as the level of cytoplasmic-dispersed IRF3 decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), indicating that the total amount of IRF3 in the cells did not dramatically change during infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and that only its subcellular localization changed. Taken together, the results above showed that IRF3, but not TBK1 or IKKε, was sequestered in viral IBs.</p>

<title>EBOV trVLPs infection attenuates the TBK1-IRF3 association and IRF3 nuclear translocation</title>
<p>Upon virus infection, IRF3, as a critical transcription factor in the IFN induction pathway, can be phosphorylated and activated by TBK1, and then phosphorylated IRF3 translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, eliciting the expression of antiviral IFNs. Given the sequestration of IRF3 by EBOV trVLPs in IBs, the TBK1-IRF3 association in EBOV trVLPs-infected cells was accessed by an <italic>in situ</italic> Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA). Cytoplasmic complexes consisting of endogenous TBK1 with IRF3 (the red signal) were observed in HepG2 cells treated with poly(I:C), which induces the activation of the RIG-I signal cascade and IRF3 phosphorylation, and poly(I:C)-induced TBK1: IRF3 complexes were significantly reduced by EBOV trVLPs infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Decreased TBK1-IRF3 association was further demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Moreover, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, SeV infection-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were significantly inhibited by EBOV trVLPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Importantly, IRF3 was also recruited into IBs-like compartments in the cytoplasm in the cells infected with live EBOV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These data collectively suggested that the EBOV-mediated sequestration of IRF3 in IBs blocks IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in the TBK1-IRF3 signaling cascade, which is critical for IFN induction.</p>

<title>IBs-like structures formed by the viral proteins VP35 and NP play a key role in inducing IRF3 sequestration</title>
<p>Ectopic expression of NP alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Noda, Watanabe, Sagara, &amp; Kawaoka, 2007</xref>) or NP and the VP35 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Noda, Kolesnikova, Becker, &amp; Kawaoka, 2011</xref>) in cells was sufficient to form IBs-like structures. To investigate the viral protein(s) involved in the sequestration of IRF3 in IBs, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding NP/VP35, NP/VP35/L, NP/VP35/L/VP30, NP/VP35/L/VP30/VP24, or NP/VP35/L/VP30/vRNA-RLuc/T7 and stained with anti-IRF3 and anti-NP at 48 hpi. Coexpression of NP and VP35 resulted in substantial sequestration of IRF3 in the IBs-like structure, which in turn resulted in a significant reduction of IRF3 in the nucleus, as observed in the cells transfected with vectors only and treated with poly(I:C) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Little if any VP35 or NP was demonstrated to interact with IRF3 by immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 – figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Compared to NP/VP35 coexpression, the presence of protein L, VP30 and VP24 showed little, if any, effect on IBs-like structure formation, IRF3 sequestration and nuclear IRF3 levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).

<title>Viral IBs-induced IRF3 sequestration suppresses IFN-β production</title>
<p>EBOV trVLPs could hijack IRF3 and sequester IRF3 into IBs and thus block the nuclear translocation of IRF3, which suggested that EBOV trVLPs may suppress IRF3-driven IFN-β production. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Basler et al., 2000</xref>), expression of VP35 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), but not NP, resulted in a mild inhibition of SeV-induced IFN-β-Luc expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Coexpression of VP35 and NP, which led to the formation of IBs and the sequestration of IRF3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), suppressed IFN-β-Luc expression much more potently than VP35 expression alone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Coexpression of NP/VP35/L/VP30 was more potent in the inhibition of SeV-induced IFN-β-Luc expression than NP/VP35 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Moreover, coexpression of NP/VP35/VP30/L almost completely suppressed poly(I:C)-induced IFN-β transcription (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). <italic>IRF3</italic> depletion showed little, if any, effect on IFN-β transcription upon NP/VP35/L/VP30 coexpression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), which suggested that NP/VP35/L/VP30 coexpression was similarly powerful as <italic>IRF3</italic> depletion in antagonizing IFN-β expression. These results strongly suggested that viral IBs sequestration of IRF3 was substantially more powerful than that of VP35 expression.</p>

<p>We next assessed the effect of IRF3 hijacking and sequestration by viral IBs on EBOV trVLPs replication. Compared with wild-type cells, <italic>IRF3</italic> depletion showed little, if any, effect on EBOV replication, as indicated by luciferase activity, suggesting that trVLPs efficiently blocked IRF3 signaling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of IRF3/5D (a phospho-mimic of activated IRF3), but not IRF3, inhibited EBOV trVLPs replication in <italic>IRF3</italic>-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the hijacking of IRF3 and sequestration into IBs by EBOV trVLPs can be significantly more potent in the inhibition of IFN-I production, thereby antagonizing the inhibitory effect of IFN-I on viral replication.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that EBOV has established multiple ways to antagonize host innate immune responses to maintain viral replication. Several EBOV proteins (VP35, VP24, GP, VP30 and VP40) are known to participate in host immune evasion to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Audet &amp; Kobinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhattacharyya, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cantoni &amp; Rossman, 2018</xref>). VP35 was demonstrated to suppress IFN-I production by inhibiting IRF3/7 phosphorylation, disrupting DC maturation, and facilitating the escape of immune sensation by dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Basler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cardenas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Messaoudi, Amarasinghe, &amp; Basler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Prins et al., 2009</xref>). VP30 and VP40 suppress RNA silencing by interacting with Dicer and modulating RNA interference components via exosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fabozzi, Nabel, Dolan, &amp; Sullivan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pleet, DeMarino, Lepene, Aman, &amp; Kashanchi, 2017</xref>). VP24 and GP are also known to block IFN-I signaling by hiding MHC-1 on the cell surface and counteracting tetherin or interfering with established immune responses by adsorbing antibodies against GP, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Audet &amp; Kobinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhattacharyya, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Viral IBs are a characteristic of cellular EBOV infection and are important sites for viral RNA replication, and NP and VP35 are extremely critical proteins for the formation of IBs structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hoenen et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether viral IBs are involved in antagonizing IFN-I production during EBOV trVLPs infection has not yet been reported. Here, we found that IRF3 is hijacked and sequestered into EBOV IBs by viral infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), which demonstrates that viral IBs are utilized for IRF3 compartmentalization. Meanwhile, this compartmentalization resulted in the spatial isolation of IRF3 from the kinases TBK1 and IKKε (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). This suggests that IRF3 deprivation by viral IBs may antagonize host antiviral signaling by inhibiting IFN-I production signaling.</p>
<p>As expected, the expression of NP/VP35/VP30/L, which is involved in the composition of IBs, was significantly more antagonistic to SeV-induced IFN-β production than the expression of VP35 alone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). In addition, the expression of NP/VP35/VP30/L can significantly antagonize the promoting effect of poly(I:C) on IFN-β transcription, and IRF3 knockout could not further inhibit the transcription of IFN-β (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), which may be because viral hijacking of IRF3 into IBs nearly completely antagonized its function of promoting IFN-β production. Furthermore, knockout of IRF3 in cells cannot further promote EBOV trVLPs replication compared to wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), which may be because IRF3 is hijacked into viral IBs and cannot be phosphorylated into the nucleus to regulate IFN-I production. These results suggest that viral IBs act as virus-built ‘jails’ to imprison transcription factors and present a novel and possible common mechanism of viral immune evasion in which the critical signaling molecule IRF3 is spatially segregated from the antiviral kinases TBK1 and IKKε.</p>
<p>Although almost all IRF3 could be sequestered to viral IBs formed by VP35 and NP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), we found that neither VP35 nor NP interacted with IRF3 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 – figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, we found that VP35 interacts with STING and colocalizes in IBs and that knockdown of STING inhibits the sequestration of IRF3 in IBs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-G</xref>). These results suggest that VP35 may hijack IRF3 into IBs through STING. However, whether other host proteins are involved in this process and the role of NP in the recruitment of IRF3 by VP35 remains unclear. In addition, we found that VP35 may hijack IRF3 into IBs via STING association (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>); however, whether VP35 activates the STING-IRF3 pathway in a cGAS-independent manner by interacting with STING and the molecular mechanism remain to be further investigated.</p>
<p>In summary, EBOV VP35 sequesters IRF3 into viral IBs and inhibits the association of IRF3 with TBK1 and IKKε, preventing IRF3 from entering the nucleus and thereby inhibiting IFN-I production (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Therefore, this study reveals a new strategy by which EBOV escapes the innate immune response and provides new ideas for Ebola virus disease treatment.</p>

<p>This study explores how Ebola virus evades human immune responses. The study reports a potential new mechanism wherein Ebola virus traps human IRF3, a key transcription factor involved in immune signaling, into virus-produced &quot;inclusion bodies.&quot; While overall the topic is <bold>important</bold> and the paper has many merits, readers should note that the reviewers identified some flaws in the experimentation, analyses, and description of methods, which means the strength of evidence is currently <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>The authors were trying to investigate whether viral IBs are involved in antagonizing IFN-I production during EBOV trVLPs infection. They found that IRF3 is hijacked and sequestered into EBOV IBs after viral infection, thereby leading to the spatial isolation of IRF3 with TBK1 and IKKε. In such a progress, the activity of IRF3 is suppressed and downstream IFN-I induction is inhibited. The authors designed many experiments, such as the PLA that examined the colocalization, to support their conclusions. However, necessary negative controls were missed in several assays. More key index is needed to be examined in several assays.</p>
<p>The paper is well organized and most data in this paper could support the conclusions, while there are several issues that need to be further solved.</p>
<p>1. In Figure 2-4, authors should examine the expression of downstream IFNs as well as the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of IRF3 to further prove the suppression of IRF3 activity by infecting with trVLPs.</p>
<p>2. In Figure 5, to better prove the conclusion that EBOV NP and VP35 play an important role in sequestering IRF3 in IBS, authors should add the &quot;NP+VP35+VP30&quot; and &quot;NP+VP35+VP24&quot; groups to reperform the assay.</p>
<p>3. In Figure 6f, the expression of STING should be examined by immunostaining to show the knockdown efficiency in trVLPs-infected cells.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Zhu et al explored molecular mechanisms by which Ebola virus (EBOV) evades host innate immune response. EBOV has a number of means to shut down the type I interferon induction (by viral VP35 protein) and block type I interferon action (by viral VP24 protein). This study reported a new mechanism that inclusion body (IB) used for viral replication sequesters IRF3, a key transcription factor involved in the interferon signaling, resulting in blockade of downstream type I interferon gene transcription. This finding is potentially interesting and may provide a new insight into EBOV's evasion of innate immunity. However, there are some flaws in the experimentations and analyses that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>1. Most of experiments were performed by transfection of trVLP plasmids, which is very different from virus infection. The conclusions should be examined and verified in the context of virus infection.</p>
<p>2. Fig 1 - VP35 displayed a classical IB staining only in Panel A, while much less so in Panel C and not in panel B. It seemed that the VP35 staining images were chosen in a way towards the authors' favor. The statistical analysis of co-localization of VP35 and IRF3, TBK1 or IKKe should be performed to draw the conclusion. Another concern is that IKKe is normally lowly expressed under a rest condition and becomes induced only when the interferon signaling is activated. It seemed to be expressed at a high level even when the interferon signaling is blocked in Panel C. The authors should comment on this discrepancy.</p>
<p>3. Fig 2 - Was this experiment done by transfection or infection? The description of result is not consistent with the figure legend. The labeling was also not consistent between panel A and B. I would suggest performing Western blot to analyze the expression level of IRF3.</p>
<p>4. Fig 3 and 4 - As VP35 is well known for its highly efficient blockade of type I interferon activation, how would the authors differentiate the effect of VP35 alone from the sequestration of IRF3 in IBs in these experiments?</p>
<p>5. Fig 3 - PolyIC can activate both RLR and TLR signaling pathways. Can the author comment on which pathway it activates in this experiment?</p>
<p>6. The authors demonstrated that VP35 interacts with STING and recruit the latter to IBs. How would this affect the function of STING given that STING plays essential roles in cGAS/cGAMP pathway?</p>
<p>7. It is difficult to follow the logics of Fig 7. The expression level of each viral protein should be determined. Ideally, a mutation in VP35 that disrupts its ability to antagonize the interferon signaling but still allows for the IB formation can be used to assess the relative contribution of IB sequestering IRF3.</p>
