<title>Abstract</title><p>Social isolation generally increases aggression but decreases mating competition, resulting in an intricate and ambiguous relationship between social experience, aggression, and reproductive success. In male <italic>Drosophila</italic>, aggression is often characterized by lunging, a frequent and comparatively gentle combat behavior. Here, we provide a behavioral paradigm for studying a less frequent but more vigorous fighting form known as tussling. While social enrichment decreases lunging, aligning with past observations, it heightens the more forceful tussling behavior. These two forms of aggression rely on different olfactory receptor neurons, specifically Or67d for lunging and Or47b for tussling. We further identify three pairs of central pC1 neurons that specifically promote tussling. Moreover, shifting from lunging to tussling in socially enriched males is accompanied with better territory control and mating success. Our findings identify distinct sensory and central neurons for two fighting forms and suggest how social experience shapes fighting strategies to optimize reproductive success.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Competition for resources such as territory, food, and mates is crucial for animal survival and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bergman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hoffmann and Cacoyianni, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stockley and Campbell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zwarts et al., 2012</xref>). Among diverse competitive strategies, physical combat is a prevalent form of fighting to repel rivals and regulated by both genetic factors and social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zwarts et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding how social experience influences combat behaviors in animals to maximize their survival and reproduction remains a fundamentally important yet inadequately understood question.</p>
<p>In the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, inter-male aggression includes relative low-intensity fights such as lunging, in which one fly rears up on its hind legs and snaps down onto its opponent, as well as relative high-intensity fights like tussling, where two males tumble over each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Certel and Kravitz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hoopfer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Palavicino-Maggio and Sengupta, 2022</xref>). A recent work showed that lunges are insufficient to establish dominance but mainly serves to maintain social status, while tussling frequence is correlated with dominance establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Simon and Heberlein, 2020</xref>). It is noteworthy that the majority of studies focus on the low-intensity lunging behavior, owing to its higher frequency and ease of observation. Substantial studies have identified regulatory genes and the neural circuit underlying the lunging-based aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hoopfer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kravitz and Fernandez, 2015</xref>). In particular, the male-specific volatile pheromone 11-<italic>cis</italic>-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) acutely promotes lunging behavior via its olfactory receptor Or67d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang and Anderson, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, chronic cVA exposure in socially-enriched males reduces the level of lunging via another olfactory receptor Or65a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, it has been found that social isolation increases lunging frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Palavicino-Maggio and Sengupta, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yadav et al., 2024</xref>) by altering the expression of genes such as <italic>Cyp6a20</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Drosulfakinin</italic> (<italic>Dsk</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agrawal et al., 2020</xref>), and <italic>Tachykinin</italic> (<italic>Tk</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). Social isolation also increases male aggression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Matsumoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zelikowsky et al., 2018</xref>) and even in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ferguson et al., 2005</xref>). In mice, the TK homologue Tachykinin 2 (Tac2) responds to social isolation and promotes inter-male aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zelikowsky et al., 2018</xref>). These findings contribute to the consensus that social isolation escalates aggression, whereas social enrichment mitigates it in animal models.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, social enrichment increases male mating success by enhancing the sensitivity of <italic>Or47b</italic>-expressing olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to fly pheromones common to both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>). Artificially activating <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs also improves mating advantage in a competitive assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dweck et al., 2015</xref>). Group housing and age-dependent juvenile hormone (JH) jointly increase the expression of the male-specific proteins from <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>), which is a master gene for male courtship behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Peng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sato et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>), in the <italic>Or47b</italic>-expressing ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hueston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, courtship levels in single-housed (SH) wild-type males are equal to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dankert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pan and Baker, 2014</xref>), in some cases, even stronger than those in group-housed (GH) males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dankert et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, group-housing decreases excitability of the courtship-promoting P1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>), which express both terminal genes in the sex determination hierarchy, <italic>fru</italic> and <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>). These findings raise a question on how social enrichment, which suppresses lunging-based aggression and does not increase courtship intensity, would facilitate mating competition.</p>
<p>Here, we modify a behavioral paradigm for studying inter-male tussling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and discover that this infrequent yet intense form of combat is enhanced by social enrichment and is crucial for territory dominance and mating competition. This process requires olfactory receptor Or47b, but not Or67d or Or65a. We further identify three pairs of central <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing pC1 neurons that specifically promote tussling. Moreover, we demonstrate that socially enriched males can overcome mating disadvantages associated with aging.</p>

<title>A Paradigm for High-intensity Aggression in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>While studying the lunging-based aggression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using a high-throughput aggression assay based on previously aggression paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Certel and Kravitz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), we occasionally observed the high-intensity boxing and tussling behavior in male flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>), which are difficult to distinguish and hereafter simply referred to as tussling. We reasoned that the intensity, instead of the frequency, could be decisive for a combat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Simon and Heberlein, 2020</xref>). Thus, although tussling is a less frequent behavior, it could serve a vital function.</p>
<p>To induce a higher level of tussling for further manipulation, we first introduced a fixed live virgin female in the same behavioral chamber for assaying lunging. The female fly was immobilized in the middle of the food, with its head embedded in the food and its body exposed to enhance male competition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that males that were group-housed for 7 days showed a significantly higher frequency of tussling behavior and reduced latency to tussle in the presence of an embedded virgin female (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We next compared tussling in male flies of different ages. We observed a significantly higher proportion of 14-day-old males raised in groups that showed tussling behavior during the 2-hour observation period, compared to the 7-day-old males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, 2-day-old males never displayed tussling behavior. In contrast, 14-day-old males showed lowed level of lunging behavior than 7-day-old males did (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous studies have shown that, in addition to mating resources, food quality is another crucial factor affecting aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lim et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we next assayed tussling behavior in 14-day-old males in the presence of an embedded virgin female with different concentrations of sucrose or yeast in the food during the behavioral test. We found that these males displayed similar levels of tussling behavior with different concentrations of sucrose in the food (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). On the contrary, male tussling intensity increased significantly with higher yeast concentrations such that more than 70% of males displayed this high-intensity fighting behavior (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>, see Figure 1-video supplement 1). Taken together, these results provide an efficient behavioral paradigm for the high-intensity tussling behavior and indicate that older males display more tussling but less lunging than younger ones.</p>

<title>Social Enrichment Inhibits Low-intensity Lunging but Enhances High-intensity Tussling</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that social enrichment inhibits aggressive behaviors, specifically the low-intensity lunging, in male flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yadav et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, we wondered whether social enrichment might also inhibit the high-intensity tussling behavior in males. To answer this question, we compared both fighting behaviors in SH and GH 14-day-old males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Lunging and tussling events from each group of representative samples were exhibited in raster plots for comparison (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We scored lunging behavior mainly in the first 10-min of test, due to its relatively higher occurrence, and tussling behavior during the whole 2-hour observational period since males take much longer time to initiate tussling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, we found that while SH males performed more frequent lunging behavior in 10 min than GH males did, which is consistent with previous findings, they rarely showed tussling behavior. In contrast, GH males displayed a large number of tussling events within 2 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Statistical analysis of tussling and lunging behaviors showed that GH males exhibited reduced tussling latency and enhanced tussling frequency, in addition to increased lunging latency and decreased lunging frequency, compared to SH males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-F</xref>). We also quantified the duration of each tussling and lunging events, and found that the average duration of individual lunging events was less than 0.2 second, while a tussling event lasted from seconds to minutes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). This further suggests that tussling is a more intense form of aggressive behavior compared to lunging. These results indicate that social enrichment inhibits low-intensity lunging but promotes high-intensity tussling in male flies.</p>

<title><italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs Mediate Social Experience-induced Tussling Behavior</title>
<p>To further investigate the sensory basis underlying the opposite regulation of lunging and tussling behaviors by social experience, we tried to examine the role of cVA-sensitive neurons, as well as other <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>-expressing ORNs, in mediating intermale aggression. Two cVA sensory neurons, <italic>Or67d</italic> and <italic>Or65a</italic> ORNs, play crucial roles in enhancing the lunging-based aggression in SH males, in which <italic>Or67d</italic> ORNs mediate acute cVA stimulation and promote male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang and Anderson, 2010</xref>), while <italic>Or65a</italic> ORNs mediate chronic cVA stimulation and inhibit male aggression in GH males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>-expressing <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs are sensitive to a class of pheromones common to both sexes, such as palmitoleic acid (PA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), and their sensitivity is enhanced under group rearing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Ir84a</italic> ORNs, which are also <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>-positive, are involved in the perception of mixed food odors and promote male courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Grosjean et al., 2011</xref>). We silenced <italic>Or67d</italic>, <italic>Or65a</italic>, <italic>Or47b</italic> or <italic>Ir84a</italic> ORNs by expressing the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baines et al., 2001</xref>) and assayed lunging and tussling behaviors in 14-day-old GH males. We found that silencing <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs, but not <italic>Or67d</italic>, <italic>Or65a</italic> or <italic>Ir84a</italic> ORNs, significantly decreased male tussling, compared to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>). In contrast, silencing <italic>Or67d</italic> ORNs, but not other ORNs, significantly reduced male lunging (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref>). These loss-of-function results suggest that <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs mediate male tussling behavior, whereas <italic>Or67d</italic> ORNs regulate male lunging behavior.</p>

<p>To elucidate the potential role of the Or47b receptor in mediating tussling behavior, we knocked down its expression in <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs using RNA interference (RNAi). Our results showed a significant decrease in male tussling behavior when the Or47b receptor expression was reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>), indicating that the functionality of <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs in tussling is dependent on the Or47b receptor. As previous studies suggested that the male-specific <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> sustains <italic>Or47b</italic> expression in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>), we next expressed microRNAs targeting <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> (<italic>UAS-fruMi</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Meissner et al., 2016</xref>) in <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs and assayed male tussling. The efficiency of <italic>Or47b</italic> and <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>RNAi knockdown was both validated by quantitative PCR (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed a slight increase of tussling latency in <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> knocked-down males, although not significantly different from the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>), suggesting that Or47b, rather than Fru<sup>M</sup>, plays a more crucial role in mediating male tussling.</p>
<p>To further confirm that the effect of social enrichment on tussling depends on the activity of <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs, we artificially activated <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs by expressing the bacterially derived sodium channel (NaChBac) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ren et al., 2001</xref>) in 14-day-old SH males. We found that these SH males with enhanced activity of <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs showed a significant increase in tussling behavior compared to control SH males. Interestingly, the level of tussling in these SH males with activated <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs was indistinguishable from that in GH males (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G, H</xref>). These gain-of-function results indicate that social enrichment acts through <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs to promote male tussling. Using the trans-Tango technique that labels downstream neurons in a usage-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Talay et al., 2017</xref>), we found substantially more downstream signals of <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs in GH males than those in SH males (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>), further supporting the involvement of <italic>Or47b</italic> ORNs under social enrichment.</p>

<title>Distinct Central Brain Neurons for Lunging and Tussling</title>
<p>We next set out to identify the central neurons involved in regulating the high-intensity tussling. We found that silencing the mushroom body neurons by expressing an inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baines et al., 2001</xref>) driven by <italic>R19B03-GAL4</italic> did not affect male tussling, suggesting that the experience-dependent tussling behavior is not dependent on the classical learning and memory center. Surprisingly, inactivation of the previously-identified aggression-promoting P1<sup>a</sup> and TK neurons did not affect tussling behavior (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). These results imply that the central circuit for tussling behavior may be distinct from the previously reported aggression circuits. As <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing pC1 neurons, also termed P1 if co-expressing <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>, are crucial for sexual and aggressive behaviors in both males and females, we also silenced two subsets of pC1 neurons (pC1<sup>SS1</sup> and pC1<sup>SS2</sup>), which were sexually dimorphic, and their functions were previously characterized in females but not in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). We found that inactivation of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> but not pC1<sup>SS1</sup> neurons significantly reduced the tussling behavior in male flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). The cell bodies of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> and P1<sup>a</sup> neurons are both located in the center of posterior brain and project to overlapping but distinct parts of the lateral protocerebral complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>). These results suggest that pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons may be key central neurons regulating tussling behavior.</p>

<p>To further compare the function of P1<sup>a</sup> and pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons in regulating male behaviors, we performed optogenetic activation experiments on these neurons expressing <italic>CsChrimson</italic>. Compared to control male pairs that did not show any significant change upon red light stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-H</xref>), optogenetic activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons induced acute courtship behavior as indicated by unilateral wing extension (UWE), and upon red light removal, there was a significant increase in lunging but not tussling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I-K</xref>), consistent with previous findings. In contrast, optogenetic activation of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons induced strong and acute tussling behavior, with more than 50% of the time during red light in tussling, and the tussling behavior ceased immediately upon removal of red light (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>, see Figure 4-video supplement 1). Activation of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons did not significantly affect either male lunging or courtship (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M, N</xref>). These results indicate that pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons acutely promote the high-intensity tussling behavior.</p>
<p>Previous studies have revealed a crucial role of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons in promoting a persistent internal state that enhances male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>). To test whether P1<sup>a</sup> neurons can promote both lunging and tussling behaviors, we further performed thermal activation experiments. We found that activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons via dTrpA1 at 30°C induced male tussling, just like activation of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons did (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). As thermal activation but not optogenetic activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons induced tussling, we reasoned that vision might be a key factor for this discrepancy, since all optogenetic experiments were performed in dark or red light. Thus, we re-performed these thermal activation experiments in dark and found that activation of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> but not P1<sup>a</sup> neurons induced tussling, although the level of tussling by pC1<sup>SS2</sup>-activated males was lower compared to that in light, suggesting a crucial role of vision in male tussling. These optogenetic and themogenetic activation experiments suggest that P1<sup>a</sup> neurons can promote both lunging and tussling behaviors, but their function on tussling requires visual stimulation, while pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons play a more direct role in acutely promoting male tussling.</p>
<p>We next used <italic>retro</italic>-Tango (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sorkaç et al., 2023</xref>) and <italic>trans</italic>-Tango (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Talay et al., 2017</xref>) techniques to explore the potential upstream and downstream circuits of P1<sup>a</sup> and pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons, and observed substential differences in both conditions (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting largely parallel inputs and outputs for P1<sup>a</sup> and pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons.</p>

<title>Territory and Mating Advantage in Tussling-favored Experienced Males</title>
<p>As our results showed that GH males and SH males were more likely to perform the low-frequency, high-intensity tussling and the high-frequency, low intensity lunging, respectively, we wondered which fighting strategy was more practical in the competition for territory and mating resources.</p>
<p>To address this question, we first designed an experimental paradigm for territory competition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). A circular territory, which is provided with food and a fixed virgin female and separated by a wall with a small door open to the outer area, was competed by two tester males, one of which was marked on their wings. We manually analyzed the first 10 winning events, each was defined as one male successfully displacing the other from the inner resource area. The winning index was calculated as the proportional difference in the number of wins between the marked male and unmarked male. In control groups such as two GH males of the same age, we observed some ‘winner takes all’ phenomenon (one male won nearly all of the 10 encounters), but overall, the winning index was close to zero due to the randomness of marking (see methods). We further found that while GH 7-day-old males (G7) won slightly, but not significantly, more than SH 7-day-old males (S7) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), older G14 males had a significant advantage over the S14 males (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>, see Figure 6-video supplement 1). Additionally, we observed that when G14 males were paired with S14 males, the proportion of males performing tussling behavior was not significantly different from that between two G14 males. However, the duration of each tussling event in G14 and S14 male pairs was significantly shorter than that between two G14 males (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we conducted further investigations into the role of social experience and the two types of fighting behaviors in mating competition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Two males and one virgin female were loaded into the behavioral chamber at the same time and recorded for courtship behaviors. A winner was defined as the male that first copulated with the female. We used the copulation advance index, which was calculated as the proportional difference between marked males and unmarked males in winning copulation (see methods). We found that G7 males had no significant advantage over S7 males (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>); however, G14 males displayed a significantly increased mating advantage over S14 males (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, see Figure 6-video supplement 2). Together, these results suggest that the tussling-favored GH males are more competitive in territory control and mating compared to the lunging-favored SH males.</p>
<p>The above results showed that GH males were more competitive compare to SH males, especially in older males, suggesting that social experience may play a potential role in altering age-related mating competition. To test this hypothesis, we first tested mating competition between males of different ages under the same rearing conditions. The results showed that younger males, whether reared in group or isolation, had a greater mating advantage compared to older males (G7 &gt; G14, S7 &gt; S14, G14 &gt; G21, S14 &gt; S21) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). These results indicate that there is generally a disadvantage in mating competition associated with aging. We next investigated whether the mating advantage induced by social experience could compensate for the mating disadvantage caused by aging. We tested pairs of males with different ages and rearing conditions (G7 vs. S14, S7 vs. G14, G14 vs. S21, S14 vs. G21) for mating competition. We found that while 14-day-old males were less competitive than 7-day-old males regardless of the rearing condition, indicative of the aging-related disadvantage, 21-day-old GH males were significantly more competitive than 14-day-old SH males (G21 &gt; S14) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>).</p>
    <p>To further investigate whether the territorial control and mating competition advantage in GH males are related to their high tussling behavior, we paired males with low tussling behavior (<italic>Or47b-GAL4/UAS-Kir2.1</italic> and <italic>pC1<sup>SS2</sup>/UAS-Kir2.1</italic>) with control males for territorial control and mating competition tests. We found that males with inactivated Or47b or pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons were incompetitive for both territorial control and mating competition compared to control males (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 3</xref>), further supporting a correlation between the occurrence of tussling behavior and the acquisition of territorial and mating competition advantages.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that long-term social enrichment in older males increases their territorial and mating competition, which can overcome their mating disadvantage associated with aging (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Regulation of physiology and behavior by social experience is an important feature across animal species. Here, we found that social experience shapes the fighting strategies of male flies, in which GH males tend to reduce the low-intensity lunging and increase the high-intensity tussling, which enhances their territorial and mating competition. We further showed that the two forms of fighting are mediated by distinct sensory and central neurons. The complex implications of these findings are discussed below.</p>
<p>Previous studies have found that social isolation generally enhances aggression but decreases mating competition in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Palavicino-Maggio and Sengupta, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yadav et al., 2024</xref>), presenting a paradox between social experience, aggression and reproductive success. Our results resolved this paradox by dissecting aggressive behaviors into the well-studied, frequently observed lunging behavior and the less frequent but high-intensity tussling behavior. We improved the behavioral paradigm for studying tussling behavior and revealed that social experience oppositely regulates lunging and tussling. It is important to note that the frequency of lunging decreases while the frequency of tussling increases from 7-day-old to 14-day-old males, suggesting a shift in fighting strategy with age. Our results further suggest that social experience may enhance male mating competition by shifting their fighting strategy to the low-frequency, high-intensity tussling, which may be more effective in combat, although direct evidence is still lacking. These results are consistent with a previous study showing a correlation between the establishment of male dominance and tussling behavior, but not lunging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Simon and Heberlein, 2020</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the mating advantage gained through social enrichment can even offset the mating disadvantage associated with aging, further supporting the vital role of shifting fighting strategies in experienced, aged males. Note that a previous study found a mating advantage in 7-day-old males compared to 2-day-old males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), which may be due to different levels of sexual maturity, but not necessatily reflect the aging effect. These results separate the function of the two fighting forms and rectify our understanding of how social experiences regulate aggression and reproductive success.</p>
<p>Our results revealed distinct neural circuits underlying the two forms of fighting, spanning from primary sensory neurons to central regulatory neurons. Specifically, silencing the cVA-sensing Or67d neurons reduced male lunging but not tussling, whereas inactivating Or47b neurons impaired male tussling but not lunging. Notably, Or47b neurons respond to pheromones common to both sexes, and the sensitivity of these sensory neurons is enhanced by social enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Peng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sethi et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike the Or67d-dependent lunging, which is primarily male-induced and socially inhibited, the Or47b-dependent tussling is promoted by social enrichment with either male or female flies. Recently, it has been found that female flies increase aggression towards mating pairs or mated females, depending on Or47b and Or67d, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gaspar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wan et al., 2023</xref>). These results suggest a common function of Or47b and Or67d neurons in both sexes for regulating aggression. However, whether these neurons mediate different fighting patterns in females and how they respond to social experience in females remain unknown. Nevertheless, our results on these two sensory pathways in males provide crucial evidence for dissecting their functions.</p>
<p>Regarding central regulatory neurons, we identified a novel class of pC1 neurons, pC1<sup>SS2</sup>, that specifically promote male tussling. In male flies, there are ∼60 pairs of <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing pC1 neurons, including the well-characterized P1<sup>a</sup> neurons that also express <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Asahina, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jiang and Pan, 2022</xref>); however, there are only three pairs of pC1<sup>SS2</sup>neurons that specifically express <italic>dsx</italic> but not <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>, and are crucial for the high-intensity tussling in males. The three pairs of pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons may have distinct function from P1<sup>a</sup> neurons in several ways. (1) P1<sup>a</sup> neurons promotes both male courtship and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>), whereas pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons specifically promote aggression but not courtship. A recent study also identified pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons as aggression-promoting, but their roles in different fighting modes are not depicted (Hindmarsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Sten et al., 2025</xref>). That tussling-promoting pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons specifically express <italic>dsx</italic> but not <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> is also consistent with a previous finding that <italic>dsx</italic>-positive pC1 neurons, rather that <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic>-positive pC1 neurons, are crucial for male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>). (2) P1<sup>a</sup> neurons promotes both lunging and tussling, although their function on tussling requires additional visual stimulation. In contrast, pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons specifically promote tussling, and the presence of light enhances but is not absolutely necessary for tussling. These results align with previous findings that visual stimuli amplify P1 activation and related behaviors (Hindmarsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kohatsu and Yamamoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pan et al., 2012</xref>), and visual stimulation is important for male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Duistermars et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ramin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>). (3) Male lunging is induced after P1<sup>a</sup> activation; whereas male tussling is induced during pC1<sup>SS2</sup> activation. These results suggest that P1<sup>a</sup> neurons may not directly regulate aggression but instead induce a persistent state that promote aggression in general, while pC1<sup>SS2</sup> neurons may play a more direct role in mediating tussling. Future studies are needed to further dissect the seemingly parallel sensory and central neuronal pathways involved in lunging and tussling, and to explore how these pathways interact during social experience and aging to optimize reproductive success.</p>

<title>Male aggression assay</title>
    <p>For the aggression assays presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, the prepared food was evenly spread into the center of behavioral chambers. There was no female in the traditional paradigm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, left) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), while a 3-5 day old virgin female was gently fixed in the center of the food with its abdomen outside in the modified paradigm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, right). We used a fixed female to restrict its position in the center of food. Then two male testers were placed into the upper chambers separated from the food (with or without a fixed female) by a film barrier. All testers were loaded by cold anesthesia. After a 30-minute adaptation, the film was gently removed to allow the two males to fall into the behavioral chamber, and the aggressive behavior was recorded for 2 hours. The aggression assays in <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref> was performed by using the paradigm without female, while other data were acquired using the modified paradigm with a fixed female unless otherwise stated. In some experiments, both single-housed and group-housed (30-40 males per vial) males were assayed for comparison.</p>
<p>We manually analyzed lunging and tussling behaviors in this study. Lunging is characterized by a male raising its forelegs and quickly striking the opponent, and each lunge typically lasts less than 0.2 seconds through detailed slow-motion analysis. Tussling is characterized by both males using their forelegs and bodies to tumble over each other, and this behavior may last from seconds to minutes. Tussling is often mixed with boxing, in which both flies rear up and strike the opponent with forelegs. Since boxing is often transient and difficult to distinguish from tussling, we referred to the mixed boxing and tussling behavior simply as tussling. As we manually analyze tussling for 2 hours for each pair of males, it is possible that we may miss some tussling events, especially those quick ones.</p>

<p>For optogenetic activation assay showed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, males were raised at 25°C on standard fly food, collected after eclosion and housed in the dark for 5-7 days on food containing 0.4 mM all <italic>trans</italic>-Retinal (MFCD00001550, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The specific light stimulation protocols are showed in the schematic (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). In brief, Two 5-7 days old males were loaded into the circular chamber (d=10mm) under freeze anesthesia and separated with a transparent film in the dark. Then the chamber was moved on the plane light source (IR channel: 865nm, red-light channel: 630nm) for 15 mins adaptation. Before video recording, the IR light channel was switched on and adjusted to the appropriate intensty for recording. The film was removed before the recording start, with the red-light channel switched on (constant red light, 0.02 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) during the 2nd and 5th minutes of the experiment. The statistics for the tussling, lunging, and unilateral wing extension (UWE) are as follows. For tussling time and UWE time, we used LifesongY software (website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/lifesongy/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/lifesongy/</ext-link>), which is written by Dr. Chao Guo based on LifesongX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernstein et al., 1992</xref>), to calculate the percentage of the total time these behaviors occurred per minute. Specifically, the &quot;tussling time (%)&quot; refers to the percentage of time during the observation period in which tussling behavior occurred, relative to the total observation time. Similarly, &quot;UWE time (%)&quot; represents the percentage of time during the observation period in which UWE occurred. For lunges, we counted the number of lunging occurrences per minute.</p>

The preparation of food and female were the same as the above aggression paradigm. The female was fixed in the center of the food and two male testers were placed separately in the two small chambers on both sides. Before initiating the experiment, the two barriers were closed. After a 30-minute adaptation, the barriers were opened to allow the males access to the central large chamber, and were closed once the males went inside, and the territorial behavior was recorded for 2 hours. The first 10 encounters occurring after 1 hour of recording were used for statistical analysis. The winning event was defined as a male driving the other male out of the food area. To discriminate between tester males, about half of them were marked on one of their wings using a red maker pen 24 hours before the experiment. For expreiments using males with different ages and/or housing conditions, we calculated the winning index as (num. of wins by males [upper panel] – num. of wins by males [lower panel])/10 encounters * 100%. For control expreiments using males of the same age and housing condition, we calculated the winning index as (num. of wins by unmarked males – num. of wins by marked males)/10 encounters * 100%, which is roughly zero due to the randomness of marking.</p>

After 30 minutes adaptation, two films were removed to allow the three flies to interact, and the behavior was recorded for 1 hour. The chambers without successful copulation during the 1-hour period were excluded from further analysis. For each condition, we used 120 efficient chambers with 10 random chambers collectively as one sample. For expreiments using males with different ages and/or housing conditions, the copulation advance index was defined as (num. of male winners [upper panel] – num. of male winners [lower panel])/10 chambers * 100%. For control expreiments using males of the same age and housing condition, the copulation advance index was calculated as (num. of winners by unmarked males – num. of winners by marked males)/10 chambers * 100%, which is roughly zero due to the randomness of marking.

<p>This work addresses an important question in the field of Drosophila aggression and mating. Prior social isolation is known to increase aggression in males, manifesting as increased lunging, which is suppressed by group housing (GH). However, it is also known that single housed (SH) males, despite their higher attempts to court females, are less successful. Here, Gao et al., develop a modified aggression assay to address this issue by recording aggression in Drosophila males for 2 hours, with a virgin female immobilized by burying its head in the food. They found that while SH males frequently lunge in this assay, GH males switch to higher intensity but very low frequency tussling. Constitutive neuronal silencing and activation experiments implicate cVA sensing Or67d neurons in promoting high frequency lunging, similar to earlier studies, whereas Or47b neurons promote low frequency but higher intensity tussling. Optogenetic activation revealed that three pairs of pC1SS2 neurons increase tussling. Cell-type-specific DsxM manipulations combined with morphological analysis of pC1SS2 neurons and side-by-side tussling quantification link the developmental role of DsxM to the functional output of these aggression-promoting cells. In contrast, although optogenetic activation of P1a neurons in the dark did not increase tussling, thermogenetic activation under visible light drove aggressive tussling. Using a further modified aggression assay, GH males exhibit increased tussling and maintain territorial control, which could contribute to a mating advantage over SH males, although direct measures of reproductive success are still needed</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Through a series of clever neurogenetic and behavioral approaches, the authors implicate specific subsets of ORNs and pC1 neurons in promoting distinct forms of aggressive behavior, particularly tussling. They have devised a refined territorial control paradigm, which appears more robust than earlier assays using a food cup (Chen et al., 2002). This new setup is relatively clutter-free and could be amenable to future automation using computer vision approaches. The updated Figure 5, which combines cell-type-specific developmental manipulation of pC1SS2 neurons with behavioral output, provides a link between developmental mechanisms and functional aggression circuits. The manuscript is generally well written, and the claims are largely supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>Although most concerns have been addressed, the manuscript still lacks a rigorous, objective method for quantifying lunging and tussling. Because scoring appears to have been done manually and a single lunge in a 30 fps video spans only 2-3 frames, the 0.2 s cutoff seems arbitrary, and there are no objective criteria distinguishing reciprocal lunging from tussling. Despite this, the study offers valuable insights into the neural and behavioral mechanisms of Drosophila aggression.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Gao et al. investigated the change of aggression strategies by the social experience and its biological significance by using Drosophila. Two modes of inter-male aggression in Drosophila are known: lunging, high-frequency but weak mode, and tussling, low-frequency but more vigorous mode. Previous studies have mainly focused on the lunging. In this paper, the authors developed a new behavioral experiment system for observing tussling behavior and found that tussling is enhanced by group rearing, while lunging is suppressed. They then searched for neurons involved in the generation of tussling. Although olfactory receptors named Or67d and Or65a have previously been reported to function in the control of lunging, the authors found that these neurons do not function in the execution of tussling and another olfactory receptor, Or47b, is required for tussling, as shown by the inhibition of neuronal activity and the gene knockdown experiments. Further optogenetic experiments identified a small number of central neurons pC1[SS2] that induce the tussling specifically. These neurons express doublesex (dsx), a sex-determination factor, and knockdown of dsx strongly suppresses the induction of tussling. In order to further explore the ecological significance of the aggression mode change in group-rearing, a new behavioral experiment was performed to examine the territorial control and the mating competition. And finally, the authors found that differences in the social experience (group vs. solitary rearing) and the associated change in aggression strategy are important in these biologically significant competitions. These results add a new perspective to the study of aggression behavior in Drosophila. Furthermore, this study proposes an interesting general model in which the social experience modified behavioral changes play a role in reproductive success.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A behavioral experiment system that allows stable observation of tussling, which could not be easily analyzed due to its low-frequency, would be very useful. The experimental setup itself is relatively simple, just the addition of a female to the platform, so it should be applicable to future research. The finding about the relationship between the social experience and the aggression mode change is quite novel. Although the intensity of aggression changes with the social experience was already reported in several papers (Liu et al., 2011 etc), the fact that the behavioral mode itself changes significantly has rarely been addressed, and is extremely interesting. The identification of sensory and central neurons required for the tussling makes appropriate use of the genetic tools and the results are clear. A major strength of this study in neurobiology is the finding that another group of neurons (Or47b-expressing olfactory neurons and pC1[SS2] neurons), distinct from the group of neurons previously thought to be involved in low-intensity aggression (i.e. lunging), function in the tussling behavior. Furthermore, the results showing that the regulation of aggression by pC1[SS2] neurons is based on the function of the dsx gene will bring a new perspective to the field. Further investigation of the detailed circuit analysis is expected to elucidate the neural substrate of the conflict between the two aggression modes. The experimental systems examining the territory control and the reproductive competition in Fig. 6 are novel and have advantages in exploring their biological significance. It is important to note that in addition to showing the effects of age and social experience on territorial and mating behaviors, the authors experimentally demonstrated that altered fighting strategy has effects with respect to these behaviors.</p>

<p>In this revised manuscript, Gao et al. presented a series of well-controlled behavioral data showing that tussling, a form of high-intensity fighting among male fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) is enhanced specifically among socially experienced and relatively old males. Moreover, results of behavioral assays led authors to suggest that increased tussling among socially experienced males may increase mating success. They also concluded that tussling is controlled by a class of olfactory sensory neurons and sexually dimorphic central neurons that are distinct from pathways known to control lunges, a common male-type attack behavior.</p>
<p>A major strength of this work is that it is the first attempt to characterize behavioral function and neural circuit associated with Drosophila tussling. Many animal species use both low-intensity and high-intensity tactics to resolve conflicts. High-intensity tactics are mostly reserved for escalated fights, which are relatively rare. Because of this, tussling in the flies, like high-intensity fights in other animal species, have not been systematically investigated. Previous studies on fly aggressive behavior have often used socially isolated, relatively young flies within a short observation duration. Their discovery that 1) older (14-days old) flies tend to tussle more often than younger (2 to 7-days-old) flies, 2) group-reared flies tend to tussle more often than socially isolated flies, and 3) flies tend to tussle at later stage (mostly ~15 minutes after the onset of fighting), are the result of their creativity to look outside of conventional experimental settings. These new findings are key for quantitatively characterizing this interesting yet under-studied behavior.</p>
<p>Newly presented data have made several conclusions convincing. Detailed descriptions of methods to quantify behaviors help understand the basis of their claims by improving transparency. However, I remain concerned about authors' persistent attempt to link the high intensity aggression to reproductive success. The authors' effort to &quot;tone down&quot; the link between the two phenomena remains insufficient. There are purely correlational. I reiterate this issue because the overall value of the manuscript would not change with or without this claim.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This work addresses an important question in the field of Drosophila aggression and mating- prior social isolation is known to increase aggression in males by increased lunging, which is suppressed by group housing (GH). However, it is also known that single-housed (SH) males, despite their higher attempts to court females, are less successful. Here, Gao et al., developed a modified aggression assay, to address this issue by recording aggression in Drosophila males for 2 hours, over a virgin female which is immobilized by burying its head in the food. They found that while SH males frequently lunge in this assay, GH males switch to higher intensity but very low-frequency tussling. Constitutive neuronal silencing and activation experiments implicate cVA sensing Or67d neurons promoting high-frequency lunging, similar to earlier studies, whereas Or47b neurons promote low-frequency but higher intensity tussling. Using optogenetic activation they found that three pairs of pC1 neurons- pC1SS2 increase tussling. While P1a neurons, previously implicated in promoting aggression and courtship, did not increase tussling in optogenetic activation (in the dark), they could promote aggressive tussling in thermogenetic activation carried out in the presence of visible light. It was further suggested, using a further modified aggression assay that GH males use increased tussling and are able to maintain territorial control, providing them mating advantage over SI males and this may partially overcome the effect of aging in GH males.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>Using a series of clever neurogenetic and behavioral approaches, subsets of ORNs and pC1 neurons were implicated in promoting tussling behaviors. The authors devised a new paradigm to assay for territory control which appears better than earlier paradigms that used a food cup (Chen et al, 2002), as this new assay is relatively clutter-free, and can be eventually automated using computer vision approaches. The manuscript is generally well-written, and the claims made are largely supported by the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your precise summary of our study, and being very positive on the novelty and significance of the study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>I have a few concerns regarding some of the evidence presented and claims made as well as a description of the methodology, which needs to be clarified and extended further.</p>
<p>(1) Typical paradigms for assaying aggression in Drosophila males last for 20-30 minutes in the presence of nutritious food/yeast paste/females or all of these (Chen et al. 2002, Nilsen et al., 2004, Dierick et al. 2007, Dankert et al., 2009, Certel &amp; Kravitz 2012). The paradigm described in Figure 1 A, while important and more amenable for video recording and computational analysis, seems a modification of the assay from Kravitz lab (Chen et al., 2002), which involved using a female over which males fight on a food cup. The modifications include a flat surface with a central food patch and a female with its head buried in the food, (fixed female) and much longer adaptation and recording times respectively (30 minutes, 2 hours), so in that sense, this is not a 'new' paradigm but a modification of an existing paradigm and its description as new should be appropriately toned down. It would also be important to cite these earlier studies appropriately while describing the assay.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now toned down the description of the paradigm and cited more related references.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Lunging is described as a 'low intensity' aggression (line 111 and associated text), however, it is considered a mid to high-intensity aggressive behavior, as compared to other lower-intensity behaviors such as wing flicks, chase, and fencing. Lunging therefore is lower in intensity 'relative' to higher intensity tussling but not in absolute terms and it should be mentioned clearly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the description as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is often difficult to distinguish faithfully between boxing and tussling and therefore, these behaviors are often clubbed together as box, tussle by Nielsen et al., 2004 in their Markov chain analysis as well as a more detailed recent study of male aggression (Simon &amp; Heberlein, 2020). Therefore, authors can either reconsider the description of behavior as 'box, tussle' or consider providing a video representation/computational classifier to distinguish between box and tussle behaviors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, we could not faithfully distinguish boxing and tussling. To address this concern, we now made textual changes in the result section we occasionally observed the high-intensity boxing and tussling behavior in male flies, which are difficult to distinguish and hereafter simply referred to as tussling.</p>
<p>We also added this information in the Materials and Methods section Tussling is often mixed with boxing, in which both flies rear up and strike the opponent with forelegs. Since boxing is often transient and difficult to distinguish from tussling, we referred to the mixed boxing and tussling behavior simply as tussling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Simon &amp; Heberlein, 2020 showed that increased boxing &amp; tussling precede the formation of a dominance hierarchy in males, and lunges are used subsequently to maintain this dominant status. This study should be cited and discussed appropriately while introducing the paradigm.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now cited this important study in both the Introduction and Discussion sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) It would be helpful to provide more methodological details about the assay, for instance, a video can be helpful showing how the males are introduced in the assay chamber, are they simply dropped to the floor when the film is removed after 30 minutes (Figures 1-2)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provided more detailed description about behavioral assays and how we analyze them. For example All testers were loaded by cold anesthesia. After a 30-minute adaptation, the film was gently removed to allow the two males to fell into the behavioral chamber, and the aggressive behavior was recorded for 2 hours.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The strain of Canton-S (CS) flies used should be mentioned as different strains of CS can have varying levels of aggression, for instance, CS from Martin Heisenberg lab shows very high levels of aggressive lunges. Are the CS lines used in this study isogenized? Are various genetic lines outcrossed into this CS background? In the methods, it is not clear how the white gene levels were controlled for various aggression experiments as it is known to affect aggression (Hoyer et al. 2008).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used the wtcs flies from Baker lab in Janelia Research Campus, and are not sure where they are originated. We appreciate your concern on the use of wild-type strains as they may show different fighting levels, but this study mainly used wild-type strains to compare behavioral differences between SH and GH males. All flies tested in this study are in w+ background, based on w+ balancers flies but are not backcrossed. We have listed detailed genotypes of all tested flies in Table S1 in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) How important it is to use a fixed female for the assay to induce tussling? Do these females remain active throughout the assay period of 2.5 hours? Is it possible to use decapitated virgin females for the assay? How will that affect male behaviors?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used a fixed female to restrict it in the center of food. These females remain active throughout the assay as their legs and abdomens can still move. Such design intends to combine the attractive effects from both female and food. One can also use decapitated females, but in this case, males can push the decapitated female into anywhere in the behavioral chamber. The logic to use fixed females has now been added in the Materials and Methods section of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Raster plots in Figure 2 suggest a complete lack of tussling in SH males in the first 60 minutes of the encounter, which is surprising given the longer duration of the assay as compared to earlier studies (Nielsen et al. 2004, Simon &amp; Heberlein, 2020 and others), which are able to pick up tussling in a shorter duration of recording time. Also, the duration for tussling is much longer in this study as compared to shorter tussles shown by earlier studies. Is this due to differences in the paradigm used, strain of flies, or some other factor? While the bar plots in Figure 2D show some tussling in SH males, maybe an analysis of raster plots of various videos can be provided in the main text and included as a supplementary figure to address this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, tussling is very low in SH males in our paradigm, which may be due to different genetic backgrounds and behavioral assays. Since tussling behavior is a rare fighting form, it is not surprising to see variation between studies from different labs. Nevertheless, this study compared tussling behaviors in SH and GH males, and our finding that GH males show much more tussling behaviors is convincing. The longer duration of tussling in our paradigm may also be due to the modified behavioral paradigm, which also supports that tussling is a high-level fighting form.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Neuronal activation experiments suggesting the involvement of pC1SS2 neurons are quite interesting. Further, the role of P1a neurons was demonstrated to be involved in increasing tussling in thermogenetic activation in the presence of light (Figure 4, Supplement 1), which is quite important as the role of vision in optogenetic activation experiments, which required to be carried out in dark, is often not mentioned. However, in the discussion (lines 309-310) it is mentioned that PC1SS2 neurons are 'necessary and sufficient' for inducing tussling. Given that P1a neurons were shown to be involved in promoting tussling, this statement should be toned down.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this important comment. We now toned down the statement on pC1SS2 function.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Are Or47b neurons connected to pC1SS2 or P1a neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We conducted pathway analysis in the FlyWire electron microscopy database to investigate the connection between Or47b neurons and pC1 neurons. The results indicate that at least three levels of interneurons are required to establish a connection from Or47b neurons to pC1 neurons. Although the FlyWire database currently only contains neuronal data from female brains, they provide a reference for circuit connect in males.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The paradigm for territory control is quite interesting and subsequent mating advantage experiments are an important addition to the eventual outcome of the aggressive strategy deployed by the males as per their prior housing conditions. It would be important to comment on the 'fitness outcome' of these encounters. For instance, is there any fitness advantage of using tussling by GH males as compared to lunging by SH males? The authors may consider analyzing the number of eggs laid and eclosed progenies from these encounters to address this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree with you and other reviewers that increased tussling behaviors correlate with better mating competition, but it is difficult for us to make a direct link between them. Thus, in the revised manuscript, we prefer to tone down this statement but not expanding on this part.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Gao et al. investigated the change of aggression strategies by the social experience and its biological significance by using Drosophila. Two modes of inter-male aggression in Drosophila are known lunging, high-frequency but weak mode, and tussling, low-frequency but more vigorous mode. Previous studies have mainly focused on the lunging. In this paper, the authors developed a new behavioral experiment system for observing tussling behavior and found that tussling is enhanced by group rearing while lunging is suppressed. They then searched for neurons involved in the generation of tussling. Although olfactory receptors named Or67d and Or65a have previously been reported to function in the control of lunging, the authors found that these neurons do not function in the execution of tussling, and another olfactory receptor, Or47b, is required for tussling, as shown by the inhibition of neuronal activity and the gene knockdown experiments. Further optogenetic experiments identified a small number of central neurons pC1[SS2] that induce the tussling specifically. In order to further explore the ecological significance of the aggression mode change in group rearing, a new behavioral experiment was performed to examine territorial control and mating competition. Finally, the authors found that differences in the social experience (group vs. solitary rearing) are important in these biologically significant competitions. These results add a new perspective to the study of aggressive behavior in Drosophila. Furthermore, this study proposes an interesting general model in which the social experience-modified behavioral changes play a role in reproductive success.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>A behavioral experiment system that allows stable observation of tussling, which could not be easily analyzed due to its low frequency, would be very useful. The experimental setup itself is relatively simple, just the addition of a female to the platform, so it should be applicable to future research. The finding about the relationship between the social experience and the aggression mode change is quite novel. Although the intensity of aggression changes with the social experience was already reported in several papers (Liu et al., 2011, etc), the fact that the behavioral mode itself changes significantly has rarely been addressed and is extremely interesting. The identification of sensory and central neurons required for the tussling makes appropriate use of the genetic tools and the results are clear. A major strength of the neurobiology in this study is the finding that another group of neurons (Or47b-expressing olfactory neurons and pC1[SS2] neurons), distinct from the group of neurons previously thought to be involved in low-intensity aggression (i.e. lunging), function in the tussling behavior. Further investigation of the detailed circuit analysis is expected to elucidate the neural substrate of the conflict between the two aggression modes.</p>

<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The experimental systems examining the territory control and the reproductive competition in Figure 5 are novel and have advantages in exploring their biological significance. However, at this stage, the authors' claim is weak since they only show the effects of age and social experience on territorial and mating behaviors, but do not experimentally demonstrate the influence of aggression mode change itself. In the Abstract, the authors state that these findings reveal how social experience shapes fighting strategies to optimize reproductive success. This is the most important perspective of the present study, and it would be necessary to show directly that the change of aggression mode by social experience contributes to reproductive success.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our data did not directly show that it is the change of aggression mode that results in territory and reproductive advantages in GH males. To address the concern, we have toned down the statement throughout the manuscript. For example, we made textual changes in the abstract as following</p>
<p>Moreover, shifting from lunging to tussling in socially enriched males is accompanied with better territory control and mating success, mitigating the disadvantages associated with aging. Our findings identify distinct sensory and central neurons for two fighting forms and suggest how social experience shapes fighting strategies to optimize reproductive success.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, a detailed description of the tussling is lacking. For example, the authors state that the tussling is less frequent but more vigorous than lunging, but while experimental data are presented on the frequency, the intensity seems to be subjective. The intensity is certainly clear from the supplementary video, but it would be necessary to evaluate the intensity itself using some index. Another problem is that there is no clear explanation of how to determine the tussling. A detailed method is required for the reproducibility of the experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this important suggestion. We now analyzed duration of tussling and lunging, and found that a lunging event is often very short (less than 0.2s), while a tussling event may last from seconds to minutes. This new data is added as Figure 2G. In addition, we also provided more detailed methods regarding to tussling behavior</p>

<bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, Gao et al. presented a series of intriguing data that collectively suggest that tussling, a form of high-intensity fighting among male fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) has a unique function and is controlled by a dedicated neural circuit. Based on the results of behavioral assays, they argue that increased tussling among socially experienced males promotes access to resources. They also concluded that tussling is controlled by a class of olfactory sensory neurons and sexually dimorphic central neurons that are distinct from pathways known to control lunges, a common male-type attack behavior.</p>
<p>A major strength of this work is that it is the first attempt to characterize the behavioral function and neural circuit associated with Drosophila tussling. Many animal species use both low-intensity and high-intensity tactics to resolve conflicts. High-intensity tactics are mostly reserved for escalated fights, which are relatively rare. Because of this, tussling in the flies, like high-intensity fights in other animal species, has not been systematically investigated. Previous studies on fly aggressive behavior have often used socially isolated, relatively young flies within a short observation duration. Their discovery that 1) older (14-days-old) flies tend to tussle more often than younger (2-days-old) flies, 2) group-reared flies tend to tussle more often than socially isolated flies, and 3) flies tend to tussle at a later stage (mostly ~15 minutes after the onset of fighting), are the result of their creativity to look outside of conventional experimental settings. These new findings are keys for quantitatively characterizing this interesting yet under-studied behavior.</p>
<p>Precisely because their initial approach was creative, it is regrettable that the authors missed the opportunity to effectively integrate preceding studies in their rationale or conclusions, which sometimes led to premature claims. Also, while each experiment contains an intriguing finding, these are poorly related to each other. This obscures the central conclusion of this work. The perceived weaknesses are discussed in detail below.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the precise summary of the key findings and novelty of the study, and your insightful suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Most importantly, the authors' definition of &quot;tussling&quot; is unclear because they did not explain how they quantified lunges and tussling, even though the central focus of the manuscript is behavior. Supplemental movies S1 and S2 appear to include &quot;tussling&quot; bouts in which 2 flies lunge at each other in rapid succession, and supplemental movie S3 appears to include bouts of &quot;holding&quot;, in which one fly holds the opponent's wings and shakes vigorously. These cases raise a concern that their behavior classification is arbitrary. Specifically, lunges and tussling should be objectively distinguished because one of their conclusions is that these two actions are controlled by separate neural circuits. It is impossible to evaluate the credibility of their behavioral data without clearly describing a criterion of each behavior.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this very important suggestion. We now provided more detailed description of the two fighting forms in the Materials and Methods section. See below</p>
<p>Lunging is characterized by a male raising its forelegs and quickly striking the opponent, and each lunge typically lasts less than 0.2 seconds through detailed analysis. Tussling is characterized by both males using their forelegs and bodies to tumble over each other, and this behavior may last from seconds to minutes. Tussling is often mixed with boxing, in which both flies rear up and strike the opponent with forelegs. Since boxing is often transient and difficult to distinguish from tussling, we referred to the mixed boxing and tussling behavior simply as tussling. As we manually analyze tussling for 2 hours for each pair of males, it is possible that we may miss some tussling events, especially those quick ones.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is also confusing that the authors completely skipped the characterization of the tussling-controlling neurons they claimed to have identified. These neurons (a subset of so-called pC1 neurons labeled by previously described split-GAL4 line pC1SS2) are central to this manuscript, but the only information the authors have provided is its gross morphology in a low-resolution image (Figure 4D, E) and a statement that &quot;only 3 pairs of pC1SS2 neurons whose function is both necessary and sufficient for inducing tussling in males&quot; (lines 310-311). The evidence that supports this claim isn't provided. The expression pattern of pC1SS2 neurons in males has been only briefly described in reference 46. It is possible that these neurons overlap with previously characterized dsx+ and/or fru+ neurons that are important for male aggressions (measured by lunges), such as in Koganezawa et al., Curr. Biol. 2016 and Chiu et al., Cell 2020. This adds to the concern that lunge and tussling are not as clearly separated as the authors claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for this important question. Indeed, there are many experiments that could do to better understand the function of pC1SS2 neurons, and we only provide the initial characterization of them due to the limited scope of this study. My lab has been focused on studying P1/pC1 function in both male and female flies and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>To partially address your concern, we made the following revisions</p>
<p>(1) We provided higher-resolution images of P1a and pC1SS2 (Figure 4C-4E). While their cell bodies are very close, they project to distinct brain regions, in addition to some shared ones.</p>
<p>(2) By staining these neurons with GFP and co-staining with anti-FruM or anti-DsxM antibodies, we showed that P1a neurons are partially FruM-positive and partially DsxM-positive, while pC1SS2 neurons are DsxM-positive and FruM-negative (Figure 5A-5D).</p>
<p>(3) As pC1SS2 neurons are DsxM-positive and FruM-negative, we also examined how DsxM regulates the development of these neurons. We found that knocking down DsxM expression in pC1SS2 neurons using RNAi significantly affected pC1 development regarding to both cell numbers (Figure 5G) and their projections (Figure 5H).</p>
<p>(4) We further found that DsxM in pC1SS2 neurons is crucial for executing their tussling-promoting function, as optogenetic activation of these neurons with DsxM knockdown failed to induce tussling behavior in the initial activation period, and a much lower level of tussling in the second activation period compared to control males (Figure 5I-5K).</p>
<p>(5) While it is very difficult to identify the upstream and downstream neurons of P1a and pC1SS2 neurons, we made an initial step by utilizing trans-tango and retro-Tango to visualize potential downstream and upstream neurons of P1a and pC1SS2 (Figure 4-figure supplement 2), which certainly needs future investigation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While their characterizations of tussling behaviors in wild-type males (Figures 1 and 2) are intriguing, the remaining data have little link with each other, making it difficult to understand what their main conclusion is. Figure 3 suggests that one class of olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) that express Or47b is necessary for tussling behavior. While the authors acknowledged that Or47b-expressing OSNs promote male courtship toward females presumably by detecting cuticular compounds, they provided little discussion on how a class of OSN can promote two different types of innate behavior. No evidence of a functional or circuitry relationship between the Or47b pathway and the pC1SS2 neurons was provided. It is unclear how these two components are relevant to each other.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It has been previously found that Or47b-expressing ORNs respond to fly pheromones common to both sexes, and group-housing enhances their sensitivity. Regarding to how Or47b ORNs promotes two different types of innate behaviors, a simple explanation is that they act on multiple second-order and further downstream neurons to regulate both courtship and aggression, not mentioning that neural circuitries for courtship and aggression are partially shared. We did not include this in the discussion as we would like to focus on aggression modes, and how different ORNs (Or47b and Or67d) mediate distinct aggression modes.</p>
<p>Regarding to the relationship between Or47b ORNs and pC1<sub>SS2</sub> neurons, or in general ORNs to P1/pC1, it is interesting and important to explore, but probably in a separate study. We tried to conduct pathway connection analyses from Or47b to pC1 using the FlyWire database, and found that Or47b neurons can act on pC1 neurons via three layers of interneurons. Although the FlyWire database currently only contains neuronal data from female brains, they can provide a certain degree of reference. We hope the editor and reviewers would agree with us that identifying these intermediate neurons involved in their connection is beyond this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lastly, the rationale of the experiment in Figure 5 and the interpretation of the results is confusing. The authors attributed a higher mating success rate of older, socially experienced males over younger, socially isolated males to their tendency to tussle, but tussling cannot happen when one of the two flies is not engaged. If, for instance, a socially isolated 14-day-old male does not engage in tussling as indicated in Figure 2, how can they tussle with a group-housed 14-day-old male? Because aggressive interactions in Figure 5 were not quantified, it is impossible to conclude that tussling plays a role in copulation advantage among pairs as authors argue (lines 282-288).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, we do not have direct evidence to show it is tussling that makes socially experienced males to dominate over socially isolated males. To address your concern, we have made following revisions</p>
<p>(1) We toned down the statements about the relationship between fighting strategies and reproductive success throughout the manuscript. For example, in the abstract Moreover, shifting from lunging to tussling in socially enriched males is accompanied with better territory control and mating success.</p>
<p>(2)  Regarding to whether a SH male can engage in tussling with a GH male, we found that while two SH males rarely perform tussling, paired SH and GH males displayed similar levels of tussling like two GH males, although tussling duration from paired SH and GH males is significantly lower compared to that in two GH males (Figure 6-figure supplement 2).</p>
<p>(3) To support the potential role of tussling in territory control and mating competition, we performed additional experiments to silence Or47b or pC1SS2 neurons that almost abolished tussling, and paired these males with control males. We found that males with Or47b or pC1SS2 neurons silenced cannot compete over control males, further suggesting the involvement of tussling in territory control and mating competition.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Despite these weaknesses, it is important to acknowledge the authors' courage to initiate an investigation into a less characterized, high-intensity fighting behavior. Tussling requires the simultaneous engagement of two flies. Even if there is confusion over the distinction between lunges and tussling, the authors' conclusion that socially experienced flies and socially isolated flies employ distinct fighting strategies is convincing. Questions that require more rigorous studies are 1) whether such differences are encoded by separate circuits, and 2) whether the different fighting strategies are causally responsible for gaining ethologically relevant resources among socially experienced flies. Enhanced transparency of behavioral data will help readers understand the impact of this study. Lastly, the manuscript often mentions previous works and results without citing relevant references. For readers to grasp the context of this work, it is important to provide information about methods, reagents, and other key resources.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for this comment and we almost totally agree.</p>
<p>(1) Our results suggest the involvement of distinct sensory neurons and central neurons for lunging and tussling, but do not exclude the possibility that they may also utilize shared neurons. For example, activation of P1a neurons promotes both lunging and tussling in the presence of light.</p>
<p>(2) We have now toned down the statements about the relationship between fighting strategies and reproductive success throughout the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figure 1 Supplement 1 shows that increased aging has a linear and inverse relationship with the number of lunges, this is in contrast to a previous study from Dierick lab (Chowdhury, 2021), where using Divider assays they showed that aggressive lunges increased up to day 10 and subsequently decreased in 30-day old flies. Given that this study did not use 14-day-old flies, it might be useful to comment on this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. Indeed, Chowdhury et al., suggested a decline of lunging after 10 days, which is not contradictory to our findings that lunging in 14d-old males is lower than that in 7d-old males. It is ideally to perform a time-series experiments to reveal the detailed relationship between ages and aggression (lunging or tussling) levels, but given our initial findings that 14d-old males showed stable tussling behavior, we prefer to use this time point for the rest of this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) For Figure 3, do various manipulations also affect the duration of tussling and boxing besides frequency and latency?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. We only analyzed latency and frequency, but not duration, as data analysis was performed manually rather than automatically on every fly pair for about 2 hours, which is very labor-consuming. We hope you could agree with us that the two parameters (frequency and latency) for tussling are representative for assaying this behavior.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) For Figure 3 A-F, the housing status of the males is not clearly mentioned either in the main text or the figure. What is the status of the tussling and lunging status when this housing condition is reversed when Or47b neurons are silenced, or the gene is knocked down? Do these manipulations overcome the effect of housing conditions similar to what is seen in NaChBac-mediated activation experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 3A-F used group-housed males and we have now added such information in the figure legends as well as Table S1.</p>
<p>We appreciate your suggestion on using different housing conditions. As silencing Or47b neurons or knocking down Or47b reduced tussling, it is reasonable to use GH males (as we did in Figure 3A-F) that performed stable tussling behavior, but not SH males that rarely tussle.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The connections between Or47b neurons and pC1SS2 or P1a neurons can be addressed by available connectomic datasets or TransTango/GRASP approaches.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this important suggestion. We used the FlyWire electron microscope database to analyze the pathway connections between these two types of neurons. The results indicated that there are at least three levels of interneurons for connecting Or47b and pC1 neurons. Although the FlyWire database currently only contains neuronal data from female brains, they can provide a certain degree of reference for males.</p>
<p>The lack of direct synaptic connection also suggests that it is challenging to resolve the connection between these two neuronal types using methods like trans-Tango/GRASP. To partially address this question, we utilized trans-Tango and retro-Tango techniques to visualize potential downstream and upstream neurons of P1a and pC1SS2 (Figure 4-figure supplement 2). Future investigations are certainly needed for clarifying functional connections between Or47b/Or67d and P1a/pC1SS2 neurons.</p>

<p>(1) Major comment 1</p>
<p>As pointed out in the public review, the weakness of this study is that the relationship between the aggression strategy and reproductive success is an inference that is not based on experimental facts; I understand that the frequency of tussling is not so high, but at least tussling-like behavior can be observed in the territory control experiment shown in Video 3. Wouldn't it be possible to re-analyse data and examine the correlation between aggressive behavior and territory control? Even if the analysis of tussling itself in this setup is difficult, for example, additional experiments using Or47b knock-out fly or pC1[SS2]-inactivated fly could provide stronger support.</p>

<p>Indeed, we can only make a correlation between the type of aggressive behavior and territory control. We now toned down this statement throughout the manuscript. For example, in the abstract, we changed our conclusions as following</p>

<p>(2) Major comment 2</p>
<p>The tussling is the central subject of this paper. However, neither the main text nor Materials and Methods section provides a clear explanation of how this aggression mode was detected. Did the authors determine this behavior manually? Or was it automatically detected by some kind of image analysis? In either case, the criteria and method for detecting the tussling should be clearly described.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The behavioral data analysis in this study was performed manually. We now provided more detailed description of the two fighting forms in the Materials and Methods section. See below</p>
<p>Lunging is characterized by a male raising its forelegs and quickly striking the opponent, and each lunge typically lasts less than 0.2 seconds through detailed analysis. Tussling is characterized by both males using their forelegs and bodies to tumble over each other, and this behavior may last from seconds to minutes. Tussling is often mixed with boxing, in which both flies rear up and strike the opponent with forelegs. Since boxing is often transient and difficult to distinguish from tussling, we referred to the mixed boxing and tussling behavior simply as tussling. As we manually analyze tussling for 2 hours for each pair of males, it is possible that we may miss some tussling events, especially those quick ones.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the experimental groups where tussling cannot be observed, the latency is regarded as 120 min, but this is a value depending on the observation time. While it is reasonable to use the latency to evaluate the behavior such as the lunging that is observed at relatively early times, care should be taken when using it to evaluate the tussling. Since similar trends to those obtained for the latency are observed for Number of tussles and % of males performing tussling, it may be better to focus on these two indices.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We initially intended to provide all three statistical metrics. However, we found that using the &quot;% of males performing tussling&quot; would require a significantly larger sample size for subsequent statistical analysis (using chi-square tests), greatly increasing the workload. At the same time, we believe that the trend observed with &quot;% of males performing tussling&quot; is consistent with the other two indices, and the percentage information can also be derived from the individual sample scatter data of the other two metrics. Therefore, we opted to use &quot;latency&quot; and &quot;numbers&quot; as the statistical metrics, despite the caveat as you mentioned.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors repeatedly mention that tussling is less frequent but more vigorous. The low frequency can be understood from the data in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, but there are no measured data on the intensity. As the authors mention in line 125, each tussling event appears to be sustained for a relatively long period, as can be seen from the ethogram in Fig. 2. For example, it would be possible to evaluate the intensity by measuring the duration of the tussling event.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We now analyzed duration of tussling and lunging, and found that a lunging event is often very short (less than 0.2s), while a tussling event may last from seconds to minutes, further supporting their relative intensities.

<p>b) Line 174 The trans-Tango is basically a postsynaptic cell labeling technique. It is unlikely that the labeling intensity changes depending on neuronal activity. Do the authors want to say in this text the high activity of Or47b-expressing neurons under GH conditions? Or are they trying to show that the expression level of the Or47b gene, which is supposedly monitored by the expression of GAL4, is increased by GH conditions? The authors should clarify which is the case.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although the primary function of the trans-Tango technique is to label downstream neurons, the original literature indicates that the signal strength in downstream neurons depends on the use of upstream neurons evidenced by age-dependent trans-Tango signals. Therefore, the trans-Tango technique can indirectly reflect the usage of upstream neurons. Our findings that GH males showed broader Or47b trans-Tango signals than SH males can indirectly suggest that group-housing experience acts on Or47b neurons. We made textually changes to clarify this.</p>

<p>We have now added this reference at the appropriate place in the revised manuscript. In addition, we have clarified that these two drivers exhibit sexually dimorphic expression patterns in the brain.</p>

<p>(5) Line 233-235 The authors' observation that control males do not form a clear dominance directly contradicts previous observations by others (Nilsen et al., PNAS 10112342 (2002); Yurkovic et al., PNAS 10317519 (2006); also see Trannoy et al., PNAS 1134818 (2016) and Simon and Heberlein above). The authors must at least discuss why their results are different.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is a misunderstanding here. We clearly state that there is a ‘winner takes all’ phenomenon. However, for wild-type males of the same age and housing condition, we calculated the winning index as (num. of wins by unmarked males – num. of wins by marked males)/10 encounters * 100%, which is roughly zero due to the randomness of marking.</p>

<p>(6) Line 251-254 The authors' observation that aged males are less competitive than younger males contradicts the conclusion in ref #18. Discussion is required.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added a discussion on this matter. In brief, Lin et al., showed that 7d-old males are more competitive than 2d-old males, which is probably due to different levels of sexual maturity of males, but not a matter of age like our study that used up to 21d-old males.</p>
