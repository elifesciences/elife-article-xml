<title>Abstract</title><p>Mammalian mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes are able to associate into quaternary structures named supercomplexes (SCs), which normally coexist with non bound individual complexes. The functional significance of SCs has not been fully clarified and the debate has been centered on whether or not they confer catalytic advantages to the non-bound individual complexes. Mitochondrial respiratory chain organization does not seem to be conserved in all organisms. In fact, and differently from mammalian species, mitochondria from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> tissues are characterized by low amounts of SCs, despite the high metabolic demands and MRC activity shown by these mitochondria. Here, we show that attenuating the biogenesis of individual respiratory chain complexes was accompanied by increased formation of stable SCs, which are missing in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in physiological conditions. This phenomenon was not accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial respiratory activity. Therefore, we conclude that SC formation is necessary to stabilize the complexes in suboptimal biogenetic conditions, but not for the enhancement of respiratory chain catalysis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitochondria are the organelles providing most of the cellular energy in form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in aerobic eukaryotes. The molecular machinery responsible for energy transformation is the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, which is canonically composed of five multiprotein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. OXPHOS consists of two tightly regulated processes: electron transport and ATP synthesis. Electron transport takes place between complexes I-IV and two mobile electron carriers (coenzyme Q and cytochrome <italic>c</italic>). During electron transport, complexes I, III and IV pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, generating a proton gradient that provides the protonmotive force exploited by complex V to synthesize ATP. In mammalian mitochondria, mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes I, III and IV can interact with each other forming supramolecular structures described generally by the term ‘supercomplexes’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. MRC supercomplexes (SCs) can have different stoichiometries and compositions, ranging from the binding of only two complexes, such as the I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> and III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1</sub> SCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], to higher-order associations between complexes I, III and IV, with the SC of I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1</sub> stoichiometry known as the ‘respirasome’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Now that the association of individual MRC complexes into supramolecular structures is well established, with structures of several SC species being resolved, the debate is centered on what the functional significance of these structures might be.</p>
<p>Several possible roles have been proposed for SCs. First, it was suggested that the association between complex I (CI) and the obligate dimer of complex III (CIII<sub>2</sub>) would allow substrate channeling, sequestering a dedicated coenzyme Q (CoQ) pool and allowing a more efficient electron transfer between the two complexes, while separating this electronic route from those of FADH<sub>2</sub>-linked dehydrogenases (e.g. complex II) to the CIII<sub>2</sub> not bound to CI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. This increased efficiency would in turn decrease electron leak and, as a consequence, produce less reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the individual free complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. However, the available high-resolution respirasome structures show that the distance between the CoQ binding sites in CI and CIII<sub>2</sub> are far apart and exposed to the membrane, thus not supporting the notion of substrate channeling within the SC structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In addition, exogenously added CoQ was necessary to sustain CI activity in the purified I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> SC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], arguing against a tightly bound and segregated CoQ pool as a functional component of the SC. A large body of work from the late 1960’s to the 1980’s, resulted in the ‘random collision model’ to explain electron transfer between the respiratory chain complexes, and in the evidence that CoQ is present as an undifferentiated pool[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. More recently, additional proof of the non compartmentalized electronic routes from CI to CIII<sub>2</sub> and from complex II (CII) to CIII<sub>2</sub>, came from kinetic measurements in sub-mitochondrial particles. In these systems, MRC organization in SCs was conserved but <italic>b</italic>- and <italic>c</italic>-type cytochromes in CIII<sub>2</sub> were equally accessible to CI-linked and CII-linked substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], and CoQ reduced by CI in the respirasomes was able to reach and readily reduce external enzymes to the SCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In addition, growing evidence supports the notion that different MRC organizations exist <italic>in vivo</italic>, where varying proportions of SC vs. free complexes do not result in separate and distinct CI-linked and CII-linked respiratory activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. This is in contrast with the idea that segregation into different types of SCs and in individual complexes is necessary for the functional interplay of the MRC, leading to the adaptation of the respiratory activity to different metabolic settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. The physical proximity of CIII<sub>2</sub> and CIV has also been suggested to promote faster electron transfer kinetics via cytochrome <italic>c</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], although this is a matter of debate as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>
<p>The second main explanation to justify the existence of SCs is that they play a structural function, stabilizing the individual complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] and/or serving as a platform for the efficient assembly of the complexes, with a special relevance for the biogenesis of mammalian CI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Notably, the MRC structural organization, especially the stoichiometry, arrangements and stability of the SCs, may not be conserved in all eukaryotic species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. This is the case even within mammals, as human cells and tissues barely contain free CI, which is rather contained in SC I<sub>1</sub>+III<sub>2</sub> and the respirasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. In contrast, other mammalian mitochondria (from bovine, ovine, rat or mouse) contain larger amounts of CI in its free form, even if the majority is still mostly in the form of SCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. The distribution of the MRC complexes between free complexes and SCs seems to differ even more in non-mammalian animal species. Several reptile species contain a very stable SC I+III<sub>2</sub> that lacks CIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], and in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> practically all of CI is free, SCs being almost completely absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. However, comparative studies of MRC function in diverse animal species suggest that higher amounts and stability of the SCs do not correlate with increased respiratory activity/efficiency and/or reduced ROS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we show that SCs can be stably formed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mitochondria upon mild perturbations of individual CIV, CIII<sub>2</sub> and CI biogenesis. This finding enabled us to test whether increased SC formation translated into enhanced respiration proficiency. However, MRC performance of fruit fly mitochondria did not change regardless of the presence or absence of SCs. These observations have led us to conclude that: 1) the efficiency in the assembly of the individual complexes is likely to be the main determinant of SC formation and 2) these supramolecular complexes play a more relevant role in maintaining the stability and/or supporting the biogenesis of the MRC than in promoting catalysis.</p>

<title><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> MRC organization does rely on SC formation under physiological conditions</title>
<p>To obtain a detailed characterization of MRC organization in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> we isolated mitochondria from wild-type adults and, after solubilization with digitonin, we performed Blue-Native Gel Electrophoresis (BNGE) followed by mass spectrometry analysis of the gel lanes, using ‘Complexome Profiling (CP)’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] and thus obtaining a profile of peptide intensities from most OXPHOS subunits along the electrophoresis lane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This allowed us to unequivocally determine the identity of the main bands that can be visualized by Coomassie staining of BNGE gels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The identity of the bands corresponding to complex I (CI) and complex IV (CIV) was also confirmed using specific in-gel activity (IGA) assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). These analyses verified that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mitochondria contain extremely low amounts of high-molecular weight CI-containing SCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], using the same solubilization and electrophoresis conditions in which the SCs are readily detectable in mammalian cells and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], dimeric complex V (CV<sub>2</sub>) is easily visualized by BNGE and present in similar amounts as monomeric CV in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mitochondrial membranes solubilized with digitonin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). This CV<sub>2</sub> species is not a strongly bound dimer, as it disappears when the samples are solubilized using a harsher detergent such as dodecylmaltoside (DDM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Conversely, CI is mainly found as a free complex in the native gels irrespective of whether the mitochondria had been solubilized with digitonin or DDM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). The other minor CI-containing band corresponding to the fraction associated with CIII<sub>2</sub>, accounts for about 3% of the total amounts of CI and CIII<sub>2</sub>, according to label-free mass spectrometry quantifications in the CP analysis and densitometric quantifications of the CI-IGA signals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure S1A). CIV activity is absent in this band both in digitonin- and DDM solubilized samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, C</xref>), whereas it is present in the bands that correspond to individual CIV and dimeric CIV (CIV<sub>2</sub>) detected both in digitonin- and DDM-treated samples, as well as in SC III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1,</sub> which is present only in the digitonin-solubilized samples. This is different from mammalian mitochondria in which SC III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1</sub> is present also in DDM-solubilized mitochondria, probably due to the tight binding of CIII<sub>2</sub> to CIV through COX7A2L/SCAF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. The latter does not have a homolog in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> even though this species has three different COX7A isoforms (named COX7A, COX7AL and COX7AL2) that exhibit a tissue-specific expression pattern, according to FlyBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flybase.org">www.flybase.org</ext-link>). CP analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitochondria only detected COX7A (mammalian COX7A1 homolog) and COX7AL2 (mammalian COX7A2 homolog), whereas COX7AL, that is solely expressed in testis, was not found. Therefore, SC I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> can be considered the only stable SC species in physiological conditions in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, yet containing a minute fraction of the total CI and CIII<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>Perturbations of CIV assembly result in increased formation of SC I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub></title>
<p>COA8 is a CIV assembly factor the defects of which cause isolated mitochondrial CIV deficiency in human and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], as well as in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Consistent with the role of Coa8 in CIV biogenesis, CP analysis of mitochondria from <italic>Coa8</italic> knockout (<italic>Coa8<sup>KO</sup></italic>) flies showed a clear decrease in fully assembled CIV and in all the CIV containing species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>) when compared to the corresponding wild-type (WT) individuals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Curiously, CP also showed that in the <italic>Coa8<sup>KO</sup></italic> mitochondria the amounts of SC I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> were noticeably increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). In these samples, complexes I and III<sub>2</sub> build a stable SC species containing ∼16% of the total amount of CI, as visualized by CI-IGA, as well as by western blot (WB) and immunodetection of specific CI and CIII<sub>2</sub> subunits after BNGE in DDM-solubilized mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>, Figure S1A and S2A). We initially speculated that the ∼5-fold increase of SC I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> formation could be linked to the release of III<sub>2</sub> from SC III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1</sub> induced by the strong reduction in CIV amounts when Coa8 is absent.</p>

<p>To test this hypothesis, we modulated Coa8 expression via UAS/GAL4 system using RNAi driven by a ‘mild’ ubiquitous GAL4 driver (<italic>da-gal4</italic>). With this system, the <italic>Coa8</italic> mRNA levels were reduced to ∼60% of the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

<title>Enhanced formation of SC I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> does not result in increased respiratory rates</title>
<p>SC formation was proposed to serve as a means to favor electron transfer between the complexes and therefore increase the efficiency of CI-fueled respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. With this in mind, the complete <italic>Coa8<sup>KO</sup></italic> and mild <italic>Coa8<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> fly mitochondria, which show increased amounts of SC I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> compared to the WT controls, provide an excellent opportunity to test this possibility. Oxygen consumption activities of fly homogenates in the presence of different substrates and inhibitors were analyzed by high-resolution respirometry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). The significant decrease in CIV enzymatic activity in the <italic>Coa8<sup>KO</sup></italic>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) was not reflected by reduced oxygen consumption (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This could be explained as a result of a high CIV excess in fly mitochondria, in which the observed 60% reduction in CIV enzyme activity is still above the threshold at which the CIV defect determines lower respiratory rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. In contrast, the mild reduction in <italic>Coa8</italic> mRNA levels did not result in CIV enzymatic deficiency but produced a slight elevation in CI activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), which is most likely due to the increased SC I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, Figure S1B). However, the <italic>Coa8-KD</italic> mitochondria did not show any differences in respiration with either CI-linked or CII-linked substrates. Also, the increased and stable interactions between complexes I and III<sub>2</sub> in the Coa8 deficient models did not produce a preferential utilization of electrons coming from CI, which would be the prediction if SC formation increased electron transfer efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>

<p>In contrast, less pronounced decreases in <italic>Bcs1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>) by using the mild <italic>da-gal4</italic> driver instead, did not produce a noticeable CIII<sub>2</sub> enzymatic defect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>).

At the functional level, this was associated with a ∼1.5-fold increase in CI enzymatic activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>), which is proportional to the increase in total CI amounts (Figure S1D), and in higher CI-linked respiration rates but only by ∼1.2-fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). CII-linked respiration was the same in the mild <italic>Bcs1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> samples as in the controls.

<title>Mild perturbation of CI biogenesis also leads to increased SC assembly</title>
<p>To understand the effect of the strong and mild perturbations in CI biogenesis on MRC organization in D. melanogaster, we employed a similar strategy as that for CIII (see above).

Defects in <italic>NDUFS4</italic> are a major cause of CI deficiency-associated mitochondrial disease in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] and the mouse and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> animal models display CI deficiency and pathological phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Accordingly, the strong reduction in Ndufs4 expression observed in our models resulted in developmental arrest and a significant decrease in fully assembled CI levels by ∼40% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B, C</xref>, Figure S1E) and in a proportional decrease in NADH:CoQ oxidoreductase enzyme activity in the larvae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). BNGE analysis of the strong <italic>Ndufs4<sup>RNAi</sup> D. melanogaster</italic> mitochondria, revealed the presence of a CI subassembly, containing the core Ndufs3 subunit (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, Figure S2E) but lacking NADH-dehydrogenase activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). This is similar to what is observed in NDUFS4-deficient human and mouse, which accumulate the so-called ∼830 kDa intermediate lacking the N-module and stabilized by the NDUFAF2 assembly factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first description of MRC SCs in the early 2000’s led to opposite opinions on whether these were real and functionally relevant entities. On the one hand, researchers argued that the random collision model and diffusion of the individual MRC complexes was well established experimentally and the idea of the SCs did not fit with these observations. On the other hand, others considered that these SCs were real entities and therefore they must have a functional relevance, mainly as a means to enhance electron transfer between the individual complexes. Presently, the existence of the SCs is not debated anymore, especially after the determination of the high resolution structures by cryo electron microscopy (EM), first of the mammalian respirasomes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]), followed by that of other mammalian SCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], and of mitochondrial respiratory chain SCs from other eukaryotic species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. However, whether SCs provide any catalytical advantage to the MRC or not, is still being debated and opposing views continue to exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. The recent resolution of MRC SCs from different eukaryotic species has revealed that the relative arrangement of the complexes within the SCs and the bridging subunits varies substantially depending on the species. Therefore, given the conservation of the structures of the individual complexes, one could argue that if SC formation was of capital importance for MRC function, the way the complexes interact should be strictly conserved as well. Importantly, neither in the mammalian respirasomes, nor in the mammalian and plant SC I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> there is any evidence of substrate channeling, as the CoQ binding sites in CI and CIII<sub>2</sub> are far apart and exposed to the milieu, in principle allowing the free exchange of CoQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. This is in agreement with different sets of functional data indicating that CoQ is interchangeable between the CI-containing SCs and the rest of the MRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Therefore, this contrasts with the possible segmentation of the CoQ pool - one dedicated to the respirasome and the other to the FADH<sub>2</sub>-linked enzymes – which has been proposed to take place as a consequence of respirasome formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. A further element against the notion that SC formation is essential for mitochondrial function, is the fact that in normal conditions the MRC of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is predominantly organized based on individual complexes, as shown by us in this work and by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> organization was justified by a tighter packing within the mitochondrial cristae and a higher concentration of the mobile electron transporters, as a way to compensate for the lack of SCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. However, inter-species differences in MRC organization do not appear to be of great relevance to determine the level of functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. For example, disaggregation of CI from the SCs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, where there are normally present, did not affect plant viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. Altogether, these observations argue against the strict requirement of SC formation to maintain MRC function.</p>
<p>The second main proposed role for SC is that of stabilizing and/or favoring the assembly of the individual complexes, especially that of CI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>].

This has provided a structural explanation as to why this complex is majorly found as an individual entity, which seems to be due the fact that the N-terminal domain of the NDUFB4 subunit, present in mammals and responsible for the interaction with CIII<sub>2</sub> within the SCs, is absent in the in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. Additionally, fruit fly subunit NDUFA11 has an extended C-terminus that results in a tighter binding of the subunit to the rest of the CI membrane arm. NDUFA11 stabilizes the transmembrane helix anchoring the lateral helix of subunit MT-ND5, bridging the two parts of the membrane arm of CI in plants and mammals, SC formation seem to be important for stabilizing the interaction of NDUFA11 in the CI membrane domain instead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. However, in this work we show that there are ways to induce the formation of CI-containing SCs in fruit fly mitochondria where they normally do not exist. For example, whereas a strong impairment of CIII<sub>2</sub> biogenesis resulted in CIII<sub>2</sub> deficiency, decreased respiration and equal amounts of assembled CI, a mild perturbation of CIII<sub>2</sub> biogenesis did not result in any MRC deficiency but rather in increased CI total amounts, mainly due to enhanced SC formation. Similarly, strong decreases in Ndufs4 expression resulted in low CI amounts and activity, but milder decreases did not affect CI function although CI was redistributed into supramolecular species. In contrast, both the complete KO and mild KD of <italic>Coa8</italic>, induced a significantly increased formation of CI-containing SCs. Even though the <italic>Coa8<sup>KO</sup></italic> flies display a significant reduction in CIV amounts and activity, the loss of COA8 is associated with milder phenotypes in humans, mouse and flies compared with the lack or dysfunction of other CIV assembly factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Therefore, we propose that a partial loss of CIV assembly also induces the formation of SCs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. These observations are in line with the idea that in situations of suboptimal MRC complex biogenesis, formation of CI-containing SCs could be a way to structurally stabilize the system and preserve its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. In the context of the cooperative assembly model, where partially assembled complexes get together before completion forming SC precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], one could envision that slower assembly kinetics would increase the chance of interactions at early stages, letting SC assembly occur in a stable way. Difference in the kinetics of CIV assembly have been observed between human and mouse fibroblasts, which is slower in the human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. Therefore, differences in assembly kinetics could also explain the observed different amounts and stoichiometries of the MRC SCs in different organisms. This is an interesting open question that will deserve further future investigation. In any case, this enhanced SC formation did not translate in an increase in respiratory function nor in a change in substrate preference in any of the tested models. If CI-containing SC formation enhanced respiratory activity significantly, we should have had detected a noticeable increase in CI-linked respiration in all the models of mild perturbation of CIV, CIII<sub>2</sub> and CI. Although we did observe higher respiration with CI-linked substrates in the mild <italic>Bcs1</italic>-KD, this was even lower than the increase in CI enzymatic activity and total abundance.</p>
<p>Therefore, we conclude that the main role of SC formation is to provide structural stability to the MRC, principally for CI, rather than to enhance electron transfer between the complexes during respiration.</p>

<title>Complexome profiling</title>
<p>Mitochondria from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> were analyzed by complexome profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. Isolated mitochondria (0.2 mg) were solubilized with 6 g digitonin/g protein in 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM 6 aminohexanoic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM imidazole/HCl, pH 7.0. After centrifugation at 22,000 X <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4°C, the supernatant was supplemented with Coomassie brilliant blue G250 and proteins were separated by 4-16% gradient BN-PAGE. Digitonin solubilized mitochondrial proteins from bovine heart were loaded as molecular mass standards. Gel lanes were cut into 60 slices, transferred to a 96-well filter microtiter plate (Millipore), and destained in 50% (v/v) methanol, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. After destaining, in-gel digestion with trypsin was performed. Tryptic peptides were separated by liquid chromatography and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a Q-Exactive 2.0 Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (2.8 SP1) equipped with an Easy nLC1000 nano-flow ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the front end. Thermo Scientific Xcalibur 3.1 Software Package was used for data recording. MS RAW data files were analyzed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.0.25). The extracted spectra were matched against the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Uniprot Reference Sequence database (release 2020_04). Database searches were done with 20 ppm match tolerances. Trypsin was selected as the protease with two missed cleavages allowed. Dynamic modifications included N-terminal acetylation and oxidation of methionine. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification. Keratins, and trypsin were removed from the list. The abundance of each protein was determined by label-free quantification using the composite intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ) values determined by MaxQuant analysis and was corrected for loading and MS sensitivity variations between samples based on the total iBAQ value for all detected complex V subunits. Gel migration profiles were created for each protein and normalized to the maximum abundance. Profiles of the identified mitochondrial proteins were hierarchically clustered by distance measures based on Pearson correlation coefficient (uncentered) and the average linkage method using the NOVA software package v0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>]. The visualization and analysis of the heatmaps representing the normalized abundance in each gel slice by a three-color code gradient (black/yellow/red) were done using Microsoft Excel 2019 and Graph Pad Prism 8.4.3. The mass calibration for the BN-PAGE gels was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>]. Membrane proteins were calibrated using the well-known molecular masses of respiratory chain complexes and supercomplexes from bovine heart mitochondria. The soluble proteins were, however, calibrated using the following set of <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins: ATPB (51 kDa), malate dehydrogenase (72 kDa, dimer), citrate synthase (100 kDa, dimer), ETFA/B (122, heterodimer), heat shock protein 60 (410 kDa, heptamer), ALDH7A1 (675 kDa, dodecamer).</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings on the organization of respiratory chain complexes in mitochondria. It provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence that respiratory supercomplex formation in the fruit fly does not impact respiratory function, suggesting the role of these complexes is structural, rather than catalytic. However, whether the conclusions extend to other species requires further evidence. This manuscript will be of broad interest to the field of mitochondrial bioenergetics.</p>

<p>Respiratory chain complexes assemble in higher-ordered structures termed supercomplexes or respirasomes. The functional significance of these assemblies is currently investigated, there are two main hypothesis tested, namely that supercomplexes provide kinetic advantages or structural stability. Here, the authors use the fruitfly to reveal that, while the respiratory chain in the organism normally does not form higher-order assemblies, it does so under conditions when their assembly is impaired. Because the rather moderate increase in supercomplex formation does not change oxygen consumption stimulated by CI or CII substrate, the authors conclude that supercomplex formation has more a structural than a functional role. The main strength of this work is that the technical quality of the experiments is high and that the authors induced defects in respiratory chain assembly through sets of well-controlled genetic models. The obtained data are mostly descriptive using standard approaches and are very well executed. The authors claim that their experiments allow to conclude that the role of supercomplex formation is restricted to a structural role and, hence, exclude a function directly related to electron transport efficiency. However, while the authors can show convincingly that supercomplexes form in the mutants, but not in the wild type, the main questions still remain, namely what is the structural mechanism of supercomplex formation and what is the significance of their formation. Given that the fly system does not show supercomplex formation under normal conditions, it is likely that it evolved functionally to work different than systems having supercomplexes. Because these differences are yet unknown, it remains questionable whether the fly system can be used to inform about the general significance of supercomplexes found in the other systems.</p>

<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The statement in the abstract regarding low amounts of SCs in &quot;insect tissues&quot; needs further support or should be narrowed. I am only aware of detailed characterization of the mitochondrial SC composition from D. melanogaster, which is insufficient to make a broad statement about the large and diverse category of insects. This should be rewritten.</p>

<p>Thank you for the comment. We have amended the text accordingly.</p>

<p>In the introduction (line 76) and discussion (line 283), the authors reference the CoQ binding sites in CI and CIII2 being &quot;too far apart&quot; to allow for substrate channeling. The distance between the active sites, though significant, is insufficient to rule out substrate channeling. A stronger argument arises from the fact that the CoQ sites of both CI and CIII2 are open to the membrane and that there are no clear barriers for the free exchange of CoQ with the membrane pool.</p>

<p>Thank you for the comment. We have modified both sentences accordingly.</p>

<p>Line 195, the slight elevation in CI amounts referred to here, does not appear to be statistically significant and therefore should not be discussed a being altered relative to the control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this point of criticism we have revisited the statistical analysis, originally done by 2-way ANOVA and post-hoc test. After giving it some thought, we now consider that this might not have been the correct way to analyze either the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) activity data or the densitometric quantifications. We have now used unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test to compare the pairs of either KO or KD vs CTRL. The reason is that since the measurement of each individual MRC activity is actually an independent assay, it should be considered separately. The same applies to the densitometry because the absolute values of the intensity of individual CI and that within SCs largely differ. Therefore, we think that it is more correct to compare the abundance of individual CI in the WT vs. either KO or KD pairs and the abundance of the CI in SC independently using a t-test. With these new statistical analyses, the difference in the enzyme activity of CI reported in figure 4D is now significant, which we consider reflects better our observations. Also, with these new analyses, the difference in the amounts of CI+CIII are significantly higher in the Coa8 KD (Figure S1B). Therefore, the original affirmation is correct and we have left the sentence as it was.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 4H, the assignments of the observed larger bands seem incorrect. The largest band (currently assigned as SC I1+III2+IV1) represents too large of a shift for only the addition of CIV and the band currently assigned at SC I1+III2 appears to also contain CIV. The identity of these bands should be reevaluated and additional experiments are needed to definitively prove their identity. This uncertainty should be addressed experimentally or made more explicit in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comment. Taking a closer look at the images, we have to agree with the Reviewer that the assignment was incorrect. The higher band is too large indeed and the reviewer is correct that the band that we previously assigned as CI1+CIII2 does appear to contain CIV as well. Therefore, we have changed the labeling of that to CI1+CIII2+CIV1 because the stoichiometry is compatible with the apparent MW. Also, we have renamed the higher MW band to HMW-SC (high-MW SC) of uncertain nature (unknown stoichiometry) but clearly containing all three complexes I, III and IV. We amended the text (lines 219-221) plus figures 5H and S1 accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 302, the authors state that the structural basis for less SC in D. melanogaster is &quot;due to a more stable association of the NDUFA11 subunit...&quot; However, this would not result is a less stable SC association and only explains why NDUFA11 is more stably associated with CI in the absence of CIII2. The more likely structural reason for the observation of less SC in D. melanogaster is the N-terminal truncation of Dm-NDUFB4 relative to mammalian NDUFB4. This truncation results in the loss of a major SC interaction site between CI and CIII2 in the matrix.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have amended the text accordingly.</p>

However, while the authors can show convincingly that supercomplexes form in the mutants, but not in the wild type, their main claim is not well supported by data and both the structural mechanism of supercompelx formation and their significance remain unknown. While the supercomplex formation observed only in mitochondrial mutants per se is interesting, it would be good to great to define structural aspects of supercomplex formation and their potential impact on the stability of the respiratory chain complexes in these mutants.</p>

<list-item><p>In order to unravel the molecular mechanism by which supercomplexes form in the mutant, it would be important to identify the factor mediating this. Prime candidates would be additional proteins that co-purify of co-fractionate with the respiratory chain when they assemble into supercomplexes or changes in the lipid composition of the mitochondria, where cardiolipin has been shown to stabilize supercomplex formation. The inclusion and analysis of complexome data for all mutants would be excellent, plus an MS analysis of a purified supercomplex.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion to which we completely agree. We have taken a closer look to the hierarchical clustering of peptide intensities in our complexome profiling data, which clusters the proteins according to their similarity in electrophoretic migration within the complexes. We have specifically looked for proteins in which the peptide intensity changed in a similar fashion as the complex I structural subunits. Among the four candidate proteins (Uniprot IDs Q8SXY6, Q95T19, Q9W0Y6, Q9VJQ3), only Q95T19 — Serine--tRNA synthetase-like protein Slimp is annotated as a mitochondrial protein. This protein is a Drosophila-specific paralog of the mitochondrial Serine-tRNA synthetase generated by gene duplication (PMID: 20870726), which carries out a function linking mitochondrial translation with mtDNA maintenance (PMID: 30943413). Therefore, in principle we would not consider it as a good candidate to be a ‘SC assembly factor’. The identification of factors promoting the formation of SC in Drosophila under these conditions is definitely an important point warranting future investigation.</p>

<list-item><p>The authors could define the stability of the respiratory chain complexes through metabolic pulse-chase labeling experiments. This could reveal that the role of supercomplex formation is indeed structural, improving stability.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this would be an important piece of information to understand the phenomenon we have observed. Unfortunately, it is technically impossible to perform metabolic labeling of mitochondrial proteins in whole flies. It would be possible to perform in organello pulse-chase labelling, however our previous experience indicates that complex I does not completely assemble de novo in isolated mitochondria (PMID: 20385768).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The authors should analyze oxygen consumption from mitochondria isolated from larvae as in the other experiments on enzyme activities or the (high-quality) BN-PAGE, and not from whole flies that are homogenized. Moreover, they need to determine the quantities of the complexes by complementary experiments (MS, Western blotting or spectroscopy).</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comments. However, we believe that repeating the entire analyses with the larvae would not add significant information to the work and the main interpretation would not change, as the main claim of the paper is based on the data collected on adult flies. In addition, the band patterns of MRC complexes in the BNGE is the same between larvae and adults and therefore, does not depend on the developmental stage.
Regarding the quantification of the complexes, we think that the data provided by using complementary approaches such as in gel activity assays (IGA), western blot (WB) and kinetic assays of MRC enzymatic activities, allowed us to confidently determine the amount of the individual complexes. Hence, we performed IGA assays and enzymatic activity assays (which reflect the amounts of fully assembled and functional complexes) in triplicate (independent samples).  For the WB analyses, due to the scarcity of some of the antibodies available to detect the Dm MRC proteins, which were a kind gift of Dr. Edward Owusu-Ansah (Columbia University), we decided to pool the three independent samples of each group before running them through the Blue-Native gels. The densitometric curves of the WB bands (Figure S2) show the abundance of each individual MRC complex within the ‘free’ and SC forms. We prioritized the BN analyses over SDS-PAGE and WB analysis, as we consider that just measuring the steady-state levels of MRC subunits is not as informative, because it is possible that certain subunits are present in the mitochondrial membranes but not assembled into the final mature structures.</p>

<list-item><p>Can changes in Coenzyme Q levels explain the absence of a defect on electron transport? This could be determined for the mutant as well as the wild type animals.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this would be a relevant aspect to investigate. For example, determining whether lower CoQ levels are able to maintain the same respiratory activities in the models in which higher amounts of SCs are formed, as it was proposed in Shimada et al. (PMID: 29191512) would be very interesting. However, the fact that the mild KD models show no MRC enzymatic defects whatsoever (Figure 4D, Figure 5I and Figure 6I), provides the most straightforward explanation to the observed absence of respiratory defects.</p>
