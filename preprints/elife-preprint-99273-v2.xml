<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> glides on solid surfaces. Dynamic bacterial focal adhesion complexes (bFACs) convert proton motive force from the inner membrane into mechanical propulsion on the cell surface. It is unclear how the mechanical force transmits across the rigid peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall. Here we show that AgmT, a highly abundant lytic PG transglycosylase homologous to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MltG, couples bFACs to PG. Coprecipitation assay and single-particle microscopy reveal that the gliding motors fail to connect to PG and thus are unable to assemble into bFACs in the absence of an active AgmT. Heterologous expression of <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG restores the connection between PG and bFACs and thus rescues gliding motility in the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells that lack AgmT. Our results indicate that bFACs anchor to AgmT-modified PG to transmit mechanical force across the PG cell wall.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In natural ecosystems, the majority of bacteria attach to surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Surface-associated motility is critical for many bacteria to navigate and populate their environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> moves on solid surfaces using two independent mechanisms: social (S-) motility and adventurous (A-) motility. S-motility, analogous to the twitching motility in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Neisseria</italic>, is powered by the extension and retraction of type IV pili<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. A-motility is a form of gliding motility that does not depend on conventional motility-related cell surface appendages, such as flagella or pili<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. AglR, AglQ, and AglS form a membrane channel that functions as the gliding motor by harvesting proton motive force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Motor units associate with at least fourteen gliding-related proteins that reside in the cytoplasm, inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In each gliding cell, two distinct populations of gliding complexes coexist: dynamic complexes move along helical paths and static complexes remain fixed relative to the substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Motors transport incomplete gliding complexes along helical tracks but form complete, force-generating complexes at the ventral side of cells that appear fixed to the substrate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Based on their functional analogy with eukaryotic focal adhesion sites, these complete gliding machineries are called bacterial focal adhesion complexes (bFACs). Despite their static appearance, bFACs are dynamic under single-molecule microscopy. Individual motors frequently display move-stall-move patterns, in which they move rapidly along helical trajectories, join a bFAC where they remain stationary briefly, then move rapidly again toward the next bFAC or reverse their moving directions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. bFACs adhere to the gliding substrate through an outer membrane adhesin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. As motors transport bFACs toward lagging cell poles, cells move forward but bFACs remain static relative to the gliding substrate.</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Fig. 1.</label>
<caption><title>Stationary bFACs drive <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding.</title>
<p>Motors carrying incomplete gliding complexes either diffuse or move rapidly along helical paths but do not generate propulsion. Motors stall and become nearly static relative to the substrate when they assemble into complete bFACs with other motor-associated proteins at the ventral side of the cell. Stalled motors push MreB and bFACs in opposite directions and thus exert force against outer membrane adhesins. Overall, as motors transport bFACs toward lagging cell poles, cells move forward but bFACs remain static relative to the substrate. IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>bFAC assembly can be quantified at nanometer resolution using the single-particle dynamics of gliding motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Single particles of a fully functional, photoactivatable mCherry (PAmCherry)-labeled AglR display three dynamic patterns, stationary, directed motion, and diffusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The stationary population consists of the motors in fully assembled bFACs, which do not move before photobleach. In contrast, the motors moving in a directed manner carry incomplete gliding complexes along helical tracks, whereas the diffusing motors assemble to even less completeness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. As motors only generate force in static bFACs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, the population of nonmotile motors indicates the overall status of fully assembled bFACs.</p>
<p>However, how bFACs transmit force across the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall is unclear. PG is a mesh-like single molecule of crosslinked glycan strands that surrounds the entire cytoplasmic membrane. The rigidity of PG defines cell shape and protects cells from osmotic lysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. If bFACs physically penetrate PG, their transportation toward lagging cell poles would tear PG and trigger cell lysis. To avoid breaching PG, an updated model proposes that rather than forming stable and rigid complexes, gliding-related proteins only assemble into force-generating machineries in bFACs.</p>
<p>Outside of bFACs, these proteins could localize diffusively or move along with unengaged motor units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To simplify this model, we can artificially divide each gliding machinery into two subcomplexes, one on each side of the PG layer. The inner subcomplexes move freely and only assembly with the outer subcomplexes in bFACs, which transform proton motive force into mechanical propulsion on cell surfaces (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The inner subcomplexes, containing the motors, are the force-generating units in bFACs. As motors reside in the fluid inner membrane, to transmit force to the cell surface, the inner subcomplexes must push against two relatively rigid structures, one on each side of the membrane, in opposite directions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). MreB is a bacterial actin homolog that supports rod shape in many bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In <italic>M. xanthus</italic>, MreB also connects to bFACs on the cytoplasmic side and thus plays essential roles in gliding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The inner subcomplexes could push against MreB filaments and PG in the cytoplasm and periplasm, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The interaction between the inner subcomplexes and PG not only satisfies the physical requirement for force generation but also supports bFAC stability. Without this interaction, the inner and outer subcomplexes can only form transient, “slippery” association, which is predicted to produce short and aberrant cell movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. How the inner complex interacts with PG remains unknown. It was speculated that gliding motors in the inner complex could bind PG directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, such binding has not been confirmed by experiments.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that AgmT, a lytic transglycosylase (LTG) for PG, is required for <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding motility. Whereas AgmT only regulates cell morphology moderately during vegetative growth, it is essential for maintaining PG integrity under the stress from the antibiotic mecillinam. Using single-particle tracking microscopy and coprecipitation assays, we found that AgmT is essential for the inner subcomplexes to connect to PG and stall in bFACs. Importantly, expressing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MltG heterologously rescues the connection between PG and bFACs and thus restores gliding motility. Hence, the LTG activity of AgmT anchors bFACs to PG, potentially by modifying PG structure. Our findings reveal the long-sought connection between PG and bFACs that allows mechanical force to transmit across the PG cell wall.</p>

<title>AgmT, a putative LTG, is required for gliding motility</title>
<p>To elucidate how bFACs interact with PG, we searched for potential PG-binding domains among the proteins that are required for gliding motility. A previous report identified 35 gliding-related genes in <italic>M. xanthus</italic> through transposon-mediated random mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Among these genes, <italic>agmT</italic> (ORF K1515_04910<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>) was predicted to encode an inner membrane protein with a single transmembrane helix (residues 4 – 25) followed by a large “periplasmic solute-binding” domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. No other motility-related genes are found in the vicinity of <italic>agmT</italic>. After careful analysis, we found that AgmT showed significant similarity to the widely conserved YceG/MltG family LTGs. The putative active site, Glu223 (corresponding to E218 in <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, is conserved in AgmT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm the function of AgmT in gliding, we constructed an <italic>agmT</italic> in-frame deletion mutant. We further knocked out the <italic>pilA</italic> gene that encodes pilin for type IV pilus to eliminate S-motility. On a 1.5% agar surface, the <italic>pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells moved away from colony edges both as individuals and in “flare-like” cell groups, indicating that they were still motile with gliding motility. In contrast, the <bold><italic>Δ</italic></bold><italic>aglR pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells that lack an essential component in the gliding motor were unable to move outward from the colony edge and thus formed sharp colony edges. Similarly, the <bold><italic>Δ</italic></bold><italic>agmT pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells also formed sharp colony edges, indicating that they could not move efficiently with gliding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We then imaged individual <bold><italic>Δ</italic></bold><italic>agmT pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells on 1.5% agar surface at 10-s intervals using bright-field microscopy. To our surprise, instead of being static, individual <bold><italic>Δ</italic></bold><italic>agmT pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells displayed slow movements, with frequent pauses and reversals (<bold>Video 1</bold>). To quantify the effects of AgmT, we measured the velocity and gliding persistency (the distances cells traveled before pauses and reversals) of individual cells. Compared to the <italic>pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells that moved at 2.30 ± 1.33 µm/min (n = 46) and high persistency (<bold>Video 2</bold> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>), <bold><italic>Δ</italic></bold><italic>agmT pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells moved significantly slower (0.88 ± 0.62 µm/min, n = 59) and less persistent (<bold>Video 1</bold> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2C</xref><bold>, D</bold>). Such aberrant gliding motility is distinct from the “hyper reversal” phenotype due to the polarity regulators constitutively switching the moving direction of cells, because hyper reversing cells usually maintain gliding velocity at the wild-type level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Instead, such phenotypes match the prediction that when the inner complexes of bFACs lose connection with PG, bFACs can only generate short, and inefficient movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Our data indicate that AgmT is not essential component in the bFACs. Thus, AgmT is likely to regulate the assembly and stability of bFACs, especially their connection with PG.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>AgmT is an LTG</title>
<p>As AgmT is a putative LTG for PG, we then tested if its predicted active site, Glu223, is required for gliding. Because the amino acid following Glu223 is also a glutamate (Glu224), we replaced both glutamate residues with alanine (AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup>) using site-directed mutagenesis to alter their codons on the chromosome. <italic>agmT<sup>EAEA</sup> pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells formed sharp colony edges on agar surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, the putative LTG activity of AgmT is required for <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding motility.</p>
<p>To determine if AgmT is an LTG, we expressed the periplasmic domain (amino acids 25 – 339) of wild-type AgmT and AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We purified PG from wild-type <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells, labeled it with Remazol brilliant blue (RBB), and tested if the purified AgmT variants hydrolyze labeled PG <italic>in vitro</italic> and release the dye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Similar to lysozyme that specifically cleaves the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in PG, wild-type AgmT solubilized dye-labeled <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PG that absorbed light at 595 nm. In contrast, the AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> variant failed to release the dye (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Hence, AgmT displays LTG activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Whereas AgmT does not affect growth rate (<bold>Fig. S2</bold>), cells that lacked AgmT or expressed AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> maintained rod shape but were slightly shorter and wider than the wild-type ones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Nevertheless, altered morphology alone does not likely account for abolished gliding. In fact, a previously reported mutant that lacks all three class A penicillin-binding proteins (<italic>Δ3</italic>) displays similarly shortened and widened morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> but is still motile by gliding (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>).</p>
<p>A recent report revealed that <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> MltG degrades un-crosslinked PG turnover products and prevents their detrimental accumulation in the periplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. To test if AgmT plays a similar role in <italic>M. xanthus</italic>, we used mecillinam to induce cell envelope stress. Mecillinam is a β-lactam that induces the production of toxic, un-crosslinked PG strands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Rather than collapsing the rod shape, mecillinam only causes bulging near the centers of wild-type <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells, whereas large-scale cell lysis does not occur, and cell poles still maintain rod shape even after prolonged (20 h) treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Thus, wild-type <italic>M. xanthus</italic> can largely mitigate mecillinam stress. In contrast, mecillinam-treated <italic>agmT</italic> cells increased their width drastically, displayed significant cell surface irregularity along their entire cell bodies, and lysed frequently (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Cells expressing AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> as the sole source of AgmT displayed similar, but even stronger phenotypes under mecillinam stress, growing into elongated, twisted filaments that formed multiple cell poles and lysed frequently (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). These results confirm that similar to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> MltG, <italic>M. xanthus</italic> AgmT is important for maintaining cell integrity under mecillinam stress. The different responses from <italic>agmT</italic> and <italic>agmT<sup>EAEA</sup></italic> cells suggest that other LTGs could partially substitute AgmT while AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> blocks these enzymes from accessing un-crosslinked PG strands.</p>
<p>AgmT is the only LTG <italic>in M. xanthus</italic> that belongs to the YceG/MltG family. Besides <italic>agmT</italic>, the genome of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> contains 13 genes that encode putative LTGs (<bold>Table S1</bold>). To test if these proteins also contribute to gliding, we knocked out each of these 13 genes in the <italic>pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> background. The resulting mutants all retained gliding motility, indicating that AgmT is the only LTG that is required for <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>).</p>

<title>AgmT is essential for proper bFACs assembly</title>
<p>How does AgmT support gliding? We first tested if AgmT regulates the function of the gliding motor. For this purpose, we quantified the motor dynamics by tracking single particles of AglR, an essential component of the motor. We spotted the cells that express a fully functional, photo-activatable mCherry (PAmCherry)-labeled AglR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> on 1.5% agar surface. We used a 405-nm excitation laser to activate the fluorescence of a few labeled AglR particles randomly in each cell and quantified their localization using a 561-nm laser at 10 Hz using single particle tracking photo-activated localization microscopy (sptPALM) under highly inclined and laminated optical sheet (HILO) illumination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Using this setting, only a thin section of each cell surface that was close to the coverslip was illuminated. To analyze the data, we only chose the fluorescent particles that remained in focus for 4 - 12 frames (0.4 - 1.2 s). As free PAmCherry particles diffuse extremely fast in the cytoplasm, entering and exiting the focal plane frequently, they usually appear as blurry objects that cannot be followed at 10-Hz close to the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. For this reason, the noise from any potential degradation of AglR- PAmCherry was negligible. Consistent with our previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, 32.1% (n = 2,700) of AglR-PAmCherry particles remained within one pixel (160 nm × 160 nm) before photobleach, indicating that they were immotile. The remaining 67.9% AglR-PAmCherry particles were motile, leaving trajectories of various lengths (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref><bold>, 4B</bold>).</p>

<p>bFAC assembly is sensitive to mechanical cues. As the agar concentration increases in gliding substrate, more motor molecules engage in bFACs, where they appear immotile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. We exposed <italic>aglR-PAmCherry</italic> cells to 405-nm excitation (0.2 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 2 s, where most PAmCherry molecules were photoactivated and used epifluorescence to display the overall localization of AglR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. As the agar concentration increased, bFACs increased significantly in size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Accordingly, the immotile AglR particles detected by sptPALM increased from 10.7% (n = 1112) on 0.5% agar to 45.2% (n = 726) on 5.0% agar surface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus, the stationary population of AglR-PAmCherry particles reflects the AglR molecules in fully assembled bFACs.</p>
<p>In contrast to the cells that expressed wild-type AgmT (<italic>agmT<sup>+</sup></italic>), AglR particles were hyper motile in the cells that lacked AgmT or expressed AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup>. On 1.5% agar surfaces, the immotile populations of AglR particles decreased to 10.5% (n = 2,989) and 11.7% (n = 1,408), respectively. Consistently, AglR-containing bFACs were rarely detectable in these cells, even on 5% agar surfaces (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>To test if other components in the gliding machinery also depend on AgmT to assemble into bFACs, we tested the localization of AglZ, a cytoplasmic protein that is commonly used for assessing bFAC assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In the cells that expressed wild-type AgmT, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-labeled AglZ formed a bright cluster at the leading cell pole and multiple static, near-evenly spaced clusters along the cell body, indicating the assembly of bFACs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In contrast, AglZ-YFP only formed single clusters at cell poles in the cells that lacked AgmT or expressed AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Taken together, the LTG activity of AgmT is essential for proper bFACs assembly.</p>

<title>AgmT does not assemble into bFACs</title>
<p>We first hypothesized that AgmT could assemble into bFACs, where it could generate pores in PG specifically at bFAC loci that allow the inner and outer gliding complexes interact directly. Alternatively, it could bind to PG and recruit other components to bFACs through protein-protein interactions. Regardless, if AgmT assembles into bFACs, it should localize in bFACs. To test this possibility, we labeled AgmT with PAmCherry on its C-terminus and expressed the fusion protein as the sole source of AgmT using the native promoter and locus of <italic>agmT</italic>. <italic>agmT-PAmCherry pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells displayed gliding motility that was indistinguishable from <italic>pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), indicating that the fusion protein is functional. Similar to many membrane proteins that resistant to dissociation by SDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, immunoblot using an anti-mCherry antibody showed that AgmT-PAmCherry accumulated in two bands in SDS-PAGE that corresponded to monomers and dimers of the full-length fusion protein, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). This result is consistent with the structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG that functions as homodimers (PDB: 2r1f). Importantly, AgmT-PAmCherry was about 50 times more abundant than AglR-PAmCherry (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). To test if AgmT assembles into bFACs, we first expressed AgmT-PAmCherry and AglZ-YFP together using their respective loci and promoter. We exposed <italic>agmT-PAmCherry</italic> cells to 405-nm excitation (0.2 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 2 s to visualize the overall localization of AgmT. We found that on a 1.5% agar surface that favors gliding motility, AglZ formed bright clusters at cell poles and aggregated in near evenly-spaced bFACs along the cell body. In contrast, AgmT localized near evenly along cell bodies without forming protein clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, AgmT does not localize into bFACs. These results echo the fact that despite its abundance, AgmT has not been identified as a component in bFACs despite extensive pull-down experiments using various bFAC components as baits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>As an additional test, we used sptPALM to track the movements of AgmT-PAmCherry single particles on 1.5 agar surfaces at 10 Hz. We reasoned that if AgmT assembles into bFACs, AgmT and gliding motors should display similar dynamic patterns. Distinct from the AglR particles of which 32.1% remained stationary, AgmT moved in a diffusive manner, showing no significant immotile population. Importantly, compared to the diffusion coefficients (<italic>D</italic>) of motile AglR particles (1.8 × 10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> ± 3.6 × 10<sup>-3</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s (n = 1,833)), AgmT particles diffused much faster (<italic>D</italic> = 2.9 × 10<sup>-2</sup> ± 5.3 × 10<sup>-3</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s (n = 8,548)). Taken together, AgmT and the gliding motor did not display significant correlation in either their localization or dynamics. We thus conclude that AgmT does not assemble into bFACs.</p>

<title>AgmT connects bFACs to PG through its LTG activity</title>
<p>We then explored the possibility that AgmT could modify PG through its LTG activity and thus generate the anchor sites for certain components in bFACs. If this hypothesis is true, heterologous expression of a non-native LTG could rescue gliding motility in the <italic>ΔagmT</italic> strain. To test this hypothesis, we fused the <italic>E. coli mltG</italic> gene (<italic>mltG<sub>Ec</sub></italic>) to a vanillate-inducible promoter and inserted the resulting construct to the <italic>cuoA</italic> locus on <italic>M. xanthus</italic> chromosome that does not interfere gliding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. We subjected the <italic>ΔagmT</italic> and <italic>agmT<sup>EAEA</sup></italic> cells that expressed MltG<sub>Ec</sub> to mecillinam (100 μg/ml) stress. Induced by 200 μM sodium vanillate, MltG<sub>Ec</sub> restored cell morphology and integrity of the <italic>ΔagmT</italic> strain to the wild-type level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This result confirmed that MltG<sub>Ec</sub> was expressed and enzymatically active in <italic>M. xanthus</italic>. In contrast, MltG<sub>Ec</sub> failed to confer mecillinam resistance to the <italic>agmT<sup>EAEA</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). A potential explanation is that AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> could still bind to PG and thus block MltG<sub>Ec</sub> from accessing <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PG.</p>
<p>Consistent with its LTG activity, the expression of MltG<sub>Ec</sub> restored gliding motility of the <italic>ΔagmT pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells on both the colony (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) and single-cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>) levels. Interestingly, in the absence of sodium vanillate, the leakage expression of MltG<sub>Ec</sub> using the vanillate-inducible promoter was sufficient to compensate the loss of AgmT. A plausible explanation of this observation is that as <italic>E. coli</italic> grows much faster (generation time 20 - 30 min) than <italic>M. xanthus</italic> (generation time ∼4 h), MltG<sub>Ec</sub> could possess significantly higher LTG activity than AgmT. Induced by 200 µM sodium vanillate, the expression of MltG<sub>Ec</sub> further but non significantly increased the velocity and gliding persistency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>). Importantly, the expression of MltG<sub>Ec</sub> failed to restore gliding motility in the <italic>agmT<sup>EAEA</sup> pilA</italic> cells, even in the presence of 200 µM sodium vanillate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Consistent with the mecillinam resistance assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), this result suggests that AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> still binds to PG and that in the absence of its LTG activity, AgmT does not anchor bFACs to PG. As MltG<sub>Ec</sub> substitutes AgmT in gliding motility, it is the LTG activity, rather than specific interactions between AgmT and bFACs, that is required for gliding.</p>
<p>It is challenging to visualize how AgmT facilitates bFAC assembly through its enzymatic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. First, the inner complex in a bFAC spans the cytoplasm, inner membrane, and periplasm and contains multiple proteins whose activities are interdependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. It is hence difficult to purify the entire inner complex in its functional state. Second, Faure <italic>et al</italic>. hypothesized that AglQ and AglS in the gliding motor could bind PG directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, such binding has not been proved experimentally due to the difficulty in purifying the membrane integral AglRQS complex. To overcome these difficulties, we used AglR-PAmCherry to represent the inner complex of bFAC and investigated how bFACs bind PG in their native environment. To do so, we expressed AglR-PAmCherry in different genetic backgrounds as the sole source of AglR using the native <italic>aglR</italic> locus and promoter. We lysed these cells using sonication, subjected their lysates to centrifugation, isolated the pellets that contained PG, and detected the presence of AglR-PAmCherry in these pellets by immunoblots using an mCherry antibody. Eliminating AgmT and disabling its active site significantly reduced the amounts of AglR in the pellets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Because such pellets contain both the PG and membrane fractions, we further eliminated PG in cell lysates using lysozyme before centrifugation and determined the amount of AglR-PAmCherry in the pellets that only contained membrane fractions. Regardless of the presence and activity of AgmT, comparable amounts of AglR precipitated in centrifugation pellets after lysozyme treatment, indicating that AgmT does not affect the expression or stability of AglR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Thus, active AgmT facilitates the association between bFACs and PG. Strikingly, the heterologous expression of MltG<sub>Ec</sub> enriched AglR-PAmCherry in the PG-containing pellets from the <italic>ΔagmT</italic> cells but not the <italic>agmT<sup>EAEA</sup></italic> ones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). These results indicate that AgmT connects bFACs to PG through its LTG activity.</p>
<p>The assembly of bFACs produces wave-like deformation on cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, suggesting that their assembly may require a flexible PG layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. As a major contributor to cell stiffness, PG flexibility affects the overall stiffness of cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. To test the possibility that AgmT and MltG<sub>Ec</sub> facilitate bFAC assembly by reducing PG stiffness, we adopted the GRABS assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> to quantify if the lack of AgmT and the expression of MltG<sub>Ec</sub> affects cell stiffness. To quantify changes in cell stiffness, we simultaneously measured the growth of the <italic>pilA<sup>-</sup></italic>, <italic>ΔagmT pilA<sup>-</sup></italic>, and <italic>ΔagmT P<sub>van</sub>-MltG<sub>Ec</sub> pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> (with 200 µM sodium vanillate) cells in a 1% agarose gel infused with CYE and liquid CYE and calculated the GRABS scores of the <italic>ΔagmT pilA<sup>-</sup></italic>, and <italic>ΔagmT P<sub>van</sub>-MltG<sub>Ec</sub> pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells using the <italic>pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> cells as the reference, where positive and negative GRABS scores indicate increased and decreased stiffness, respectively (see Materials and Methods and Ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>). The GRABS scores of the <italic>ΔagmT pilA<sup>-</sup></italic>, and <italic>ΔagmT P<sub>van</sub>-MltG<sub>Ec</sub> pilA<sup>-</sup></italic> (with 200 µM sodium vanillate) cells were -0.06 ± 0.04 and -0.10 ± 0.07 (n = 4), respectively, indicating that neither AgmT nor MltG<sub>Ec</sub> affects cell stiffness significantly. Whereas PG flexibility could still be essential for gliding, AgmT and MltG<sub>Ec</sub> do not regulate bFAC assembly by modulating PG stiffness. Instead, these LTGs could connect bFACs to PG by generating structural features that are irrelevant to PG stiffness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gliding bacteria adopt a broad spectrum of nanomachineries. Compared to the trans-envelope secretion system that drives gliding in <italic>Flavobacterium johnsoniae</italic> and <italic>Capnocytophaga gingivalis</italic>, the gliding machinery of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> appears to lack a stable structure that transverses the cell envelope, especially across the PG layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In order to generate mechanical force from the fluid <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding machinery, the inner complex must establish solid contact with PG and push the outer complex to slide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In this work, we discovered AgmT as the long-sought factor that facilitates persistent gliding by connecting bFACs to PG.</p>
<p>It is surprising that AgmT itself does not assemble into bFACs and that MltG<sub>Ec</sub> substitutes AgmT in gliding. Thus, rather than interacting with bFAC components directly and specifically, AgmT facilitates proper bFAC assembly indirectly through its LTG activity. LTGs usually break glycan strands and produce unique anhydro caps on their ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. However, because AgmT is the only LTGs that is required for gliding, it is not likely to facilitate bFAC assembly by generating such modification on glycan strands. <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG is a glycan terminase that controls the length of newly synthesized PG glycans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Likewise, AgmT could generate short glycan strands and thus uniquely modify the overall structure of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PG, such as producing small pores that retard and retain the inner subcomplexes of bFACs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). On the contrary, the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> mutants that lack active AgmT could produce PG with increased strain length, which blocks bFACs from binding to the cell wall and precludes stable bFAC assembly. However, it would be very difficult to demonstrate how glycan length affects the connection between bFACs and PG.</p>

<p>Then how does AgmT, a protein localized diffusively, facilitate bFAC assembly into near-evenly spaced foci?

Strikingly, <italic>M. xanthus</italic> does assemble bFACs in response to substrate hardness (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) and assembled bFACs could distort the cell envelope, generating undulations on the cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Taken together, whereas AgmT potentially modifies the entire PG layer, it is still the quasiperiodic MreB filaments that determine the loci for bFAC assembly in response to the mechanical cues from the gliding substrate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Most bacteria encode multiple LTGs that function in PG growth, remodeling, and recycling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.

Based on their catalytic folds and domain arrangements, LTGs can be categorized inti six distinct families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Both <italic>M. xanthus</italic> AgmT and <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG belong to the YceG/MltG family, which is the first identified LTG family that is conserved in both Gram-negative and positive bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. About 70% of bacterial genomes, including firmicutes, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria, encode YceG/MltG domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The unique inner membrane localization of this family and the fact that AgmT is the only <italic>M. xanthus</italic> LTG that belongs to this family (<bold>Table S2</bold>) could partially explain why it is the only LTG that contributes to gliding motility.

Deletion and insertion mutants were constructed by electroporating <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells with 4 µg of plasmid DNA. Transformed cells were plated on CYE plates supplemented with 100 µg/ml sodium kanamycin sulfate and 10 µg/ml tetracycline hydrochloride when needed. AgmT and AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> were labeled with PAmCherry at their C-termini by fusing their gene to a DNA sequence that encodes PAmCherry through a KESGSVSSEQLAQFRSLD (AAGGAGTCCGGCTCCGTGTCCTCCGAGCAGCTGGCCCAGTTCCGCTCCCTGGA C) linker. All constructs were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing.</p>

<title>Protein expression and purification</title>
<p>DNA sequences encoding amino acids 25 – 339 of AgmT and AgmT<sup>EAEA</sup> were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted into the pET28a vector (Novogen) between the restriction sites of <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Hind</italic>III and used to transform <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3). Transformed cells were cultured in 20 ml LB (Luria-Bertani) broth at 37 °C overnight and used to inoculate 1 L LB medium supplemented with 1.0% glucose. Protein expression was induced by 0.1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-h-d-thiogalactopyranoside) when the culture reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8. Cultivation was continued at 16 °C for 10 h before the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 20 min. Proteins were purified using a NGC™ Chromatography System (BIO-RAD) and 5-ml HisTrap™ columns (Cytiva)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.

<p>PG was purified following the published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. In brief, <italic>M. xanthus</italic> cells were grown until mid-stationary phase and harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 20 min, 25 °C). Supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended and boiled in 1× PBS with 5% SDS for 2 h. SDS was removed by repetitive wash with water and centrifugation (21,000 × g, 10 min, 25 °C). Purified PG from 100 ml culture was suspended into 1 ml 1× PBS and stored at -20 °C. RBB labelling of PG was performed essentially as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Purified sacculi were incubated with 20 mM RBB in 0.25 M NaOH overnight at 37 °C.

<title>Microscopy Analysis</title>
<p>For all imaging experiments, we spotted 5 μl of cells grown in liquid CYE medium to OD<sub>600</sub> ∼1 on agar (1.5%) pads. For the treatments with inhibitors, inhibitors were added into both the cell suspension and agar pads. The length and width of cells were determined from differential interference contrast (DIC) images using a MATLAB (MathWorks) script<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript nicely outlines a conceptual problem with the bFAC model in A-motility, namely, how the energy derived from the inner membrane AglRQS motor transduced through the cell wall into mechanical force on the cell surface to drive motility? To address this, the authors make a significant contribution by identifying and characterizing a lytic transglycosylase (LTG) called AgmT. This work thus provides clues and a future framework work to address mechanical force transmission from the cytoplasm through the cell envelope to the cell surface.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(i) Convincing evidence shows AgmT functions as a LTG and, surprisingly, that mltG from E. coli complements the swarming defect of an agmT mutant.</p>
<p>(ii) Show 13 other LTGs found in M. xanthus are not required for A-motility.</p>
<p>(iii) Authors show agmT mutants develop morphological changes in response to treatment with a beta-lactam antibiotic, mecillinam.</p>
<p>(iv) The use of single molecule tracking to monitor the assembly and dynamics of bFACs in WT and mutant backgrounds.</p>
<p>(v) The authors understand the limitations of their work and do not overinterpret their data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors provided more experiments and clearly addressed my prior concerns in their revised manuscript.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript nicely outlines a conceptual problem with the bFAC model in A-motility, namely, how is the energy produced by the inner membrane AglRQS motor transduced through the cell wall into mechanical force on the cell surface to drive motility? To address this, the authors make a significant contribution by identifying and characterizing a lytic transglycosylase (LTG) called AgmT. This work thus provides clues and a future framework work for addressing mechanical force transmission between the cytoplasm and the cell surface.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Convincing evidence shows AgmT functions as an LTG and, surprisingly, that mltG from E. coli complements the swarming defect of an agmT mutant.</p>
<p>(2) Authors show agmT mutants develop morphological changes in response to treatment with a b-lactam antibiotic, mecillinam.</p>
<p>(3) The use of single-molecule tracking to monitor the assembly and dynamics of bFACs in WT and mutant backgrounds.</p>
<p>(4) The authors understand the limitations of their work and do not overinterpret their data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A clear model of AgmT's role in gliding motility or interactions with other A-motility proteins is not provided. Instead, speculative roles for how AgmT enzymatic activity could facilitate bFAC function in A-motility are discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for this comment. We have added a new figure, Fig. 6, and updated the Discussion to propose a mechanism, “rather than interacting with bFAC components directly and specifically, AgmT facilitates proper bFAC assembly indirectly through its LTG activity. LTGs usually break glycan strands and produce unique anhydro caps on their ends40-44. However, because AgmT is the only LTGs that is required for gliding, it is not likely to facilitate bFAC assembly by generating such modification on glycan strands. <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG is a glycan terminase that controls the length of newly synthesized PG glycans25. Likewise, AgmT could generate short glycan strands and thus uniquely modify the overall structure of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PG, such as producing small pores that retard and retain the inner subcomplexes of bFACs (Fig. 6). On the contrary, the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> mutants that lack active AgmT could produce PG with increased strain length, which blocks bFACs from binding to the cell wall and precludes stable bFAC assembly. However, it would be very difficult to demonstrate how glycan length affects the connection between bFACs and PG”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Although agmT mutants do not swarm, in-depth phenotypic analysis is lacking. In particular, do individual agmT mutant cells move, as found with other swarming defective mutants, or are agmT mutants completely nonmotile, as are motor mutants?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up an important question. Prompted by this question, we analyzed the gliding phenotype of the <italic>ΔagmT pilA</italic> mutant on the single cell level. We found that the <italic>ΔagmT pilA</italic> cells are not completely static. Instead, they move for less than half cell length before pauses and reversal. We moved on to quantify the velocity and gliding persistency and found that the gliding phenotype of the <italic>ΔagmT pilA</italic> cells matches the prediction on the bFACs that loses the connection between the inner subcomplexes and PG.</p>
<p>We then imaged individual <italic>∆agmT pilA-</italic> cells on 1.5% agar surface at 10-s intervals using bright-field microscopy. To our surprise, instead of being static, individual <italic>∆agmT pilA-</italic> cells displayed slow movements, with frequent pauses and reversals (Video 1). To quantify the effects of AgmT, we measured the velocity and gliding persistency (the distances cells traveled before pauses and reversals) of individual cells. Compared to the <italic>pilA-</italic> cells that moved at 2.30 ± 1.33 μm/min (n = 46) and high persistency (Video 2 and Fig. 2C, D), <italic>∆agmT pilA-</italic> cells moved significantly slower (0.88 ± 0.62 μm/min, n = 59) and less persistent (Video 1 and Figure. 2C, D). Such aberrant gliding motility is distinct from the “hyper reversal” phenotype. Although the hyper reversing cells constitutively switching their moving directions, they usually maintain gliding velocity at the wild-type level27. due to the polarity regulators Instead, the slow and “slippery” gliding of the <italic>∆agmT pilA-</italic> cells matches the prediction that when the inner complexes of bFACs lose connection with PG, bFACs can only generate short, and inefficient movements19. Our data indicate that AgmT is not essential component in the bFACs. Thus, AgmT is likely to regulate the assembly and stability of bFACs, especially their connection with PG.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The bioinformatic and comparative genomics analysis of agmT is incomplete. For example, the sequence relationships between AgmT, MltG, and the 13 other LTG proteins in M. xanthus are not clear. Is E. coli MltG the closest homology to AgmT? Their relationships could be addressed with a phylogenetic tree and/or sequence alignments. Furthermore, are there other A-motility genes in proximity to agmT? Similarly, does agmT show specific co-occurrences with the other A-motility genes across genera/species?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We answered the first question in the Discussion (it was in the first Results section in the previous version), “Both <italic>M. xanthus</italic> AgmT and <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG belong to the YceG/MltG family, which is the first identified LTG family that is conserved in both Gram-negative and positive bacteria25,41. About 70% of bacterial genomes, including firmicutes, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria, encode YceG/MltG domains25. The unique inner membrane localization of this family and the fact that AgmT is the only <italic>M. xanthus</italic> LTG that belongs to this family (Table S2) could partially explain why it is the only LTG that contributes to gliding motility”.</p>
<p>For the second, we added one sentence in the Results, “No other motility-related genes are found in the vicinity of <italic>agmT</italic>”.</p>
<p>For the third question, we do not believe a co-occurrence analysis is necessary. Because <italic>M. xanthus</italic> gliding is very unique but “about 70% of bacterial genomes, including firmicutes, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria, encode YceG/MltG domains25”, gliding should show no co-occurrence with the YceG/MltG family LTGs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Related to iii, what about the functional relationship of the endogenous 13 LTG genes? Although knockout mutants were shown to be motile, presumably because AgmT is present, can overexpression of them, similar to E. coli MltG, complement an agmT mutant? In other words, why does MltG complement and the endogenous LTG proteins appear not to be relevant?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for this question, which prompted us to think the uniqueness of AgmT more carefully. AgmT is unique for its inner-membrane localization, rather than activity. We answered this question in the discussion, “LTGs usually break glycan strands and produce unique anhydro caps on their ends40-44. However, because AgmT is the only LTGs that is required for gliding, it is not likely to facilitate bFAC assembly by generating such modification on glycan strands”. We then moved on to propose a possible mechanism, “<italic>E. coli</italic> MltG is a glycan terminase that controls the length of newly synthesized PG glycans25. Likewise, AgmT could generate short glycan strands and thus uniquely modify the overall structure of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PG, such as producing small pores that retard and retain the inner subcomplexes of bFACs (Fig. 6). On the contrary, the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> mutants that lack active AgmT could produce PG with increased strain length, which blocks bFACs from binding to the cell wall and precludes stable bFAC assembly. However, it would be very difficult to demonstrate how glycan length affects the connection between bFACs and PG”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Based on Figure 2B, overexpression of MltG enhances A-motility compared to the parent strain and the agmT-PAmCh complemented strain, is this actually true? Showing expanded swarming colony phenotypes would help address this question.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up an important question. Prompted by this question, we analyzed the effects of MltG expression at the single-cell level. We found that “Consistent with its LTG activity, the expression of MltGEc restored gliding motility of the <italic>ΔagmT</italic> <italic>pilA-</italic> cells on both the colony (Fig. 2B) and single-cell (Fig. 2C, D) levels. Interestingly, in the absence of sodium vanillate, the leakage expression of MltGEc using the vanillate-inducible promoter was sufficient to compensate the loss of AgmT. A plausible explanation of this observation is that as <italic>E. coli</italic> grows much faster (generation time 20 - 30 min) than <italic>M. xanthus</italic> (generation time ~4 h), MltGEc could possess significantly higher LTG activity than AgmT. Induced by 200 μM sodium vanillate, the expression of MltGEc further but non significantly increased the velocity and gliding persistency (Fig. 2B-D). Importantly, the expression of MltGEc failed to restore gliding motility in the <italic>agmTEAEA pilA</italic> cells, even in the presence of 200 μM sodium vanillate (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the mecillinam resistance assay (Fig. 3C), this result suggests that AgmTEAEA still binds to PG and that in the absence of its LTG activity, AgmT does not anchor bFACs to PG”. These results are shown in the new panels C and D in Figure 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Cell flexibility is correlated with gliding motility function in M. xanthus. Since AgmT has LTG activity, are agmT mutants less flexible than WT cells and is this the cause of their motility defect?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up an important question. We saw cells that lack AgmT making S-turns and U-turns frequently under microscope. We used a GRABS assay to quantify cell stiffness and found that neither the absence of AgmT nor the expression of MltGEc affect cell stiffness. We added this result in the manuscript, “The assembly of bFACs produces wave-like deformation on cell surface6,37, suggesting that their assembly may require a flexible PG layer2,6,11,12. As a major contributor to cell stiffness, PG flexibility affects the overall stiffness of cells38. To test the possibility that AgmT and MltGEc facilitate bFAC assembly by reducing PG stiffness, we adopted the GRABS assay38 to quantify if the lack of AgmT and the expression of MltGEc affects cell stiffness. To quantify changes in cell stiffness, we simultaneously measured the growth of the <italic>pilA-</italic>, <italic>ΔagmT pilA-</italic>, and <italic>ΔagmT Pvan-MltGEc pilA-</italic> (with 200 μM sodium vanillate) cells in a 1% agarose gel infused with CYE and liquid CYE and calculated the GRABS scores of the <italic>ΔagmT pilA-</italic>, and <italic>ΔagmT Pvan-MltGEc pilA-</italic> cells using the <italic>pilA-</italic> cells as the reference, where positive and negative GRABS scores indicate increased and decreased stiffness, respectively (see Materials and Methods and Ref38). The GRABS scores of the <italic>ΔagmT pilA-</italic>, and <italic>ΔagmT Pvan-MltGEc pilA-</italic> (with 200 μM sodium vanillate) cells were -0.06 ± 0.04 and -0.10 ± 0.07 (n = 4), respectively, indicating that neither AgmT nor MltGEc affects cell stiffness significantly. Whereas PG flexibility could still be essential for gliding, AgmT and MltGEc do not regulate bFAC assembly by modulating PG stiffness. Instead, these LTGs could connect bFACs to PG by generating structural features that are irrelevant to PG stiffness”.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Carbo et al. reports a novel role for the MltG homolog AgmT in gliding motility in M. xanthus. The authors conclusively show that AgmT is a cell wall lytic enzyme (likely a lytic transglycosylase), its lytic activity is required for gliding motility, and that its activity is required for proper binding of a component of the motility apparatus to the cell wall. The data are generally well-controlled. The marked strength of the manuscript includes the detailed characterization of AgmT as a cell wall lytic enzyme, and the careful dissection of its role in motility. Using multiple lines of evidence, the authors conclusively show that AgmT does not directly associate with the motility complexes, but that instead its absence (or the overexpression of its active site mutant) results in the failure of focal adhesion complexes to properly interact with the cell wall.</p>
<p>An interpretive weakness is the rather direct role attributed to AgmT in focal adhesion assembly. While their data clearly show that AgmT is important, it is unclear whether this is the direct consequence of AgmT somehow promoting bFAC binding to PG or just an indirect consequence of changed cell wall architecture without AgmT. In E. coli, an MltG mutant has increased PG strain length, suggesting that M. xanthus's PG architecture may likewise be compromised in a way that precludes AglR binding to the cell wall. However, this distinction would be very difficult to establish experimentally. MltG has been shown to associate with active cell wall synthesis in E. coli in the absence of protein-protein interactions, and one could envision a similar model in M. xanthus, where active cell wall synthesis is required for focal adhesion assembly, and MltG makes an important contribution to this process.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on the data that AgmT does not assemble into bFACs and that heterologous MltGEc substitutes <italic>M. xanthus</italic> AgmT in gliding, we believe that AgmT facilitates the proper assembly of bFACs indirectly. At the end of Introduction, we pointed out, “Hence, the LTG activity of AgmT anchors bFAC to PG, potentially by modifying PG structure”. Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we revised the Discussion to emphasize that AgmT facilitates proper bFAC assembly indirectly through its LTG activity. For the reviewer’s convenience, the revised paragraph is pasted here, with the changes highlighted in blue:</p>
<p>“It is surprising that AgmT itself does not assemble into bFACs and that MltGEc substitutes AgmT in gliding. Thus, rather than interacting with bFAC components directly and specifically, AgmT facilitates proper bFAC assembly indirectly through its LTG activity. LTGs usually break glycan strands and produce unique anhydro caps on their ends40-44. However, because AgmT is the only LTGs that is required for gliding, it is not likely to facilitate bFAC assembly by generating such modification on glycan strands. <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG is a glycan terminase that controls the length of newly synthesized PG glycans25. Likewise, AgmT could generate short glycan strands and thus uniquely modify the overall structure of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PG, such as producing small pores that retard and retain the inner subcomplexes of bFACs (Fig. 6). On the contrary, the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> mutants that lack active AgmT could produce PG with increased strain length, which blocks bFACs from binding to the cell wall and precludes stable bFAC assembly. However, it would be very difficult to demonstrate how glycan length affects the connection between bFACs and PG”.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The last sentence of the Discussion implies that anchoring LTG (AgmT) in the inner membrane is important. I did not see this mentioned about AgmT. Does it contain an inner membrane anchoring domain? Along these lines, the AgmT and MltG proteins appear to be of different sizes (Figure 1A). Please clarify, perhaps including full-length sequence alignment and/or domain architecture for these proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We revised the first paragraph in the Results and clarified, “Among these genes, agmT (ORF K1515_0491023) was predicted to encode an inner membrane protein with a single N-terminal transmembrane helix (residues 4 – 25) and a large “periplasmic solute-binding” domain22.”</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for spotting the mistake in Fig. 2A. The <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG sequence shown in the alignment starts from residue 158, instead of 88. We have corrected this mistake in the figure. <italic>M. xanthus</italic> AgmT and <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG are of similar sizes, with 239 and 240 amino acids, respectively.</p>

<p>Protein electrophoresis was done using SDS-PAGE. It is not unusual that some proteins, especially membrane proteins, are resistant to dissociation by SDS and appear as multimers in SDS-PAGE. The authors have seen this phenomenon repeatedly in both our experiments and the literature. Nevertheless, we clarified our experimental condition in the text, “Similar to many membrane proteins that resistant to dissociation by SDS34, immunoblot using an anti-mCherry antibody showed that AgmTPAmCherry accumulated in two bands in SDS-PAGE that corresponded to monomers and dimers of the full-length fusion protein, respectively (Fig. 5A)”.</p>

This effect was very obvious in Fig. 5B, possibly due to the unevenness of the agar surface. We examined our data carefully and did not find significant polar enrichment. Compared to AglZ that significantly enriches at poles and forms evenly-spaced clusters along the cell body, the localization of AgmT is completely different.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>- Major comment: I would rephrase conclusions regarding a direct role of AgmT in focal adhesion assembly since these data are indirect (AglR binding to the cell wall is reduced in the absence of AgmT - this could also be interpreted as the absence of AgmT causing altered cell wall architecture that precludes AglR binding). Example: I don't think the data support line 222 &quot;AgmT connects bFACs to PG&quot;, perhaps rephrased to accommodate more agnostic explanations. Likewise, line 308 states that MltG has been &quot;adopted&quot; by the gliding motility machinery. This conclusion cannot be drawn from the data presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the conclusions should be stated precisely. At the end of Introduction, we pointed out, “Hence, the LTG activity of AgmT anchors bFAC to PG, potentially by modifying PG structure”. Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we revised the Discussion to emphasize that AgmT facilitates bFAC assembly indirectly through its LTG activity. For the reviewer’s convenience, the revised paragraph is pasted here, with the changes highlighted in blue:</p>
<p>“It is surprising that AgmT itself does not assemble into bFACs and that MltGEc substitutes AgmT in gliding. Thus, rather than interacting with bFAC components directly and specifically, AgmT facilitates proper bFAC assembly indirectly through its LTG activity. LTGs usually break glycan strands and produce unique anhydro caps on their ends40-44. However, because AgmT is the only LTGs that is required for gliding, it is not likely to facilitate bFAC assembly by generating such modification on glycan strands. <italic>E. coli</italic> MltG is a glycan terminase that controls the length of newly synthesized PG glycans25. Likewise, AgmT could generate short glycan strands and thus uniquely modify the overall structure of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PG, such as producing small pores that retard and retain the inner subcomplexes of bFACs (Fig. 6). On the contrary, the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> mutants that lack active AgmT could produce PG with increased strain length, which blocks bFACs from binding to the cell wall and precludes stable bFAC assembly. However, it would be very difficult to demonstrate how glycan length affects the connection between bFACs and PG”.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the conclusion that “AgmT connects bFACs to PG&quot; still stands true. Although AgmT is not likely to interact with the gliding machinery directly, its activity does increase the binding between bFACs and PG.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that “adopt” may not be the best word to describe AgmT’s function in gliding. In the revised manuscript, we changed the phrase to “contributes to gliding motility”.</p>

<p>- Figure 2: Mention in the caption why the pilA mutation is significant. Also, make more clear what one is supposed to see. You could include an arrow showing motile cells extruding from the colony edge, and mark + label the edge of the colony.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer’s recommendations, we described the motility phenotypes in detail in the main text, “On a 1.5% agar surface, the <italic>pilA-</italic> cells moved away from colony edges both as individuals and in “flare-like” cell groups, indicating that they were still motile with gliding motility. In contrast, the <italic>∆aglR pilA-</italic> cells that lack an essential component in the gliding motor, were unable to move outward from the colony edge and thus formed sharp colony edges. Similarly, the <italic>∆agmT pilA-</italic> cells also formed sharp colony edges, indicating that they could not move efficiently with gliding (Fig. 2B)”.</p>
<p>We also added a schematic block into panel B and two sentences into the legend, “To eliminate S-motility, we further knocked out the <italic>pilA</italic> gene that encodes pilin for type IV pilus. Cells that move by gliding are able to move away from colony edges.”</p>

<p>Protein electrophoresis was done using SDS-PAGE. It is not unusual that some proteins, especially membrane proteins, are resistant to dissociation by SDS and appear as multimers in SDS-PAGE. The authors have seen this phenomenon repeatedly in both our experiments and the literature. Nevertheless, we clarified our experimental condition in the text, “Similar to many membrane proteins that resistant to dissociation by SDS34, immunoblot using an anti-mCherry antibody showed that AgmTPAmCherry accumulated in two bands in SDS-PAGE that corresponded to monomers and dimers of the full-length fusion protein, respectively (Fig. 5A)”.</p>
