<title>Abstract</title>
<p>During root nodule symbiosis (RNS), cell-division activity is re-initiated and sustained in the root cortex to create a hospitable cellular niche. Such temporary and spatially confined site is required to render host cells compatible with the intracellular progression of rhizobia. Although it has been suggested that early infection events might involve a pre-mitotic cell-cycle arrest, this process has not been dissected with cellular resolution. Here, we show that a dual-colour Medicago histone reporter robustly identifies cells with different mitotic or endoreduplication activities in the root cortex. By imaging deep root tissues, we found that a confined trajectory of cortical cells that are transcellularly passed by infection threads are in a stage of the cell-cycle that is distinct from directly adjacent cells. Distinctive features of infected cells include nuclear widening and large-scale chromatin rearrangements consistent with a cell-cycle exit prior to differentiation. Using a combination of fluorescent reporters demarcating cell-cycle phase progression, we confirmed that a reduced proliferation potential and modulating the G2/M transition, a process possibly controlled by the NF-YA1 transcription factor, mark the success of rhizobial delivery to nodule cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell-cycle regulation is a key pathway to maintain beneficial and sustainable symbiotic associations that are of primary importance in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. One common theme to stabilize facultative associations is to achieve a mutual control of cell proliferation and differentiation dynamics in both the host and the symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kondorosi &amp; Kondorosi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Russo &amp; Genre, 2021</xref>). Prime examples are flowering plants from a single phylogenetic clade, comprising four orders (Fabales, Fagales, Cucurbitales, Rosales) with legumes being the most prominent ones, that evolved the unique ability to accommodate soil-borne rhizobia intracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Parniske, 2018</xref>). Within this symbiosis, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen and deliver ammonium to the host in exchange for plant photosynthates. The conversion of atmospheric dinitrogen into a usable form is highly energy-demanding and requires a low-oxygen environment, which is provided within nodules, specialized lateral organs formed on the roots that are densely populated by rhizobia. A widely adopted mechanism to access the developing nodule cells is the formation of cortical infection threads, transcellular conduits formed upon the invagination of the host plasma membrane and hijacking the cellular machinery of infected root cortical cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Su et al., 2023</xref>). Although our molecular and cellular understanding of the infection mechanisms is expanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Tsyganova et al., 2021</xref>), our knowledge on how these processes are interconnected with the control of cell-cycle progression in cells hosting intracellular infection threads has remained fragmentary.</p>
<p>Plants engaging into arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or root nodule symbioses (RNS) have recruited a common range of cell-cycle processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Foucher &amp; Kondorosi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Russo &amp; Genre, 2021</xref>). In <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (hereafter, Medicago), the perception of and colonization by the AM fungus result in occasional cell divisions in the inner cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Russo et al., 2019</xref>) and in diffuse endoreduplication events as intraradical hyphae spread throughout the root cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carotenuto et al., 2019b</xref>). During RNS, the perception of rhizobia results in the onset of a signalling cascade that triggers an outward gradient of cell-cycle reactivation and cell divisions. Although this is initiated in the pericycle, cell-cycle reactivation occurs throughout the inner cortical (C) layers C5, C4 and the middle C3 layer in Medicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). The successful establishment of RNS further involves the tight coordination of the infection and organogenesis programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Guan et al., 2013</xref>). It requires the progression of cortical infection threads through the C3 layer prior to subsequent periclinal divisions that produce a persistent nodule meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). The resulting indeterminate nodules will later form well-defined developmental zones, with actively dividing meristematic cells giving rise to post-meristematic, differentiating central tissues of increasing ploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Vinardell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Nagymihály et al., 2017</xref>). While those cells can be intracellularly colonized, the infection competence of nodule-like structures as being induced by exogenous application of cytokinin (Gauthier-Coles et al., 2019), constitutive activation of common symbiotic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gleason et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Singh et al., 2014</xref>) or the expression of meristematic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dong et al., 2021</xref>) may be massively reduced in many of these spontaneous nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The lack of infectibility cannot be overcome even when applying bacterial strains which enter plant cells from the intercellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Liang et al., 2019</xref>). This clearly demonstrates the ultimate requirement of cells being in a so far uncharacterized state of infection competence.</p>
<p>Transcriptome profiling of Medicago root hairs, treated with rhizobial Nod factors or undergoing rhizobial colonization, uncovered changes in several cell-cycle related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>). This perception of Nod factors results in the increased transcription of D-type cyclins, genes known to respond to extrinsic signals and to promote cell-cycle progression from the first GAP (G1) phase to the DNA-synthesis (S) phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dewitte et al., 2003</xref>). Subsequently, the initiation of infection threads coincides with the highest expression of genes required for DNA replication, modification and repair, strongly suggesting that the epidermal infection programme involves cell cycle re-entry and progression to a post-replicative phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>). A repression of the endocycle was further proposed to occur since infected root hairs accumulate transcripts of the <italic>OSD1/UVI4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>), whose activity prevents an unscheduled increase in ploidy by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Iwata et al., 2011</xref>). However, much less is known about the transcriptional signature of infected cells along the cortical trajectory of transcellularly progressing infection threads. Such ability to guide rhizobia <italic>via</italic> cortical infection threads is yet thought to be an important innovation since it has been evolutionary maintained in the vast majority of nodulating species as it, most likely, maximizes the host control over bacterial delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Parniske, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cathebras et al., 2022</xref> – pre-print).</p>
<p>A central regulator for controlling infection and organogenesis is the transcription factor <italic>Nodule Inception</italic> (<italic>NIN</italic>). Co-opted from nitrate response circuits, NIN acts as a master coordinator of infection, nodule organogenesis and nodule number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Marsh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fournier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Soyano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cathebras et al., 2022</xref> – pre-print). It promotes the expression of several growth targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>) including <italic>NF-YA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Soyano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Feng et al., 2021</xref>), a subunit of the conserved heterotrimeric Nuclear Factor-Y (NF-Y) transcription factor. A-, B- and C-type subunits of the NF-Y complex act as specialized modules, interacting with other transcription factors and recruiting chromatin remodelling enzymes to adjust cell specification to environmental or developmental needs (Zanetti et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Myers &amp; Holt, 2018</xref>). In vertebrates, the CCAAT-binding NF-Y transcription factor targets genes involved in all major activities executed in G2 and mitosis (M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Linhart et al., 2005</xref>) and is an important regulator of the G2/M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Manni et al., 2001</xref>). In legumes, the rhizobium-induced NF-YA1 subunit functions in cortical infection thread progression, in the establishment and maintenance of the nodule meristem and in the early differentiation of nodule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Combier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hossain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schiessl et al., 2023</xref> – pre-print). Yet, whether the Medicago NF-YA1 protein regulates the G2/M transition is not known.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that intracellular infection at least partially relies on cell-cycle control is further supported by structural re-arrangements in cortical cells anticipating transcellular IT progression. These include the formation of pre-infection threads (PITs), which are transvacuolar, cytoplasmic bridges comparable to those occurring in pre-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">van Brussel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> detection of marker transcripts revealed that outer cortical cells recruit histone H4 used during DNA replication but do not express a B-type, mitotic cyclin gene – implying that activated target cells stop in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yang et al., 1994</xref>). G2-phase cell-cycle arrests have been repeatedly described in eukaryotic cells as appropriate gates for executing cell fate and patterning decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Meserve &amp; Duronio, 2017</xref>), for wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cosolo et al., 2019</xref>) or for host infection during pathogenic and biotrophic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wildermuth et al., 2017</xref>). In plants, transiently or sustainably reducing the potential to enter mitosis is an appropriate response when cells must, for instance, cope with genotoxic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Takahashi et al., 2019</xref>) or switch to another cell-cycle program, such as the meiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hernandez-Lagana et al., 2021</xref>) or the endoreduplication cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">De Veylder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wildermuth et al., 2017</xref>). Modulating the G2/M transition combines well-described transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms, leading to the repression of genes necessary to execute cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berckmans &amp; De Veylder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>), controlling the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and the stability of transcriptional repressors and mitotic inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kondorosi &amp; Kondorosi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Although previous reports have suggested such cell-cycle patterns to occur in roots during rhizobial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>), this has never been spatially resolved at cellular level.</p>
<p>Here, we employed a combination of cell-cycle reporters to resolve functional steps of cell-cycle progression on the cortical infection thread trajectory with cellular and subcellular resolution. We demonstrate that the first generation of Medicago cells successfully internalizing rhizobia shows unique features, including a marked decrease in their histone H3.1 content and a reduced competence for both cell division and chromosome segregation. We also show that tetraploid (4n) cells reaching an 8C DNA content are optimal for infection by rhizobia. Our results strongly suggest that, upon transcellular infection thread passage, cortical cells undergo a last GAP phase after DNA replication and exit to differentiation. Furthermore, we present first evidence that the symbiotically-induced NF-YA1 subunit, by controlling mitotic entry in a heterologous system, holds potential to contribute to this process.</p>

<title>A reduced proliferative potential typifies cells supporting cortical infection thread progression</title>
<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (hereafter, Arabidopsis), the incorporation and eviction dynamics of histone H3 variants have been used to identify cells with different cell division and reprogramming potentials, during organ patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Otero et al., 2016</xref>) or when acquiring reproductive competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hernandez-Lagana &amp; Autran, 2020</xref>). To test whether gaining a stage of intracellular infection competence involves a similar modification of the cell-division potential and associated chromatin reorganization, we searched for Medicago genes coding for the replicative histone variant H3.1 and the replacement variant H3.3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>–figure supplement 1A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Probst et al., 2020</xref>). The encoded Medicago H3.1 protein is identical to the one present in <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> and <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> and, as in other flowering plants, differs from H3.3 by only four residues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>–figure supplement 1B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). To check that these Medicago <italic>H3</italic> genes encode for <italic>bona fide</italic> H3.1 and H3.3 counterparts, native promoter-genomic fusions with fluorescent tags were expressed in <italic>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</italic>– induced transgenic roots, formed on composite plants that were inoculated with the compatible symbiont <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> (each composite plant representing an independent transformant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boisson-Dernier et al., 2001</xref>). We adopted a fixation, clearing and cell-wall counter-staining procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Ursache et al., 2018</xref>) that enabled us to perform detailed imaging deep inside the multi-layered root cortical tissues. Medicago H3 fusion proteins fully recapitulated the patterns observed in Arabidopsis roots (<italic>i.e.,</italic> patchy pattern of H3.1 and constitutive presence of H3.3; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>–figure supplement 1C–E) and showed the expected localization in euchromatin (diffuse labelling) and heterochromatic regions (subnuclear foci; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>–figure supplement 1C–E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ingouff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Shi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Otero et al., 2016</xref>). A low H3.1 content, typical for cells with a reduced proliferative potential, also enabled us to identify putative quiescent centre (QC) cells within the open root apical meristem of Medicago (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>–figure supplement 1E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rost, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Otero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). Preferentially incorporated during DNA replication, the canonical histone H3.1 variant controls the maintenance of genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Davarinejad et al., 2022</xref>) and epigenetic inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jiang &amp; Berger, 2017</xref>) and is consequently maintained at high levels in cells engaged in recurrent cell division or endoreduplication cycles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Once cells exit the cell cycle, H3.1 is evicted and likely replaced by H3.3 to mediate cellular differentiation in various Arabidopsis cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Otero et al., 2016</xref>). In Medicago, increased levels of <italic>H3.1</italic> transcripts were coherently detected at an early stage of nodule primordia development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>– figure supplement 1F; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Schiessl et al., 2019</xref>) and mRNAs accumulated only in meristematic (ZI) and infection zones of mature nodules (ZIId and ZIIp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Roux et al., 2014</xref>), while <italic>H3.3</italic> transcription stayed high in the differentiation zone (ZIII; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>– figure supplement 1G). We verified a corresponding differential accumulation of H3.1 and H3.3 tagged proteins at cellular resolution in nodule sections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The double histone reporter proved also useful to distinguish actively endoreduplicating cells prior to fungal colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carotenuto et al., 2019b</xref>) from fully differentiated, arbuscule-containing cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Since the selected Medicago histone variants recapitulated the expected transcriptional and localization patterns in well-defined developmental zones, we considered them as functional reporters of H3.1 and H3.3. In addition, the H3.1/H3.3 balance enables to track cortical cells re-entering the cell cycle and adapting their responses to both bacterial and fungal symbionts.</p>

<p>We then focused on the H3.1 nuclear content at early interaction stages between rhizobia and the host plant (8 days post inoculation [dpi]; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A–B</xref>). In accordance with RNA sequencing data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>– figure supplement 1F; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Schiessl et al., 2019</xref>), we observed the replicative H3.1 variant accumulating in regularly dividing cortical cells forming the nodule primordium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel). The H3.1-eGFP fusion protein was also visible in cells penetrated but not fully passed by an infection thread (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, close up). This is consistent with earlier observations that cells preparing for intracellular infection pass through S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yang et al., 1994</xref>). By contrast, host cells sustaining cortical infection thread progression in the middle and inner cortex (C3 and C4) up to the first recipient cells in the nodule primordium (C4/5-derived; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) exhibited enlarged nuclei (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) with a significantly decreased histone H3.1 content compared to their direct neighbouring cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Such pattern was also observed using another <italic>H3.1</italic> gene expressed in root tissues (<italic>H3.1 (2)</italic>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>–figure supplement 1A–E). Nuclear enlargement associated with a massive eviction of H3.1 typically identifies cells having completed a DNA replication round, but pausing in the following GAP phase for cell-cycle switches or exit decisions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Otero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hernandez-Lagana &amp; Autran, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Probst et al., 2020</xref>). Together, our data strongly suggest that cortical cells along the infection thread trajectory, different to their direct neighbours, exhibit a reduced proliferation potential and presumably exit the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 B–E</xref>). The observed nuclear enlargement and large-scale chromatin rearrangements are consistent with an increased transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Knaack et al., 2022</xref>) concomitant with sustained infection thread progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>).

<title>Exiting the cell cycle on the cortical infection thread trajectory aligns infection and organogenesis</title>
<p>Next, we tested whether a cell-cycle exit decision and associated remodelling of the histone H3 composition requires the tight coupling of infection and nodule organogenesis as observed under wild-type (WT) conditions. Thus, we compared the H3.1/H3.3 patterns in WT roots to those of two mutants in which nodule organogenesis is either abolished (<italic>daphne-like</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>) or where nodules form but cortical infection threads are impaired in their progression (<italic>nf-ya1-1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>). In the WT situation, the majority of cortical cells (90%) enabling transcellular passage until reaching the nodule primordium showed a reduced proliferation potential (low H3.1 content, n = 41; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>–figure supplement 1A). A higher H3.1 content was occasionally observed in the last infected cell in the absence of nodule primordium organogenesis (NOD <sup>(-)</sup>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>–figure supplement 1B). Absence of inner cortical cell division is also a characteristic feature of the <italic>daphne-like</italic> Medicago mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>–figure supplement 1C), which lacks a remote cis-regulatory region in the <italic>NIN</italic> promoter perceiving cytokinin signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>). This non-nodulating mutant still produces WT-like root hair infections occasionally reaching outer cortical layers.

Although the last infected cortical cells showed a significant nuclear enlargement in all three genetic backgrounds investigated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), failure to coordinate organogenesis and infection programs in the mutants resulted in an increased occurrence of infected cells accumulating more H3.1 than their direct neighbours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).

<title>Cortical cells supporting transcellular infection control their commitment to cell division</title>
<p>In Medicago and other plants producing indeterminate nodules, a local control of mitotic activity could be especially important for rhizobia to timely cross the middle cortex, where sustained cellular proliferation gives rise to the nodule meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate in greater detail whether cells competent for transcellular infection are selectively kept away from transiting to mitosis, we first used a triple fluorescent sensor enabling to track all cell-cycle phases <italic>in planta</italic>. Originally developed for Arabidopsis, the plant cell-cycle indicator (PlaCCI) combines a component of the pre-replication complex (CDT1a), the replicative histone variant (H3.1) and the N-terminal domain of a B-type cyclin (N-CYCB1;1) as G1-, S- and late G2-phase reporters, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Desvoyes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Echevarria et al., 2021</xref>). The N-terminal domain of CYCB1;1 contains a destruction box (D-box) ensuring a rapid turnover of the protein after one mitotic cell cycle. These cell-cycle markers are expressed at early stages of organ development but disappear in terminally differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Desvoyes et al., 2020</xref>). When expressing the PlaCCI construct in transgenic Medicago roots, all three markers were successfully visualized in reactivated cortical cells upon nodule primordium formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Cortical cells passed by an infection thread kept low but detectable amounts of the Arabidopsis H3.1 variant, indicating that they transited through S-phase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). However, these cells stopped before accumulating substantial levels of N-CYCB1;1, in contrast to their direct neighbours. We also confirmed latter observations when using an Arabidopsis CYCB1;2-based fluorescent reporter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), labelling only cells that transit through G2/M (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>–figure supplement 1A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Weimer et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these results verified a selective decrease in mitotic competence occurring on the cortical infection thread trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yang et al., 1994</xref>) as rhizobia pass the middle cortical layer (C3) in Medicago roots. Importantly, we did not observe the G1-phase marker accumulating in cells undergoing infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), favouring the hypothesis of a cell-cycle arrest and exit decision (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) rather than a rapid switch to another endoreduplication round (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Desvoyes et al., 2019</xref> – pre-print).</p>

<p>We next tested whether transcriptional reporters of a target gene necessary to execute cell division get selectively repressed on the path of a cortical infection. The late G2/M gene <italic>KNOLLE</italic> codes for a syntaxin protein specialized in angiosperm cytokinesis and is oppositely controlled when cells do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Haga et al., 2007</xref>) or shall not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Takahashi et al., 2019</xref>) commit to mitosis. The transcription of <italic>KNOLLE</italic> and other late cell-cycle genes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>CYCB1;2</italic>) in Arabidopsis is primarily regulated by mitosis-specific activator (MSA) cis-elements present in their promoters that are targeted by activator- and repressor-type three Myb repeats (MYB3R) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Haga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>). Mutations in all three MSA core sequences present in the Medicago <italic>KNOLLE</italic> promoter significantly reduced the expression of a β-glucuronidase (<italic>GUS</italic>) reporter gene in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaf cells in the presence of a hyperactive form of a MYB3R transcriptional activator (NtmybA2Δ630; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>–figure supplement 1B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Araki et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that the Medicago <italic>KNOLLE</italic> gene can be used as a <italic>bona fide</italic> late G2/M readout. Using the pKNOLLE::NLS-3xVenus construct, we found that the activation of the <italic>KNOLLE</italic> promoter was lower on the cortical infection thread trajectory in comparison to neighbouring, proliferating cells from nodule primordia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). An equivalent construct, ensuring the timely elimination of fluorescent reporters after one canonical cell cycle (pKNOLLE::D-box-3xVenus-NLS; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>–figure supplement 1C), corroborated a selective control of the G2/M transition in cells undergoing transcellular infection. Combining our observations of enlarged nuclei (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), the absence of a G1 marker and the reduced H3.1 levels and expression of mitotic genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B–E</xref>), we conclude that the initial cortical cells along the infection thread trajectory conduct a single cell-cycle round and stay in a post-replicative (<italic>i.e.</italic>, G2) phase as long as they are crossed.</p>
<p>We further took advantage of the fact that the PlaCCI sensor provides a full view on cell-cycle phase progression in root tissues, in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Desvoyes et al., 2020</xref>) and Medicago (this study). CDT1a- and CYCB1;1-associated signals in the root tip enabled us to identify 2C (<italic>i.e.</italic>, G1) and 4C (<italic>i.e.</italic>, G2) nuclei, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 2A) – where 2C and 4C chromatin-values correspond to the DNA content of a basic diploid genome. Measuring the area of nuclei exhibiting the CYCB1;1-YFP signal in cortical layers of the root apical meristem (root tip) or the nodule primordium revealed that they were on average 1.57 or 1.63 times larger than the ones producing CDT1a-CFP, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 2B). This is in agreement with an increased DNA content as cells transit from the G1- to the late G2-phase. Surprisingly, proliferating nodule cells contained significantly wider nuclei than their diploid counterparts in the proliferation zone of the root apical meristem (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 2B), suggesting a higher ploidy level early on. These results lead to the intriguing possibility that reactivated inner cortical cells in Medicago enter the mitotic cell cycle with an increased amount of genetic material.</p>

Aligning the Medicago CENH3 amino acid sequence (G8A083) with characterized CENH3 sequences from <italic>L. japonicus</italic>, Arabidopsis, <italic>H. vulgare</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> revealed the presence of canonical CENH3 features (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>–figure supplement 1), including a variable N-terminal tail and the centromere targeting domain (CATD). When expressing a mCitrine-CENH3 fusion protein under the control of its own promoter (pCENH3::mCitrine-CENH3), CENH3 labelled up to 16 nuclear foci and localized exclusively at the presumed centromeres during mitosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>) in diploid root tip cells. As the signal was rather weak, we scored centromeric foci in roots ectopically expressing the protein (pUbi::mCitrine-CENH3; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Here, a reliable signal was observed in an increased proportion of nuclei (82%) displaying not more than 14 to 16 mCitrine-CENH3 foci (versus only 55% when <italic>CENH3</italic> was expressed under its endogenous promoter; n = 55; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) – reflecting the base ploidy in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> with 2n = 16.

<p>In a first set of experiments, we used CENH3 to discriminate between polyploid cells undergoing endomitosis or endocycling. In endomitosis, entire chromosome replication and partial mitotic progression result in a doubling of the chromosome / centromeric foci number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Iwata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">De Storme et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, endocycling cells undergo repeated rounds of DNA synthesis without segregating the newly replicated parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Edgar et al., 2014</xref>). Here, copied chromosome arms do not condense and spatial separation of sister kinetochores does not occur, so that the number of compact CENH3 signals corresponds to the initial number of chromosomes (up to 8C; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>–figure supplement 2A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>). As the occurrence of endocycling cells has been previously reported in tissues infected by AM fungi, we first tested the CENH3-reporter in roots inoculated with <italic>Rhizophagus irregularis</italic>. Indeed, cortical cells entered by the fungus displayed large nuclei with no more than 16 labelled foci (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>–figure supplement 2B), supporting their endocycling nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>). Up to 16 CENH3 foci were also observed in diploid cortical cells from the root tip and pericycle cells from lateral root primordia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>–figure supplement 2C). However, the majority of nodule cells exhibited between 26 and 32 fluorescent centromeric foci (75,5% in nodule primordia from stage IV to VI, n = 106; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>– figure supplement 2B–C) and a visibly increased number of chromosomes on mitotic figures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>–figure supplement 2B). These observations strongly support previously published data proposing that proliferating cortical cells giving rise to Medicago root nodules are tetraploid (4n = 32; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Torrey &amp; Barrios, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>We next tested whether endopolyploid cells are already present at an earlier stage of nodule development, where cell division events are confined to the pericycle, the inner cortical cells (C4, C5) and occasionally occur in the third (C3) and second (C2) cortical layers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, cells originating only from cortical cell divisions (C2 to C5) showed an increased number of chromosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-E</xref>) compared to recently divided cells originating from the pericycle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Notably, cells performing anticlinal divisions in the middle cortex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, left panel) that will later be crossed by the infection thread (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, violet triangle) were also polyploid. From these observations, we concluded that a key feature of cortical cells in Medicago nodules is their ability to segregate a higher number of chromosome copies - corresponding to 8C in a tetraploid cell entering mitosis.</p>

<title>Infected cells within the nodule primordium selectively halt their preparations for mitosis</title>
<p>In a next set of experiments, we studied to which extent the cells positioned on the infection thread trajectory (C3 to C4/5) prepare for mitosis. For this, we made use of the pre-mitotic loading characteristics of CENH3 to the centromeres, which mainly occurs during the G2 phase and prior to the spatial separation of sister kinetochores (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2011</xref>). In proliferating populations of the root tip (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>–figure supplement 1A-B) and nodule primordia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref>), late G2 cells contained large nuclei where the majority of sister kinetochores was split and appeared as twin foci. We further noticed that centromere separation in Medicago is a gradual rather than a simultaneous process, as root tip cells with comparable nuclear areas often exhibited an intermediate number of fluorescent doublets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>–figure supplement 1A) of similar appearance and length on a single focal plane (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>–figure supplement 1B–D). To address the question to which extent cortical cells that are competent for infection progress through the G2 phase and commit to nuclear division, we assessed the gradual formation of sister centromeres. Although the nuclear size of infected C3 cells suggested an 8C DNA content, as found in late G2-phase cells of the nodule tissue (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B, C</xref>), none of these infected cells showed the typical CENH3 twin foci formed when sister kinetochores split (n = 13; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Such control over mitotic commitment was tightly maintained in the majority of infected, C4/5-derived cells (75,5%; n = 53; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) which did not display any visible sign of centromere separation across image stacks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), despite a presumably duplicated genomic DNA content (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). A smaller proportion of the recently infected cells (20,7%) partially prepared for chromosome segregation and showed up to 3 fluorescent doublets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) of comparable lengths to those measured in G2-phase progressing cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), whereas only two cells (3,8%) with internalized bacteria got closer to nuclear and likely to cell division (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Together, by combining several marker strategies based on histone H3 dynamics and on <italic>bona fide</italic> mitotic reporters, we conclude that most middle (C3) and inner (C4/5-derived) cortical cells competent for intracellular infection enter a post-replicative, G2-type phase without proceeding towards M-phase. Endopolyploid cortical cells hosting infection threads have presumably gained the ability to execute a differentiation program rather than entering cell division at the end of G2.</p>

<title>The symbiosis-specific NF-YA1 subunit holds potential to modulate the G2/M transition</title>
<p>Our data suggest that cell-cycle progression and bacterial infection are highly coordinated, although the precise molecular players able to redirect cell-cycle decisions while promoting cortical infections remain to be identified. Prominent candidates are NF-YA1 proteins that were evolutionary recruited to RNS, where they sustain both organogenesis and intracellular infection in a range of nodulating legume and non-legume species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Combier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hossain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bu et al., 2020</xref>). NF-YA1 plays an unambiguous role as a positive regulator of cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Soyano et al., 2013</xref>) but was also recently shown to function in the early differentiation and specification of nodule cells in Medicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schiessl et al., 2023</xref> – pre-print). This prompted us to assess whether NF-YA1 could act as a switch at mitotic entry. To test this, we used WT NF-YA1 and a mutated variant lacking a functional DNA-binding domain (mutDBD) as eGFP fusion proteins. As expected, both variants localized to the nucleus in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> epidermal cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>). To foster cell cycle re-entry in such differentiated cells, we ectopically expressed the Arabidopsis D-type cyclin <italic>CYCD3;1</italic> in mature leaves as described in the recently developed ‘cell division-enabled leaf system’ (CDELS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). As these re-activated cells commit to mitosis and perform cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), they also enable the activation of promoters containing MSA cis-elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Xu et al., 2020</xref>) as found in the Medicago <italic>KNOLLE</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>–figure supplement 1B). We confirmed this by expressing eGFP-KNOLLE from its endogenous promoter in the absence and presence of Arabidopsis CYCD3;1. The KNOLLE fusion protein was only detected when co-expressed with CYCD3;1 using immunoblot analyses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>–figure supplement 1A) and labelled newly formed cell-division planes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>–figure supplement 1B). This is consistent with previous reports showing that the syntaxin KNOLLE accumulates only in dividing cells. We also confirmed the activation of the Medicago <italic>KNOLLE</italic> promoter (pKNOLLE::GUS) in CDEL samples ectopically expressing CYCD3;1 by using a fluorometric GUS assay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Next, we tested the impact of NF-YA1 on the activity of promoters driving cell cycle-dependent gene transcription in the CDEL samples. While the presence of NF-YA1 did not alter <italic>GUS</italic> expression when driven from the histone <italic>H4</italic> promoter (pH4::GUS) that is active during DNA synthesis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yang et al., 1994</xref>), it significantly repressed pKNOLLE::GUS activation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). This effect was fully abolished when using the mutated NF-YA1<sup>mutDBD</sup> variant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, the repressive effect of NF-YA1 was stronger compared to the one observed when using a MYB3R transcriptional repressor from Medicago (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>–figure supplement 2A–B) known to halt the expression of late G2/M genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Haga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Takahashi et al., 2019</xref>). These results suggest that the NF-YA1 DNA-binding subunit prevents an unscheduled entry into mitosis in de-differentiating leaf cells, despite the action of ectopically-expressed CYCD3;1.</p>

<p>We then tested whether such effect could be observed at the cellular level in the CDEL system. For this, we ectopically co-expressed non-fluorescently-tagged CYCD3;1 and NF-YA1 and additionally transformed these leaves with fluorescently tagged Medicago H3.3 and KNOLLE proteins, expressed from their native regulators (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>–figure supplement 1B). While the constitutive presence of NF-YA1 did not prevent cell division events <italic>per se</italic>, a significantly lower proportion of transformed cells produced detectable levels of KNOLLE (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>–figure supplement 1C), indicating that less pavement cells engaged in mitosis at the investigated experimental timepoint. Cells visibly accumulating the KNOLLE protein still progressed through M-phase in the presence of NF-YA1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>–figure supplement 1B), although a smaller proportion of them fully completed cell division at 64 hours when compared to the control samples (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>–figure supplement 1D). From these data we concluded that NF-YA1 is able to control mitotic entry in de-differentiating, endoreduplicated cells at least in the CDEL system. Since symbiotically infected middle and inner primordium layers, where <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression was found to be confined in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>), are comprised of endopolyploid cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C–E</xref>), we hypothesize that the Medicago NF-YA1 protein might similarly modulate cell-cycle progression during symbiotic infections of legume roots by rhizobia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Failure to timely coordinate infection and organogenesis programs in the root cortex results in the formation of poorly colonized nodules that are unable to support the plant’s demand to obtain fixed nitrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Guan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schiessl et al., 2023</xref>–pre-print). Here, we sought to understand at cellular resolution, whether cell-cycle progression and cellular reprogramming are altered in a spatially confined array of host cells that gain a time-limited stage of competence for transcellular infection.</p>
<p>Our data support a model where dividing cells contributing to nodule formation, including target cells for cortical infection, are polyploid and contain 4 copies (C) of each chromosome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D–E</xref>). In Medicago, these 4C cells either pre-exist in the root cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Vinardell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carotenuto et al., 2019b</xref>) or arise from a single endoreduplication round prior to their possible entry into cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Libbenga &amp; Torrey, 1973</xref>). As competent cells are crossed by a cortical infection thread or fully internalize bacteria and despite being embedded into a proliferating tissue, they reach an 8C DNA content (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>) but without committing to a subsequent cell division (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C–E</xref>). Rather, cells supporting transcellular infections presumably use a cell-cycle GAP phase after DNA replication (<italic>i.e.,</italic> G2) and extend such phase to remodel their histone H3 composition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Finally, this differentiation process and concomitant transcellular passage are accomplished within a single, last cell-cycle round (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Otero et al., 2016</xref>). Here, and similar to infected root hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>), a rapid switch to another endocycle is likely prevented as both G1- and S-phase markers are kept low (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Taken together, these events control a cell-cycle progression state where molecular players operate to ensure a successful transmission of rhizobia to the first nodule cells.</p>

By the time they are crossed and ultimately internalize bacteria, such tetraploid cells (this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Torrey and Barrios, 1969</xref>) reach a post-replicative, 8C ploidy stage but contrary to direct neighbour cells, they do not commit to a subsequent cell division (red to white two-colour gradient). (<bold>B</bold>) Rather, cells supporting transcellular infection presumably enter a prolonged G2-phase (this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yang et al., 1994</xref>) during which they remodel their histone H3 composition as part of their cellular reprogramming for infection. This differentiation process and concurrent transcellular passage are accomplished within a last cell-cycle round. We propose that cellular factors controlling the G2/M transition and eventually the exit from the canonical cell cycle (dashed arrow) are prominent candidates to support intracellular infection competence.</p></caption>

<title>Modulating endopolyploidy during rhizobial infections</title>
<p>In line with findings from Arabidopsis reporting that a downregulation of <italic>H3.1</italic> gene expression and a massive eviction process contribute to various differentiation programs, <italic>e.g.</italic>, in the male and female gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ingouff et al., 2010</xref>), the root meristem, the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Otero et al., 2016</xref>) and the female germline precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hernandez-Lagana &amp; Autran, 2020</xref>), we show that the genetic program enabling intracellular infections of Medicago roots accesses the same mechanism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>– figure supplement 1C–E). Reciprocally, our data indicate that high H3.1 levels tend to be maintained in infected cells with blocked or aborted infections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>–figure supplement 1A–D). Furthermore, the nuclear enlargement in infected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) indicates profound transcriptional reprogramming and activation of new gene regulatory networks, as previously shown to occur in LCO-treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Knaack et al., 2022</xref>) or young symbiotic cells (<italic>i.e.</italic>, infected root hairs and 8C cells from mature nodules; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Nagymihály et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>). We expanded the latter view by showing that tetraploid cortical cells passed by an infection thread also reach a presumable 8C DNA content (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). As reported for growing cell types in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhosale et al., 2018</xref>), such alteration in endopolyploidy might support, among others, changes in cell wall composition, which have also recently been demonstrated to occur specifically around infected cells in Medicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Su et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gaudioso-Pedraza et al., 2018</xref>). In the determinate nodulator <italic>L. japonicus</italic>, polyploidization of early nodule cells might be controlled by <italic>VAGRANT INFECTION THREAD 1</italic> (<italic>VAG1</italic>), a putative component of the DNA topoisomerase VI (topo VI) complex, as cortical cells with reduced ploidy levels cannot be infected in the <italic>vag1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Suzaki et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, but different to infections by mycorrhizal fungi where repetitive rounds of endoreduplication occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Russo &amp; Genre, 2021</xref>) and support fungal colonization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carotenuto et al., 2019b</xref>), markedly reduced histone H3.1 contents in cells maintaining rhizobial infections in the root cortex up to the first recipient cells in nodule primordia indicate reduced endocycling rates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Otero et al., 2016</xref>). Such attenuation of cell-cycle progression together with decreased transcript levels of mitotic cyclins were shown to occur in budding yeast and Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Negishi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gigli-Bisceglia et al., 2018</xref>) following the activation of a cell-wall integrity (CWI) checkpoint.

<title>A G2-phase arrest and attenuated endoreduplication as a plausible context for cortical infections</title>
<p>Reaching and staying in a pre-mitotic stage has been proposed to facilitate the long-distance progression of infection threads in legume species forming so-called cortical, pre-infection threads (PITs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Foucher &amp; Kondorosi, 2000</xref>). These structures resemble the onset of a cell division plane that requires the formation of a cortical division zone, which is established from late S-through G2 phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Costa, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, this cell-cycle progression window coincides with the one we observed in infected cortical cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A–E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A–C</xref>). In addition, the existence of pre-mitotic and G2-arrested cortical cells on the infection thread trajectory is in line with a recent report showing that a rhizobium-induced mitotic module, comprising an α-Aurora kinase gene and its MYB3R transcriptional activator, supports endosymbiotic infection in Medicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly though, overexpression of the activator-type <italic>MYB3R1</italic> gene resulted in the formation of abnormally bulbous or branched infection threads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). These data emphasize the need to balance the activity of transcriptional regulators driving mitosis and cytokinesis in infected cells.</p>
<p>In summary, we hypothesize that endocycle suppression after a round of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>) and exiting the cell-cycle from the G2-phase might therefore create a permissive, yet controlled state for cortical infection thread progression, where polarization and cell-wall remodelling factors specialized for intracellular infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lace et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Su et al., 2023</xref>) act in a defined cell-cycle window to sustain infection thread growth and guidance across cortical layers.</p>

<title>Endopolyploidization following cytokinin perception: a legume innovation?</title>
<p>Using the centromeric histone H3 (CENH3) fluorescent reporter enabled us to assess the number of chromosomes, the progression through the G2 phase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>–figure supplement 1A–B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>) and to clearly identify diploid and polyploid cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> B and E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">De Storme et al., 2016</xref>). Combining CENH3 patterns with the histone H3.3 marker showed that somatic cortical cells giving rise to indeterminate Medicago root nodules are mainly tetraploid, which is consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Torrey &amp; Barrios, 1969</xref>). Furthermore, our imaging data indicate that dividing endopolyploid cells are homogenously maintained in the nodule tissue (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>–figure supplement 2B–C). This suggests that tetraploidization is an important feature for nodule fitness and infectability, as it may enable processes such as the required integration of many contextual stimuli (<italic>e.g.,</italic> bacterial signals; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Russo &amp; Genre, 2021</xref>), the coordination of controlled organogenesis and a greater cellular adaptability to hypoxic environments as also suggested for human tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yant &amp; Bomblies, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, our findings point towards tetraploidization of cortical cells being a hallmark for nodule identity as pericycle cells in nodule or lateral root primordia remain strictly diploid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>–figure supplement 2C). Interestingly, when dissected and cultured in suspension, cortical cells from the susceptible zone of pea roots entered cell divisions as tetraploid cells only when cytokinin (kinetin) was applied in addition to auxin (2,4-D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Libbenga &amp; Torrey, 1973</xref>). This is particularly interesting since a specific cortical response to cytokinin, an auxin/cytokinin interplay and subsequent cellular proliferation in the root cortex appear to be a legume innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Guan et al., 2013</xref>; Gauthier-Coles et al., 2019).</p>

<title>NF-YA1, possible intermediary between intracellular infection and cell-cycle control</title>
<p>While this and other reports have shed light onto cell-cycle patterns during rhizobial infections in roots and nodules, genetic factors coordinating cell-cycle progression and intracellular infections remained enigmatic. Using the heterologous CDEL system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Xu et al., 2020</xref>) has enabled us to test the impact of at least one of the potential candidates, the symbiotic transcription factor NF-YA1, on cell cycle-dependent activities in a de-differentiating cellular population. Expression of NF-YA1 in this system did not prevent cells from passing through S-phase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). But, while the activated cells (as indicated by the induction of the KNOLLE reporter) still engage in mitosis and eventually divide (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>–figure supplement 1B), significantly fewer transformed cells promoted the expression of this G2/M marker at our experimental timepoints (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>–figure supplement 1C) These results strongly suggest that, in the CDEL system, NF-YA1 negatively regulates the entry into mitosis despite the presence of CYCD3;1. The latter has been shown to promote mitotic cycles and to restrain differentiation and endoreduplication when accumulated in shoot tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schnittger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dewitte et al., 2003</xref>). Our observations are also consistent with findings in mammalian cells, where the NF-Y trimer mediates the repression of key mitotic genes in complex with the WT p53 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Imbriano et al., 2005</xref>) during a G2 arrest induced by genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Manni et al., 2001</xref>). A link to DNA damage control, potentially arising when endoreduplicated pavement cells are pushed back into a chromosome segregation cycle, seems likely in the CDEL system. However, whether NF-YA1 similarly monitors cell division activity in polyploid nodule primordium cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) and controls the G2/M transition along the infection thread trajectory and in intracellularly colonized nodules (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) are aspects that need to be addressed independently.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose that a local control of cell-cycle activity and a cell-cycle exit decision along the infection thread trajectory provide a window of cellular competence for cortical infections to progress down to the nodule primordium niche in Medicago. We demonstrated that the cell division and differentiation potentials are controlled in a spatially confined cell-file in the root cortex. We also showed that post-replicative, tetraploid cells reaching an 8C DNA content are optimal for intracellular infection. Consequently, it is tempting to hypothesize that exactly these cells comprise a highly specific transcriptional and regulatory landscape that ultimately defines the molecular susceptibility state for intracellular infection competence.</p>

The first, second and third fully expanded true leaves were used for infiltration experiments using needle-less syringes. Agrobacteria were resuspended in a MES/KOH infiltration buffer (10 mM, pH 5.6) supplemented with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 150 μM acetosyringone. Bacterial cultures used for co-transformations were diluted to a final OD 600 nm of 0.1 for each construct. <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> (GV3101) cells producing the p19 silencing suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Silhavy et al., 2002</xref>), were systematically included at a final OD 600 nm of 0.05. Upon infiltration, plants were further grown for 64 to 72 h before harvesting leaf samples with a biopsy puncher (4 mm diameter) in the distal half of fully infiltrated leaves. Four to 5 leaf discs were either mounted in sterile tap water and imaged with a confocal microscope, or 10 leaf discs were frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to <italic>in vitro</italic> transactivation assays.</p>

<title>Cell division-enabled leaf system (CDELS)</title>
<p>To foster differentiated pavement cells to enter the cell division cycle, non-fluorescently-tagged Arabidopsis CYCD3;1 was expressed under control of the CaMV 35S promoter by Agrobacterium infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). The p35S::CYCD3;1-HA construct was co-transformed with binary vectors allowing native expression of cell cycle regulated-reporters (pH4::GUS, pKNOLLE::GUS, pKNOLLE::eGFP-KNOLLE) and constitutive expression of transcription factors (NF-YA1, NF-YA1<sup>mutDBD</sup>) from Medicago. All plasmids used in the experiments involving the CDEL system are listed in Table S1. Transformed leaves homogenously expressing nuclear transformation markers included on the corresponding binary vectors were selected using an AXIO Imager.M2m ApoTome.2 light microscope (Zeiss). The activity of HA-tagged CYCD3;1 was verified by the presence of at least one mitotic figure with chromosomes labeled by H3.3-mCherry before harvesting.</p>

<title>Immunoblot analyses</title>
<p>To detect proteins transiently produced in the CDEL samples, 3 discs from 64 h post-infiltration leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to powder using a Tissue Lyser MM300 (Retsch). The powder was resuspended in 120 μl of 2x loading buffer and heated for 8 min at 95 °C. Equal volumes of samples were loaded and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) at constant voltage (80V). Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (0.2 µm pore size) using the Trans-Blot® Turbo™ semi-dry transfer system (7 min mixed MW MIDI program) (Bio-Rad). After blocking in a 2.5% (w/v) milk/TBST solution for 1 h at RT, transferred membranes were hybridized overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-GFP (Takara Bio Cat# 632381, RRID:AB_2313808) (1/5000); anti-DsRed (Takara Bio Cat# 632496, RRID:AB_10013483) (1/5000); peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA (Roche Cat# 12013819001, RRID:AB_390917) (1/2000); anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# F3165, RRID:AB_259529) (1/2000). Membranes were washed and incubated 1 h at RT with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse, Sigma-Aldrich Cat# A4416, RRID:AB_258167; anti-rabbit, Sigma-Aldrich Cat# A6154, RRID:AB_258284) (1/2000). Immunoblotted proteins were detected using the Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad). Digital images were acquired using an ECL ChemoCam Imager (Intas Science imaging) with exposures stopped before saturation.</p>

<title>Transactivation and quantitative fluorometric GUS assays</title>
<p><italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf samples used for GUS fluorometric assays were harvested 72 h post-infiltration. The same number of plasmids was used for all co-transformation experiments. A construct driving the accumulation of a nuclear FP (proH3.1::NLS:3xVenus) was included in the absence of exogenous transcription factors. Ten leaf discs per transformed leaf were frozen in liquid nitrogen inside a Safe Seal Micro tube containing a stainless-steel bead (5 mm diameter). Samples were ground twice for 30 s (28/s frequency) using a Tissue Lyser MM300 (Retsch) and the powder was resuspended in 400 µl of cold GUS extraction buffer (50 mM NaHPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 0.05% [v/v] Triton X-100 and 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail [Roche]). Crude leaf extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a turning wheel and centrifuged at 16.900 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Ten µl of the supernatant were used to determine protein concentrations by the dye-binding Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Twenty-five µg of total proteins in a final volume of 100 µl were pipetted into a white 96 well plate (Greiner Bio-One) before the addition of 200 µl of GUS reaction buffer (50 mM NaHPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% [v/v] Triton X-100 and 0.5 mM 4-Methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide [4-MUG] [Carl Roth]). After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C in the dark, the fluorescence emitted by GUS-mediated hydrolysis of 4-MUG into 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) was measured using a microplate reader (POLARstar Omega, BMG LABTECH). Fluorescence was recorded at 360 nm excitation and 460 nm emission filter (gain 500, 20 flashes per well) every 5 min over a time period of 130–180 min. Samples were run in technical triplicates and blank measurements (100 µl extraction buffer + 200 µl reaction buffer) were performed to correct for any nonenzymatic hydrolysis of 4-MUG. Corrected GUS activities (4-MU fluorescence units [FU] min<sup>-1</sup>) were calculated as: A<sub>GUS</sub> = ΔF / Δt = (F1-F0) / Δt where ΔF is the difference in fluorescence intensities measured in the linear range of the fluorescence curves over a 15 min period of time (Δt). Values were normalized to 1 μg of protein content by using the protein concentration determined via Bradford assay. Two to 5 independent experiments were performed with at least 3 leaves from 2 different plants analyzed.</p>

<title>Data visualization and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Alignment of multiple protein sequences was performed using Jalview (version 2.11.2.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Procter et al., 2021</xref>). Statistical analyses and generation of figures were performed using the GraphPad Prism software (version 9.5.1) (GraphPad Software Inc.). Normal distribution of data was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality tests. A Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA test followed by Dunnett’s multiple T3 comparisons or an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction were applied as parametric tests. Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons or Mann-Whitney tests were applied as non-parametric tests. Boxes in the box-and-whiskers plots extend from the 25th to 75th percentiles and whiskers range from the smallest to the largest values. Middle horizontal lines are plotted at the median. Sample size n, statistical tests and significance levels are provided in the figure legends.

<p>This is a <bold>fundamental</bold> cell biological study of host responses during symbiotic microbial infection of plants. <bold>Compelling</bold> imaging-based approaches using genetically-encoded cell cycle markers show that in Medicago truncatula root cortex cells, early rhizobial infection events are associated with cell-cycle re-entry, but once the infection is established, host cells exit the cell cycle. The work will be of interest to a wide range of colleagues, from development and cell biology to plant-microbe interactions.</p>

<p>Many studies reported findings implying that rhizobial infection is associated with cell cycle re-entry and progression, however, our understanding has been fragmented. This study provides exciting new insights as it represents a comprehensive description of the cell cycle progression during early stages of nodulation using fluorescence markers.</p>
<p>To briefly summarize, the authors first monitor H3.1 / H3.3 replacement to distinguish between replicating (S phase) and non-replicating cells to show that M. truncatula cortex cells along the bacterial infection thread are non-replicating (while neighbors enter the S phase). Nuclear size measurements revealed that these non-replicative cells are in the post-replicative stage (G2) rather than in the pre-replicative G1 phase, which the authors confirm with the Plant Cell Cycle Indicator (PlaCCI) fluorescent marker to track cell cycle progression in more detail. Cortex cells in the trajectory of the infection thread did not accumulate the late G2 marker of the PlaCCI nor the G2/M marker KNOLLE, indicating that these cells indeed remain in G2. Because nuclear size measurements indicated that infected cells are polyploid, the authors used the centromere histone marker CENH3 to determine chromosome number. They find that cortex cells giving rise to the nodule primordium are endomitotic and tetraploid, probably because their cell cycle is halted at centromere separation. Although not a focus of this manuscript, the authors also use their fluorescent tools to track cell cycle progression during arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. They confirm that infected cells transition from a replicating to a non-replicating state (H3.1 to H3.3) with progressing development of the arbuscules. In addition, the CENH3 marker confirms previous findings that cortex cells infected by fungi are endocycling (i.e., DNA synthesis without segregation of replicated parts). This represents an important confirmation of previous findings and contrasts with the situation during nodulation symbiosis, where chromosomes separate after replication.</p>
<p>In my view, the part about NF-YA1 is less strong - although I realize this is a compelling candidate to be a regulator of cell cycle progression, the experimental approaches used to address this question falls a bit short, in particular, compared to the very detailed approaches shown in the rest of the manuscript. The authors show that the transcription factor NF-YA1 regulates cell division in tobacco leaves; however, there is no experimental validation in the experimental system (nodules). All conclusions are based on a heterologous cell division system in tobacco leaves. The authors state that NF-YA1 has a nodule-specific role as a regulator of cell differentiation. I am concerned the tobacco system may not allow for adequate testing of this hypothesis. With the fluorescent tools the authors have at hand (in particular tools to detect G2/M transition, which the authors suggest is regulated by NF-YA1), it would be interesting to test what happens to cell division if NF-YA1 is over-expressed in Medicago roots?</p>
<p>Based on NF-YA1 expression data published previously and their results in tobacco epidermal cells, the authors hypothesize that NF-YA regulates the mitotic entry of nodule primordial cells. Given that much of the manuscript deals with earlier stages of the infection, I wonder if NF-YA1 could also have a role in regulating mitotic entry in cells adjacent to the infection thread?</p>
<p>In general, all microscopy images are of very high quality and support the authors' conclusions. While individually each set of fluorescent markers has its limitations, combined they constitute a powerful tool to track various stages of cell cycle progression in individual root cells during symbiosis. Overall, this is a very strong manuscript that comprehensively elucidates root cell cycle changes during microbial infection.</p>

<p>Cell cycle control during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis is an important topic, but our understanding of the process is poor and lacks resolution, as the nodule is a complex organ with many cell types that undergo profound changes. The authors aim to define the cell cycle state of individual plant cells in the emerging nodule primordium, as a transcellular infection thread passes through the meristem to reach cells deep in the incipient nodule and releases bacteria to form symbiosomes. The authors used a number of cell cycle reporters, such as different Histone 3 variants and cyclins, to follow cell cycle progress in exquisite detail. They showed that the host cells in the path of an infection thread exhibit a cell fate distinct from their immediate neighbors: after entering the S phase similar to their neighbors, these cells exit the cell cycle and enter a special differentiated state. This is likely an important shift that allows the proper passage of the infection thread. Although definitive proof needs more investigation, they showed that a pioneering transcription factor, NF-YA1, likely represses these endoreduplicated cells from completing the cell cycle.</p>

<p>We would like to thank you very much for handling and reviewing our manuscript so carefully and to be so positive about our work. We are indeed grateful about these very concise and constructive reviews as well as about the Editorial Assessment. We basically agree with all reviewers' comments. Besides addressing all formal suggestions, we also decided to do some more experiments.</p>
<p>The main concern, the role of the transcription factor NF-YA1 during rhizobial infections, is indeed an absolut valid one. While the CDEL system has its beauties it certainly has its limitations as well. Thus, we will try to assess the role of NF-YA1 during symbiotic infections in Medicago more specifically. We will place NF-YA1 expression under the control of infection-specific promoters to limit pleiotropic effects of ectopic over-expression and assess rhizobial infections as well as cell cycle patterns in tranformed hairy roots producing the H3.1/H3.3 marker. Infection-inducible promoters will also be used to drive the ectopic expression of CYCD3;1 on the cortical infection thread trajectory to locally increase mitotic cycles, in order to test the functional importance of cell cycle exit on cortical infections.</p>
<p>We hope that we will be able to conclude more firmly on NF-YA1 function prior to locking the version of record and to deliver these experiments in a time frame of about 4-6 months, which is the minimum time we need for cloning the respective constructs, doing all hairy root transformations in sufficient numbers and quantitative microscopy.</p>
