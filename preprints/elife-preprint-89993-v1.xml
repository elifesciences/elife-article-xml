<title>Summary</title>
<p>Neuronal and behavioral adaptations to novel stimuli are regulated by temporally dynamic waves of transcriptional activity, which shape neuronal function and guide enduring plasticity. Neuronal activation promotes expression of an immediate early gene (IEG) program comprised primarily of activity-dependent transcription factors, which are thought to regulate a second set of late response genes (LRGs). However, while the mechanisms governing IEG activation have been well studied, the molecular interplay between IEGs and LRGs remain poorly characterized. Here, we used transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to define activity-driven responses in rat striatal neurons. As expected, neuronal depolarization generated robust changes in gene expression, with early changes (1 h) enriched for inducible transcription factors and later changes (4 h) enriched for neuropeptides, synaptic proteins, and ion channels. Remarkably, while depolarization did not induce chromatin remodeling after 1 h, we found broad increases in chromatin accessibility at thousands of sites in the genome at 4 h after neuronal stimulation. These putative regulatory elements were found almost exclusively at non-coding regions of the genome, and harbored consensus motifs for numerous activity-dependent transcription factors such as AP-1. Furthermore, blocking protein synthesis prevented activity-dependent chromatin remodeling, suggesting that IEG proteins are required for this process. Targeted analysis of LRG loci identified a putative enhancer upstream of <italic>Pdyn</italic>, a gene encoding an opioid neuropeptide implicated in motivated behavior and neuropsychiatric disease states. CRISPR-based functional assays demonstrated that this enhancer is both necessary and sufficient for <italic>Pdyn</italic> transcription. This regulatory element is also conserved at the human <italic>PDYN</italic> locus, where its activation is sufficient to drive <italic>PDYN</italic> transcription in human cells. These results suggest that IEGs participate in chromatin remodeling at enhancers and identify a conserved enhancer that may act as a therapeutic target for brain disorders involving dysregulation of <italic>Pdyn</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Experience-dependent cellular adaptations within the brain circuits that control motivated behaviors are critical for learning, memory, and longterm behavioral change. In psychiatric disorders such as drug addiction, these cellular changes are hijacked to drive maladaptive behavioral changes that promote drug seeking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Furthermore, mutations that alter the function of activity-dependent transcription factors have been implicated in a host of neurodevelopmental and autism spectrum disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Adaptations to novel stimuli are regulated by temporally and functionally distinct activity-dependent transcriptional programs. For example, various forms of neuronal activation result in the rapid induction of immediate early genes (IEGs), including transcription factors such as <italic>Fos</italic> (aka c-Fos), <italic>Npas4</italic>, and <italic>Nr4a2</italic>. These genes follow a temporally dynamic profile, with elevated expression within 1 h of a stimulus and rapid return to baseline levels. In contrast, the same stimuli promote expression of a more delayed gene expression program, termed late response genes (LRGs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This set of genes includes kinases, neurotrophic factors, and neurotransmitter receptors.</p>
<p>Current models of activity-dependent gene expression suggest that these distinct transcriptional waves work together to promote enduring cellular and behavioral adaptations.</p>
<p>While genes within the IEG expression program are required for cellular and behavioral changes following stimulation, the exact mechanisms by which they contribute to LRG expression and the functional consequences of this process remain poorly characterized. Recent evidence suggests that chromatin remodeling at genomic enhancers is a key event linking LRGs to IEGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In non-neuronal systems, AP-1, an activity-dependent transcription factor consisting of <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Jun</italic> family members, directly contributes to chromatin remodeling at LRG enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. However, despite ample evidence for activity-dependent transcription of AP-1 members in multiple brain regions and cell types, understanding the nature and functional consequences of LRG induction remains a challenge for several reasons. First, emerging evidence has revealed that different classes of neurons induce distinct LRG programs in response to the same neuronal activation. Second, different types of stimuli may give rise to non-overlapping constellations of IEG transcription factors, which could promote activation of distinct LRGs to tune neuronal responses. Finally, even where chromatin remodeling has been identified near LRGs, the consequences of this remodeling have not been concretely linked to transcriptional activation of candidate LRGs.</p>
<p>Here, we used next generation sequencing approaches to characterize temporally distinct, activity-dependent transcriptomic and epigenomic reorganization in cultured rat embryonic striatal neurons, an <italic>in vitro</italic> model containing many cell types implicatedinlearning, motivation, reward, andsubstance use disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. These experiments comprehensively characterized activity-responsive genes in both the IEG and LRG expression programs in striatal neurons, and revealed a temporal decoupling between IEG activation and activity-dependent chromatin remodeling. Further functional studies suggest that translation of IEGs is necessary for activity-dependent chromatin remodeling, and that sites of chromatin opening are enriched for AP-1 transcription factor motifs. Combining transcriptional and epigenomic profiling allowed us to identify a putative enhancer upstream of the <italic>Pdyn</italic> locus that is conserved in the human genome. CRISPR-based activation and repression experiments provided functional validation that this region serves as a <italic>Pdyn</italic> enhancer in both rat neurons and dividing human cell lines. Collectively, these results highlight the mechanisms through which neuronal activity promotes gene expression changes to modify neuronal function, and have relevance for brain disease states characterized by alterations to this process.</p>

<title>Characterization of temporally and functionally distinct transcriptional programs following neuronal depolarization</title>
<p>Activity-dependent transcriptomic and epigenomic reorganization has been heavily implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as drug addiction. Previously, our lab established cultured rat embryonic striatal neurons as an <italic>in vitro</italic> model for studying activitydependent processes as these cultures contain the same cell types affected by drugs of abuse in the rat ventral striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. To characterize IEG and LRG expression programs in this model system, we performed RNA-seq following neuronal depolarization with 10mM KCl for 1 or 4 h (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). Following 1 h of depolarization, we identified 207 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; defined as genes with an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 and |log2FoldChange| &gt; 0.5). Notably, â¼75% of these genes were upregulated by KCl, including activity-dependent transcription factors such as <italic>Npas4, Fos, Fosb, Fosl2</italic>, and <italic>Nr4a1</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, Table S1</bold>). In contrast, 4 h of depolarization resulted in significant transcriptomic reorganization, with 1,680 genes identified as DEGs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, Table S1</bold>). DEGs upregulated by KCl at this timepoint included the opioid propeptide <italic>Pdyn</italic>, as well as the voltage-gated potassium channel <italic>Kcnf1</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). Interestingly, overlap between 1 h DEGs (putative IEGs) and 4 h DEGs (putative LRGs) primarily occurred when IEGs such as <italic>Fos</italic> were upregulated at both 1 and 4 h (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1a</xref></bold>). In contrast, most 4 h DEGs such as <italic>Pdyn</italic> demonstrated temporally specific upregulation and were only activated following 4 h of depolarization (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1b</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To determine whether 1 h and 4 h specific DEGs were functionally distinct, we used gProfiler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> to identify enriched cellular component and molecular function gene ontology (GO) terms in each gene list. 1 h DEGs, or IEGs, were enriched for cellular component terms such as âNucleusâ, âChromatinâ, and âTranscription regulator complexâ (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>), suggesting that most DEGs were transcription factors or genes encoding proteins involved in transcriptional regulation. Conversely, 4 h DEGs, or LRGs, were enriched for cellular component terms such as âSynapseâ and âNeuron projectionâ (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>), suggesting that these DEGs encode proteins required for cellular adaptations to stimulation. Molecular function GO term analysis found overlap between IEGs and LRGs (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1c</xref></bold>), with both IEG-specific and overlapping molecular function GO terms including transcription factor activity (<bold>Table S2</bold>). However, LRG molecular function GO terms were distinct and included âvoltage gated channel activityâ and âG protein-coupled receptor bindingâ (<bold>Table S2</bold>). Together, these results demonstrate that striatal neuron depolarization induces temporally and functionally distinct gene expression programs that can be classified as IEGs and LRGs.</p>

<title>Activity-dependent chromatin remodeling primarily occurs in non-coding genomic regions</title>
<p>In non-neuronal systems, LRG induction is dependent on activity-dependent chromatin remodeling at genomic enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To identify the potential mechanisms governing transcriptomic reorganization following 4 h of depolarization, we first sought to identify whether activity-dependent chromatin remodeling occurs in striatal neurons. Cultured rat embryonic striatal neurons were treated with 10mM KCl for 1 or 4 h and assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by next generation sequencing (ATAC-seq) libraries were prepared (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). Strikingly, 1 h of depolarization did not induce any chromatin remodeling that passed genome-wide cutoffs for statistical significance (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>). However, 4 h of depolarization induced genome-wide chromatin remodeling with 5,312 differentially accessible regions (DARs, defined as regions with adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value <underline>&lt;</underline> 0.05), all of which become more open with depolarization (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>; <bold>Table S3</bold>). Previous studies have suggested that activity-dependent chromatin remodeling and other epigenetic processes occur in non-coding regions associated with genomic enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. To understand whether activity-dependent chromatin remodeling preferentially occurred in non-coding genomic regions, we calculated the odds ratio of enrichment compared to chance levels for all 4 h DARs as well as baseline peaks identified in vehicle treated samples that did not overlap 4 h DARs (termed âvehicleâ peaks; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). Notably, vehicle peaks were significantly enriched in coding regions and proximal promoters (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>). In contrast, activity-regulated DARs were depleted in coding regions and promoters, but were enriched in intergenic and intronic regions of the genome. This distribution is consistent with a function for these DARs as distal cis-regulatory enhancer elements.</p>

<p>Enhancers are marked by distinctive histone modifications, including histone acetylation (at H3K27) and increased ratios of histone monomethylation to trimethylation at H3K4 (H3K4me1:H3K4me3). In contrast, while promoters are also marked by H3K27ac, they tend to exhibit a lower H3K4me1:H3K4me3 ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. To investigate whether 4 h DARs were enriched for enhancer-associated histone modifications, we next leveraged a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> that profiled histone modification enrichment throughout the mouse striatum. While DARs and vehicle peaks were enriched for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2a,b</xref></bold>), DARs had a significantly higher H3K4me1:H3K4me3 ratio than vehicle peaks (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2c,d</xref></bold>). The preferential enrichment of DARs in non-coding regions coupled with the presence of H3K27ac and increased ratios of H3K4me1:H3K4me3 suggests that activity-dependent chromatin remodeling occurs at genomic enhancers in striatal neurons.</p>

<title>Transcription factor motifs associated with IEGs are significantly enriched in 4 h DARs</title>
<p>The combination of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq results suggests a temporal decoupling between induction of IEG transcription factors and activitydependent chromatin remodeling. IEG transcription factors were activated following 1 h of depolarization (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>), but activity-dependent chromatin remodeling only occurred following 4 h of depolarization (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>). Furthermore, IEG transcription factors are critical mediators of activity-dependent chromatin remodeling in neuronal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and non-neuronal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Thus, we predicted that IEG transcription factor motifs would be enriched in 4 h DARs.</p>
<p>To test this possibility, we searched for enriched motifs using a database of experimentally validated transcription factor binding motifs with HOMER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Additionally, because millions of IEG motifs are found throughout the genome, we compared the enrichment between 4 h DARs and peaks found in vehicle treated samples. HOMER uses randomly selected background regions to compare the enrichment of motifs within a user identified peak set. This allowed us to calculate a percent enrichment, or the percent of background sequences with the motif subtracted from percent of target sequences with the motif. While no transcription factor motifs exhibited enrichment greater than 50% in the vehicle peak dataset (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>), 8 motifs exceed this threshold within 4 h DARs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref></bold>). Interestingly, all motifs correspond to versions of the consensus motif for the AP-1 family of activity-dependent transcription factors, with 93% of 4 h DARs containing an AP-1 motif (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref></bold>). In addition to calculation of a percent enrichment, we calculated the enrichment of specific motifs across DARs and vehicle peaks. AP-1, as well as its subunits FOS, FOSL2, and JUNB, were significantly enriched at the center of DARs and not in vehicle peaks (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref></bold>). Recently, binding sites for the AP-1 family member ÎFosB were assayed in the adult mouse nucleus accumbens using CUT&amp;RUN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Bindings sites identified in this study were then mapped to the rat genome. ÎFosB is significantly enriched in DARs, but not in vehicle peaks or a set of 5,312 random regions that are the same size as DARs (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2e</xref></bold>). Additional analyses identified that MEF2C motifs were enriched at the center of DARs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c-d</xref></bold>). MEF2C is a member of the MEF2 family of proteins that are integral regulators of synaptic plasticity in the developing brain and interact with histone deacetylases to alter chromatin accessibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. ISL1, is an integral regulator of MSN development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, was also enriched at the center of DARs, with 95% of DARs containing an ISL1 motif (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c-d</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>The HOMER database allowed us to investigate the enrichment of over 400 transcription factor motifs in over 5,300 DARs. To understand if DARs could be separated based on the transcription factor motifs present within these regions, we used uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP; a dimensionality reduction technique)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and density-based clustering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> to separate DARs based on the presence, absence, or count of annotated transcription factor motifs. This analysis identified 3 major clusters with some DARs labeled as outliers (cluster 0) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref></bold>). Unsurprisingly, clusters were not defined by the presence of AP-1, FOSL2, MEF2C, or ISL1, transcription factors that are significantly enriched at the center of DARs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref></bold>). However, cluster 2 was marked by the presence of the KLF10 motif and cluster 1 was marked by the presence of a motif corresponding to OCT6 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results demonstrate a significant enrichment of IEG motifs within 4 h DARs and suggests that IEGs may participate in activity-dependent chromatin remodeling in striatal neurons.</p>

<title>De novo protein translation is required for activity-dependent chromatin remodeling</title>
<p>The significant enrichment of IEG transcription factor motifs within 4 h DARs suggests that these inducible transcription factors may be required for subsequent activity-dependent chromatin remodeling. Furthermore, the temporal decoupling between IEG expression and activity-dependent chromatin remodeling suggests that IEGs must be translated before acting on genomic regions to induce an open chromatin state. To test the hypothesis that <italic>de novo</italic> protein translation is required for activity-dependent chromatin remodeling, we repeated ATAC-seq after 4 h of depolarization in combination with protein synthesis inhibition.

<title>Activity-dependent Pdyn transcription is regulated by IEGs and protein translation</title>
<p>Given that activity-dependent chromatin remodeling across the genome required protein translation, we next sought to identify discrete regions near LRGs that may serve as activity-dependent enhancers. We predicted that regions serving as activity-dependent enhancers for LRGs would be: 1) located in non-coding regions of the genome, 2) inaccessible at baseline and accessible following depolarization, and 3) inaccessible when depolarization was paired with protein synthesis inhibition. These regions would be fundamentally different from enhancers regulating IEGs (such as the enhancers within the <italic>Fos</italic> locus), which are accessible at baseline and do not undergo activity-dependent chromatin remodeling (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref></bold>). We identified a putative enhancer â¼45 kilobases upstream of the <italic>Pdyn</italic> TSS that met all of these criteria (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). While <italic>Pdyn</italic> is an LRG that plays important roles in striatal function, the <italic>Pdyn</italic> promoter does not undergo activity-dependent chromatin remodeling (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). Next, we predicted that if this differently accessible chromatin region in the <italic>Pdyn</italic> locus serves as enhancer for <italic>Pdyn</italic>, then blocking protein translation should also attenuate activity-dependent <italic>Pdyn</italic> transcription. In support of this prediction, anisomycin pretreatment completely blocked activity-dependent <italic>Pdyn</italic> transcription, as detected with RT-qPCR (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref></bold>). Additionally, anisomycin pretreatment attenuated baseline <italic>Pdyn</italic> mRNA levels in the absence of stimulation, suggesting that basal <italic>Pdyn</italic> expression is comprised of both constitutive and activity-dependent transcriptional events (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To determine whether <italic>Pdyn</italic> is directly regulated by IEG transcription factors, we leveraged a previously published RNA-seq dataset that used CRISPR activation tools to overexpress 16 IEGs that are upregulated in striatal neurons following dopamine stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref></bold>). CRISPR-based activation of 16 IEGs (including <italic>Fos, Fosb</italic>, and <italic>Junb</italic>) resulted in significant upregulation of <italic>Pdyn</italic> mRNA (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref></bold>), demonstrating that activation of IEGs is sufficient to upregulate <italic>Pdyn</italic> expression. To further investigate the transcriptional regulation of <italic>Pdyn</italic>, we leveraged a publicly available single nucleus RNA-sequencing dataset from rats treated with a single dose of cocaine (or saline as a control; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref></bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Because these rats were sacrificed one hour after injection, we reasoned that LRGs have not yet been fully activated by cocaine experience at this timepoint. However, using pseudotime analysis to reconstruct gene regulatory networks allowed us to identify predicted upstream regulators of <italic>Pdyn</italic> transcription. In prior work, we demonstrated that distinct populations of Drd1-MSNs have differential responses to cocaine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, pseudotime trajectory graphs were constructed such that the highest pseudotime marked cells that were transcriptionally activated by cocaine (i.e., expressed high levels of IEGs) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f-g</xref></bold>). <italic>Pdyn</italic> mRNA levels were also higher in cells with high <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>FosB</italic> expression (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref></bold>).

<title>CRISPR-based functional validation of a novel Pdyn enhancer</title>
<p>The observation that <italic>Pdyn</italic> DAR accessibility and <italic>Pdyn</italic> mRNA were both activity-and translation-dependent suggests that this site acts as a stimulus-regulated enhancer for <italic>Pdyn</italic>. To test this hypothesis, we used a catalytically dead version of Cas9 (dCas9) fused to the transcriptional activator VPR (CRISPRa) or the transcriptional repressor KRAB-MeCP2 (CRISPRi)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> to activate or silence this region on demand (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a,b</xref></bold>).

<title>PDYN is a cell type-specific LRG in the human genome regulated by a conserved genomic enhancer</title>
<p>Because genomic enhancers are critical regulators of genes important for shared biological functions, many of these elements are conserved across species.

<p>This published study also performed ATAC-seq on human glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons following 0 and 90 minutes of depolarization. While 90 minutes does not provide the same temporal resolution for chromatin remodeling at genomic enhancers as our experiments in rat neurons, it is a timepoint in which chromatin remodeling may initially occur following stimulation. Interestingly, the rat <italic>Pdyn</italic> DAR is conserved in a region that is also upstream of the human <italic>PDYN</italic> TSS (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref></bold>), and this region undergoes time-dependent increases in chromatin accessibility following KCl stimulation along with other identified DARs in this locus (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we used transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to characterize activity-dependent transcriptional and epigenomic waves in cultured embryonic rat striatal neurons, an <italic>in vitro</italic> model relevant for studying striatal function and neuropsychiatric disease. These experiments characterized a well-studied IEG expression program, which consisted primarily of activity-dependent transcription factors, as well as a delayed LRG expression program (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-c</xref></bold>). While IEGs are required for cellular and behavioral adaptations, they control this process through the transcriptional regulation of LRGs. LRGs are both functionally and temporally distinct from IEGs. IEGs primarily encode transcription factors and co-activators, while LRGs encode opioid peptides, transporters, and other proteins involved in synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. For example, FOS regulates transcriptional activation of the LRG <italic>Scg2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, a gene that encodes several neuropeptides that regulate inhibitory plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. IEGs, such as <italic>Fos</italic>, may regulate LRGs by their involvement in activity-dependent chromatin remodeling, as <italic>Fos</italic> mRNA induction is required for activity-dependent chromatin remodeling in dentate gyrus following neuronal stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, analysis of both transcriptomic and epigenomic data revealed a temporal decoupling between transcriptional activation of IEGs and chromatin remodeling. While 1 h of depolarization was sufficient to induce hundreds of transcriptional changes, genome-wide chromatin remodeling was only observed following 4 h of depolarization. This result contrasts with a previously published study that observed genome-wide chromatin remodeling in the mouse dentate gyrus following 1 h of electroconvulsive stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Differences in the temporal dynamics of activity dependent chromatin remodeling could be due to differences in both the cell type of interest (hippocampal vs. striatal), as well as the type of stimulation (electroconvulsive stimulation vs. depolarization). Nonetheless, our studies agree in that a significant proportion of regions undergoing remodeling become more accessible following stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>). The accepted model of activity-dependent transcription posits that LRG activation is dependent on IEGs. To this point, blocking <italic>Fos</italic> mRNA induction via shRNA in the dentate gyrus is sufficient to significantly attenuate activity-dependent chromatin remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This data demonstrates that <italic>Fos</italic> is required for some level of chromatin remodeling in the brain but does not provide evidence regarding the mechanisms through which it is involved. In non-neuronal cells, AP-1 acts as a pioneer factor at genomic enhancers by guiding the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to target regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Our data suggests a similar mechanism regulates activity-dependent chromatin remodeling at genomic enhancers in neurons. First, AP-1 motifs and FosB binding sites are significantly enriched within 4 h DARs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b-d</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">S2e</xref></bold>). Second, blocking translation of IEGs, which include a significant number of AP-1 family members, completely blocks activity-dependent chromatin remodeling (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c,d</xref></bold>). Thus, we may propose a neuron-specific model in which neuronal stimulation results in the transcription and translation of AP-1 family members. These AP-1 family members then interact with the SWI/SNF complex to induce chromatin remodeling at genomic enhancers. However, while AP-1 is thought to aid in enhancer selection, it is expressed in a non-cell type specific manner and must choose from over 1 million potential AP-1 motifs in the genome. Thus, additional factors must be present to ensure precise cell type-specific responses to activity. The use of the HOMER database allowed us to explore the enrichment of over 400 additional transcription factor motifs, including ISL1, an MSN-selective transcription factor. ISL1 is significantly enriched in DARs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c-d</xref></bold>). The combined enrichment of AP-1 and ISL1 at 4 h DARs suggests that cell type-specific transcription factors may be working in conjunction with activity-dependent transcription factors to induce chromatin remodeling. We envision three possible mechanisms through which cell type-specific transcription factors may be involved in this process. First, population-specific transcription factors may be directly interacting with AP-1 or chromatin remodeling complexes to induce remodeling at these sites. Second, ISL1 may stochastically bind these regions, resulting in specific temporal windows in which AP-1 might bind in a cooperative fashion. Finally, because cell type specific transcription factors are often activated during development, they may epigenetically alter potential binding sites proximal to AP-1 motifs, resulting in a preferential targeting of these AP-1 motifs at later timepoints. Any of these mechanisms would allow distinct cell types to induce specific LRG programs, even with homogenous IEG activation, and ultimately enable the same stimulus to produce different cellular adaptations in different cell types.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have demonstrated that most regions undergoing activity-dependent chromatin remodeling are genomic enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Analysis of 4 h DARs from this study identified a significant enrichment for DARs in non-coding regions and a depletion in coding regions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-e</xref></bold>), suggesting that activity dependent chromatin remodeling in striatal neurons is also occurring at genomic enhancers. This data also demonstrates a distinction between the chromatin profiles of IEG and LRG enhancers. IEG enhancers are âpoisedâ at baseline, while LRG enhancers are largely inaccessible in without stimulation. For example, enhancers within the <italic>Fos</italic> locus are accessible in both vehicle and KCl treated samples (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref></bold>), while the <italic>Pdyn</italic> enhancer is only accessible with neuronal depolarization (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). In addition, LRG enhancers contain motifs for activity-dependent transcription factors (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-e</xref>)</bold> and are dependent on <italic>de novo</italic> protein translation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c,d</xref></bold>). While LRG enhancers become accessible only with activity, both IEG and LRG enhancers are in noncoding regions of the genome and are marked by specific histone modifications like H3K27ac and H3K4me1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>While the enrichment of DARs in putative enhancer elements is intriguing, we also wanted to understand whether enhancers regulate nearby LRGs. To do this, we identified a DAR upstream of the <italic>Pdyn</italic> TSS that may serve as a functional enhancer. This region is also accessible in the adult rat NAc (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref></bold>). Furthermore, this region is coaccessible with the <italic>Pdyn</italic> promoter and has the highest level of accessibility in Drd1-and Grm8-MSNs, suggesting that the enhancer is functional <italic>in vivo</italic> and may exhibit some level of cell type specificity (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref>)</bold>. However, a larger dataset containing more nuclei will be needed to test for any drug-specific chromatin remodeling at this region. CRISPR-based functional assays demonstrated that the DAR upstream of the <italic>Pdyn</italic> TSS serves as a genomic enhancer that is necessary, sufficient, and specific for transcription of <italic>Pdyn</italic>. We were particularly interested in <italic>Pdyn</italic> because it encodes the dynorphin neuropeptides that are agonists for the kappa opioid receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. The kappa opioid receptor system has been the target of several antagonists that reduce drug-taking behaviors in pre-clinical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, <italic>Pdyn</italic> is regulated by dopamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and drugs of abuse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and polymorphisms and structural variants within the human <italic>PDYN</italic> gene locus are associated with drug abuse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In particular, one polymorphism affects an AP-1 binding site within the <italic>PDYN</italic> gene promoter, which may result in less <italic>PDYN</italic> transcription and an increased risk for cocaine dependence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Thus, the identification of a functional, conserved enhancer for <italic>PDYN</italic> in the human genome provides a novel potential therapeutic target capable of regulating stimulus-dependent changes in <italic>PDYN</italic> expression while leaving constitutive expression patterns unaltered. Future experiments should investigate whether this conserved enhancer element mediates reward-related behaviors and cellular adaptations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have identified and characterized temporally distinct waves of transcription and chromatin remodeling in striatal neurons. Furthermore, we found that the translation of IEGs is required for activity-dependent chromatin remodeling, particularly at genomic enhancers. Targeted analysis of LRG loci identified a genomic enhancer that is necessary, sufficient, and specific for <italic>Pdyn</italic> transcription. This enhancer is conserved in the human genome and represents a novel therapeutic target for modulation of the kappa opioid receptor system. Continued functional validation of putative enhancer regions within this dataset may provide additional therapeutic targets.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study that uses chromatin accessibility as a measure to determine the impact of neuronal activity on the state of chromatin regulatory elements in striatal neurons. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence of how Pdyn gene expression is highly dependent on a distal regulatory genomic region both at basal and upon neuronal activation in this particular system, a mechanism conserved as well in human neuronal cells. Although some findings are not novel, this paper ties previous findings all together in one place and uses the analysis to then identify a functionally relevant and conserved enhancer for the prodynorphin gene with potential relevance for neuropsychiatric disorders beyond basic cellular neuroscience.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, the authors use ATAC-seq to find regions of the genome of rat embryonic striatal neurons in culture that show changes in regulatory element accessibility following stimulation by KCl-mediated membrane depolarization. The authors compare 1hr and 4hr transcriptomes to see both rapid and late response genes. When they look at ATAC-seq data they see no changes in accessibility at 1hr but strong changes at 4hr. The differentially accessible sites were enriched for the AP-1 site, suggesting regulation by Fos-Jun family members, and consistent with the requirement for IEG expression, anisomycin blocked the increase in accessibility. To test the functional importance of this regulation the authors focus on a putative enhancer 45kb upstream of the activity-induced gene encoding the neuromodulator dynorphin (Pdyn). To test the function of this region, the authors recruited CRISPRi to the site, which blocked KCL-dependent Pdyn induction, or CRISPRa, which selectively increased Pdyn expression in the absence of KCl. Finally, the authors reanalyze other human and rat datasets to show cell-type specific function of this enhancer correlated to Pdyn expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The idea that stimuli that induce expression of Fos in neurons can change the accessibility of regulatory elements bound from Fos has been shown before, but almost all the data are from hippocampal neurons so it is nice to see the different cell type used here. The most interesting part of the study is the identification of the Pdyn enhancer because of the importance of this gene product in the function of striatal neurons. Overall the conclusions appear to be well supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The timing and the location of the accessibility changes are meaningfully different from other similar studies, which should be discussed. The authors provide good data for the function of a single enhancer near Pdyn, but could contextualize this with respect to other regulatory elements nearby.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors characterize activity-dependent transcriptional and epigenetic changes at two different time points (1h and 4hrs) after neuronal activation using rat striatal primary cultures. They show that while at 1h post-stimulation mostly a selective set of IEGs are up-regulated, at 4hrs a wider set of genes, identified as late-response genes (LRGs), are upregulated, with distinct functional signatures. By using ATAC-seq, the authors show how chromatin accessibility is mostly spared at 1h post-stimulation, while a prominent set of differentially accessible regions (DARs) could be identified at 4hrs post-stimulation, enriched in motifs for TFs upregulated at their initial time-point. These chromatin changes appear to be dependent on the earlier translation of proteins, as they are avoided when neuronal cultures are pre-treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor Anisomycin. Afterwards, the authors characterized a set of regulatory regions of a particular LRG, Pdyn, associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, by using CRISRPR to activate or inactivate an enhancer that increases its accessibility at 4hrs post-stimulation, showing that the expression of Pdyn is highly dependent on this regulatory region both, at basal level and for its proper activity-dependent stimulation and that it is enriched in motifs for IEGs upregulated at 1h post-stimulation. Using publicly available data from human GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons similarly stimulated with KCl, the authors show that this enhancer is conserved in humans and that it is mostly modified in GABAergic neurons in response to neuronal stimulation, but not in glutamatergic neurons. Finally, the authors suggest that the regulatory role of the Pdyn enhancer they focus on it might be cell-type specific, as single-nuclei ATAC-seq data generated in rat Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) shows that its coaccessibility score together with Pdyn promoter is more prominent in Drd1- and Grm8-MSNs.</p>
<p>Among the major strengths of the article, there is the generation of neuronal RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data in a model system, rat striatal neuronal cells, that hasn't been so broadly characterized as other more common ones such as mouse hippocampal neuronal cells and the functional characterization of an enhancer of the Pdyn gene that might be of interest for translational applications in which alterations of this gene might be occurring in neurological disorders.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the manuscript presents several weaknesses to consider. First of all, at a conceptual level, most of the findings related to the induction of particular transcriptional programs upon neuronal activation the changes in chromatin state, and the need for protein translation for proper induction of LRGs have been broadly characterized previously in the literature (Tyssowski et al., Neuron, 2018; Ibarra et al., Mol. Syst. Biol., 2022; and also reviewed by Yap and Greenberg, Neuron, 2018). In addition, it is not so obvious why to focus on Pdyn gene regulatory regions among the thousands of genes upregulated and with modified chromatin landscape after neuronal activation. The authors highlight three particular traits of this gene as the reason to choose it, but those traits are probably shared by most of the genes that are part of the LRGs set.</p>
<p>At the methodological level, some attention should be put into the timings chosen for generating the data. The authors claim that these time points (1h and 4hrs) identify the first (i.e IEGs) and second (i.e LRGs) waves of transcription. However, at 4hrs the highest over-expressed genes are still IEGs, as shown in the volcano plots of Figure 1B and 1C, showing a high overlap with up-regulated genes found at 1h (Figure 1D). This might suggest that the 4hrs time point is somewhere in between the first and second wave of transcription, probably missing some of the still-to-be-induced LRGs of the latest one.</p>
<p>Finally, while only prosed as a suggestion, the assumption that from the data generated in this article, we can envision a mechanism by which AP-1 family of transcription factors interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is going too far, as no evidence is provided implicated SWI/SNF in the data presented in the manuscript.</p>

<p>This work contributes to the literature characterizing early and late waves of transcription and associated chromatin remodeling following neuronal depolarization, here in cultured embryonic striatum. While they find IEG transcription 1h after depolarization, they find chromatin remodeling is slower (opening at the 4h time point). This may be due to chromatin at IEG regulatory regions already being open (in embryonic striatum), although previous work has found remodeling occurring at the 1h time point (in adult dentate gyrus). The authors next show that the chromatin remodeling that occurs at the late (4h) stage is largely in putative regulatory regions of the genome (rather than gene bodies), and is dependent on translation, which validates and extends the prior literature. The authors then transition from genome-wide basic neuroscience to focus on a specific gene of interest, prodynorphin (Pdyn), and a putative enhancer they identify from their chromatin analysis. They target CRISPR-activating and -inhibiting complexes to the putative enhancer and demonstrate that accessibility of this locus is necessary and sufficient for Pdyn transcription. They then show that at least one PDYN enhancer is conserved from rodents to humans, and is only activity-regulated in human GABAergic but not glutamatergic neurons. Finally, the authors generate snATAC-seq and show Pdyn gene and enhancer activity are also cell-type-specific in the rat striatum. The Pdyn work in particular is thorough and novel.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This work integrates multiple cutting-edge methods (multiple forms of genome-wide sequencing, combining new and published data across species, applying new forms of bioinformatic analysis, and targeted epigenome editing) to repeatedly and convincingly demonstrate these waves of chromatin remodeling and transcription. The figures and visual representations of data in particular set a new standard for the field. Although several findings within this paper are not novel, this paper ties previous findings all together in one place and goes on to show potential relevance for neuropsychiatric disorders beyond basic cellular neuroscience. The conclusions are mostly supported by the data.</p>
<p>Results and conclusions that would benefit from clarification/extension.</p>
<p>
1. Throughout the paper, the authors emphasize a &quot;temporal decoupling&quot; of transcriptional and chromatin response to depolarization, based on a lack of significant chromatin changes at 1h, despite IEG transcription. However, previous publications show significant chromatin remodeling at 1h (e.g. Su et al., NN 2017 in adult dentate gyrus) or 2h (Kim et al., Nature 2010; Malik et al., NN 2014 in cultured embryonic cortical neurons). The discussion briefly mentions this contrast, but it remains difficult to conclude decisively whether there is temporal decoupling when such decoupling is not found consistently. If one is to make broad conclusions about basic neural chromatin response to depolarization, it would be ideal to know under which conditions there is temporal decoupling, or if this is a region-specific phenomenon.</p>
<p>2. The UMAP analysis is a novel way to probe transcription factor enrichment, but it's unclear what this is actually showing. The authors sought to ask whether &quot;DARs could be separated based on transcription factor motifs in these regions.&quot; However, the motifs present in any genomic stretch are fixed based on genomic sequence, so it seems like this analysis might be asking whether certain motifs are more likely to be physically clustered together in the genome, in activity-regulated regions (rather than certain transcription factors acting in concert, as is implied in discussion). While still potentially interesting, this analysis does not seem to give much additional insight into activity-dependent chromatin remodeling beyond the motif enrichment analysis already performed. Nevertheless, to draw stronger conclusions, it would be necessary to compare clustering to a random set of genomic regions of the same length/size to interpret the clustering here. It would also be useful to know whether the ISL1 motif is also enriched in ubiquitously accessible genomic regions in the striatum (and not just DARs).</p>
<p>3. The authors identify late-response gene enhancers by 3 criteria. However, only Pdyn was highlighted thereafter. How many putative DARs met these three criteria in striatum? Only Pdyn?</p>
