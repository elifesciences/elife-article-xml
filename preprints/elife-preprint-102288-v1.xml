<title>Abstract</title><p>Membrane-bound pyrophosphatases (mPPases) are homodimeric proteins that hydrolyse pyrophosphate and pump H<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> across membranes. They are crucial for the virulence of protist pathogens, making them attractive drug targets. In this study, we investigate the inhibitory effects of seven distinct bisphosphonates against <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> mPPase to explore their mode of action and assist in future small molecule inhibitor development. We solved two structures of mPPase bound to the inhibitors in the enzyme active sites and probed the conformational dynamics of mPPase under multiple inhibitors and functionally relevant conditions by double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy. We found that mPPase adopts five distinct conformations within the ensemble in the presence of different inhibitors. Combined with solid-supported membrane-based electrophysiology recordings, this revealed that during catalysis, one monomer of the dimer remains open, and Na<sup>+</sup> can only be pumped in a closed state. These results further support the existence of catalytic asymmetry in our pumping-before-hydrolysis model.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Membrane-bound pyrophosphatases (mPPases) facilitate the transport of protons and/or sodium ions across membranes while catalysing the breakdown of pyrophosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>), a by-product generated in various cellular synthetic reactions - into inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>). These enzymes are found in plants, certain species of bacteria, protist parasites, and archaea, but are absent from multicellular animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Within these organisms, mPPases are essential for cell survival under diverse stress conditions such as osmotic stress, mineral deficiency, and extreme temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Based on their potassium dependency, mPPases are divided into two families: K<sup>+</sup>-dependent and K<sup>+</sup>-independent. While K<sup>+</sup>-independent mPPases all transport H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-dependent mPPases can transport H<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, or both<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Currently, mPPase structures from three different organisms have been reported: <italic>Vigna radiata (</italic>VrPPase), <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> (TmPPase), and, most recently, a structure from <italic>Pyrobaculum aerophilum</italic> (PaPPase) in complex with imidodiphosphate (IDP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. For TmPPase, several different structural states have been determined, including the resting state (TmPPase:Ca:Mg)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, with two phosphates bound (TmPPase:2P<sub>i</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, IDP bound (TmPPase:IDP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, IDP and <italic>N</italic>-[(2-amino-6-benzothiazolyl)methyl]-1<italic>H</italic>-indole-2-carboxamide (ATC) bound (TmPPase:IDP:ATC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, phosphate analogue (WO<sub>4</sub>)-bound (TmPPase:WO<sub>4</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and time-resolved X-ray diffraction structures (with and without substrate/product bound) showing structural asymmetry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Similarly, VrPPase has been solved in multiple states, including IDP-bound (VrPPase:IDP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, single phosphate-bound (VrPPase:P<sub>i</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, two phosphates bound (VrPPase:2P<sub>i</sub>), and different mutations at the hydrophobic gate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. These structures show that mPPases are homodimeric enzymes, with each monomer consisting of 16 transmembrane helices (TMHs), occasionally 17 TMHs as found in the sequence databases, organised into two concentric rings: the inner ring (TMH5-6, 11-12, and 15-16) and the outer ring (TMH1-4, 7-10, and 13-14). Each monomer consists of four regions: a hydrolytic centre, a coupling funnel, an ion gate, and an exit channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To simplify residue comparison between mPPases, we employ the residue numbering scheme XÎ£<sup>Y.Z</sup> (superscripts refer to BallesterosâWeinstein numbering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>), where X represents the amino acid, Î£ denotes the amino acid position in TmPPase, Y indicates the helix number, and Z specifies the offset of amino acid positions within the centrally conserved residues of the helix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>mPPases are a promising drug target for treating diseases caused by parasitic protists, such as malaria and leishmaniasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Among the currently available compounds, ATC demonstrates the most effective inhibitory activity against TmPPase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. ATC is bound to a region near the enzyme exit channel of one subunit, which induces structural asymmetry in the mPPase dimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Functional asymmetry in K<sup>+</sup>-dependent mPPases has also previously been shown by Artukka, et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Anashkin and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> further supported this hypothesis by analysing the inhibition of <italic>Desulfitobacterium hafniense</italic> mPPase using three non-hydrolysable PP<sub>i</sub> analogues (IDP, etidronate (ETD), and aminomethane bisphosphonate). Bisphosphonates, such as risedronate (RSD) and pamidronate (PMD), serve as primary drugs currently used to combat osteoclast-mediated bone loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Unlike IDP, which contains a P-N-P bond, bisphosphonates have a P-C-P bond, with its central carbon can accommodate up to two substituents, allowing a large compound variability. Therefore, understanding their inhibition mechanism on mPPases is crucial for developing future small molecule inhibitors.</p>
<p>Our previous work on serial time-resolved X-ray crystallography and electrometric studies on TmPPase showed a direct observation of structural asymmetry, where two monomers are in different states during PP<sub>i</sub> hydrolysis upon the addition of substrate and Na<sup>+</sup>, supporting a âpumping-before-hydrolysisâ energy coupling model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. However, except for the allosteric inhibitor ATC, which binds to a region near the exit channel, crystal structures of TmPPase bound to inhibitors at the active site are symmetric. In order to probe the proposed asymmetry caused by the inhibitor (and substrate) binding in solution, we employed double electron-electron resonance (DEER), also known as pulsed electron double resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy. This method relies on the introduction of spin labels on selected protein sites, allowing for precise determination of inter-spin distances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, making it a powerful tool for probing the conformation and dynamics of integral membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, including ion channels, transporters, outer membrane proteins, and receptors in their native environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. As an ensemble technique, DEER can probe the presence of multiple conformational species in solution including lowly populated protein states, which are key to the protein function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Here, we solved two TmPPase structures in complex with ETD and zoledronate (ZLD) and monitored their conformational ensemble using DEER spectroscopy in solution. Overall, bisphosphonates can trigger conformational changes in the active site and near the exit channel of TmPPase in an asymmetric mode and under certain inhibitor-bound conditions, the DEER data correlate with the expected distances of an open/closed asymmetric model, consistent with the corresponding X-ray structures. This, along with our electrometric studies detecting the Na<sup>+</sup> signal across the membrane, further suggests that ion pumping requires a fully closed state of one TmPPase monomer, supporting our pumping-before-hydrolysis model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Bisphosphonates are weaker TmPPase inhibitors than IDP</title>
<p>Bisphosphonates have been shown to inhibit mPPases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. To understand their binding mechanism to TmPPase, we first assessed the binding ability of seven distinct bisphosphonates to TmPPase by testing their inhibitory activity using the molybdenum blue assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), with IDP (IC<sub>50</sub> = 56.4 Â± 5.4 ÂµM) as a positive control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Of the compounds tested, all the straight-chain primary amines had similar IC<sub>50</sub>s, ranging from 117 to 138 ÂµM (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06). Substituting the -NH- of IDP with the âCCH<sub>3</sub>(OH)â of ETD resulted in a significantly weaker IC<sub>50</sub> (&gt; 200 ÂµM). Similarly, branched aliphatic and aromatic bisphosphonates (ibandronate (IBD), ZLD and RSD) also showed weaker inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 200 ÂµM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV1</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that the binding of bisphosphonates to TmPPase induces conformational changes in the protein structure, we incubated the enzyme with the inhibitors and performed an <italic>N</italic>-ethyl maleimide (NEM) modification assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. NEM covalently binds to exposed cysteine residues of the protein, forming a carbon-sulfur bond that can inhibit the protein activity if the residue is essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. IDP has been reported to prevent the NEM modification of cysteine by retaining TmPPase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In the absence of inhibitors, NEM modification resulted in a decrease in TmPPase activity by approximately 40% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), similar to the activity reduction observed with CaCl<sub>2</sub>, an inhibitor that binds to the open form of TmPPase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Upon the addition of IDP, TmPPase adopts a closed conformation, rendering it resistant to NEM modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV2</xref>); consequently, the enzyme remains largely unaffected by NEM. Although not as effective as IDP, all bisphosphonates prevent NEM modification to a comparable extent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>TmPPase structures in complex with bisphosphonate inhibitors</title>
<p>To decipher the structural basis of bisphosphonates inhibition and their binding to TmPPase, we decided to solve their structures since all the bisphosphonates bound to TmPPase despite not being isosteres of PP<sub>i</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We obtained protein crystals for all the inhibitors, but they diffracted weakly, except for TmPPase in complex with ETD (TmPPase:ETD) and ZLD (TmPPase:ZLD), which diffracted to resolutions of 3.2 Ã and 3.3 Ã, respectively. TmPPase:ETD crystallised in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is a well-known mPPase inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, while TmPPase:ZLD crystallised without Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Both data sets were anisotropic as analysed using the STARANISO server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). We solved both structures by molecular replacement using the resting state structure (PDB ID: 4AV3) as the search model for TmPPase:ETD and the closed IDP-bound structure (PDB ID: 5LZQ) for TmPPase:ZLD. There were two molecules in the asymmetric unit for TmPPase:ETD and four for TmPPase:ZLD.</p>
<p>In the initial round of the refinement for the TmPPase:ETD structure, both chains displayed positive (F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub>) density at 3<italic>Ï</italic> in their hydrolytic centres that could accommodate ETD (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figs. EV3A-B</xref>, <italic>upper left panel</italic>). We also observed extra density that corresponds to a calcium ion in the resting state structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figs. EV3A,B</xref>, <italic>upper left panel</italic>). Due to the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (0.2 M) in the crystallisation condition, we placed the same ion at this position. After placing Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and water molecules in the difference density peaks, further rounds of refinement provided us with a reasonable 2mF<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> density map in the active site of both monomers (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV3A,B</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>) and the POLDER (Omit) maps indicate a good fit of the compound to the density (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV3A,B</xref><italic>, bottom left panel</italic>). Finally, the TmPPase:ETD structure was refined to an average resolution of 3.2 Ã (h = 3.1 Ã, k = 3.6 Ã, l = 4.3 Ã) with the final R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> of 27.2% / 31.0 % (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Asymmetry in the TmPPase complex with etidronate</title>
<p>Unlike the fully-open TmPPase:Ca:Mg structure (PDB ID: 4AV3), we observed additional density above the hydrolytic centre in both chains that could be fitted with several residues of loop5-6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV5</xref>).

In the IDP-bound structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, these loops interact with IDP and form a tightly packed structured lid over the active site. However, in the TmPPase:ETD structure, despite interacting with ETD in both chains, these loops are positioned slightly above the active site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>), with loop5-6 of chain A extending more toward the centre compared to loop5-6 of chain B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Structural alignment between chain A and B of TmPPase:ETD yields a root mean square deviation (RMSD) per C<italic>Î±</italic> of 1.44 Ã, approximately four times higher than the RMSD between chain A and B in the resting state (RMSD/CÎ±= 0.39 Ã) (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Despite the overall structural similarity, further comparison between the monomers of TmPPase:ETD and those in the resting state reveals that chain B of TmPPase:ETD differs most from TmPPase:ETD chain A and from both chains in the resting state structure (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Notably, there are clear differences on the cytoplasmic (hydrolytic) side between the monomers of TmPPase:ETD; chain B adopts a slightly more constricted conformation compared to chain A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Bendix analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> showed that three (TMH11, 12 and 15) out of six inner ring helices of chain B are more curved on the cytoplasmic side, bending towards the active site (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV6</xref>). Besides that, the loops on the cytoplasmic side of chain B (loops11-12, 13-14, and 15-16) appear to be more flexible, as indicated by more unresolved residues, compared to those in chain A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These observations suggest structural asymmetry between chains A and B in the TmPPase:ETD structure.</p>
<p>The structural asymmetry arises due to differences in the orientation of ETD within each monomer at the active site. ETD comprises two phosphonate groups separated by a central carbon bonded to a hydroxyl group. Compared to the IDP location in the IDP-bound structure, ETDs are positioned above the IDP site, with the lower phosphonate group of ETDs located in the position of the upper (leaving-group) phosphonate group of IDP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, the upper phosphonate group of ETDs in chains A (ETD<sub>A</sub>) and B (ETD<sub>B</sub>) is distinctly positioned; ETD<sub>A</sub> is tilted approximately by 35.9Â° relative to the IDP orientation, while ETD<sub>B</sub> is relatively parallel to the IDP orientation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The lower phosphonate group position remains the same for both ETDs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). As a result, loop5-6 of the two monomers is oriented differently. In chain A, this loop protrudes towards the active centre and interacts with ETD<sub>A</sub> <italic>via</italic> E217<sup>5.76</sup> mediated by a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, while in chain B, the loop is more constricted and interacts with ETD<sub>B</sub> <italic>via</italic> D218<sup>5.77</sup>, also mediated by a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Furthermore, ETD<sub>A</sub> and ETD<sub>B</sub> interact with the active site <italic>via</italic> different residues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). D465<sup>11.57</sup>, D488<sup>12.39</sup> and N492<sup>12.43</sup> in TMH11 and TMH12 were involved in the interaction with ETD<sub>B</sub> <italic>via</italic> a water molecule. Consequently, these two TMHs undergo slight inward movement, resulting in a more constricted conformation of chain B. Nonetheless, the methyl group of ETDs in both chains points towards TMH12 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,D</xref>), which might prevent complete closure of the hydrolytic centre and downward motion of TMH12.</p>

<title>Structural distinction between zoledronate and IDP-bound TmPPase</title>
<p>In contrast to the TmPPase:ETD structure, the TmPPase:ZLD structure adopts a closed conformation, The overall structure is more similar to the IDP-bound structure (RMSD/CÎ± of 0.760 Ã) than the resting state structure (RMSD/CÎ± of 2.32 Ã) (Table. S2). However, compared to the IDP-bound structure, the TmPPase:ZLD structure exhibits noticeable movements in three of six inner ring helices (TMH11, 12 and 15) and seven of ten outer ring helices (TMH1-4 and 7-9). These movements extend outwards from the hydrolytic centre (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), leaving it not fully closed. A cross-sectional view confirms this observation, showing the tunnel extending from the hydrolytic centre to the enzyme opening, which is closed in the IDP-bound structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). This is because ZLD is bulkier than IDP due to the presence of the heteroaryl group, which points towards TMH11, 12, and 15 on the cytoplasmic side.</p>

<title>Exit channel and active site lid movements</title>
<p>The X-ray structures of TmPPase with the different inhibitors bound to the active site show either a closed, resting or asymmetric (TmPPase:ETD, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) conformation. The asymmetric structure of the TmPPase with ETD is unique and similar to that observed in our recent time-resolved study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To probe the TmPPase conformational ensemble in solution under various inhibitor-bound conditions, we employed DEER spectroscopy. We selected two distinctive sites on TmPPase (S525 and T211), which were mutated to cysteine and selectively spin-labelled with 2,5-dihydro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3- [[(methylsulfonyl)thio]methyl]-1<italic>H</italic>-pyrrol-1-yloxy (MTSSL, modification is denoted as R1 hereafter) to enable the measurement of interspin distances between the spin-labelled residue pairs. The selected sites were located on the exit channel (S525R1) and the enzyme entrance (T211R1) to capture any conformational changes occurring in the protein on either side of the membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV8A</xref>) without interfering with the activity of TmPPase. For both TmPPase sites, high mPPase spin labelling efficiency was achieved with no non-specific MTSSL being present, as evidenced by the continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW EPR) spectra recorded at room temperature (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV9</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. From the CW EPR spectral lineshapes (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV9</xref>), which relate to the rotation correlation time of the spin label, we observed that T211R1 showed high spin label mobility in the conditions tested (apo, +ETD, and +IDP), while S525R1 had intermediate to low spin label mobility in the conditions tested (apo, +Ca, +Ca/ETD and +ETD). This is consistent with spin-labelled sites on integral membrane proteins of variable dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Unlike DEER, which provides insights into the conformational state of membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, CW EPR offers information on the local environment of the spin label.

<p>In addition, we generated <italic>in silico</italic> distance distribution predictions for the two sites (S525R1 and T211R1) using MtsslWizard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and based on the X-ray structures of TmPPase with different molecules bound (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV8</xref>). In the case of T211R1, the X-ray electron density in loop<sub>A</sub>5-6 of the TmPPase:ETD (residues V208<sup>5.67</sup>-L215<sup>5.74</sup>: VGKTELNL) and TmPPase:Ca (residues T211<sup>5.70</sup>-R221<sup>6.28</sup>: TELNLPEDDPR) structures is missing, suggesting a highly dynamic or disordered state for this region. We therefore modelled this protein region using the Rosetta server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and generated <italic>in silico</italic> distance distributions based on the X-ray structures. These were overlaid with the experimentally derived DEER distance distributions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV8D</xref>) for comparison. The S525R1 dimer yielded high-quality DEER traces, allowing us to resolve the distance differences between the inhibitor conditions probed. Under all tested conditions, strong oscillations were observed in the raw DEER data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) indicating that the shifts observed in the state populations within the TmPPase ensemble are highly reliable. Both DeerAnalysis and ComparativeDeerAnalyser were used for background correction of the DEER traces and their results are in agreement (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV8B</xref>).</p>
<p>The separation of S525R1 in the <italic>apo</italic> state (with no Ca<sup>2+</sup> or inhibitor added) is broad with a mean distance of 3.8 nm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the distance distribution shifts towards shorter distances, suggesting that the two monomers come closer at the periplasmic side, and consistent with the predicted distances derived from the TmPPase:Ca structure. In the presence of both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ETD (+Ca/ETD), we observe an increase in the mean distance distribution to 3.7 nm, consistent with the predicted distance for the TmPPase:ETD structure (which corresponds to the +Ca/ETD condition). Finally, in the presence of ETD but no Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the experimental distance between the loops on the different monomers increases to 4.0 nm. Although these changes are small, they are significant. They can be seen in both the time domain data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) and resulting distances (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The reference black dashed lines depicted for the <italic>apo</italic> state, highlight these subtle changes in the background corrected time traces. More substantial changes occur with the addition of IDP with a mean of the resulting distance distribution at 4.2 nm, which is the longest distance recorded for the S525R1 pair in solution. In contrast, the addition of ZLD results in the shortest distances we observed by DEER under the conditions tested, with a mean of the distance distribution of 3.4 nm. Remarkably, this differs substantially from the <italic>in silico</italic> distance distribution predicted from the X-ray structure of TmPPase:ZLD (4.3 nm), which is expected to be identical to that of TmPPase:IDP (RMSD/CÎ± = 0.571 Ã) (see Discussion).</p>
<p>Unlike S525R1, distance distributions for T211R1 derived from the DEER time traces are broad for all conditions tested (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV8D</xref>). This is evidenced by the lack of oscillations in the raw DEER data (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV8B</xref>), which further supports the highly dynamic nature of the labelling site located on loop<sub>A</sub>5-6. The lack of electron density in the respective X-ray structures is due to flexibility, also consistent with the high mobility recorded in our CW EPR spectra at room temperature (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV9A</xref>). DeerAnalysis and ComparativeDeerAnalyzer are in close agreement, as in the case of S525R1 (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV10</xref>). For <italic>apo</italic> and +Ca/ETD in particular, traces were collected for longer time windows to resolve longer distances for the T211R1 pair (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV8B</xref>). The broad distance distributions suggest the conformational flexibility of T211R1 (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV8C</xref>). The <italic>apo</italic>, +Ca and +Ca/ETD conditions all appear highly similar, while the obtained distributions for +ETD and +IDP have larger contributions from shorter distances within their conformational ensembles. Finally, TmPPase incubated with ZLD (TmPPase+ZLD) in solution appears to have longer distances, contrasting with predictions derived from the TmPPase:ZLD structure.</p>
<p>Collectively, periplasmic S525R1 allows for robust quantitative interpretations of the conformational transitions TmPPase undergoes under different conditions. T211R1 presents a highly dynamic site with less defined oscillations in the DEER traces. However, the overall transitions suggested by T211R1 agree qualitatively with conformational changes informed by the S525R1 pair: upon substrate/inhibitor binding, the T211R1 pair moves closer while the S525R1 pair distance increases.</p>
<p>Based on the DEER data on the IDP-bound TmPPase, we observed significant deviations between the experimental and the <italic>in silico</italic> distances derived from the TmPPase:IDP X-ray structure for both cytoplasmic- (T211R1) and periplasmic-end (S525R1) sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV8D</xref>). This deviation could be explained by the dimer adopting an asymmetric conformation under the physiological conditions used for DEER, with one monomer in a closed state and the other in an open state. To model this asymmetric arrangement, we combined chain A of the TmPPase:Ca structure with chain B of the TmPPase:IDP structure, <italic>i.e.</italic> TmPPase:Ca(A)_IDP(B), and predicted its <italic>in silico</italic> distance distribution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Remarkably, the derived asymmetric model predicts a distance distribution that agrees closely with the experimental DEER distance distribution obtained for S525R in solution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). This predicted distribution also falls between the two conformational extremes of TmPPase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Effect of ETD and ZLD on sodium transport of TmPPase</title>
<p>Previously, we showed that IDP can facilitate a single Na<sup>+</sup> pumping cycle without hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To investigate whether pumping also occurs in the presence of ETD and ZLD, we recorded electrometric data during PP<sub>i</sub> hydrolysis and after binding of IDP, ETD and ZLD. In electrometric measurements, also known as solid-supported membrane-based electrophysiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, a current signal is generated and recorded when Na<sup>+</sup> is transported across the membrane by the active reconstituted TmPPase.

Most of the signal decayed within 1 second after K<sub>4</sub>PP<sub>i</sub> was supplied. Full signal recovery required several minutes before a repeat measurement could be performed on the same sensor. As expected, when 200 Î¼M K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> was added as a negative control, there was no signal, indicating that no ion pumping had occurred. Replacing the substrate with IDP resulted in a signal about half that of K<sub>4</sub>PP<sub>i</sub>.

<p>This observation is consistent with the TmPPase:ETD and TmPPase:ZLD structures, which show the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> density in the ion gate. Interestingly, in all the solved TmPPase structures, Na<sup>+</sup> at the ion gate has only been observed in the IDP-bound structures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-E</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV7</xref>). In the IDP-bound structure, four key residues (D703<sup>16.46</sup>, D243<sup>6.50</sup>, S247<sup>6.54</sup> and E246<sup>6.53</sup>) in the ion gate constitute the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). The formation of the site is driven by the downward motion of TMH16 (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV7A</xref>), transitioning from the resting state (TmPPase:Ca) to the closed state (TmPPase:IDP). The orientation of D703<sup>16.46</sup> of the TmPPase:ETD structure resembles the structure of TmPPase:Ca, rotated away from the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site, causing a loss of Na<sup>+</sup> binding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B,C</xref>). In the TmPPase:ZLD structure, D703<sup>16.46</sup> and K707<sup>16.50</sup> are oriented relatively similarly to the Na<sup>+</sup> binding position in the TmPPase:IDP structure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6D,E</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV7C</xref>), but no Na<sup>+</sup> density was observed despite the higher resolution compared to the TmPPase:IDP structure (3.26 Ã compared to 3.5 Ã for the IDP-bound structure). This might be because the inhibitor restricts the complete closure of the active site and full constriction and downward movement of the inner helices (especially TMH12 and 16) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref>), which hinder the Na<sup>+</sup> pumping.</p>

<title>Catalytic asymmetry in mPPase</title>
<p>Some evidence for asymmetry in mPPase gating has been shown previously by kinetic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and captured in the time-resolved 600s and 3600s structures of TmPPase:PP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, where in both structures, one chain is in the open state and the other is in the closed state. Our new structures, together with DEER distance measurements that monitor the conformational ensemble equilibrium of TmPPase in solution, provide further solid experimental evidence of asymmetry in gating and transitional changes upon substrate/inhibitor binding.</p>
<p>In our study, the TmPPase:ETD structure captured the asymmetric binding of ETD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Loop5-6, which interact with ETD, moves inward to close the active site, but not as deeply as in the TmPPase:IDP structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). Here, ETD is positioned<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> above the hydrolytic centre (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), unable to descend further due to occupation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the active site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,D</xref>), as in the TmPPase:Ca structure (PDB ID: 4AV3). This is supported by our DEER data recorded in solution, which showed an enhancement of the longer distance distribution components of T211R1 when comparing the +ETD-only to the +Ca/ETD condition (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. EV8D</xref>), indicating a semi-closed conformation. While in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the loops move closer together. Due to the different orientations of ETD in the two monomers, the orientations of loop5-6 differ as well (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). Nevertheless, the TmPPase:ETD structure can be considered as a snapshot transition between the <italic>apo</italic> structure (TmPPase:0-60s, PDB: 8B21), where no substrate is bound, and the TmPPase:600s structure (PDB: 8B23), where the PP<sub>i</sub> has bound to one chain and descended to the hydrolytic centre. On the other hand, the TmPPase:ZLD structure, while resembling the IDP-bound structure, is more open (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and ZLD is positioned about 1.0 Ã above the IDP position in the hydrolytic centre (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Based on these observations, and the DEER data for +IDP, which is consistent with an asymmetric conformation of TmPPase being present in solution, we propose five distinct models of TmPPase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). All these models involve one monomer in an open/resting state, while the other is constrained upon the binding of the substrate/inhibitors. Model 1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), where both monomers are in the resting state as in the TmPPase:Ca structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, displays both active sites in an open conformation. In model 2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), one active site is semi-closed, while the other remains open. This is supported by the distance distributions for S525R1 and T211R1 for +Ca/ETD informed by DEER, which agrees with the <italic>in silico</italic> distance predictions generated by the asymmetric TmPPase:ETD X-ray structure.</p>

</fig>
<p>While models 1 and 2 differ at the active site, the DEER distance distributions recorded for the S525R1 pair in the near exit channel are highly similar (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, models 1 and 2). However, in the presence of ZLD, and as seen in model 3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), the mean of the DEER distance distribution for S525R1 is shifted towards shorter distances (3.4 nm), while the active site (T211R1) retains the configuration observed in model 2. This might be because, although ZLD can enter the active site, its bulky heteroaryl group prevents the complete closure of the active site and restricts the full downward movement of TMH12 and TMH16. This likely prevents the formation of the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site, leading to the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> in the TmPPase:ZLD structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and the lack of Na<sup>+</sup> signal in the electrometric measurement (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Among all conditions tested, the DEER distance distributions of IDP-bound TmPPase exhibit the longest distances recorded for the periplasmic S525R1 site, but the shortest for the cytoplasmic T211R1 site. This suggests that the binding of IDP to TmPPase induces the closure of the active site and the full downward movement of TMH12 and TMH16, in line with the IDP-bound TmPPase structure. However, the DEER distance distributions obtained in solution for both S525R1 and T211R1 fall in between the extreme modelled distances seen in the X-ray structures. This is due to the presence of an asymmetric conformation between the two monomers, consistent with the asymmetric binding model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, model 4,5), where IDP (and similarly for ETD without Ca<sup>2+</sup> present) binds only to one monomer, as in the hybrid structure TmPPase:Ca(A)_IDP(B) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>These models further confirm structural and functional studies showing the asymmetry in the catalysis of TmPPase. Together with our previous time-resolved structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, they complement the ensemble of conformational changes during the reaction steps.</p>

<title>Sodium ion pumping in TmPPase</title>
<p>In a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, we found that the single turnover event of Na<sup>+</sup> pumping only occurs in the presence of IDP. In our current Nanion SURFE<sup>2</sup>R experiment, upon the addition of ETD and ZLD, we did not observe Na<sup>+</sup> pumping (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), consistent with ETD and ZLD bound structures where no Na<sup>+</sup> was observed at the ion gate.</p>
<p>We proposed that the motion of TMH12 and the communication network from TMH5 to TMH13 and TMH10 are key parts of intra-subunit communication between the two monomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Loop12-13, where the S525R1 site is located, can be used to monitor the motion of TMH12. The mean distance for the S525R1 distribution in the <italic>apo</italic> state is shorter compared with the IDP bound state (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). However, in the presence of ZLD, the distances for S525R1 are even shorter than in <italic>apo</italic>, contradicting our initial prediction of having similar distances to the IDP bound state. This suggests that in solution, the exit channel of the ZLD-bound TmPPase can adopt a conformation that resembles the <italic>apo</italic> state, even though its active site is similar to the IDP-bound condition. This may explain why TmPPase is unable to pump Na<sup>+</sup> upon the addition of ZLD. We suggest that while IDP constrain the conformation of one subunit to a closed state as in model 4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) and facilitate single turnover events of Na<sup>+</sup> transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, ZLD and ETD restrict the conformation of one subunit to an intermediate state as in models 3 and 5 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), which is unable to facilitate Na<sup>+</sup> transport.</p>
<p>In summary, EPR experiments in solution, coupled with new structures of inhibited forms of TmPPase, reveal that TmPPase binds inhibitors asymmetrically, forming open-closed states, where one monomer is in the inhibitor (IDP, ETD, ZLD) bound state and the other monomer is in the open state, consistent with half-of-the-sites-reactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In future studies, we could use time-resolved DEER in complex with the substrate to explore, for example, how and in what order the release of phosphate products and ions leads to conformational changes in the active sites, exit channels, and communication between subunits, capturing further details during the reaction steps.</p>

<p>For EPR spectroscopy measurements, residue S525, located in the periplasmic loop12-13 of the TmPPase exit channel, was mutated to cysteine and covalently modified with a methanethiosulfonate thiol-specific spin label (MTSSL) to introduce a paramagnetic centre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> (the labelled protein is referred to as S525R1).

The resultant background correction was then validated using a module for validation implemented in DA. The validation was carried out after initial Tikhonov regularisation, varying the background start time from 5% to 80% of the respective time windows of the cut data for 16 trials. From this, the raw data were re-loaded and processed (Tikhonov regularisation) with the cutoff and background start time as established from the first round of validation. Resulting data are taken for plotting figures showing raw data/background and form factor/fit. This is the starting point for a full validation, where the background start time was again varied from 5% to 80% of the time window for 16 trials, as well as some added &quot;white noise&quot; with a level of 1.50 for 50 trials. The result of validation was pruned and used for plotting the distance distribution and confidence interval.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Crystallographic analysis revealed the asymmetric conformation of the dimer in the inhibitor-bound state. Based on this result, which is consistent with previous time-resolved analysis, authors verified the dynamics and distance between spin introduced label by DEER spectroscopy in solution and predicted possible patterns of asymmetric dimer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Crystal structures with inhibitor bound provide detailed coordination in the binding pocket thus useful information for the PPase field and maybe for drug development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The distance information measured by DEER is advantageous for verifying the dynamics and structure of membrane protein in solution. However, regarding T211 data, which, as the authors themselves stated, lacks measurement precision, it is unclear for readers how confident one can judge the conclusion leading from these data for the cytoplasmic side.</p>
<p>The distance information for the luminal site, which the authors claim is more accurate, does not indicate either the possibility or the basis for why it is the ensemble of two components and not simply a structure with a shorter distance than the crystal structure.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Membrane-bound pyrophosphatases (mPPases) are homodimeric proteins that hydrolyze pyrophosphate and pump H+/Na+ across membranes. They are attractive drug targets against protist pathogens. Non-hydrolysable PPi analogue bisphosphonates such as risedronate (RSD) and pamidronate (PMD) serve as primary drugs currently used. Bisphosphonates have a P-C-P bond, with its central carbon can accommodate up to two substituents, allowing a large compound variability. Here the authors solved two TmPPase structures in complex with the bisphosphonates etidronate (ETD) and zoledronate (ZLD) and monitored their conformational ensemble using DEER spectroscopy in solution. These results reveal the inhibition mechanism of these compounds, which is crucial for developing future small molecule inhibitors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors show that seven different bisphosphonates can inhibit TmPPase with IC50 values in the micromolar range. Branched aliphatic and aromatic modifications showed weaker inhibition.</p>
<p>High-resolution structures for TmPPase with ETD (3.2 Ã) and ZLD (3.3 Ã) are determined. These structures reveal the binding mode and shed light on the inhibition mechanism. The nature of modification on the bisphosphonate alters the conformation of the binding pocket.</p>
<p>The conformational heterogeneity is further investigated using DEER spectroscopy under several conditions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors observed asymmetry in the TmPPase-ELD structure above the hydrolytic center. The structural asymmetry arises due to differences in the orientation of ETD within each monomer at the active site. As a result, loop5-6 of the two monomers is oriented differently, resulting in the observed asymmetry. The authors attempt to further establish this asymmetry using DEER spectroscopy experiments. However, the (over)interpretation of these data leads to more confusion than any further understanding. DEER data suggest that the asymmetry observed in the TmPPase-ELD structure in this region might be funneled from the broad conformational space under the crystallization conditions.</p>
<p>DEER data for position T211R1 at the enzyme entrance reveal a highly flexible conformation of loop5-6 (and do not provide any direct evidence for asymmetry, Figure EV8). Similarly, data for position S521R1 near the exit channel do not directly support the proposed asymmetry for ETD. Despite the high quality of the data, they reveal a very similar distance distribution. The reported changes in distances are very small (+/- 0.3 nm), which can be accommodated by a change of spin label rotamer distribution alone. Further, these spin labels are located on a flexible loop, thereby making it difficult to directly relate any distance changes to the global conformation.</p>
<p>The interpretations listed below are not supported by the data presented:</p>
<p>(1) 'In the presence of Ca2+, the distance distribution shifts towards shorter distances, suggesting that the two monomers come closer at the periplasmic side, and consistent with the predicted distances derived from the TmPPase:Ca structure.'</p>
<p>Problem: This is a far-stretched interpretation of a tiny change, which is not reliable for the reasons described in the paragraph above.</p>
<p>(2) 'Based on the DEER data on the IDP-bound TmPPase, we observed significant deviations between the experimental and the in silico distances derived from the TmPPase:IDP X-ray structure for both cytoplasmic- (T211R1) and periplasmic-end (S525R1) sites (Figure 4D and Figure EV8D). This deviation could be explained by the dimer adopting an asymmetric conformation under the physiological conditions used for DEER, with one monomer in a closed state and the other in an open state.'</p>
<p>Problem: The authors are trying to establish asymmetry using the DEER data. Unfortunately, no significant difference is observed (between simulation and experiment) for position 525 as the authors claim (Figure 4D bottom panel). The observed difference for position 112 must be accounted for by the flexibility and the data provide no direct evidence for any asymmetry.</p>
<p>(3) 'Our new structures, together with DEER distance measurements that monitor the conformational ensemble equilibrium of TmPPase in solution, provide further solid experimental evidence of asymmetry in gating and transitional changes upon substrate/inhibitor binding.'</p>
<p>Problem: See above. The DEER data do not support any asymmetry.</p>
<p>(4) Based on these observations, and the DEER data for +IDP, which is consistent with an asymmetric conformation of TmPPase being present in solution, we propose five distinct models of TmPPase (Figure 7).</p>
<p>Problem: Again, the DEER data do not support any asymmetry and the authors may revisit the proposed models.</p>
<p>(5) 'In model 2 (Figure 7), one active site is semi-closed, while the other remains open. This is supported by the distance distributions for S525R1 and T211R1 for +Ca/ETD informed by DEER, which agrees with the in silico distance predictions generated by the asymmetric TmPPase:ETD X-ray structure'</p>
<p>Problem: Neither convincing nor supported by the data</p>

Likewise, the authors choose to focus the spectroscopy experiments on these weaker binders, missing an opportunity to provide insight into the interaction between more potent binders and the protein.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer concern regarding the choice of weaker inhibitors. We attempted co-crystallization with all available inhibitors, including those with higher potency. However, despite numerous efforts, these potent inhibitors yielded low-resolution crystals, making them unsuitable for detailed structural analysis. Therefore, we chose to focus on the weaker binders, as we were able to obtain high-quality crystal structures for these compounds. This allowed us to perform DEER spectroscopy with the added advantage of accurately analyzing the data against structural models derived from X-ray crystallography. Using these weaker inhibitors enabled a more precise interpretation of the DEER data, thus providing reliable insights into the conformational dynamics and inhibition mechanism. However, as suggested by the reviewer, in the revised version, we will perform DEER analysis on the more potent inhibitors to provide additional insight into their interactions.</p>

<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. The scale of motions seen in this study correspond to those seen in the full panoply of crystal structures of mPPases. Some proteins undergo very large conformational changes during catalysis â such as the rotary ATPase. This one doesnât, meaning that the precise motions we describe are likely to be relevant. Conformational changes in the ensemble, whether large or small, represent essential protein motions which underlie key mPPase catalytic function. Our DEER spectroscopy data demonstrate the sensitivity and resolution necessary to monitor these subtle changes in equilibria, even if these are only a few Angstroms. For several of the conditions we investigated by DEER in solution, corresponding x-ray structures have been solved, with the derived distances agreeing well with the DEER distributions. This further validates the biological relevance of the structures, including serial time-resolved ones that indicate asymmetry.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The ZLD-bound crystal structure doesn't predict the DEER distances, and the conformation of Na+ binding site sidechains in the ZLD structure doesn't predict whether sodium currents occur. This might suggest that the ZLD structure captures a conformation that does not recapitulate what is happening in solution/ a membrane.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that the ZLD-bound crystal structure does not predict the DEER distances. However, we believe this discrepancy arises from the effect of the bulkiness of ZLD inhibitor, which prevents the closure of the hydrolytic centre. Additionally, the absence of Na+ at the ion gate in the ZLD-bound structure suggests that Na+ transport does not occur, a conclusion further supported by our electrometric measurements. We agree with the reviewer, that the distances observed in the DEER experiments might represent a potential new conformation in solution, which may not be captured by the static X-ray structure, thereby offering insights into the dynamic nature of the protein under physiological conditions. Finally, the static x-ray structures have not captured the asymmetric conformations that must exist to explain half-of-the-sites reactivity.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Crystallographic analysis revealed the asymmetric conformation of the dimer in the inhibitor-bound state. Based on this result, which is consistent with previous time-resolved analysis, authors verified the dynamics and distance between spin introduced label by DEER spectroscopy in solution and predicted possible patterns of asymmetric dimer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Crystal structures with inhibitor bound provide detailed coordination in the binding pocket thus useful information for the PPase field and maybe for drug development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The distance information measured by DEER is advantageous for verifying the dynamics and structure of membrane protein in solution. However, regarding T211 data, which, as the authors themselves stated, lacks measurement precision, it is unclear for readers how confident one can judge the conclusion leading from these data for the cytoplasmic side.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the advantageous use of the DEER methodology for identifying dynamic states of membrane proteins in solution. We used two sites in our analysis: S525 (periplasm) and T211 (cytoplasm). As we clearly stated in the original manuscript, S525R1 yielded high-quality DEER data, while T211R1 yielded weak (or no) visual oscillations, leading to broad, though different distributions for the several conditions tested. Our main conclusions are based on the S525R1 data. We included the T211R1 data because, although it does not provide definitive evidence, it <italic>is</italic> consistent with our proposed model and offers additional insights into biologically relevant conditions. Furthermore, the shifts in the centre of mass (Fig EV8D) of the broad T211R1 distributions show a trend that is consistent with our model; although not proving it, it does not exclude it either. Lastly, these data do indeed confirm an important structural feature of mPPase in solution conditions which is the intrinsically high dynamic state of the loop5-6 where T211 is located, and consistent with our previous (Kellosalo <italic>et al</italic>., Science,  2012; Li <italic>et al</italic>., Nat. Commun, 2016; Vidilaseris <italic>et al</italic>., Sci. Adv., 2019; Strauss <italic>et al</italic>., EMBO Rep., 2024) and current x-ray crystallography data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The distance information for the luminal site, which the authors claim is more accurate, does not indicate either the possibility or the basis for why it is the ensemble of two components and not simply a structure with a shorter distance than the crystal structure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this possibility and alternative interpretation of our DEER data. In the revised version, we will show that our DEER data are consistent with (and do not exclude) asymmetry and rephrase to be inclusive of other possibilities. Importantly, this additional possibility does not affect the current interpretation of the data in our manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Membrane-bound pyrophosphatases (mPPases) are homodimeric proteins that hydrolyze pyrophosphate and pump H+/Na+ across membranes. They are attractive drug targets against protist pathogens. Non-hydrolysable PPi analogue bisphosphonates such as risedronate (RSD) and pamidronate (PMD) serve as primary drugs currently used. Bisphosphonates have a P-C-P bond, with its central carbon can accommodate up to two substituents, allowing a large compound variability. Here the authors solved two TmPPase structures in complex with the bisphosphonates etidronate (ETD) and zoledronate (ZLD) and monitored their conformational ensemble using DEER spectroscopy in solution. These results reveal the inhibition mechanism of these compounds, which is crucial for developing future small molecule inhibitors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors show that seven different bisphosphonates can inhibit TmPPase with IC50 values in the micromolar range. Branched aliphatic and aromatic modifications showed weaker inhibition.</p>
<p>High-resolution structures for TmPPase with ETD (3.2 Ã) and ZLD (3.3 Ã) are determined. These structures reveal the binding mode and shed light on the inhibition mechanism. The nature of modification on the bisphosphonate alters the conformation of the binding pocket.</p>
<p>The conformational heterogeneity is further investigated using DEER spectroscopy under several conditions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors observed asymmetry in the TmPPase-ELD structure above the hydrolytic center. The structural asymmetry arises due to differences in the orientation of ETD within each monomer at the active site. As a result, loop5-6 of the two monomers is oriented differently, resulting in the observed asymmetry. The authors attempt to further establish this asymmetry using DEER spectroscopy experiments. However, the (over)interpretation of these data leads to more confusion than any further understanding. DEER data suggest that the asymmetry observed in the TmPPase-ELD structure in this region might be funneled from the broad conformational space under the crystallization conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>See also the response below - We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. The asymmetry was previously established using serial time crystallography (Strauss et al., EMBO Rep, 2024) and biochemical assays (<italic>e.g.</italic> Malinen et al., Prot. Sci., 2022; Artukka et al., Biochem J, 2018; Luoto et al., PNAS, 2013) and also partially seen in one static structure (Vidilaseris <italic>et al.,</italic> Sci Adv 2019). DEER data only show that the previously proposed asymmetry could also be present within the conformational ensemble in solution conditions. Indeed, our data do not (and cannot) exclude this possibility.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>DEER data for position T211R1 at the enzyme entrance reveal a highly flexible conformation of loop5-6 (and do not provide any direct evidence for asymmetry, Figure EV8).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see relevant response above. We acknowledge that T211 is indeed situated on a highly dynamic loop, which is important for gating and our DEER data confirm its high flexibility. Given we have not observed oscillations of this site, leading to broad distributions, we have stated in the original manuscript that we will not establish the presence of any asymmetry in solution on the basis of T211, rather relying on the S525 site, for which we have acquired high-quality DEER data, as was also pointed out and have been commented on by all reviewers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, data for position S521R1 near the exit channel do not directly support the proposed asymmetry for ETD.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer appears to suggest that we hold the S525R1 DEER data as direct proof of asymmetry; this is combative on the grounds that to directly prove asymmetry would require time-resolved DEER measurements, far beyond the scope of this work. Rather, we have applied DEER measurements to explore whether asymmetry (observed previously via time-resolved X-ray crystallography) is also present (or indeed a possibility) in solution. We simply state that the DEER data are consistent with asymmetry (i.e., that the mean distance increases in the presence of ETD compared to the apo-state). This is a restrained interpretation of the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Despite the high quality of the data, they reveal a very similar distance distribution. The reported changes in distances are very small (+/- 0.3 nm), which can be accommodated by a change of spin label rotamer distribution alone. Further, these spin labels are located on a flexible loop, thereby making it difficult to directly relate any distance changes to the global conformation</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for recognising the high quality of our DEER data for the S525R1, where visual oscillations in the raw traces, as in our case, reportedly lead to highly accurate and reliable distributions, able to separate (in fortuitous cases) helical movements of only a few Angstroms. The ability of DEER/PELDOR offering near Angstrom resolution was previously demonstrated by the acquisition and solution of high resolution multi-subunit spin-labelled membrane protein structures (Pliotas at al., PNAS, 2012; Pliotas et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2015; Pliotas, Methods Enzymol, 2017) as well as it ability in detecting small (and of similar to mPPase magnitude) conformational changes in different integral membrane proteins systems (Kapsalis <italic>et al.,</italic> Nature Comms, 2019; Kubatova <italic>et al</italic>., PNAS, 2023; Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>., JACS, 2024; Lane <italic>et al.,</italic> Structure, 2024; Hett <italic>et al</italic>., JACS, 2021; Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., Nature, 2024), occurring under different conditions and/or stimuli in solution and/or lipid environment. The changes here are not very small (e.g. ~ 7 Angstroms between the two mean distance extremes (Ca vs IDP)) for DEERâs proven detection sensitivity, and with all other conditions showing changes between those extremes.</p>
<p>These changes are relatively small, but they are expected for membrane ion pumps. <italic>Indeed, none of the mPPase structures show helical movements of greater than a half a turn, and that only in helices 6 and 12.</italic> There appear to be larger-scale loop closing motions of the 5-6 loop that includes T211, due to the presence of E217 which binds to one of the Mg2+ ions that coordinate the leaving group phosphate. (This is, inter alia, the reason that this loop is so flexible: it can not order before substrate is bound.) Here we have the resolution to detect such subtle differences by DEER, given there are clear shifts in our time domain data and these are reflected in the mean distances in the distributions. Therefore, our study demonstrates the sensitivity and resolution DEER offers in detecting subtle conformational transitions, key in membrane proteins pathways. To further belabour this point, we do not quantify the DEER data (for instance through parametric fitting) to extract populations of different conformational states and we appreciate that to do so would be highly prone to error; however we do (and can, we feel without overinterpretation) assert that the mean distances shift.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The interpretations listed below are not supported by the data presented:</p>
<p>(1) 'In the presence of Ca2+, the distance distribution shifts towards shorter distances, suggesting that the two monomers come closer at the periplasmic side, and consistent with the predicted distances derived from the TmPPase:Ca structure.' Problem: This is a far-stretched interpretation of a tiny change, which is not reliable for the reasons described in the paragraph above.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the authors overall agree with the reviewer assessment that Â±0.3 nm is a small (not a minor) change, there are literature examples quantifying (or using for quantification) distribution peaks separated by similar Îr. (Kubatova <italic>et al</italic>., PNAS, 2023; Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>., JACS, 2024; Hett <italic>et al</italic>., JACS, 2021; Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., Nature, 2024). In particular, none of the mPPase structures show helical movements of greater than a half a turn (in helices 6 and 12 in particular). There appear to be larger-scale loop closing motions of the 5-6 loop that includes T211, due to the presence of E217 which binds to one of the Mg2+ ions that coordinate the leaving group phosphate. (This is, inter alia, the reason that this loop is so flexible: it can not order before substrate is bound.)</p>
<p>Importantly, we have fitted Gaussians to the experimental distance distributions of 525R1 output by the Comparative Deer Analyzer 2.0 and observed a change in the distribution width in presence of Ca2+, implying the rotameric freedom of the spin label is restricted. However, the CW-EPR for 525R1 indicate that the rotational correlation time of the spin label is highly consistent between conditions (the spectra are almost identical); this cannot be explained simply by rotameric preference of the spin label (as asserted by the reviewer 3), as there is no (further) immobilisation observed from the CW-EPR of apo-state (Figure EV9) to that in presence of Ca2+. Furthermore, in the absence of conformational changes, it is reasonable to assume (and demonstrable from the CW-EPR data) that the rotamer cloud should not significantly change between conditions. However, Gaussian fits of the two extreme cases yielding the longest (i.e., in presence of IDP) and shortest (in presence of ZTD) mean distances for the 525R1 DEER data indicated significant (i.e., above the noise floor after Tikhonov validation) probability density for the IDP condition at 50 Ã (P(r) = 0.18). This occurs at four standard deviations above the mean of the ZTD condition, which by random chance should occur with &lt;0.007% probability. Indeed, one can say that to observe 18% probability density at four standard deviations above the mean by random chance would occur on the order of one in 4 x 10^6.</p>
<p>As in previous response the method can detect changes of such magnitude which are not small, but physiologically relevant and expected for integral membrane proteins, such as mPPases. Indeed, even in equal (or more) complex systems such as heptameric mechanosensitive channel proteins DEER provided sub-Angstrom accuracy, when a spin labelled high resolution XRC structure was solved (Pliotas et al., PNAS, 2012; Pliotas et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2015). Despite this is ideal case where DEER accuracy was experimentally validated another high resolution structural method on modified membrane protein and is not very common it demonstrates the power of the method , especially when strong oscillations are present in the raw DEER data (as here for mPPase 525R1), even when multiple distances are present, Angstrom resolution is achievable in such challenging protein classes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) 'Based on the DEER data on the IDP-bound TmPPase, we observed significant deviations between the experimental and the in silico distances derived from the TmPPase:IDP X-ray structure for both cytoplasmic- (T211R1) and periplasmic-end (S525R1) sites (Figure 4D and Figure EV8D). This deviation could be explained by the dimer adopting an asymmetric conformation under the physiological conditions used for DEER, with one monomer in a closed state and the other in an open state.'</p>
<p>Problem: The authors are trying to establish asymmetry using the DEER data. Unfortunately, no significant difference is observed (between simulation and experiment) for position 525 as the authors claim (Figure 4D bottom panel). The observed difference for position 112 must be accounted for by the flexibility and the data provide no direct evidence for any asymmetry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer 3 is wrong in suggesting that we are trying to prove asymmetry through the DEER data. That is a well-known fact in the literature (eg Vidilaseris et al, Sci Adv 2019 where we show (1) that the exit channel inhibitor ATC (i.e., close to 525) binds better in solution to the TmPPase:PPi complex than the TmPPase:PPi2 complex, and (2) that ATC binds in an asymmetric fashion to the TmPPase:IDP2 complex with just one ATC dimer on one of the exit channels. We merely use the DEER data to support this well-established fact.</p>
<p>However, we agree that the DEER data in presence of IDP does not provide direct proof for asymmetry; particularly mutant T211R1 yields in silico distributions too short for measurement by DEER. It is possible that the deviations observed (and particularly likely for T211R1) arise from conformational heterogeneity in solution. We will rephrase this paragraph accordingly: âOwing to the broad nature of the T211R1 (cytoplasmic site) distance distributions, we refrain from interpreting shifts in this data. For the 525R1 (periplasmic site) for which we obtained data of high quality (as also pointed out by both reviewers 2 and 3) we observed deviations between the experimental and the in-silico distances derived from the TmPPase:IDP X-ray structure. While this deviation is less pronounced than for the +ZTD condition, the deviation is consistent with an asymmetric conformation in solution.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) 'Our new structures, together with DEER distance measurements that monitor the conformational ensemble equilibrium of TmPPase in solution, provide further solid experimental evidence of asymmetry in gating and transitional changes upon substrate/inhibitor binding.'</p>
<p>Problem: See above. The DEER data do not support any asymmetry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We feel that the reviewer comments here are somewhat unfounded. The DEER data (and we will limit discussion only to the 525R1 mutant in this regard) satisfy relevant criteria of the white paper (Schiemann et al., 2021, JACS) from the EPR community (signal-to-noise ratio w.r.t modulation depth of &gt; 20 in all cases; replicates have been performed and will be added into the main-text or supplementary; near quantitative labelling efficiency (evidenced by lack of free spin label signal in the CW-EPR spectra); analysed using the CDA (now Figure EV10, this data we will promote to the main-text) to avoid confirmation bias).</p>
<p>While the DEER data do not prove asymmetry, we do not claim proof of asymmetry in the above sentence. We concede to rephrase the offending sentence above as: âOur new structures, together with DEER distance measurements that monitor the conformational ensemble of TmPPase in solution, do not exclude asymmetry in gating and transitional changes upon substrate/inhibitor binding and are consistent with our proposed model.â We feel that this reframed conjecture of asymmetry is well founded; indeed, comparing the experimental apo-state 525R1 distance distribution with <italic>in-silico</italic> modelling performed on the hybridised asymmetric structure (i.e., comprised of one monomer bound to Ca2+ and another bound to IDP) yields an overlap coefficient (Islam and Roux, JPC B, 2015) of &gt;0.97. This implies the envelope of the modelled distance distribution is quantitatively inside the envelope of the experimental distance distribution. Thus, the DEER data do not exclude asymmetry (previously observed by time-resolved XRC) in solution. While we appreciate that ideally one would measure time-resolved DEER to directly correlate kinetics of conformational changes within the ensemble to the catalytic cycle of mPPase,(and this is something we aim to do in the future), it is beyond the the scope of this study.</p>
<p>Indeed, half-of-the-sites reactivity has been demonstrated in at least the following papers (Vidilaseris et al, Sci Acv. ,2019, Strauss et al, EMBO Rep. 2024, Malinen et al Prot Sci, 2022, Artukka et al Biochem J, 2018; Luoto et al, PNAS, 2013). Half-of-the sites activity requires asymmetry in the mechanism, and therefore asymmetric motions in the active site (viz 211) and exit channel (viz 525). As mentioned above, we have demonstrated this for other inhibitors (Vidilaseris et al 2019) and as part of a time-resolved experiment (Strauss et al 2024). In fact, given the wealth of evidence showing that the symmetrical crystal structures sample a non- or less-productive conformation of the protein, it would be quixotic to propose the DEER experiments - in solution - do not generate asymmetric conformations. It certainly doesnât obey Occamâs razor of choosing the simplest possible explanation that covers the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Based on these observations, and the DEER data for +IDP, which is consistent with an asymmetric conformation of TmPPase being present in solution, we propose five distinct models of TmPPase (Figure 7).</p>
<p>Problem: Again, the DEER data do not support any asymmetry and the authors may revisit the proposed models.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. Please see our detailed response above. However, in the revised version, we will clarify that the proposed models are not solely based on the DEER data but are grounded in both current and previously solved structures, with the DEER data providing additional consistency with these models.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) 'In model 2 (Figure 7), one active site is semi-closed, while the other remains open.

<p>Problem: Neither convincing nor supported by the data</p>

<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. However, owing to the conformational heterogeneity of T211R1, in the revised version, we will exclude it in the above sentence, to the effect: Please see our detailed response above.</p>
