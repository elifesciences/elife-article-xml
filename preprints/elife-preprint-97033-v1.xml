<title>Abstract</title><p>Classical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling takes place in response to extracellular stimuli and involves receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins located at the plasma membrane. It has recently been established that GPCR signaling can also take place from intracellular membrane compartments, including endosomes that contain internalized receptors and ligands. While the mechanisms of GPCR endocytosis are well understood, it is not clear how internalized receptors are supplied with G proteins. To address this gap we use gene editing, confocal microscopy, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer to study the distribution and trafficking of endogenous G proteins. We show here that constitutive endocytosis is sufficient to supply newly internalized endocytic vesicles with 20-30% of the G protein density found at the plasma membrane. We find that G proteins are present on early, late, and recycling endosomes, are abundant on lysosomes, but are virtually undetectable on the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and the medial Golgi apparatus. Receptor activation does not change heterotrimer abundance on endosomes. Our results provide a detailed subcellular map of endogenous G protein distribution, suggest that G proteins may be partially excluded from nascent endocytic vesicles, and are likely to have implications for GPCR signaling from endosomes and other intracellular compartments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce a vast number of important physiological signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gilman, 1987</xref>), most often in response to activation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pierce, Premont, &amp; Lefkowitz, 2002</xref>). Canonical G protein signaling occurs when a cell surface GPCR is activated by an extracellular ligand, which in turn promotes activation of plasma membrane G protein heterotrimers and downstream effectors. Recently, it has become clear that GPCRs can also signal from intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Calebiro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eichel &amp; von Zastrow, 2018</xref>), most notably endosomes and the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Calebiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferrandon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Irannejad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Irannejad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mullershausen et al., 2009</xref>). Signaling from endosomes is often a continuation of signaling that starts at the plasma membrane and persists as (or resumes after) active receptors are endocytosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tsvetanova, Irannejad, &amp; von Zastrow, 2015</xref>). Much is known about the machinery responsible for GPCR internalization, and also about the trafficking itineraries of specific receptors after endocytosis. Some receptors are efficiently sorted for recycling and are returned to the plasma membrane, whereas other receptors are rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hanyaloglu &amp; von Zastrow, 2008</xref>). It is also known that at least one isoform of the G protein effector adenylyl cyclase is actively internalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lazar et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, much less is known about how G protein heterotrimers traffic from the plasma membrane through intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>). It is not known how efficiently heterotrimers are loaded onto endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane, how receptor activation might change this process, or what the fate of G proteins might be after endocytosis. Activation at the plasma membrane promotes heterotrimer dissociation, and the resulting loss of membrane avidity allows Gβy dimers and some Gα subunits to translocate through the cytosol to sample intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akgoz, Kalyanaraman, &amp; Gautam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hynes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ransnäs et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Slepak &amp; Hurley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wedegaertner, Bourne, &amp; von Zastrow, 1996</xref>). However, these processes reverse quickly when activation ceases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akgoz, Kalyanaraman, &amp; Gautam, 2004</xref>), meaning that activation-dependent translocation of free Gα subunits and Gβy dimers would be an inefficient mechanism to deliver inactive heterotrimers to intracellular membranes. While G proteins have been detected on the surface of endosomes and other intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hewavitharana &amp; Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Irannejad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scarselli &amp; Donaldson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>) there has been no quantitative comparison of G protein distribution across subcellular compartments.</p>
<p>Here we study the subcellular distribution of endogenous heterotrimeric G proteins in cultured cells using CRISPR-mediated gene editing, confocal imaging, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). We find that G proteins are abundant on membrane compartments that are functionally continuous with the plasma membrane, including early, late, and recycling endosomes. However, heterotrimer density on endocytic membranes is lower than on the plasma membrane, suggesting that G protein endocytosis is inefficient. Endocytic trafficking of G proteins is not regulated by GPCRs. Our findings are likely to have implications for GPCR signaling from endosomes, as internalized receptors are concentrated in G protein-deficient compartments.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To study the localization of endogenous G proteins we used gene editing to attach small peptide tags to the amino terminus of Gβ<sub>1</sub> subunits (<italic>GNB1</italic>) in HEK 293 cells. We chose this subunit because it is the most abundant Gβ subunit in this cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cho et al., 2022</xref>), it can associate with any type of Gα or Gψ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hillenbrand et al., 2015</xref>), and it can be labeled without disrupting heterotrimer formation or function. For bioluminescence experiments we added the HiBit tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schwinn et al., 2018</xref>) and isolated clonal “HiBit-β<sub>1</sub>“ cell lines. For imaging experiments we added a tandem tag that included the 11<sup>th</sup> beta strand of mNeonGreen2 (mNG2(11)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Feng et al., 2017</xref>) and HiBit in cells constitutively expressing mNG2(1-10) and isolated “mNG-β<sub>1</sub>“ cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Amplicon sequencing verified that cell lines had correctly edited <italic>GNB1</italic> genes and SDS-PAGE revealed single proteins with apparent molecular weights consistent with edited Gβ<sub>1</sub> subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). BRET assays demonstrated that tagged subunits in HiBit-β<sub>1</sub> and mNG-β<sub>1</sub> cell lines formed functional heterotrimers with endogenous Gα and Gψ subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Endogenous Gα and Gβ subunits are expressed at approximately a 1:1 ratio, and Gβ subunits are tightly associated with Gψ and inactive Gα subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cho et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gilman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Krumins &amp; Gilman, 2006</xref>), therefore we assume that the large majority of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> and HiBit-β<sub>1</sub> subunits in unstimulated cells are part of heterotrimers.</p>

<title>Endogenous G proteins primarily associate with the plasma membrane and endolysosomes</title>
<p>Confocal imaging of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> cells revealed the expected bright fluorescence at the plasma membrane. Most cells also contained pleiomorphic intracellular structures and dim cytosolic fluorescence that was sufficient to suggest relative exclusion of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> from the nucleus. Especially notable were clusters of large vesicular structures located at the cell periphery which were later identified as lysosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; see below). Large intracellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus were not evident.</p>

</fig>
<p>To identify the intracellular membrane compartments with mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence we coexpressed a series of organelle markers tagged with red fluorescent proteins. Markers of the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and medial Golgi apparatus indicated that these large compartments were virtually devoid of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplements 1</xref>-<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In some cells an indistinct region of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence was interleaved with leaflets of the Golgi apparatus, but line profiles suggested that this was a distinct structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 3</xref>), most likely the perinuclear recycling compartment (see below).</p>
<p>In contrast, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> clearly colocalized with the marker FYVE, which binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) on the surface of endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - figure supplement 1</xref>). However, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence was not detected on every FYVE-positive vesicle and when present was much less intense than fluorescence of adjacent segments of the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The median signal-to-background ratio for FYVE-positive structures was less than one-fourth that of the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). FYVE domains primarily localize to early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hammond &amp; Balla, 2015</xref>), so it was not surprising that similar colocalization of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> was observed with the early endosome marker rab5a. As was the case with FYVE, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> was detectable in some rab5a-positive vesicles but not others and was not as intense as the nearby plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - figure supplement 2</xref>). In order to determine the fate of G proteins after endocytosis we then examined mNG-β<sub>1</sub> colocalization with markers of recycling and late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stenmark, 2009</xref>). Dim mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence was detected on indistinct rab11a-positive structures clustered diffusely in the vicinity of the nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - figure supplement 3</xref>), which we presumptively identified as the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC). Similarly, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> colocalized extensively with vesicles labeled with rab7a, a marker of late endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - figure supplement 4</xref>). Notably, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence was more intense on rab7a-positive late endosomes than on FYVE- or rab5a-positive early endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The presence of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> on late endosomes suggested that some G proteins may be degraded by lysosomes. Accordingly, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> strongly colocalized with lysosomes marked with LysoView 633 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3-5" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - figure supplement 5</xref>) or long-term incubation with fluorescent dextran (<xref rid="figs3-5" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - figure supplement 5</xref>). In many instances the intensity of mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence on lysosomes was similar to that of the nearby plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). These imaging results suggest that G proteins are likely to undergo endocytosis and enter both recycling and degradative pathways and may become more concentrated as late endosomes mature.</p>

<p>As an alternative approach we performed bystander BRET experiments to map the subcellular localization of endogenous HiBit-β<sub>1</sub>. This approach provides an unbiased index of membrane protein colocalization from large populations of cells and has the additional advantage of very high sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lan et al., 2012</xref>). We expressed LgBit and a series of inert Venus-tagged membrane markers in HiBit-β<sub>1</sub> cells and observed large bystander signals at the plasma membrane, smaller bystander signals at endosomes, and very small bystander signals at the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Although bystander BRET signals cannot be directly compared between different compartments, these results are generally consistent with what we observed using confocal imaging and confirm the presence of G proteins on multiple endosomal compartments.</p>

<title>Constitutive G protein endocytosis is inefficient</title>
<p>That mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence was less intense on endosomes than the plasma membrane suggested that G protein density may be lower on the surface of endosomes than on the plasma membrane. However, differences in fluorescence intensity could be due to differences in the amount of membrane surface area sampled in the imaging volume. Likewise, differences in bystander BRET between compartments could be due to differences in several factors, including expression and efficiency of compartment-specific BRET acceptors. Therefore, we devised a co-labeling protocol that allowed us to compare mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence to the amount of newly internalized membrane imaged at endocytic vesicles, and to make the same measurements at the plasma membrane. To stain both the plasma membrane as well as newly formed endocytic vesicle membrane we exposed live cells to the styryl dye FM4-64, which rapidly and reversibly partitions into (but does not cross) membranes and is only fluorescent in a hydrophobic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Betz, Mao, &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>). When cells are exposed to FM4-64 at physiological temperatures the plasma membrane is stained immediately, and this is followed over the course of several minutes by the appearance of intracellular vesicles that have trapped the dye (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1</xref>). As an orthogonal approach we stained cells with CellMask Deep Red, a lipophilic dye that permanently stains the plasma membrane and therefore is incorporated into endocytic vesicles. Both dyes are expected to produce fluorescence signals proportional to the surface area of the membrane sampled by the imaging method, allowing us to normalize the fluorescence of individual vesicles to the nearby plasma membrane. We reasoned that if G proteins are passively incorporated into endocytic vesicles without any enrichment or exclusion, then mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence in each vesicle should have the same intensity relative to the plasma membrane as lipophilic dyes. After staining cells and allowing 15 minutes for constitutive endocytosis we found that FM4-64 and CellMask dyes reported similar amounts of membrane surface area in endocytic vesicles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>); in both cases peak vesicle intensity was on average similar to the intensity of the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, peak mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence on the same endocytic vesicles was much less intense than the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>). There was considerable variability between individual vesicles, such that some vesicles contained no detectable mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1</xref>). This result confirms that heterotrimeric G proteins are present on newly internalized membrane but also suggests that G proteins are partially excluded from endocytic vesicles.</p>

<title>Receptor activation does not change G protein endocytosis</title>
<p>The above results suggested that constitutive endocytosis of heterotrimeric G proteins is inefficient. However, it is possible that GPCR and G protein activation could change how G proteins are loaded onto endocytic vesicles. To test this possibility, we performed similar imaging experiments with mNG-β<sub>1</sub> cells transfected with SNAP-tagged β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (SNAPf-β<sub>2</sub>AR). This receptor is often used as a model of activity-dependent GPCR internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Benovic et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">von Zastrow &amp; Kobilka, 1992</xref>) and has been shown to activate G proteins on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bowman, Shiwarski, &amp; Puthenveedu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Irannejad et al., 2013</xref>). We labeled SNAPf-β<sub>2</sub>AR with a membrane-impermeant SNAP ligand (AF 647) at room temperature to prevent constitutive endocytosis, then incubated cells with FM4-64 and the agonist isoproterenol for 15 minutes at physiological temperature to promote receptor endocytosis. Confocal imaging after agonist washout revealed numerous intracellular vesicles with intense AF 647 fluorescence, consistent with robust receptor internalization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Normalization and comparison to FM4-64 fluorescence indicated that SNAPf-β<sub>2</sub>AR was enriched approximately three-fold on endocytic vesicles compared to the nearby plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, C</xref>), consistent with active recruitment of active receptors to clathrin-coated pits and endocytic vesicles. In contrast, mNG-β<sub>1</sub> fluorescence in the same vesicles was again lower than expected given the amount of membrane imaged in each vesicle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, C</xref>). Once again there was considerable variability between individual endocytic vesicles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, D</xref>). Using FM4-64 fluorescence as a standard for membrane surface area we calculated that mNG-β<sub>1</sub> density on receptor-containing vesicles was 28 ± 8% (mean ± 95% CI; <italic>n</italic>=91) of the nearby plasma membrane. Although this density was higher than that calculated for vesicles formed by constitutive endocytosis (20 ± 8%; <italic>n</italic>=45), the difference did not reach significance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). These results demonstrate that activation-dependent internalization of β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors does not significantly promote or prevent loading of G proteins onto endocytic vesicles.</p>

<p>These findings suggested that receptor activation should have no impact on the abundance of G proteins on endosomes. To test this idea, we performed bystander BRET experiments with HiBit-β<sub>1</sub> cells transiently expressing β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic, D2 dopamine or M3 muscarinic receptors to activate G<sub>s</sub>, G<sub>i/o</sub> and G<sub>q/11</sub> heterotrimers, respectively. We incubated cells with agonist for 30 minutes under conditions permissive for vesicular trafficking, then washed with antagonist to allow receptors and heterotrimers to become inactive prior to measuring BRET. Under these conditions no significant changes in bystander BRET were observed at any endosome compartment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These results support the idea that receptor and G protein activation do not lead to persistent changes in G protein abundance on the surface of endosomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While the mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis, chaperoning and trafficking of nascent G protein heterotrimers are fairly well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marrari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>), the mechanisms that regulate the subcellular distribution of heterotrimers after delivery to the plasma membrane have not been studied as extensively. Here we show that constitutive and activity-dependent endocytosis of G proteins is inefficient. Avoidance of endocytosis is likely to be important for maintaining a high density of heterotrimers at the plasma membrane, where much important signaling takes place. On the other hand, this limits the abundance of G proteins on the surface of endosomes. At present we can only speculate regarding the mechanism that limits G protein density on endocytic vesicles. Many endocytosis mechanisms, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, rely on bulky coat proteins and adapters to induce membrane curvature and recruit cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Doherty &amp; McMahon, 2009</xref>). One possibility is that heterotrimeric G proteins are simply excluded from nascent endocytic vesicles by steric occlusion. While large extracellular domains are known to impede endocytosis of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">DeGroot et al., 2018</xref>), a similar relationship has not been demonstrated for intracellular domains. It is noteworthy that the monomeric G proteins H-Ras and N-Ras are also less abundant on endosomes than the plasma membrane, and therefore are separated from internalized growth factor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pinilla-Macua, Watkins, &amp; Sorkin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Surve, Watkins, &amp; Sorkin, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Some studies using overexpressed G protein subunits have suggested that a large pool of G proteins is located on intracellular membranes, including the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chisari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Saini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>), whereas others have indicated a distribution that is dominated by the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Crouthamel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Evanko, Thiyagarajan, &amp; Wedegaertner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marrari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Takida &amp; Wedegaertner, 2003</xref>). A likely factor contributing to this discrepancy is the stoichiometry of overexpressed subunits, as neither Gα nor Gβy traffic appropriately to the plasma membrane as free subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>). Our results show that endogenous G proteins are primarily located on the plasma membrane and are present on internal membranes at substantially lower levels. We identify the specific intracellular compartments where G proteins are found and show the relative abundance of G proteins on each compartment. Nascent heterotrimers are likely formed and lipid modified on the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>), yet few heterotrimers can be found on these compartments at any given moment, consistent with a relatively slow rate of turnover compared to forward trafficking during biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>). In the present study we have limited our analysis to the medial portion of the Golgi apparatus. It is possible that G proteins may be more abundant on the trans-Golgi network, as this compartment is involved in membrane protein recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nakano, 2022</xref>). Likewise, we found that few heterotrimers are associated with mitochondria, despite the fact that previous studies have demonstrated functional roles for G proteins on these organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hewavitharana &amp; Wedegaertner, 2012</xref>). Our results suggest that GPCR signaling from intracellular compartments will generally have to be transduced by a lower density of G proteins.</p>
<p>Fully lipid-modified heterotrimers in their inactive state are unlikely to detach from membranes at a significant rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shahinian &amp; Silvius, 1995</xref>). Therefore, we infer from the presence of Gβ<sub>1</sub> on early, late, and recycling endosomes that heterotrimers undergo vesicle-mediated endocytosis in unstimulated cells and are not efficiently sorted to either the slow recycling pathway or the degradative pathway. Our results are largely consistent with the hypothesis that G proteins passively follow bulk endocytic flow of membrane and suggest that at least some G proteins are recycled to the plasma membrane. Our imaging results also show that G proteins are apparently more abundant on late endosomes and lysosomes than on early endosomes, suggesting that they become concentrated as late endosomes mature. We cannot exclude the possibility that heterotrimers traffic between membrane compartments by mechanisms other than vesicular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Saini, Chisari, &amp; Gautam, 2009</xref>). However, even if this is the case our conclusions that G proteins are internalized inefficiently and are present at lower density on most intracellular membranes are still valid. The cell lines we developed should prove useful for answering additional questions related to G protein regulation, such as possible non-vesicular translocation due to palmitate turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Saini, Chisari, &amp; Gautam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wedegaertner &amp; Bourne, 1994</xref>), the role of ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dohlman &amp; Campbell, 2019</xref>), and localization in subcompartments not studied here.</p>
<p>Our study is not without limitations. Our labeling strategy was designed to interfere as little as possible with heterotrimer function, but we cannot rule out the possibility that the tags we used to visualize and track G proteins had some influence on their trafficking. By labeling Gβ<sub>1</sub> subunits we cannot directly distinguish heterotrimers from free Gβy dimers, complicating interpretation. This strategy also does not allow us to resolve heterotrimers containing different Gα subunits. It is quite possible that heterotrimers containing different Gα subunits could be subject to different trafficking mechanisms. Our conclusion that GPCR activation has no lasting effect on the subcellular distribution of G proteins rests on three representative receptors, chosen because they activate three of the four major G protein families. It is possible that other receptors will influence G protein distribution using mechanisms not shared by the receptors we studied. Finally, our study was limited to a single non-differentiated cell type. It would not be surprising to find that differentiated cells have mechanisms to regulate G protein trafficking and distribution that are not shared by the model cells we used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Calebiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kotowski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Puri et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, here we show that heterotrimeric G proteins are more abundant on the plasma membrane than on any intracellular compartment where they are thought to be important for signaling. Our results are likely to have functional implications for signaling from intracellular compartments. Receptor-G protein coupling is thought to be rate-limited by collision and G protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hein et al., 2005</xref>), and decreasing G protein expression is known to impair downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schwindinger et al., 1997</xref>). Signaling from endosomes and other compartments may thus be disadvantaged by a low density of G proteins. Further studies are warranted to examine the stoichiometry of receptors, G proteins, regulators, and effectors in different subcellular compartments and how this affects signaling.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Jang et al. describes the application of new methods to measure the localization of GTP-binding signaling proteins (G proteins) on different membrane structures in a model mammalian cell line (HEK293). G proteins mediate signaling by receptors found at the cell surface (GPCRs), with evidence from the last 15 years suggesting that GPCRs can induce G-protein mediated signaling from different membrane structures within the cell, with variation in signal localization leading to different cellular outcomes. While it has been clearly shown that different GPCRs efficiently traffic to various intracellular compartments, it is less clear whether G proteins traffic in the same manner, and whether GPCR trafficking facilitates &quot;passenger&quot; G protein trafficking. This question was a blind spot in the burgeoning field of GPCR localized signaling in need of careful study, and the results obtained will serve as an important guidepost for further work in this field. The extent to which G proteins localize to different membranes within the cell is the main experimental question tested in this manuscript. This question is pursued through two distinct methods, both relying on genetic modification of the G-beta subunit with a tag. In one method, G-beta is modified with a small fragment of the fluorescent protein mNG, which combines with the larger mNG fragment to form a fully functional fluorescent protein to facilitate protein trafficking by fluorescent microscopy. This approach was combined with the expression of fluorescent proteins directed to various intracellular compartments (different types of endosomes, lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, mitochondria) to look for colocalization of G-beta with these markers. These experiments showed compelling evidence that G-beta co-localizes with markers at the plasma membrane and the lysosome, with weak or absent co-localization for other markers. A second method for measuring localization relied on fusing G-beta with a small fragment from a miniature luciferase (HiBit) that combines with a larger luciferase fragment (LgBit) to form an active luciferase enzyme. Localization of G-beta (and luciferase signal) was measured using a method known as bystander BRET, which relies on the expression of a fluorescent protein BRET acceptor in different cellular compartments. Results using bystander BRET supported findings from fluorescence microscopy experiments. These methods for tracking G protein localization were also used to probe other questions. The activation of GPCRs from different classes had virtually no impact on the localization of G-beta, suggesting that GPCR activation does not result in the shuttling of G proteins through the endosomal pathway with activated receptors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The question probed in this study is quite important and, in my opinion, understudied by the pharmacology community. The results presented here are an important call to be cognizant of the localization of GPCR coupling partners in different cellular compartments. Abundant reports of endosomal GPCR signaling need to consider how the impact of lower G protein abundance on endosomal membranes will affect the signaling responses under study.</p>
<p>The work presented is carefully executed, with seemingly high levels of technical rigor. These studies benefit from probing the experimental questions at hand using two different methods of measurement (fluorescent microscopy and bystander BRET). The observation that both methods arrive at the same (or a very similar) answer inspires confidence about the validity of these findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The rationale for fusing G-beta with either mNG2(11) or SmBit could benefit from some expansion. I understand the speculation that using the smallest tag possible may have the smallest impact on protein performance and localization, but plenty of researchers have fused proteins with whole fluorescent proteins to provide conclusions that have been confirmed by other methods. Many studies even use G proteins fused with fluorescent proteins or luciferases. Is there an important advantage to tagging G-beta with small tags? Is there evidence that G proteins with full-size protein tags behave aberrantly? If the studies presented here would not have been possible without these CRISPR-based tagging approaches, it would be helpful to provide more context to make this clearer. Perhaps one factor would be interference from newly synthesized G proteins-fluorescent protein fusions en route to the plasma membrane (in the ER and Golgi).</p>
<p>As noted by the authors, they do not demonstrate that the tagged G-beta is predominantly found within heterotrimeric G protein complexes. If there is substantial free G-beta, then many of the conclusions need to be reconsidered. Perhaps a comparison of immunoprecipitated tagged G beta vs immunoprecipitated supernatant, with blotting for other G protein subunits would be informative.</p>
<p>Additional context and questions:</p>
<p>(1) There exists some evidence that certain GPCRs can form enduring complexes with G-beta-gamma (Pubmed: 23297229, 27499021). That would seem to offer a mechanism that would enable receptor-mediated transport of G protein subunits. It would be helpful for the authors to place the findings of this manuscript in the context of these previous findings since they seem somewhat contradictory.</p>
<p>(2) There is some evidence that GaS undergoes measurable dissociation from the plasma membrane upon activation (see the mechanism of the assay in Pubmed: 35302493). It seems possible that G-alpha (and in particular GaS) might behave differently than the G-beta subunit studied here. This is not entirely clear from the discussion as it now stands.</p>
<p>(3) The authors say &quot;The presence of mNG-b1 on late endosomes suggested that some G proteins may be degraded by lysosomes&quot;. The mechanism of lysosomal degradation by proteins on the outside of the lysosome is not clear. It would be helpful for the authors to clarify.</p>
<p>(4) Although the authors do a good job of assessing G protein dilution in endosomal membranes, it is unclear how this behavior compares to the measurement of other lipid-anchored proteins using the same approach. Is the dilution of G proteins what we would expect for any lipid-anchored protein at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane?</p>

<p>This is an interesting method that addresses the important problem of assessing G protein localization at endogenous levels. The data are generally convincing.</p>
<p>Specific comments</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<p>
The description of the gene editing method is unclear. There are two different CRISPR cell lines made in two different cell backgrounds. The methods should clearly state which CRISPR guides were used on which cell line. It is also not clear why HiBit is included in the mNG-β1 construct. Presumably, this is not critical but it would be helpful to explicitly note. In general, the Methods could be more complete.</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>
The explanation of validation experiments in Figures 1 C and D is incomplete and difficult to follow. The rationale and explanation of the experiments could be expanded. In addition, because this is an interesting method, it would be helpful to know if the endogenous editing affects normal GPCR signaling. For example, the authors could include data showing an Iso-induced cAMP response. This is not critical to the present interpretation but is relevant as a general point regarding the method. Also, it may be relevant to the interpretation of receptor effects on G protein localization.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>
The conclusion that beta-gamma subunits do not redistribute after GPCR activation seems new and different from previous reports. Is this correct? Can the authors elaborate on how the results compare to previous literature?</p>
<p>Can the authors note that OpenCell has endogenously tagged Gβ1 and reports more obvious internal localization? Can the authors comment on this point?</p>
<p>Is this the first use of CRISPR / HiBit for BRET assay? It would be helpful to know this or cite previous work if not. Also, as this is submitted as a tools piece, the authors might say a little more about the potential application to other questions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This article addresses an important and interesting question concerning intracellular localization and dynamics of endogenous G proteins. The fate and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been extensively studied but so far little is known about the trafficking routes of their partner G proteins that are known to dissociate from their respective receptors upon activation of the signaling pathway. The authors utilize modern cell biology tools including genome editing and bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to probe intracellular localization of G proteins in various membrane compartments in steady state and also upon receptor activation. Data presented in this manuscript shows that while G proteins are mostly present on the plasma membrane, they can be also detected in endosomal compartments, especially in late endosomes and lysosomes. This distribution, according to data presented in this study, seems not to be affected by receptor activation. These findings will have implications in further studies addressing GPCR signaling mechanisms from intracellular compartments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The methods used in this study are adequate for the question asked. Especially, the use of genome-edited cells (for the addition of the tag on one of the G proteins) is a great choice to prevent the effects of overexpression. Moreover, the use of bystander BRET allowed authors to probe the intracellular localization of G proteins in a very high-throughput fashion. By combining imaging and BRET authors convincingly show that G proteins are very low abundant on early endosomes (also ER, mitochondria, and medial Golgi), however seem to accumulate on membranes of late endosomal compartments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors provide a novel dataset, many questions regarding G protein trafficking remain open. For example, it is not entirely clear which pathway is utilized to traffic G proteins from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments. Additionally, future studies should also address the dynamics of G protein trafficking, for example by tracking them over multiple time points.</p>
