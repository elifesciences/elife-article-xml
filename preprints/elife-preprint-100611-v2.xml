<title>Abstract</title><p>Dietary protein absorption in neonatal mammals and fishes relies on the function of a specialized and conserved population of highly absorptive lysosome rich enterocytes (LREs). The gut microbiome has been shown to enhance absorption of nutrients, such as lipids, by intestinal epithelial cells. However, whether protein absorption is also affected by the gut microbiome is poorly understood. Here, we investigate connections between protein absorption and microbes in the zebrafish gut. Using live microscopy-based quantitative assays, we find that microbes slow the pace of protein uptake and degradation in LREs. While microbes do not affect the number of absorbing LRE cells, microbes lower the expression of endocytic and protein digestion machinery in LREs. Using transgene assisted cell isolation and single cell RNA-sequencing, we characterize all intestinal cells that take up dietary protein. We find that microbes affect expression of bacteria-sensing and metabolic pathways in LREs, and that some secretory cell types also take up protein and share components of protein uptake and digestion machinery with LREs. Using custom-formulated diets, we investigated the influence of diet and LRE activity on the gut microbiome. Impaired protein uptake activity in LREs, along with a protein-deficient diet, alters the microbial community and leads to increased abundance of bacterial genera that have the capacity to reduce protein uptake in LREs. Together, these results reveal that diet-dependent reciprocal interactions between LREs and the gut microbiome regulate protein absorption.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability of the intestine to efficiently absorb nutrients from the diet is influenced significantly by the microbiome that it harbors (A. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wilson et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kau et al. 2011</xref>). Most dietary nutrients, including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, are absorbed by the small intestinal epithelium after luminal digestion. In zebrafish and mice, microbiome colonization enhances small intestinal absorption of dietary lipids compared to germ-free (GF) animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Semova et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Martinez-Guryn et al. 2018</xref>). Gut microbiomes are also known to increase dietary energy harvest by fermenting complex carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids that can be absorbed by the gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cholan et al. 2020</xref>). There is evidence that <italic>Drosophila</italic>-associated microbes absorb dietary proteins and amino acids and are, in turn, ingested and metabolized by the host, promoting survival under dietary protein-limited conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Keebaugh et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yamada et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lesperance and Broderick 2020</xref>). Furthermore, amino acids secreted by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbiome have been shown to modify feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al. 2021</xref>). However, whether the microbiome affects intestinal absorption of dietary proteins remains poorly understood. The importance of this question is underscored by the gut microbiomeâs links to protein malnutrition diseases. Children with kwashiorkor, a disease caused by severe protein malnutrition, have significantly altered gut microbiomes that promote weight loss when transplanted into GF mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Smith et al. 2013</xref>). These studies suggest that protein deprivation may cause a gut microbial community to develop that further exacerbates the effects of the disease. Defining the reciprocal interactions between intestinal physiology, microbiome, and dietary protein nutrition is therefore an important research goal.</p>
<p>In neonatal mammals and fishes, dietary protein absorption is dependent on the function of a specialized population of epithelial cells in the ileal region of the small intestine originally described as vacuolated or neonatal enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kraehenbuhl and Campiche 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">RodrÃ­guez-Fraticelli et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wallace et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gonnella and Neutra 1984</xref>; J. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wilson, Whitney, and Neutra 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rombout et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Graney 1968</xref>). Recent work in zebrafish and mice showed that these cells, which we refer to as lysosome rich enterocytes (LREs), are highly endocytic and specialize in the uptake of luminal proteins that they then digest in giant lysosomal vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>). In mammals, LREs are present only during suckling stages and are lost at weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harper et al. 2011</xref>), whereas in fishes they are retained through adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Noaillac-Depeyre and Gas 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Stroband and Debets 1978</xref>). In zebrafish, digestive processes can be observed live in the transparent larvae following gavage with fluorescent cargoes directly into the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">RodrÃ­guez-Fraticelli et al. 2015</xref>). Using this assay, LREs were shown to internalize proteins but not lipids from the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>LREs internalize luminal proteins using an endocytic complex composed of the scavenger receptor cubilin (Cubn), the transmembrane linker amnionless (Amn), and endocytic clathrin adaptor Dab2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>). Loss of these components severely reduces their capacity to take up luminal proteins, leading to stunted growth, poor survival, and intestinal edema reminiscent of kwashiorkor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>). LREs are broadly present in vertebrates and likely also in lower chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nakayama, Sekiguchi, and Ogasawara 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yonge 1923</xref>), suggesting LRE development and physiology are ancient and important aspects of intestinal function. However, whether gut microbes play a role in LRE dependent processes or the pathobiology of LRE deficiency is not known.</p>
<p>Previous work suggested that microbes affect uptake and degradation kinetics in LREs. Specifically, zebrafish larvae colonized with a complex gut microbiome (ex-GF conventionalized or CV) had electron-dense material in the lysosomes of LREs that was not detected in GF larvae (Rawls, Samuel, &amp; Gordon, 2004). Consistent with these findings, CV larvae immersed in horse radish peroxidase (HRP) had increased HRP accumulation in LREs (Bates et al., 2006). However, it was unclear from those studies if microbes caused material to accumulate in LREs by increasing the rate of LRE uptake, decreasing LRE degradation, or both.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate how interactions between LREs, the gut microbiome, and diet affect host nutrition in zebrafish larvae. We demonstrate that the gut microbiome reduces the rates of protein uptake and degradation in LREs. We present single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data that represents all major intestinal cell types, uncovering cell populations capable of protein uptake, and the effects of microbes across the gut. Using monoassociation experiments, we dissected the effects of specific microbial strains on LREs and found that <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> colonization strongly reduces LRE activity. Finally, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and custom formulated diets, we found that dietary protein content and LRE activity also affect the gut microbiome composition. Together, our results uncover significant interactions between LREs, diet, and gut microbes that regulates host nutrition.</p>

<title>Gut microbiome slows uptake and degradation kinetics in LREs</title>
<p>We first investigated if microbes affect protein absorption in LREs. To do this, we used established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pham et al. 2008</xref>) to rear zebrafish to the larval stage in gnotobiotic conditions to compare LRE activity in GF and ex-GF conventionalized (CV) conditions. In these experiments, a portion of the GF cohort was conventionalized with microbes at 3 days post fertilization (dpf), while the rest remained in the GF condition until the experimental endpoint of 6 dpf. At that point, we gavaged GF and CV larvae with fluorescent soluble cargoes and imaged uptake in the LRE region using confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shaner et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cocchiaro and Rawls 2013</xref>). To test how the microbiome affects protein uptake in LREs, we gavaged larvae with the purified fluorescent protein mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shaner et al. 2004</xref>). Previous work showed that LREs readily take up mCherry following gavage with fluorescence peaking in the anterior LREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>). We found that GF and CV larvae rapidly took up mCherry in the LREs, absorbing detectable levels of mCherry within five minutes of gavage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). LREs progressively became more saturated with mCherry between 5 â 60 minutes post gavage in both conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). However, mCherry fluorescence peaked in the anterior LREs of GF larvae by 40 minutes PG (Figure S1A), but the peak did not emerge until 60 minutes PG in CV larvae (Figure S1B). Between 5 and 60 minutes PG, the anterior LREs of GF larvae accumulated mCherry at a significantly faster rate than those in CV larvae (Figure S1C). Across the entire LRE region, GF larvae took up significantly more mCherry than CV larvae by 1 hour PG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). However, LREs in CV larvae eventually reached a similar level of mCherry uptake by 5 hours PG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Over the 1 to 5 hour time course, the anterior LREs in CV larvae gradually increased in mCherry saturation, while mCherry saturation remained at a stable, high level in GF larvae (Figure S1D). We tested if the gut microbiome reduces mCherry uptake in LREs by lowering its concentration in the lumen. That did not appear to be the case because luminal mCherry concentrations were equivalent in GF and CV larvae at 1 and 5 hours PG (Figure S1E), and the microbiome did not degrade mCherry over time (Figure S1F). We observed a similar trend using Lucifer Yellow (LY) as a fluid phase endocytic tracer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Swanson, Yirinec, and Silverstein 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>). GF larvae took up significantly more LY than CV larvae by 1 hour PG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) but accumulated similar amounts by 3 hours PG (Figure S1G). These results suggest that microbial colonization reduces the rate of endocytosis in the LRE region.</p>

<p>We hypothesized that microbial burden may influence the rate of luminal uptake and that a threshold density may be needed for microbes to affect protein-uptake kinetics in LREs. To investigate this possibility, we compared mCherry uptake activity between CV larvae with different microbial densities. At 1 hour PG, mCherry uptake was not reduced in CV larvae when the density was 3 x 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL in the gnotobiotic zebrafish media (GZM) (Figure S1H). However, a higher density of 3 x 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL in the GZM was sufficient to significantly reduce mCherry uptake in CV larvae compared to GF larvae (Figure S1I).</p>
<p>LREs degrade much of the protein they take up from the intestinal lumen within their lysosomal vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>). To test if microbes affect the protein degradation process, we employed a pulse-chase assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>) to compare the rate of protein degradation between GF and CV larvae (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). At 6 dpf, larvae were gavaged with mTurquoise (25 mg/mL), a pH-insensitive protein that degrades rapidly in LREs (Figure S2). One hour after gavage, the remaining luminal mTurquoise was flushed with PBS, and live larvae were imaged with confocal microscopy over the course of 1 hour. In both GF and CV larvae, mTurquoise degraded over the 1-hour imaging time course (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B â 2C</xref>), with the degradation process occurring at a significantly faster rate in GF compared to CV LREs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Together, these uptake and degradation kinetics assays demonstrate that the microbiome reduces the rate of cargo uptake and lysosomal protein degradation in LREs.</p>

<p>Clustering analysis with Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Satija et al. 2015</xref>) revealed seventeen cell clusters, including two LRE clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Each of these clusters was characterized by transcriptomic signatures that distinguished them from other clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) (Supplementary Tables A â C). Ileocytes are an ileal enterocyte population that specialize in bile salt recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wen et al. 2021</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>fatty acid binding protein 6</italic> (<italic>fabp6</italic>), a top ileocyte cluster marker, was also expressed in both LRE clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Using transgenic reporters, previous studies showed that <italic>fabp6</italic> expression is highest in the ileocytes, but expression was also detected in the anterior LRE region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wen et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lickwar et al. 2017</xref>). We, therefore, termed the LRE cluster with the higher <italic>fabp6</italic> expression in our scRNAseq dataset âanterior LREsâ and the LRE cluster with lower <italic>fabp6</italic> expression âposterior LREsâ. In total, this dataset includes 131 GF and 199 CV anterior LREs, along with 359 GF and 381 CV posterior LREs (Figure S3A).</p>
<p>GF and CV larvae had proportionally similar numbers of cells in each cluster, including LREs (Figure S3B), with the exception of a cluster we called Cloaca 3, which was only present in the CV condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). GO term analysis revealed that Cloaca 3 consisted of IECs that are enriched in pathways related to host defense, response to bacteria, and iron ion transport (Fig S3C). Several of the genes involved in bacterial response were top cluster markers for Cloaca 3 (Figure S3D). These include genes involved in sensing bacteria through lipopolysaccharide-binding, neutrophil recruitment, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kanther et al. 2011</xref>). Their expression was markedly higher in Cloaca 3 than neighboring clusters (Figure S3E). For example, one of the Cloaca 3 marker genes was serum amyloid a (<italic>saa</italic>), which is known to be induced by microbiota in the distal intestine and cloaca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Murdoch et al. 2019</xref>). These results suggest that development of Cloaca 3 cells is stimulated by the microbiome and functions in microbial sensing and immune response.</p>
<p>Our scRNAseq data indicated that LRE numbers were similar in the presence or absence of the gut microbiome (Figure S3A). To quantitatively determine if microbes affect the number of LREs, we gavaged DQ-red BSA to mark the LRE lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Marwaha and Sharma 2017</xref>) in GF and CV larvae and computationally segmented LREs using ilastik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sommer et al. 2011</xref>) (Figure S3F). This experiment revealed that there is not a significant difference in the number of active LREs between GF and CV larvae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Together, these data show that the development of most intestinal cell clusters, including LREs, is not dependent on the gut microbiome. The notable exception is Cloaca 3, which only appeared in the presence of gut microbes.</p>

<title>Identification of cell types with protein uptake capacity</title>
<p>Next, we explored the effects of the gut microbiome on mCherry uptake throughout the gut. Surprisingly, scRNA-seq analysis revealed that mCherry is internalized by several cell types in addition to LREs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4AâB</xref>). While LREs had the highest percentage of mCherry-positive cells, other mCherry-positive cell types included ileocytes, goblet, acinar, enteroendocrine, immune and <italic>best4/otop2</italic> cells in both GF and CV conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, anterior enterocytes, pharynx, and cloaca clusters contained extremely low levels of mCherry-positive cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), showing that these cell types have very low protein uptake activity.</p>

</fig>
<p>The gut microbiome increased the proportions of mCherry-positive cells in several clusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). This effect could be observed in secretory cells such as enteroendocrine, goblet cells, and acinar cells, which increased by 25%, 11%, and 8%, respectively. The gut microbiome also increased the proportion of mCherry-positive neurons by 13%. Notably, the proportion of mCherry-positive anterior (84 â 91%) and posterior (98 â 97%) LREs was extremely high in both GF and CV conditions, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). However, the gut microbiome had mixed effects on the number of mCherry-positive LREs. While anterior LREs had a slightly higher proportion of mCherry-positive cells in the CV condition (7% increase), microbes caused a small decrease in the proportion of mCherry-positive posterior LREs (1% decrease) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4CâD</xref>). Regardless of microbial colonization, the proportion of mCherry-positive LREs remained high, underscoring the robust protein-uptake program in these cells.</p>
<p>Since the microbiome increased the proportion of mCherry-positive cells in many clusters, we proceeded to investigate the transcriptional program they hold in common. There were many differentially expressed genes between aggregated mCherry-positive and mCherry-negative cells in the CV condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The top upregulated genes in aggregated mCherry-positive cells (<italic>ctsbb</italic>, <italic>lrp2b</italic>, <italic>ctsl.1</italic>, <italic>dab2</italic>, <italic>cpvl</italic>, <italic>cubn</italic>, <italic>tdo2b</italic>, <italic>lgmn</italic>, <italic>fabp6</italic>, <italic>sptbn5</italic>) were also significant LRE cluster markers (Figure S4A). On the other hand, the most upregulated genes in aggregated mCherry-negative cells (<italic>fabp2</italic>, <italic>chia.2</italic>, <italic>fabp1b.1</italic>, <italic>apobb.1</italic>, <italic>apoa4b.1</italic>, <italic>apoa1a</italic>, <italic>tm4sf4</italic>, <italic>afp4.1</italic>, <italic>apoc2</italic>, <italic>apoc1</italic>) were also significant anterior enterocyte cluster markers (Figure S4B). This presumably reflects the high relative abundance of LRE and anterior enterocytes in the mCherry-positive and mCherry-negative groups, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). However, expression of the top differentially expressed genes also clearly delineated mCherry-positive and mCherry-negative cells in secretory cell clusters, including goblet, EEC and acinar cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, S4C-D). Differential expression of these genes between mCherry-positive and negative cells was significant in these clusters (Supplementary Table D). Upregulated genes in mCherry-negative cells were highly enriched in anterior enterocytes and mCherry-negative cloaca 3, acinar, pharynx and <italic>best4</italic>/<italic>otop2</italic> cells (Figure S4D). These data suggest that intact protein uptake in non-LRE cells is associated with the expression of a subset of markers involved in protein uptake in LREs.</p>

<title>Regional expression patterns and responses to the microbiome in LRE clusters</title>
<p>Despite similarities between LREs and mCherry-positive cells from other clusters, LREs maintained distinct transcriptional patterning that distinguished them from other cell types, including close clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). For example, KEGG pathway analysis confirmed that the lysosome pathway was strongly upregulated in anterior and posterior LREs in both GF and CV conditions (S5AâS5D), distinguishing them from their closest cluster neighbors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, S5E).

</fig>
<p>Anterior and posterior LREs were distinguished by some notable differences in their transcriptional programs. Anterior LREs shared more transcriptional similarities to ileocytes than did posterior LREs. Bile salt transport genes, fatty acid binding protein (<italic>fabp6</italic>) and solute carrier family 10 member 2 (<italic>slc10a2</italic>), were highly expressed in ileocytes, but expression also occurred in the LRE clusters at a gradient from anterior to posterior LREs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5CâD</xref>). Further evidence of shared expression patterns between ileocytes and anterior LREs can be seen in their expression of tryptophan metabolic genes. Tryptophan metabolism was a significantly upregulated KEGG pathway in anterior LREs in the GF and CV conditions (Figure S5A-S5B). Expression of tryptophan metabolic genes, including kynurenine 3-monoxygenase (<italic>kmo</italic>) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase a (<italic>tdo2a</italic>), occurred in LREs and ileocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5DâE</xref>). Anterior LREs showed high expression of tryptophan metabolic genes (<italic>tdo2b</italic>, <italic>aldh9a1a.1</italic>, <italic>kmo</italic>, <italic>tdo2a</italic>, <italic>ddc</italic>) in the GF and CV conditions (Figure S5GâS5H). Furthermore, anterior and posterior LREs were distinguished by differential expression of several peptidases (Figure S5I).</p>
<p>Several genes were differentially expressed between GF and CV conditions in the anterior and posterior LREs (S5J-S5K) (Supplementary Table E). The differences between the GF and CV conditions were most apparent in posterior LREs where expression of several peptidase genes was higher in GF than in CV larvae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Carboxypeptidase vitellogenic like (Cpvl), a serine carboxypeptidase, and Cathepsin La (Ctsla), a cysteine-type peptidase, are predicted to localized to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mahoney et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tingaud-Sequeira and CerdÃ  2007</xref>). Peptidase M20 domain containing 1, tandem duplicate 2 (Pm20d1.2) is an amino acid hydrolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Long et al. 2016</xref>). These results raise the possibility that higher expression of protein-degradation genes <italic>cpvl, ctsla</italic> and <italic>pm20d1.2</italic> contributes to the faster degradation rates we observed in GF LREs.</p>
<p>In the CV condition, posterior LREs upregulated the expression of several genes involved in the immune response to bacteria (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). These include genes for several proteins that mediate the immune response to toll-like receptor signaling from bacteria, including <italic>LPS-responsive beige-like anchor protein</italic> (<italic>lrba</italic>), <italic>myeloid differentiation factor 88</italic> (<italic>myd88)</italic>, and <italic>hsp90b1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Karmarkar and Rock 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gibson et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Franzenburg et al. 2012</xref>; van der <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sar et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Graustein et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wang et al. 2019</xref>). MyD88 signaling helps to prevent bacterial overgrowth and clears intestinal pathogens (Van Der <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Vaart et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Karmarkar and Rock 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gibson et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Franzenburg et al. 2012</xref>; van der <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sar et al. 2006</xref>). MyD88 also regulates expression of <italic>JunD proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit</italic> (<italic>jund</italic>), a LPS-sensor that can induce inflammation in response to the intestinal bacteria, including <italic>Aeromonas</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Meixner et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al. 2022</xref>). <italic>EH-domain containing 1b</italic> (<italic>ehd1b</italic>) is upregulated in response to bacterial infection and is involved in vesicle-mediated transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dubytska et al. 2022</xref>). These patterns suggest that the microbiome stimulates posterior LREs to upregulate expression of genes involved in directing the immune response to intestinal bacteria.</p>
<p>The microbiome also stimulated expression of dopamine synthesis and signaling genes in posterior LREs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). These include <italic>dopamine decarboxylase</italic> (<italic>ddc</italic>), which decarboxylates tryptophan to synthesize dopamine and serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Koyanagi et al. 2012</xref>). Expression of <italic>GNAS complex locus</italic> (<italic>gnas</italic>), which is involved in the dopamine receptor signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lu et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Vortherms et al. 2006</xref>), was also elevated in CV posterior LREs. Interestingly, posterior LREs were the only cell cluster in which <italic>gnas</italic> and <italic>ddc</italic> expression was significantly higher in the CV than GF condition. These results suggest that the gut microbiome increases dopamine synthesis and signaling pathways in posterior LREs.</p>
<p>The microbiome also upregulated several genes related to iron ion transport and homeostasis in LREs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). In the CV condition, posterior LREs cells had significantly elevated levels of <italic>solute carrier family 11 member 2</italic> (<italic>slc11a2</italic>), <italic>ferroportin</italic> (<italic>slc40a1</italic>), and <italic>melanotransferrin</italic> (<italic>meltf</italic>) (S5K). Anterior LRE cells also showed increased expression of <italic>slc40a1</italic> and <italic>meltf</italic> (Figure S5K). Slc11a2 helps regulate the influx of iron into the cell, while ferroportin regulates the export of iron out of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yilmaz and Li 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bao et al. 2024</xref>). Melanotransferrin has iron-binding properties and is predicted to localize to the plasma membrane, where it transports iron into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sekyere et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dunn, Rahmanto, and Richardson 2007</xref>). Interestingly, melanotransferrin was an important cluster marker in Cloaca 3, a cell cluster that only occurred in the CV condition and is directly adjacent to LREs in the intestine (Figure S3D). These results suggest that upregulation of iron transport genes is a consistent response to microbiome in LREs and other epithelial cells in the distal intestine.</p>
<p>Together, these scRNA-seq data revealed that LREs upregulate genes in response to microbial colonization that are involved in innate immunity, iron homeostasis and dopamine-synthesis and signaling pathways, and they downregulate several peptidases that may linked to reduced protein degradation upon microbial colonization.</p>

<title>Individual strains of microbes differentially affect LRE activity</title>
<p>We next investigated if specific bacteria alter LRE kinetics and gene expression patterns. To this end, we turned to monoassociation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pham et al. 2008</xref>), where larvae are colonized with a single strain of bacteria at 3 dpf rather than the unfractionated microbiome used to colonize CV fish.</p>

Interestingly, we found that while mCherry uptake was only minimally reduced by <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic> and moderately reduced by <italic>P. mendocina</italic> and <italic>A. caviae</italic>, colonization with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> reduced mCherry uptake severely (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="597998v3_fig6.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we investigated the mechanisms by which <italic>V. cholerae</italic> reduced mCherry uptake in LREs. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> monoassociation did not significantly affect fish growth (Two-tailed T-test, p = 0.66, n =18 â 22) (Figure S6A), suggesting that interactions with LREs rather than systemic effects reduced uptake activity. To test if <italic>V. cholerae</italic> exposure induced acute effects on LRE uptake activity, we gavaged GF larvae with live <italic>V. cholerae</italic> or PBS. Thirty minutes after initial exposure, the larvae were gavaged again with mCherry (1.25 mg per mL). Interestingly, there was no difference in mCherry uptake between larvae that were initially gavaged with live <italic>V. cholerae</italic> or PBS (Figure S6A), indicating that longer-term exposure to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is required to reduce protein uptake activity in LREs. We next tested if <italic>V. cholerae</italic> monoassociation or CV conditions increased the rate of transcytosis in LREs, which could lead to reduced mCherry signal in LREs. To investigate this possibility, we gavaged GF, CV and <italic>V. cholerae</italic>-monoassociated larvae with mCherry (1.25 mg/mL) and then measured the mCherry signal in the pronephros at 4 hours PG. There was no difference in pronephros signal between these conditions, indicating that intestinal microbes were not causing LREs to increase mCherry trans-epithelial transport through transcytosis (Figure S6B). Finally, we tested if <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lowered mCherry uptake in LREs by reducing its concentration in the intestinal lumen, perhaps by promoting intestinal motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wiles et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Logan et al. 2018</xref>). To do so, we analyzed confocal images of GF and <italic>V. cholerae</italic>-colonized larvae taken at one hour PG and measured luminal mCherry concentration in the intestinal lumen proximal to LREs. The concentration was the same in both conditions (Figure S6C), showing that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> does not significantly reduce mCherry concentrations in the intestinal lumen within these timeframes.</p>
<p>Our monoassociation experiments suggested that microbes selectively affect LRE activity. To investigate if this effect is mediated by transcriptional regulation of specific protein uptake and degradation machinery genes, we employed quantitative hybridization chain reaction (HCR) RNA-FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choi et al. 2018</xref>) to compare expression of target genes between GF and monoassociated larvae. We focused on <italic>dab2</italic> and <italic>cubn</italic>, which encode endocytic components critical for the LREâs ability to internalize proteins and soluble cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to what we found previously using conventional in situ hybridization probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>), the <italic>dab2</italic> HCR probe was highly specific to LREs and pronephros (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). By comparing the integrated signal obtained from max projection of confocal stacks, we found that GF larvae had significantly higher levels of <italic>dab2</italic> expression than those colonized with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>dab2</italic> expression profiles in GF and <italic>V. cholerae</italic>-colonized larvae showed patterns reminiscent to those of mCherry uptake, with a peak in the anterior LREs that tapers off in the posterior LREs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Since mCherry uptake is dependent on Dab2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>), this pattern may help explain why mCherry uptake tends to peak in the anterior LREs.</p>
<p>Next, we tested the effects of these strains on <italic>cubn</italic> expression. Similarly to <italic>dab2</italic>, the <italic>cubn</italic> HCR probe highlighted LREs and showed faint fluorescence in pronephros (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). We found that while <italic>V. cholerae</italic> significantly reduced <italic>cubn</italic> expression, <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic> did not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). These patterns are consistent with the degree to which <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic> affected mCherry uptake in LREs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>cubn</italic> expression profile in LREs was different from <italic>dab2</italic>. It lacked an anterior peak, suggesting that <italic>cubn</italic> expression is perhaps more uniform throughout the LREs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the endocytic machinery, we also tested the effects of individual microbial strains on the expression of LRE-enriched proteases <italic>ctsh</italic> and <italic>ctsz</italic>. Our scRNA-seq data showed that these peptidases are highly upregulated in GF LREs. We found that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> reduced expression of <italic>ctsh</italic> and <italic>ctsz</italic> compared to <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic> and GF larvae, which presented similar levels of <italic>ctsz</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>â<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, our data reveal that microbial colonization reduces both protein uptake and degradation in LREs by modulating the expression of endocytic and lysosomal proteins. Our data also suggest that LREs have functional heterogeneity, which may represent some degree of specialization into two different clusters as suggested by the scRNAseq data.</p>

<title>LRE activity impacts the gut microbiome in a diet-dependent manner</title>
<p>We next investigated whether LRE activity has reciprocal effects on the gut microbiome. Our previous research demonstrated that <italic>cubn</italic> mutants have significantly reduced survival compared to heterozygotes when they are fed a low protein diet from 6 to 30 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>). We hypothesized that the combination of the <italic>cubn</italic> mutation with a low protein diet fostered a microbial community that further reduced the hostâs protein uptake capabilities.</p>
<p>To explore this possibility, we tested the combined effects of the <italic>cubn</italic> mutation and custom-formulated, isocaloric high and low protein diets (see Materials and Methods) on the larval zebrafish microbiome. We fed high-protein (HP) or low-protein (LP) diets to <italic>cubn</italic> heterozygote and homozygous mutant siblings from 6 to 30 dpf, then performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on whole larvae to identify microbial populations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Initial analyses highlighted that zebrafish larvae developed bacterial communities that were distinctly different from the diets and tank water (Bray Curtis distance, p = 0.0001) (Figure S7A). Larval microbiomes from different tanks were not significantly different in either HP (Bray Curtis distance, p = 0.08) or LP-fed (Bray Curtis distance, p = 0.13) conditions (Figure S7B). Diet strongly affected microbiome composition in heterozygotes (Bray Curtis distance, p = 0.001), but not in <italic>cubn</italic> homozygous mutants (Bray Curtis distance, p=0.18) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B-C</xref>). Mutants had significantly different microbiomes than heterozygotes when they were fed a LP diet (Bray Curtis distance, p = 0.023), but not a HP diet (Bray Curtis distance, p = 0.34) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B-C</xref>). In contrast, beta dispersion was not significantly different between HP or LP-fed <italic>cubn</italic> heterozygotes and mutants (Bray Curtis dispersion, p = 0.24) (Figure S7C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zaneveld, McMinds, and Thurber 2017</xref>). Some of these effects may reflect differences in taxonomic richness, which was significantly impacted by genotype and diet (1-way ANOVA, p = 0.042) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). LP-fed <italic>cubn</italic> mutants had significantly lower microbial richness than HP-fed mutants (Two tailed t-test, p= 0.0094, n = 6 - 9). These results suggest that the combination of the LP-diet and <italic>cubn</italic> mutation lowers taxa richness and affects the mutant microbiome.</p>

<p>The broad differences in microbiome diversity led us to investigate class and genus-level effects of the <italic>cubn</italic> mutation and LP diet on the microbiome. The effects of dietary protein on the microbiome were clearly seen at the class level (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Gammaproteobacteria were significantly more abundant in HP than LP-fed heterozygotes (DESeq2, padj = 0.02). LP-fed mutants were deficient in Alphaproteobacteria, which were more abundant in LP-fed heterozygotes (DESeq2, padj = 0.021) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Indeed, one important trend was that mutants consistently had fewer differentially abundant taxa than heterozygotes at the class and genus levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). The few taxa that were more abundant in mutants than heterozygotes emerged when they were fed the LP diet (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>
<p>The impacts of dietary protein and the <italic>cubn</italic> mutation on the microbiome were also apparent at the genus level (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>â<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7G</xref>) (Supplementary Table F). <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. were significantly more abundant in HP than LP-fed heterozygotes (DESeq2, padj = 0.002) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). One genus, <italic>Hassalia</italic>, was significantly more abundant in LP-fed mutants than in heterozygotes (DESeq2, padj = 6.04E-21). Independently of diet, <italic>Aeromonas</italic> spp. were more highly abundant in <italic>cubn</italic> mutants than heterozygotes (DESeq2, padj = 0.01) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>). Interestingly, our monoassociation experiments demonstrated that a member of <italic>Aeromonas</italic> genus, <italic>A. caviae</italic>, can reduce protein uptake activity in LREs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these results suggest that LRE activity and dietary protein content can interactively affect the larval zebrafish microbiome. The combination of the LP diet and <italic>cubn</italic> mutation cause a less rich microbiome to develop. Furthermore, the <italic>cubn</italic> mutation may lead to the proliferation of certain microbes that can reduce protein uptake activity in LREs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of our investigations reveal reciprocal interactions between LREs and the gut microbiome that impact host nutrition. We show that the gut microbiome slows the rates of protein uptake and degradation in LREs and reduces expression of lysosomal protease genes. We also found that monoassociated bacteria such as <italic>Aeromonas</italic> and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> reduce protein uptake in LREs and downregulate expression of endocytic and protease genes. Finally, we show that impaired LRE protein uptake activity and dietary protein content impact the microbiome.</p>
<p>Precise delivery of fluorescent cargoes to the gut via gavage provided a quantitative assay that allowed us to uncover that the gut microbiome reduces the rate of cargo uptake and protein degradation in LREs. These effects were caused by microbially-induced metabolic effects in the LREs, not quantity of LREs that developed or the availability of luminal protein. The significance of the microbe dependent downregulation of protein uptake remains unclear. One possibility is that this effect limits the transepithelial transport of microbial products, which occurs as a byproduct of the endocytic activity of LREs, thus dampening the expression of pro-inflammatory markers. This microbial suppression of the principal physiologic function of LREs (i.e., protein uptake and degradation) is strikingly similar to the microbial suppression of genes involved in lipid absorption in enterocytes within small intestine of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Camp et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Willms et al. 2022</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Camp et al. 2014</xref>). This suggests that microbial inhibition of absorptive gene expression programs across enterocyte populations may be a broader conserved theme in intestinal physiology.</p>
<p>Recent scRNA-seq studies suggested that the gut microbiome affects the transcriptome of LREs and other ileal cell types in zebrafish by upregulating expression of immune markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Massaquoi et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jones et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Willms et al. 2022</xref>). Our dataset also showed that microbes upregulated expression of immune markers in LREs. However, the immune markers that other studies attributed to LREs were not upregulated by LREs in our dataset. For example, we found that several of these immune markers (<italic>saa, prdx1, lect2l)</italic> were actually upregulated in cloaca cells, not LREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Willms et al. 2022</xref>). These misalignments could result from previous datasets including relatively few LREs that were over-clustered with cloaca, pronephros or other ileal cells. Furthermore, these studies did not functionally evaluate intestinal protein absorption, making it difficult to assess the impact of microbes on LRE-dependent processes. Sequencing FACS-sorted IECs minimized contamination from other tissues like the pronephros. Furthermore, we captured a larger number of bona fide LREs from GF and CV larvae that were positively identified in our dataset by their fluorescent label and transcriptional program. Thus, our single cell dataset provides a high degree of resolution into the effects of the microbiome on LREs and IECs and made it possible to differentiate anterior from posterior LREs.</p>
<p>Labeling intestinal cells by mCherry gavage allowed us to identify all intestinal cells that take up luminal protein, including EECs, goblet and acinar cells. These cells showed greater expression of LRE markers than mCherry-negative secretory cells. Unlike LREs, they do not appear to play a significant role in protein absorption as gavaging with DQ Red BSA, which labels cells with lysosomal degradation activity, did not label these cells. Remarkably, anterior enterocytes and <italic>best4/otop2</italic> cells were completely mCherry-negative, indicating that they are virtually devoid of endocytic activity.</p>
<p>The proportion of mCherry-positive secretory cells was greater in the CV condition. EECs are known for sensing intestinal nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goldspink, Reimann, and Gribble 2018</xref>), but they also influence the intestinal inflammation response to the gut microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Worthington, Reimann, and Gribble 2018</xref>). Intestinal microbes, including <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, regulate EEC signaling activity in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ye et al. 2019</xref>). In the mouse intestine, some EECs have a synaptic connection to neurons through neuropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">BohÃ³rquez et al. 2015</xref>), which could facilitate the uptake of mCherry by neurons that we detected. Neuronal expression of <italic>cldn15la</italic> was detected in our data and other datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Willms et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sur et al. 2023</xref>), allowing them to be captured by our cell sorting here. Goblet cells secrete a mucous barrier that protects the intestinal epithelium from microbial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Belkaid and Hand 2014</xref>). They also sample luminal antigens and endocytose luminal cargoes as a byproduct of membrane recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birchenough et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mcdermott and Huffnagle 2014</xref>). Similarly, acinar cells secrete digestive enzymes and antimicrobial peptides into the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yee, Lorent, and Pack 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahuja et al. 2017</xref>). The gut microbiome may stimulate mucin production and the exocytosis of antimicrobial peptides, which would cause these cells to upregulate their compensatory endocytic activity and lead to mCherry uptake. We speculate that the mCherry uptake we observed in these non-LRE cell types could be related to these respective known functions.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of LREs were mCherry-positive regardless of microbial colonization. This result aligns with our kinetic assays, which showed that LREs have protein uptake activity in both GF and CV conditions. However, our gavage assays showed that anterior LREs in the GF condition took up protein more rapidly than they did in the CV condition. However, the anterior LREs accumulate more protein than posterior LREs in both the GF and CV conditions. The high uptake activity in this anterior LRE region may be due to greater expression of <italic>dab2</italic>, which our HCR results support. Thus, the anterior LRE region has a greater dynamic range in protein uptake activity, and that may partially explain why the effect of the microbiome was more apparent in this region. In addition, anterior LRE protein uptake activity may have remained more active than posterior LREs in both GF and CV conditions due to reduced expression of innate immune factors compared to posterior LREs. Through high rates of apical endocytosis, LREs could be exposed to large amounts of microbial antigens. Posterior LREs upregulated inflammatory response genes in the CV condition, but anterior LREs did not. Furthermore, anterior LREs showed higher expression of tryptophan metabolism genes than posterior LREs, which may attenuate their inflammatory response to the microbiome. Tryptophan metabolites, including kynurenine derivatives, are AhR receptor ligands that downregulate host immune response to bacterial antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bessede et al. 2014</xref>). However, tryptophan metabolism may be an important microbiome-tolerance pathway in both LRE regions. The microbiome induced expression of <italic>haao</italic>, an enzyme that produces kynurenine metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Xue et al. 2023</xref>), in posterior LREs. These results suggest that tryptophan metabolic activity in LREs could participate in host tolerance of the gut microbiome, and inflammation may affect protein uptake activity in LREs</p>
<p>LREs may play a role in shaping the gut microbiome community by impacting luminal iron levels. Microbes strongly upregulated expression of iron-ion transport genes in LREs that control the influx and efflux of cellular iron. The microbiome increases intestinal iron absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mayneris-Perxachs, Moreno-Navarrete, and FernÃ¡ndez-Real 2022</xref>), but its effect on iron absorption in LREs is unknown. Host iron nutrition and luminal iron levels can affect the gut microbiome community and proliferation of microbial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mayneris-Perxachs, Moreno-Navarrete, and FernÃ¡ndez-Real 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dostal et al. 2012</xref>). Iron absorption and secretion by LREs may affect the gut microbiome community and play a role in host-microbiome homeostasis.</p>
<p>The impact of intestinal microbes on LRE activity may be dependent on their inflammatory properties. Monoassociating larvae with <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic>, <italic>P. mendocina</italic>, <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, and <italic>A. caviae</italic> produced differential effects on protein uptake activity and expression of endocytic machinery. <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic> may be classified as an anti-inflammatory bacteria because it reduces intestinal neutrophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rolig et al. 2015</xref>). Colonization with <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic> only mildly reduced protein uptake activity, and it did not reduce expression of endocytic machinery. In contrast, the pro-inflammatory strains, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>A. caviae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rolig et al. 2015</xref>), reduced LRE activity and endocytic expression. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> colonization causes intestinal neutrophil recruitment and stimulates macrophages to express TNF-alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wiles et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ngo, Amitabh, Sokoloff, Trinh, Wiles, Guillemin, and Parthasarathy 2024</xref>). Importantly, the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strain we used here does not encode cholera toxin or toxin-coregulated pilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Stephens et al. 2016</xref>). This strain has been shown to increase intestinal contractility in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ngo, Amitabh, Sokoloff, Trinh, Wiles, Guillemin, Parthasarathy, et al. 2024</xref>) and may affect protein absorption under nutrient limiting conditions. However, in our gavage assays the luminal protein concentrations are never limiting and were not affected by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> colonization (Fig. S6D). Future studies could identify the underlying bacterial signals causing LREs to regulate protein uptake activity and host signal transduction mechanisms.</p>
<p>Our investigations into the impact of LRE protein uptake activity on the gut microbiome revealed diet-dependent effects on the microbial community. LP-fed, <italic>cubn</italic> mutants developed a distinct microbiome community with diminished species richness. <italic>Aeromonas</italic> was the only genus that proliferated in <italic>cubn</italic> mutants compared to heterozygotes. While <italic>Aeromonas</italic> is considered a part of the core zebrafish gut microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Roeselers et al. 2011</xref>), some species are inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rolig et al. 2015</xref>). As discussed, <italic>A. caviae</italic> can reduce LRE protein uptake activity. This result suggests that host protein deprivation through the impaired LRE activity may lead to proliferation of proinflammatory bacteria like <italic>Aeromonas</italic> that can further reduce protein uptake activity by LREs.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results show reciprocal regulation between LREs and the gut microbiome, along with the impact of the gut microbiome on protein uptake by IECs. These results pave the way to identify microbial signals or antigens that reduce protein uptake activity by LREs. Future studies could characterize the effect of microbes on protein-uptake by secretory cell populations. Further investigations into the tryptophan metabolism, iron ion transport, and expression of bacteria-sensing genes by LREs could reveal mechanisms for host-microbiome homeostasis.</p>

<title>Gnotobiotic zebrafish husbandry</title>
<p>Previously described gnotobiotic husbandry methods were used to raise GF, CV, and monoassociated larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pham et al. 2008</xref>). Briefly, embryos were treated with antibiotic zebrafish media, followed by iodine and bleach washes to eliminate microbes from their chorions at 0 dpf. Following microbe-removal steps, embryos were housed in sterile cell culture flasks containing autoclaved gnotobiotic zebrafish media (GZM) and incubated at 28Â°C. Each flask contained 30 embryos in 30 mL media. At 3 dpf, gnotobiotic larvae were either conventionalized, monoassociated, or remained in the GF condition. In this process, 80% of the media was replaced. The media in GF and monoassociated flasks was replaced with 24 mL autoclaved GZM, while CV flasks received 12 mL autoclaved GZM and 12 mL 5 Âµm-filtered zebrafish system water. After this step, gnotobiotic zebrafish either (Protocol A) continued to be raised as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pham et al. 2008</xref>), or (Protocol B) they were raised by our modified protocol designed to boost the bacterial load. In Protocol A, each flask was given 100 ÂµL ZM000 daily from 3 â 5 dpf following media changes, and 80% of the media was replaced with autoclaved GZM from 4 â 5 dpf. In Protocol B, flasks are given 150 ÂµL ZM000 from 3 â 5 dpf, and 40% of the media was replaced with autoclaved GZM from 4 â 5 dpf. The scRNA-seq (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> â <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), lucifer yellow gavage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), and long-term mCherry gavage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D â E</xref>) larvae were raised according to Protocol A. The larvae used in rapid mCherry-uptake (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B â C</xref>), mTurquoise degradation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), and monoassociation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) experiments were raised according to Protocol B. At the 6 dpf endpoint, GF flasks were tested for sterility by spot-testing on TSA plates, as well as brain-heart, dextrose and nutrient broth. The bacterial density in CV and monoassociated media was tested by serial dilutions on TSA plates. Zebrafish larvae were monoassociated with <italic>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</italic> ZOR0008, <italic>Aeromonas caviae</italic> ZOR0002, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> ZWU0020 or <italic>Pseudomonas mendocina</italic> ZWU0006 that were previously isolated from conventionally-reared zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Stephens et al. 2016</xref>). Bacteria stocks used in monoassociation were kept in 50% glycerol at â80Â°C for long term storage and on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates at 4Â°C for short term storage. Bacteria were cultured by incubating picked colonies in LB liquid media on a shaker table at 30Â°C for 24 â 72 hours to reach turbidity with an OD600 of 1 â 3. Cultures were re-suspended in 1X PBS after spinning at 5,000 RPM for 2 minutes. The bacterial density (CFU/mL) was determined by plating serial dilutions on TSA plates and incubating overnight at 37Â°C. Re-suspended bacteria was added to GF flasks to colonize larvae at 3 dpf. For the mCherry gavage experiment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), GF larvae were colonized with approximately 6 x 10<sup>8</sup> CFU of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, <italic>A. caviae</italic>, <italic>P. mendocina</italic>, or <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic>.

<title>Rapid uptake</title>
<p>Larvae were gavaged with mCherry (1.25 mg/mL), then incubated briefly. After designated time intervals (5 â 40 minutes) post gavage (PG), mCherry was cleared from the intestinal lumen by gavaging larvae with 1X PBS. Following clearance, larvae were immediately preserved in 4% PFA in PBS. Samples were stored at 4Â° C overnight. The following day, larvae were mounted on glass-bottomed dishes and imaged by confocal microscopy.</p>
<p>Fluorescence profiles of mCherry uptake in LREs were generated by analyzing confocal images in ImageJ (version 1.53t). Images were z-projected as max intensity plots. The LRE region was delineated with a rectangular selection tool to generate plot profiles of mCherry fluorescence along the LRE region. The anterior LRE region was designated as the 50 - 150 Âµm region flanking peak fluorescence at 60 minutes PG. A 100 Âµm segment length was chosen because it encompasses approximately one third of the LRE region. In this experiment, the 50 â 150 Âµm position was selected because peak fluorescence occurred at approximately 100 Âµm, so analysis covers the most kinetically active LREs. The posterior LRE region was designated as the 100 Âµm region immediately distal to the anterior region (150 â 250 Âµm).</p>
<p>mCherry fluorescence in anterior versus posterior LREs was calculated from area under the curve (AUC) measurements (Figure S1A â S1B). The average AUC measure at each time point was calculated. These values were normalized by dividing them by the peak AUC value at 60 minutes post gavage in the GF condition. The regional differences in mCherry fluorescence between anterior and posterior LREs from 5 â 60 minutes post gavage was calculated with a 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroniâs multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>The rate of mCherry accumulation in anterior LREs (Figure S1C) was calculated next. The average and standard error in mCherry fluorescence at each time point was calculated for GF and CV conditions. These were normalized when they were divided by the maximum average value, which occurred in the GF condition at 60 minutes PG. A simple linear regression was used to calculate the difference in the mCherry-accumulation slopes between GF and CV conditions.</p>

<title>Long term uptake of mCherry (1 â 5 hours PG)</title>
<p>Following mCherry gavage (1.25 mg/mL), larvae were incubated, then preserved in 4% PFA at designated time intervals (1 â 5 hours PG). Samples were stored at 4Â°C overnight, then imaged by confocal microscopy. Confocal images were analyzed with ImageJ. The same protocol was used to process images. To compare mCherry and Lucifer yellow uptake in the whole LRE region, the average fluorescence and standard error were calculated for each 30 Âµm LRE segment in GF and CV conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-F</xref>). The difference in fluorescence profiles between GF and CV conditions at each time point was then calculated with a 2-way ANOVA. To do so, the average fluorescence in each segment (30 Âµm) of the LRE region (300 Âµm) was compared between the GF and CV conditions.</p>
<p>To compare the rate of mCherry uptake in anterior LREs, the average fluorescence and standard error were calculated for the 0 â 100 Âµm segment in GF and CV conditions. A simple linear regression calculated the difference in mCherry-uptake rate between conditions, along with the difference in slope from zero. A 100 Âµm segment length was chosen because it encompasses approximately one third of the LRE region. In this experiment, the 0 â 100 Âµm position was selected because peak fluorescence occurred at approximately 50 Âµm, so analysis covered the most kinetically active LREs.</p>

<title>Lucifer yellow uptake</title>
<p>Larvae were gavaged with 4 nL of Lucifer yellow (1.25 mg/mL), then incubated. Immediately before imaging, luminal Lucifer yellow was cleared with a 1X PBS gavage. Larvae were live imaged to avoid signal quenching by PFA. The same protocol was used to process these images as mCherry-gavaged larvae. To compare Lucifer yellow uptake in the whole LRE region, the average fluorescence and standard error were calculated for each 50 Âµm LRE segment in GF and CV conditions. The difference in fluorescence between GF and CV conditions at each time point was then calculated with a 2-way ANOVA. The same statistical methods were used to calculate the 2-way ANOVA as the long-term mCherry uptake experiments.</p>

<title>mTurquoise degradation</title>
<p>Larvae were gavaged with mTurquoise (25 mg/mL) and incubated for 1 hour. Luminal mTurquoise was cleared with a 1X PBS gavage. Sedated larvae were mounted on glass-bottom plates and live imaged by confocal microscopy from 20 â 60 minutes post clearance.</p>
<p>mTurquoise fluorescence was quantified in the whole LRE region using ImageJ as described above. Live imaging allowed us to track mTurquoise degradation over time in individual fish. The maximum mTurquoise fluorescence value for each individual fish was calculated at the first time point (20 minutes). All mTurquoise fluorescence measures for each respective fish were then divided by the fishâs maximum value, effectively converting mTurquoise fluorescence measures to a 0 â 100% scale across all time points. After that, we calculated average mTurquoise fluorescence in individual fish at each time point and normalized to the fishâs average value at 20 minutes PG. Next, we generated a degradation curve by finding the mean and standard error across fish from GF or CV conditions. These values were linearized when we transformed the x-axis by dividing 1 by the time point (i.e., the x-axis value for the 20-minute time point would be 1/0.333 or 3). Finally, we calculated the difference in degradation rate between GF and CV larvae with a simple linear regression.</p>

<title>Microbial degradation of mCherry</title>
<p>We tested if the larval zebrafish microbiome can degrade mCherry. CV larvae (n = 27) were anesthetized with 0.22 Âµm-filtered Tricaine, then homogenized in GZM with a Tissue-Tearor<sup>TM</sup> (BioSpec Products, inc., model # 985370). The homogenate was spun at 5,000 RPM for 2 minutes and re-suspended in 1X PBS. mCherry was added to the zebrafish microbiome mixture and the 1X PBS control (25 Âµg/mL). The microbiome and control were added to a 96 well plate. The mCherry fluorescence was measured in each well periodically over 2 hours. Average mCherry fluorescence (AU) over time was compared between treatments with a simple linear regression.</p>

<title>Trans-epithelial transport</title>
<p>GF and CV larvae were anesthetized with 1X Tricaine at 6 dpf. Then, anesthetized larvae were gavaged with mCherry protein (1.25 mg/mL). Larvae were placed in a 28Â°C incubator to absorb the mCherry for 4 hours. At that point, larvae were fixed in 4% PFA and stored overnight at 4Â°C. Fixed samples were washed in 1X PBS three times before being mounted in 0.9% low-melt agarose in egg water. Imaging was done with a 25X objective and resonant scanner, and images were taken as z-stacks. Statistics were done by 1-way ANOVA with Tukeyâs multiple comparisons test.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>LRE segmentation</title>
<p>GF and CV larvae were anesthetized with 1X Tricaine at 6 dpf. Then, DQ-red BSA (50 Âµg/mL) was gavaged into larvae until the whole gut was filled with the gavage mixture (4 nL). After 0.5 hours of uptake, the larvae were flushed with a 1X PBS gavage until no visible red color was observed in the gut. Larvae were stored in a 28Â°C incubator for 3 hours after DQ-red BSA gavage. During this incubation period, DQ-red BSA fluorescence activated when the dye was catabolized by lysosomal proteases, thus marking the lysosomal vacuole of each LRE. Larvae were then anesthetized with 1X Tricaine, mounted in 1.3% low-melt agarose in egg water, and live imaged by confocal microscopy. Imaging was done on a Leica SP8 microscope using a 25X objective (Leica) and resonant scanner.</p>
<p>Images were imported into Ilastik version 1.3.3 and segmented by the Pixel Classification program. The program is trained to identify DQ-red BSA-filled LRE vacuoles by machine learning where 10 â 15 LRE vacuoles are manually marked per image. This process is carried out for 5 â 10 images before the program is allowed to train itself based on these manual feed-ins. Any errors made by the program are then manually corrected and used to improve the segmentation process. After the segmentation program is trained to have at least an estimated 85% accuracy, the results are exported as probability maps in .h5 format, which are then fed into Ilastikâs Object Classification program. The following parameters are used for the classification process: Method: Hysteresis; Smooth: Ï=1.0 for x-,y- and z-axis; Threshold: core=0.60, final=0.60; Donât merge objects. After checking the accuracy of object classification, the results are then exported as .cvs files from which the numbers of objects (in this case LRE vacuoles) are extracted. Statistics were done by 1-way ANOVA with Tukeyâs multiple comparisons test.</p>

Bacterial density in CV flasks ranged from approximately 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> â 5 x 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL. In total, 276 CV and 277 GF, GFP-positive larvae were gavaged with mCherry (1.25 mg/mL) and incubated for 4 hours to mark LREs with mCherry in addition to GFP. Then, larvae were dissociated, and cell suspensions were sorted by FACS as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>). The cell death marker, 7AAD (5 Âµg/mL), was added to cell suspension prior to FACS to remove dead cells. Cells were sorted on a MoFlo Astrios EQ cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) by the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource Center (Duke University). In total, 61,000 double-positive and 156,000 GFP-positive cells were collected from GF larval samples. From CV larval samples, 51,000 double-positive and 140,000 GFP-positive cells were collected. Cells were collected in RLT Plus Buffer (Qiagen RNeasy Plus Micro Kit: QIAGEN Cat No. 74034) media.</p>
<p>To test mCherry-uptake activity in this cohort, GF and CV larvae were gavaged with mCherry (1.25 mg/mL) at the same time as larvae destined for scRNA-seq. These larvae were incubated for 5 hours, then preserved in 4% PFA. They were confocal imaged the following day as described above.</p>

<p>Cell Ranger v3.0 (10X Genomics) was used to demultiplex sequencing files and align reads to the zebrafish reference genome, Danio Rerio GRCz11. Analysis was performed in RStudio (version 2023.12.1) using the Seurat package (version 5.0.1). Reads were filtered by the following criteria: UMIs/cell &gt; 500, genes/cell &gt; 250, Log10GenesperUMI &gt; 0.8, and mitoRatio &lt; 0.5. The SCTransform method was used for normalization. Cells were clustered with a resolution of 0.5. Cluster markers were identified using Seuratâs âFindMarkersâ function. Cluster identity was determined by cross-referencing marker genes to other scRNA-seq and RNA-sequencing datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wen et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Willms et al. 2022</xref>).

<p>HCR probes, hairpins, amplification, wash and hybridization buffers were purchased from Molecular Instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choi et al. 2018</xref>). Our methods were adapted from a previously published procedure for performing HCR on zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Munjal et al. 2021</xref>). At 6dpf, larvae were anesthetized and fixed in 4% PFA, then incubated on a shaker table for two hours. Larvae were washed with 1X PBS twice, followed by two cold acetone washes. Larvae were incubated in cold acetone at â20Â°C for 8 minutes, followed by three 1X PBS washes. For the detection stage, larvae were first incubated in probe hybridization buffer at 37Â°C for 30 minutes on a shaker. Larvae were incubated in probe solution (4 nM) on a shaker at 37Â°C for 24 â 48 hours. Excess probes were removed by washing larvae four times with preheated, 37Â°C probe wash buffer, incubating samples on a shaker table at room temperature for 15 minutes each time. This step was followed by two, 5 â 10 min SSCT washes on a shaker at room temperature. For the amplification stage, larvae were incubated in room temperature amplification buffer for 30 minutes. Hairpins (30 pmol) were prepared by heating at 95Â°C for 90 seconds, then snap-cooled in the dark at room temperature 30 minutes. Hairpins were added to amplification buffer. Larvae were incubated in the hairpin solution in the dark at room temperature overnight. Excess hairpins were removed with five SSCT washes on a shaker table at room temperature. The duration of the first two washes were 5 minutes, followed by two 30-minute washes and one 1-minute wash. Samples were protected from light during the washes. Larvae were imaged by confocal microscopy using a Leica SP8 microscope equipped with 10X and 25X objectives. The difference in HCR probe fluorescence profiles between GF and monoassociated larvae was calculated with a 2-way ANOVA. To do so, the average probe fluorescence in each segment (30 Âµm) of the LRE region (300 Âµm) was compared between the GF and monoassociated conditions.</p>

<title>16S rRNA gene sequencing</title>
<p>At 30 dpf, samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Larvae were anesthetized with 0.2 Âµm-filtered tricaine in autoclaved egg water. After the water was removed, larvae were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tank water samples were collected by passing 50 mL through a 0.2 Âµm filter (Pall Corporation MicroFunnel Filter Funnels #4803), then flash freezing the filter paper in liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Samples were put on dry ice during transport to the Duke Microbiome Shared Resource for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Larval DNA was extracted with the MagAttract PowerSoil DNA EP Kit (Qiagen, 27100-4-EP). Following the Earth Microbiome Project protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/">http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/</ext-link>), the V4 region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the 515F and 806R primers, which are barcoded for multiplexed sequencing. PCR product concentration was measured with the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (ThermoFisher, Q32854) on a Promega GloMax plate reader. Equimolar PCR products from all samples were pooled and sequenced with 250 bp PE reads on the MiSeq Illumina platform. Sequencing results are deposited at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (BioProject Accession #: PRJNA1188138).</p>
<p>Paired-end fastq files were demultiplexed in R (version 4.1.1). The <italic>dada2</italic> package was used to denoise the sequences, filter and trim reads, dereplicate reads, merge paired end reads, generate an amplicon sequence variant table, remove chimeras and generate a Phyloseq object. The Silva database (version 138.1) was used to assign taxonomy. Mitochondria and chloroplasts were filtered out of the dataset using the Phyloseq package (version 1.46.0). Phyloseq was used for downstream analysis of relative abundance and taxa richness. The DESeq2 package (version 1.42.0) was used to measure differential abundance. The ggplot2 package (version 3.5.0) was used to generate heatmap and relative abundance plots. The vegan package (version 2.6-4) was used to measure Bray Curtis distance.</p>

<p>The Bagnat and Rawls groups' previous published work (Park et al., 2019) described the kinetics and genetic basis of protein absorption in a specialized cell population of young vertebrates termed lysosome rich enterocytes (LREs). In this study they seek to understand how the presence and composition of the microbiota impacts the protein absorption function of these cells and reciprocally, how diet and intestinal protein absorption function impact the microbiome.</p>
<p>Strengths of the study include the functional assays for protein absorption performed in live larval zebrafish, which provides detailed kinetics on protein uptake and degradation with anatomic precision, and the gnotobiotic manipulations. The authors clearly show that the presence of the microbiota or of certain individual bacterial members slows the uptake and degradation of multiple different tester fluorescent proteins.</p>
<p>To understand the mechanistic basis for these differences, the authors also provide detailed single-cell transcriptomic analyses of cells isolated based on both an intestinal epithelial cell identity (based on a transgenic marker) and their protein uptake activity. The data generated from these analyses, presented in Figures 3-5, are valuable for expanding knowledge about zebrafish intestinal epithelial cell identities, but of more limited interest to a broader readership. Some of the descriptive analysis in this section is circular because the authors define subsets of LREs (termed anterior and posterior) based on their fabp6 expression levels, but then go on to note transcriptional differences between these cells (for example in fabp6) that are a consequence of this initial subsetting.</p>
<p>Inspired by their single-cell profiling and by previous characterization of the genes required for protein uptake and degradation in the LREs, the authors use quantitative hybridization chain reaction RNA-fluorescent in situ hybridization to examine transcript levels of several of these genes along the length of the LRE intestinal region of germ-free versus mono-associated larvae. They provide good evidence for reduced transcript levels of these genes that correlate with the reduced protein uptake in the mono-associated larval groups.</p>
<p>The final part of the study (shown in Figure 7) characterized the microbiomes of 30-day-old zebrafish reared from 6-30 days on defined diets of low and high protein and with or without homozygous loss of the cubn gene required for protein uptake. The analysis of these microbiomes notes some significant differences between fish genotypes by diet treatments, but the discussion of these data does not provide strong support for the hypothesis that &quot;LRE activity has reciprocal effects on the gut microbiome&quot;. The most striking feature of the MDS plot of Bray Curtis distance between zebrafish samples shown in Figure 7B is the separation by diet independent of host genotype, which is not discussed in the associated text. Additionally, the high protein diet microbiomes have a greater spread than those of the low protein treatment groups, with the high protein diet cubn mutant samples being the most dispersed. This pattern is consistent with the intestinal microbiota under a high protein diet regimen and in the absence of protein absorption machinery being most perturbed in stochastic ways than in hosts competent for protein uptake, consistent with greater beta dispersal associated with more dysbiotic microbiomes (described as the Anna Karenina principle here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28836573/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28836573/</ext-link>). It would be useful for the authors to provide statistics on the beta dispersal of each treatment group.</p>
<p>Overall, this study provides strong evidence that specific members of the microbiota differentially impact gene expression and cellular activities of enterocyte protein uptake and degradation, findings that have a significant impact on the field of gastrointestinal physiology. The work refines our understanding of intestinal cell types that contribute to protein uptake and their respective transcriptomes. The work also provides some evidence that microbiomes are modulated by enterocyte protein uptake capacity in a diet-dependent manner. These latter findings provide valuable datasets for future related studies.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I suggest that the authors clarify the level of protein in the standard fish food and how this relates to the protein levels in the high protein and low protein diets used in their microbiome study.</p>

<p>Childers et al. address a fundamental question about the complex relationship within the gut: the link between nutrient absorption, microbial presence, and intestinal physiology. They focus on the role of lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs) and the microbiota in protein absorption within the intestinal epithelium. By using germ-free and conventional zebrafishes, they demonstrate that microbial association leads to a reduction in protein uptake by LREs. Through impressive in vivo imaging of gavaged fluorescent proteins, they detail the degradation rate within the LRE region, positioning these cells as key players in the process. Additionally, the authors map protein absorption in the gut using single-cell sequencing analysis, extensively describing LRE subpopulations in terms of clustering and transcriptomic patterns. They further explore the monoassociation of ex-germ-free animals with specific bacterial strains, revealing that the reduction in protein absorption in the LRE region is strain-specific.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The authors employ state-of-the-art imaging to provide clear evidence of the protein absorption rate phenotype, focusing on a specific intestinal region. This innovative method of fluorescent protein tracing expands the field of in vivo gut physiology.</p>
<p>
- Using both conventional and germ-free animals for single-cell sequencing analysis, they offer valuable epithelial datasets for researchers studying host-microbe interactions. By capitalizing on fluorescently labelled proteins in vivo, they create a new and specific atlas of cells involved in protein absorption, along with a detailed LRE single-cell transcriptomic dataset.</p>
<p>
- Their robust and convincing microbiota analysis puts forward a diet-dependent mechanism of community change upon low-protein diet, intricately linked with the host.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for their thorough and kind assessment. We appreciate the suggestion for edits and for pointing out areas that needed further clarification.</p>
<p>One point in need of further explanation is the use <italic>fabp6</italic> (referred to as <italic>fabp2</italic> by the reviewer) to define anterior LREs and their gene expression pattern, which includes high levels of <italic>fabp6</italic>, something that was deemed a âcircular argumentâ by the reviewer.  The rationale for using <italic>fabp6</italic> as a reference is that we were able to define its spatial pattern in relation to other LRE markers and the neighboring ileocyte population using transgenic markers (Lickwar et al., 2017; Wen et al., 2021). Thus, far from being a circular argument, using <italic>fabp6</italic> allowed us to identify other markers that are differentially expressed between anterior and posterior LREs, which share a core program that we highlight in our study. In the revised manuscript, we clarified this point (lines 166 â 169).</p>
<p>We followed the Reviewerâs suggestion to test if LRE activity and dietary protein affected beta dispersal. Our analyses revealed that beta dispersion was not significantly different between our experimental conditions. We added details about this analysis (lines 384 â 386) and a new supplemental figure panel (Figure S7C).</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for the kind and positive assessment of our work, for suggestions to improve the accessibility and clarity of the manuscript, and for pointing out an issue related to a neuronal population that needed further clarification.</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a population of neurons that express <italic>cldn15la</italic>. They are not easily visualized by microscopy because IECs express this gene much more highly. However, the endogenous <italic>cldn15la</italic> transcripts can be found in neurons as shown in a recently published dataset (PMID: 35108531) as well as in this study We added a discussion point to clarify this issue (lines 463 â 465).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Childers et al. address a fundamental question about the complex relationship within the gut: the link between nutrient absorption, microbial presence, and intestinal physiology. They focus on the role of lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs) and the microbiota in protein absorption within the intestinal epithelium. By using germ-free and conventional zebrafishes, they demonstrate that microbial association leads to a reduction in protein uptake by LREs. Through impressive in vivo imaging of gavaged fluorescent proteins, they detail the degradation rate within the LRE region, positioning these cells as key players in the process. Additionally, the authors map protein absorption in the gut using single-cell sequencing analysis, extensively describing LRE subpopulations in terms of clustering and transcriptomic patterns. They further explore the monoassociation of ex-germ-free animals with specific bacterial strains, revealing that the reduction in protein absorption in the LRE region is strain-specific.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employ state-of-the-art imaging to provide clear evidence of the protein absorption rate phenotype, focusing on a specific intestinal region. This innovative method of fluorescent protein tracing expands the field of in vivo gut physiology.</p>
<p>Using both conventional and germ-free animals for single-cell sequencing analysis, they offer valuable epithelial datasets for researchers studying host-microbe interactions. By capitalizing on fluorescently labelled proteins in vivo, they create a new and specific atlas of cells involved in protein absorption, along with a detailed LRE single-cell transcriptomic dataset.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors present tangible hypotheses, the data are primarily correlative, and the statistical methods are inadequate. They examine protein absorption in a specific, normalized intestinal region but do not address confounding factors between germ-free and conventional animals, such as size differences, transit time, and oral gavage, which may impact their in vivo observations. This oversight can lead to bold conclusions, where the data appear valuable but require more nuance.</p>
<p>The sections of the study describing the microbiota or attempting functional analysis are elusive, with related data being overinterpreted. The microbiome field has long used 16S sequencing to characterize the microbiota, but its variability due to experimental parameters limits the ability to draw causative conclusions about the link between LRE activity, dietary protein, and microbial composition. Additionally, the complex networks involved in dopamine synthesis and signalling cannot be fully represented by RNA levels alone. The authors' conclusions on this biological phenomenon based on single-cell data need support from functional and in vivo experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for their assessment and for pointing out some areas that needed to be explained better and/or discussed.</p>
<p>The Reviewer mentions some potential confounding factors (ie., size differences, transit time, oral gavage) in the gnotobiology experiments. We would like to convey that these aspects have been addressed in our experimental design and are now clarified in the revised manuscript: 1- larval sizes were recorded and found to be similar between GF and monoassociated larvae (Figure S6A); 2- while intestinal transit time may be affected by microbes and is a topic of interest, in our assay luminal mCherry cargo is present at high levels throughout the gut and is not limiting at any point during the experiment; 3- gavage, which is necessary for quantitative assays, is indeed an experimental manipulation that may somehow alter the subjects (the same is true for microscopy and virtually any research method). However, it cannot explain differences between GF and CV or alter our conclusions via microbial or dietary effects. We now elaborate the former point in the revised discussion (line 426). A new panel has been added for Fig.S6 to show that standard length was similar in GF and monoassociated larvae (Figure S6A).</p>
<p>We are aware that microbial community composition is often highly variable between experiments and this necessitates adequately high biological replication and inclusion of internal controls to allow conclusions to be drawn. Nevertheless, studies evaluating the utility of 16S rRNA gene sequencing have found that this analysis reveals important impacts of environmental factors on the gut microbiome (PMIDs: 21346791, 31409661, 31324413). Our results provide further evidence that 16S rRNA gene sequencing remains a useful method to detect perturbations to the zebrafish gut microbiome. Reproducing previous findings, we detected many of the core zebrafish microbiota strains in our samples that have been identified by other studies (PMIDs: 26339860, 21472014, 17055441). To ensure the robustness of our results, we included several biological replicates for each condition, co-housed genotypes and included large sample sizes to minimize environmental variability between groups. In response to this reviewer concern, we have added a supplemental beta diversity plot and statistical analyses showing that the microbiomes in our larvae were significantly different from the diets or tank water (Figure S7A). This analysis shows that the host environment influenced microbial community composition (lines 376 â 378). We also added an additional supplemental panel and performed analysis showing that the experimental replicates (i.e., different tanks) were not a significant source of variation in this study (lines 378 â 380) (Figure S7B). This result underscores that the microbiota in these larvae were influenced by both the host and diet.</p>
<p>Regarding dopamine pathways, we acknowledge that it involves complex biology that will require dedicated studies. In this work, we simply point out gene expression patterns we find interesting as they may inform future studies.</p>
<p>Finally, the Reviewer mentions the use of inadequate statistical methods for some analyses without specifying or indicating alternative analyses, only the need to justify the use of two-way ANOVA is made explicit. In this point, we respectfully disagree and would like to emphasize that we use statistical methods that are standard in the field (PMID: 37707499). We nevertheless added a justification for the use of two-way ANOVA where appropriate (lines 635-637, 653-654, 773-776). The two-way ANOVA test was to compare fluorescence profiles of gavages cargoes or HCR probes along the length of the LRE region. This test accounts for differences in fluorescence between experimental conditions in segments (30 Î¼m) along the LRE region (~300 Î¼m). This allows us to capture differences in fluorescence between experimental conditions while accounting for heterogeneity in the LRE region. Please see our comment below for more information about our use of the 2-way ANOVA.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) This is a very satisfying and thorough analysis of the reciprocal influence of diet, microbiome, and host genotype on protein absorption by the host. Below I make suggestions that mainly relate to making the paper more accessible to a broader audience.</p>
<p>(2) Line 233 Starts a section that reports the findings of the scRNA dataset. The writing is inconsistent with respect to how the genes are listed: whether abbreviation only or spelled out followed by abbreviation. I prefer the latter. For example, slc10a2 is a bile acid Na cotransporter but for those not in the know, they would have to look this up. Perhaps adding a supplementary table that provides a gene list of those discussed in the text with abbreviation/spelled-out, and KEGG terms.</p>

<p>Due to the many colors of fluorescent proteins and HCR probes in this paper, we were not able to find an alternative plot line color to represent GF.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In Figure 2 I suggest consistency with respect to the order you present GF/CV</p>
<p>Figure 1 GF-&gt;CV</p>
<p>Figure 2 CV-&gt;GF</p>
<p>My preference is GF-&gt;CV</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Images in Figure 2 were re-ordered following reviewerâs recommendation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Here, 20 minute time point also appears qualitatively different between GF and CV.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There can be slight differences in LREs between individuals. These images were selected because they represented the average differences in the amount of mTurquoise degradation activity that occurred between 20 â 60 minutes post-flushing in the GF and CV conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 3E Figure legend refers to being able to see BSA in vacuoles. The image should be modified to show this- currently too small.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response, we enlarged the confocal microscopy images showing DQ red BSA in the LRE region (Figure 3E). We added a panel with confocal microscopy images of the LREs in 6 dpf larva gavaged with DQ red BSA (Figure S3F). These images show that DQ red BSA fluorescence was localized to the LRE lysosomal vacuole.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 5D, Posterior LRE should be pink not green in the key to the right of the heatmap.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for catching this error. We have corrected the colors (Figure 5D).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Introduction and context:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Expand the introduction to include more background on microbial-mediated protein absorption, with references to relevant findings in Drosophila. This will provide a stronger foundation for the study's contributions to the field.</p>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We added information about microbe-mediated amino acid harvest in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to the introduction (lines 49-53).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) Methodological suggestions:</p>
<p>Measure and report differences between germ-free (GF) and conventional (CV) animals, such as transit time, to account for potential confounding factors in protein absorption dynamics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully assert that a transit assay is not required for this study and could actually create confusion as an effect in transit time could be interpreted as a contributing factor when it is in fact not the case due to the experimental design. This is because the concentration of luminal protein was equivalent in GF and CV larvae (Figure S1E), so the LREs had equal saturating access to those proteins in both conditions. Furthermore, we showed the microbiota did not degrade fluorescent protein (Figure S1F). Therefore, we feel confident that there was lower protein uptake in the LREs of CV larvae because the microbiome exerted regulatory effects on LRE activity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Provide detailed information on the gating strategy used for single-cell sorting to enhance the dataset's utility and support claims about cell changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The methods we used for sorting cells were previously described (PMID: 31474562). In this manuscript, we describe them under the heading âFluorescence activated cell sorting for single cell RNA-sequencing.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Explain the &quot;GeneRatio&quot; metric in figure legends for clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The GeneRatio is the ratio of genes associated with each individual GO term to the number of genes associated with the domain. An explanation was added to the caption (Figure S3C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) Visual and statistical improvements:</p>
<p>Include images of labeled peptidases within lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs) to reinforce findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We added images of labeled peptidases in the LRE region (Figure S6E-D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For Panels 4-F and 5-D, consider using violin plots of selected genes to improve clarity and emphasize major ideas.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 4F, the heatmap shows multiple genes were upregulated in mCherry-positive cells. We tried the plotting suggested by the reviewer and felt that violin plots could not convey this message as clearly. Likewise, the heatmap in Figure 5D effectively shows the gradient of expression between ileocytes, anterior and posterior LREs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengthen statistical analysis by employing more rigorous methods and justifying their selection, such as using two-way ANOVA where appropriate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The two-way ANOVA was used to quantify protein uptake or HCR probe fluorescence along the length of the LRE region. This statistical test allowed us to compare differences in fluorescence between experimental conditions in multiple LRE segments (see Authoer response image 1 below for example). As our assays show, the LRE region is heterogenous with segments showing different levels of activity and gene expression. The two-way ANOVA is appropriate because it allows us to account for this heterogeneity by comparing fluorescence across multiple segments.</p>

<p>Our figures display these fluorescent levels in line plots (above, left) rather than bar plots (above, right). The results are easier to visualize interpret in line plots, and they display the fluorescence profiles in greater detail.</p>

<p>(14) Technical corrections:</p>
<p>Correct figure references: Figure 5 about tryptophan metabolism should be 5A, S5G-S5H.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We corrected the figure references.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 518: Spell out &quot;heterozygotes&quot; instead of using &quot;gets&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We changed the term from âhetsâ to âheterozygotes.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(15) Revise Figure S2 citation to match the actual figure labeling.</p>

<p>We corrected the text to indicate âFigure S2â rather than âFigure S2A.â</p>
<p>Additional manuscript modification</p>
<p>Â· Figure panels 3B-C, S3A-B, 4A-C: Two cluster were relabeled with improved descriptors based on our updated annotations. The clusters âPharynx-esophagus-cloaca 1â (PEC1) and PEC2 were relabeled as âPharynx-cloaca 1â and âPharynx-cloaca 2.â</p>
