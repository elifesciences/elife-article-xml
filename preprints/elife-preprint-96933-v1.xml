<title>Abstract</title><p>Recent studies in cancer cell lines have shown that the tetrameric Shieldin complex (comprising REV7, SHLD1, SHLD2, and SHLD3) facilitates non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), while blocking homologous recombination (HR). Surprisingly, several eukaryotic species lack SHLD1, SHLD2 and SHLD3 orthologs, suggesting that Rev7 may leverage an alternative mechanism to regulate the double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice. Exploring this hypothesis, we discovered that <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rev7 robustly interacts with the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) subunits, impedes G-quadruplex DNA synergised, HU-induced toxicity and facilitates NHEJ, while antagonizing HR. We identified a 42-aminoacid C-terminal fragment of Rev7 that was critical for its binding to the subunits of MRX complex, protect <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells from G-quadruplex DNA-HU-induced toxicity and promote NHEJ by inhibiting HR, whereas the N-terminal HORMA domain, a conserved protein–protein interaction module, was dispensable. We further demonstrate that the full-length Rev7 impedes Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities, without affecting the latter’s ATP-binding ability. Notably, we found that Rev7 binds with high affinity and specificity to G-quadruplex structures, as opposed to no binding to mixed-sequence single- and double-stranded DNA. These data uncover unanticipated insights into the functional interaction between the MRX subunits and Rev7, and highlight a mechanism by which it regulates the DSB repair pathway choice between HR and NHEJ in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A hallmark of low fidelity DNA polymerases, also known as DNA translesion synthesis polymerases (TLS polymerases), with no detectable proofreading activity, is their ability to catalyse DNA synthesis across a variety of bulky, helix-distorting DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Prakash et al., 2005</xref>; Vaisman et al., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Maiorano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ling et al., 2022</xref>). As a result, the TLS polymerases play important roles in a plethora of cellular processes, including but not limited to epigenetics, immune signalling, viral mutagenesis and cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). Indeed, translesion synthesis is a source of mutagenesis, potentially contributing to the development of cancer and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lange et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baranovskiy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Pilzecker et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> TLS Polζ (hereafter referred to as ScPolζ), comprising catalytic subunit Rev3, two copies of Rev7 regulatory subunits and accessory subunits Pol31 and Pol32, plays a pivotal role in TLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Makarova et al., 2012</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that the error rate during ScPolζ-catalysed replication of undamaged DNA templates is much higher than that of DNA polymerases, as it lacks 3′-to-5′ proofreading exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lawrence et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Huang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Northam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Zhong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kochenova et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this, <italic>S. cerevisiae rev3, rev7</italic> or <italic>pol32</italic> mutant strains show greatly reduced spontaneous mutation frequencies, confirming that ScPolζ is responsible for DNA damage-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Quah et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lawrence et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Morrison et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nelson et al., 1996</xref>, Makarova et al., 2015).</p>
<p>The TLS Polζ is conserved in a wide range of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, including fungi, plants, and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Maiorano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ling et al., 2022</xref>; Paniagua et al., 2023). While the catalytic subunit Rev3 alone is capable of replicating damaged DNA, Rev7 augments its catalytic efficiency by twenty- to thirtyfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Quah et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Morrison et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nelson et al., 1996</xref>, Makarova et al., 2015) and the accessory subunits Pol31 and Pol32 further raise it by three- to tenfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Makarova et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that they enhance the processivity of translesion DNA synthesis by Polζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acharya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bezalel-Buch et al., 2020</xref>). Biochemical and structural analyses have demonstrated that Rev7 (also known as MAD2B and MAD2L2) serves as a bridge between Rev3 and the scaffold protein Rev1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Haracska et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kikuchi et al., 2012</xref>; et al., 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Pustovalova et al., 2012</xref>). Structural analysis of ScPolζ, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), has revealed a remarkable level of organization, wherein its subunits interact with each other and align themselves to form a functional complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gómez-Llorente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Malik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Du Truong et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, structural studies on the ScPolζ holoenzyme suggest a model wherein subunits Rev3, Rev7, Pol31, and Pol32 form a pentameric ring-shaped structure, facilitated by an uninterrupted chain of protein-protein interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gómez-Llorente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Malik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Du Truong et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the cryo-EM structure of ScPolζ holoenzyme bound to an A:C mismatch show how the active site pocket accommodates mismatched duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Malik et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>A deluge of new findings have established that the tetrameric Shieldin complex - comprised of REV7, SHLD1, SHLD2 and SHLD3 – binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), blocks 5′ end resection and homologous recombination (HR), antagonizes the recruitment of BRCA1 to the DSB, while facilitating non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boersma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Mirman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Findlay et al., 2018</xref>; Gupta et el., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Tomida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Noordermeer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Subsequent studies have demonstrated that the C-terminal “seat belt” region of human Rev7 binds to the N-terminus of SHLD3 (Gupta et el., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Tomida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Noordermeer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Clairmont et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dai et al., 2020</xref>). Parenthetically, Rev7 deficiency has been linked to disease pathology: a notable example is the Fanconi anaemia in which biallelic <italic>REV7</italic> mutations are associated with hypersensitivity to ICL-forming compounds, accumulation of chromosome breaks during S/G2 phase of the cell cycle and enhanced p53/p21 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bluteau et al., 2016</xref>). While Rev7 is most well known as a component of TLS Polζ, it is also involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression by binding to CDH1, an activator of APC/C, modulate the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and facilitate mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Listovsky and Sale, 2013</xref>; Vaisman et al., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ling et al., 2022</xref>). However, a mechanistic understanding of how Rev7 regulates cell cycle events and how such roles differ or relate to its role in TLS remains underexplored. Although the emphasis of the findings differs, the fact that Rev7 functions as an anti-resection factor has spurred a new wave of experiments on DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clairmont and D’Andrea, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>At DSBs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Mre11–Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) in conjunction with Sae2 first catalyses endonucleolytic cleavage of 5′-terminated DNA strands and then its 3’→5’ exonucleolytic activity produces a short 3’-ssDNA overhang; subsequently, Exo1 and Dna2-Sgs1 redundantly generate long tracks of ssDNA that are critically important for HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). As such, the mechanism by which cells restrain over-resection of DSBs is unclear, although hyper-resection could potentially hinder optimal HR and trigger genomic instability. Surprisingly, however, Shieldin orthologs are absent in organisms such as yeast, fruit fly, nematode worm, zebrafish and frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</xref>). These data together prompted us to hypothesize that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rev7 (hereafter referred to as ScRev7) may recruit an unknown functional equivalent(s) of Shieldin orthologs to regulate the DSB repair pathway choice between HR and NHEJ. We thus reasoned that one specific alternative worthy of consideration is the MRX complex on the basis of current knowledge about its multiple roles in signalling, processing and repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). Here, we provide several lines of evidence, suggesting that ScRev7, through a 42-aminoacid C-terminal fragment in the “safety belt” region, directly interacts with Mre11, Rad50 or Xrs2 subunits, protects <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells from G-quadruplex DNA/HU-induced toxicity and facilitates efficient NHEJ while antagonizing HR. Mechanistically, ScRev7 binds with low-nanomolar affinity and specificity to G-quadruplex DNA, inhibits Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities, without affecting the ability of the latter to bind ATP. Collectively, our findings not only reveal unanticipated functional interactions between Rev7 and the MRX subunits, but also provide novel insights into how Rev7 regulates the pathway choice between HR and NHEJ in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

<title>ScRev7 directly interacts with the MRX subunits</title>
<p>As noted above, studies in cancer cell lines have documented that the Rev7-Shieldin effector complex facilitates NHEJ by blocking 5′ end resection and HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boersma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Mirman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Findlay et al., 2018</xref>; Gupta et el., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>). Given that Shieldin orthologues are absent <italic>in S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</xref>), we hypothesized that Rev7 may recruit alternative factors such as the MRX heterotrimer, to block HR and enable NHEJ. To test this premise, yeast two-hybrid assays (Y2H) were performed to identify potential protein–protein interactions between ScRev7 and the M/R/X subunits, whereas in follow-up studies we mapped the minimal region of ScRev7 required for its interaction with the MRX subunits. The yeast strain PJ69-4A was co-transformed with plasmids (prey vectors) encoding the Mre11, Rad50 or Xrs2 subunits and ScRev7 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (bait vector). The positive colonies were selected on SC/-Trp-Leu-His dropout medium containing 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fields and Song, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">James et al., 1996</xref>). The results showed robust growth in the selection medium containing 3-aminotriazole (3-AT), indicating Y2H interactions between ScRev7 and the Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2 subunits (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic>), whereas cells bearing empty vector and a plasmid expressing either Mre11, Rad50 or Xrs2 subunits did not yield any Y2H signals. Conversely, yeast cells transformed with prey and bait vectors expressing Rev7 showed robust growth (<italic>bottom panel of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic>), indicating that Rev7 forms homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Rizzo et al., 2018</xref>), which served as a positive control.</p>

<p>Given that Rev3 has been implicated in HR-mediated DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sonoda et al., 2003</xref>), we asked whether the MRX subunits interact with ScRev7 in the <italic>rev3</italic>Δ mutant strain. To test this hypothesis, the <italic>S. cerevisiae rev3</italic>Δ strain was co-transformed with a combination of bait (pGBKT7 or pGBKT7-<italic>REV7</italic>) and prey vectors (pGADT7, pGADT7-<italic>REV7</italic>, pGADT7-<italic>MRE11</italic>, pGADT7-<italic>RAD50</italic> or pGADT7-<italic>XRS2</italic>). Interestingly, we observed binary interactions between the subunits of MRX complex and ScRev7 in the <italic>rev3</italic>Δ mutant (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></italic>), indicating that Rev3 is not necessary for the interaction between ScRev7 with the MRX subunits. Analogously ScRev7 showed binary interactions with the subunits of MRX complex in the <italic>mre11Δ rad50Δ xrs2Δ</italic> triple mutant strain (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic>), further confirming that their association is independent of endogenous MRX subunits.</p>

<title>ScRev7 exhibits high-affinity binding to the MRX subunits</title>
<p>Microscale thermophoresis (MST) allows for quantitative analysis of protein-protein interactions in free solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Wienken et al., 2010</xref>). Since the binding of ScRev7 to the MRX subunits was unexpected, we sought to validate their interaction by an orthogonal assay and determine their binding affinities using purified proteins. We assessed the binding of ScRev7-eGFP (<italic><xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></italic>) to the Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2 subunits using the MST assay. The fraction of the indicated protein bound to ScRev7-eGFP was plotted as a function of concentrations (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></italic>). Normalized MST data were fitted to a logistic binding curve, resulting in an apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>) of 0.16 ± 0.07 and 0.23 ± 0.06 μM for Rad50 and Mre11 subunits, respectively, which is two- to threefold greater compared to Xrs2 (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></italic>). To confirm these findings, we purified <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rev1 (<italic><xref rid="fig1s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1— figure supplement 3</xref></italic>) and assessed its interaction with ScRev7 as positive control. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Rizzo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Guo et al., 2003</xref>), our results showed that Rev1 interacts with Rev7 with an affinity similar to that of Rev7 and Rad50 interaction (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></italic> and <italic>F</italic>). On the other hand, our results demonstrated that the MRX subunits do not interact with the negative control eGFP reporter (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></italic>). It is also noteworthy that the Hill coefficients (n<sub>H</sub>) indicate larger than one, implying positive cooperativity (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></italic>). The quantitative assessment of binding affinities together with Y2H data suggest that ScRev7 robustly interacts with the MRX subunits.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Models predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer reveal that Mre11 and Rad50 subunits independently associate with Rev7</title>
<p>To further characterize the interaction between the MRX subunits and ScRev7, we used a structure prediction algorithm, AlphaFold-Multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Evans et al., 2022</xref>), to generate structural models of ScRev7-Mre11 and ScRev7-Rad50 heterodimers. The models with the high pLDDT scores were considered for further analysis. Strikingly, the models indicated that Mre11 and Rad50 binding surfaces overlap with ScRev7 and thereby suggesting that the latter can only bind one of these proteins at a time (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></italic>). In the model of Rev7-Mre11 complex, residues Asp 206 and Ile 240 in the Rev7 C-terminal “safety belt region” (green) mediate dimerization with Mre11 through residues Asp 131 and Arg 181. Interestingly, His 127 in the Rev7 N-terminal HORMA domain also contribute its binding to Asp 131 of Mre11 (<italic><xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S1</xref></italic>). Furthermore, inspection of Rev7-Rad50 complex model showed that the ScRev7 C-terminal residues Lys 168, Glu 184, Asn 189 and Asp 188 mediate dimerization with ScRad50 via residues Glu 577, Lys 596 and Arg 603 (<italic><xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S2</xref></italic>). Curiously, AlphaFold-Multimer models also revealed that amino acid residues outside of the 42-residue fragment also contribute to pairwise interactions between Rev7 and the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits, although Y2H assays did not identify such interaction. Indeed, similar findings have been previously noted for several other interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">You et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Koegl and Uetz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hoff et al., 2010</xref>). A structural model of Rev7-Xrs2 heterodimer was not generated because Xrs2 alone has no known biochemical activity and thus was not considered for further investigation.</p>

<title>A 42-aminoacid C-terminal segment of ScRev7 is critical for its interaction with the MRX subunits</title>
<p>As the data from Y2H and MST assays, as well as AlphaFold-Multimer-based structural modelling, implied direct interaction between the MRX subunits and ScRev7, we sought to identify the putative functional domains in the ScRev7 in regulating the function of MRX subunits. To this end, we generated three N-terminally truncated species and an equal number of C-terminally truncated variants. We refer to these variants as Rev7-N1; Rev7-N2; Rev7-N3, and Rev7-C1, Rev7-C2 and Rev7-C3, respectively (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic>). We then examined for their ability to associate with the MRX subunits and thus survival of yeast cells on selective medium. Our experiments surprisingly revealed that cells expressing the ScRev7 N-terminally truncated variants showed robust growth in selection medium (<italic>bottom panel of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic>) similar to the WT (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref></italic>), indicating that they associate with the subunits of MRX complex. Further, these results also revealed that the HORMA domain encompassing residues 1-149 at the N-terminus, an evolutionarily conserved protein–protein interaction module, is dispensable for interaction between the MRX subunits and ScRev7 (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic>). Notwithstanding, we cannot exclude the possibility that it may play a function that is undetectable by the Y2H assay. We then performed Y2H experiments using the C-terminally truncated species (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></italic>). Notably, deletion of C-terminal 42-amino acid residues (i.e., 203-245) completely abolished the viability of the yeast cells (<italic>bottom panel of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></italic>). Similar abrogation of cell viability was also caused by deletion of the C-terminal 150 to 203 amino acid residues of ScRev7 (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></italic>). These results indicate that the C-terminal 42-residue segment of ScRev7 is critical for interaction with the MRX subunits.</p>

<p>Several studies have documented the genome-wide prevalence of G-quadruplex DNA structures in various organisms ranging from viruses to humans, which play regulatory roles in diverse cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rhodes and Lipps, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Spiegel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Yadav et al., 2021</xref>).

<p>Next, we asked whether the G-quadruplex DNA motifs affect cell viability in the absence or presence of DNA damaging agents, such as HU. To this aim, we tested the effect of G-quadruplex forming sequences, positioned on either the leading or lagging template strands, on the growth of WT, <italic>rev7</italic>Δ mutant and cells expressing the ScRev7 variants (Rev7-C1 or 42-residue C-terminal segment) in the absence or presence of HU.

<title>Rev7 exhibits high-affinity for G-quadruplex DNA structures</title>

In this regard, our results revealed that <italic>REV7</italic> alleviates G-quadruplex DNA synergised, HU-induced toxicity, raising the possibility that ScRev7 may interact with G-quadruplex DNA structures.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed under physiological conditions to test for their ability to bind a suite of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DNA substrates. In a protein titration experiment, we found that ScRev7 bound effectively to the G-quadruplex DNA substrates (TP-G4, 6G3-G4 and 4G3-G4), yielding &gt;90% protein-DNA complexes at the protein concentrations used (<italic><xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C—figure supplement 1A-C</xref></italic>). By contrast, it exhibited no detectable binding to mixed-sequence ssDNA or dsDNA (<italic><xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4— figure supplement 1D-E</xref></italic>). Furthermore, the mobility of ScRev7-DNA complexes was progressively decreased with increasing ScRev7 concentrations, suggesting cooperative binding of ScRev7 to G-quadruplex structures. As expected, the binding was lost when the G4 DNA capable sequences were mutated (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></italic> and <italic><xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">4D—figure supplement 1F</xref></italic>).

Further, it has been demonstrated that Mre11 cleaves non-B DNA structures such as DNA hairpins, cruciforms and intra- and inter-molecular G-quadruplex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ghosal and Muniyappa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Trujillo and Sung, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lobachev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ghosal and Muniyappa, 2005</xref>). To explore the functional significance of Mre11-Rev7 complex formation, an assay was performed wherein 5’-<sup>32</sup>P-labelled dsDNA and MRX subunits (in equimolar amounts) were incubated in the absence or presence of ScRev7. The reaction products were analyzed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ghosal and Muniyappa, 2005</xref>).

We then examined the effect of ScRev7 on MRX nuclease activity by co-incubating various concentrations of ScRev7 and fixed amounts of MRX subunits, prior to the addition of 5’-<sup>32</sup>P-labelled dsDNA. The results revealed that ScRev7 inhibited the MRX cleavage activity in a dose-dependent manner and almost complete inhibition was observed at 2 μM (<italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes 4-12</italic>). Interestingly, somewhat similar results were obtained with ScRev7-C1, although its inhibitory effect was noticeably less efficient than that of full-length ScRev7. Based on these data, we surmise that ScRev7-C1 does not faithfully recapitulate the Y2H results. Although the reason for this remains unclear, one possible reason for these discrepant results might be due to the interaction of amino acid residues in the ScRev7-C1 with Mre11, consistent with AlphaFold-Multimer modeling of the ScRev7-Mre11 heterodimer structure.</p>

<p>We next evaluated whether ScRev7 affects the ability of Rad50 to catalyze ATP hydrolysis using thin layer chromatography coupled with an image analysis. Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ghosal and Muniyappa, 2007</xref>), control reactions showed that Rad50 catalyzed [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP hydrolysis to ADP and <sup>32</sup>Pi, which increased in a manner dependent on its concentration (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E</xref></italic> and <italic>F</italic>). Interestingly, while ScRev7 itself has no ATPase activity, it suppressed ATP hydrolysis of Rad50 in a dose-dependent manner (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6G</xref></italic> and <italic>I</italic>).

As noted above, a possible explanation for this observation is that amino acid residues in the ScRev7-C1 may interact with Rad50, consistent with AlphaFold-Multimer modeling of the ScRev7-Rad50 heterodimer structure. These results were validated using colorimetric molybdate/malachite green-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lanzetta et al., 1979</xref>).

<p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the heterotrimeric MRX complex has been implicated in both Ku-dependent NHEJ and microhomology-mediated end joining repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Zhang and Paull, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boulton and Jackson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Moore and Haber, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ma et al., 2003</xref>). Multiple studies in cancer cell lines have shown that Rev7 inhibits DNA end-resection and favors NHEJ over HR (Gupta et el., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; Liang et al., 1972). To our knowledge, it is unknown whether these findings have been extended to other species. However, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Rev7 has been shown to inhibit long-range resection at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Leland et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, it is unclear whether the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rev1, Rev3 and Rev7 subunits are required for NHEJ. To investigate this, the efficiency of plasmid-based NHEJ repair was analyzed by transforming BamHI-linearized plasmid pRS416, which has no homology with the genomic DNA, into the WT and isogenic mutant strains as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boulton and Jackson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Moreau et al., 1999</xref>) (<italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></italic>). Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boulton and Jackson, 1998</xref>), we observed that NHEJ was undetectable in the <italic>mre11Δ</italic> mutant (<italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S3</xref></italic>). Notably, while the <italic>rev1Δ and rev3</italic>Δ strains showed a modest decrease in the efficiency of NHEJ, <italic>rev7Δ</italic> single and <italic>rev1Δ rev3</italic>Δ double mutants exhibited approximately four- and twofold decrease, respectively, compared with the WT. Further analysis revealed that the NHEJ efficiency in double mutants - <italic>rev1Δ rev7Δ, rev3</italic>Δ <italic>rev7Δ</italic> and <italic>sae2Δ rev7Δ</italic> - was comparable to that of <italic>rev7Δ</italic> mutant (<italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></italic> and <italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref></italic> —<italic><xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S3</xref></italic>). Intriguingly, however, we found that ScRev7-42 aa peptide, but not the Rev7-C1 variant, fully restored NHEJ efficiency in <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells to the WT levels. Together, these data indicate that Rev7 augments the efficiency to NHEJ-mediated DSB repair in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

<p>Next, we sought to verify our plasmid-based NHEJ results in a chromosomal context. To this aim, the NHEJ efficiency was determined using “suicide-deletion” assay in which the I-SceI induced DSB may be repaired preferentially via NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Karathanasis and Wilson, 2002</xref>). Briefly, it is based on an approach wherein galactose-induced I-SceI endonuclease creates a pair of site-specific DSBs, resulting in the deletion of its own coding region, thereby facilitating NHEJ-mediated repair (<italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></italic>). Using this approach, we determined the frequency of Ade2+ recombinants in the WT and isogenic mutant strains. A critical NHEJ factor Ku70 was used as a control. As expected, while NHEJ was undetectable in strains lacking <italic>MRE11</italic> and <italic>KU70</italic>, deletion of <italic>REV7, REV1</italic> and <italic>REV3</italic> led to a 9-fold, 2.3-fold- and 3.2-fold decrease, respectively, in the frequency of NHEJ compared with the WT. Of note, a fourteen-fold decrease in the frequency of Ade2+ recombinants were observed in the <italic>rev7-C1</italic> cells, which could be restored to WT levels by expressing the C-terminal 42 amino acid peptide (<italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S4</xref></italic>). The results reinforce the notion Rev7 promotes NHEJ repair at DSBs. The PCR product derived from genomic DNA of Ade2+ recombinants showed a 1.3 kb amplicon, suggesting faithful repair of I-SceI induced DSB (<italic><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref></italic>).</p>

<title>REV7 suppresses HR in S. cerevisiae</title>
<p>As noted above, the RIF1/REV7/Shieldin complex blocks DNA end resection and BRCA1-mediated HR, but promotes DSB repair through NHEJ in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gómez-Llorente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Malik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Du Truong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boersma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Mirman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Findlay et al., 2018</xref>; Gupta et el., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Tomida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Noordermeer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Liang et al., 2020</xref>); however, the generality of this finding remained largely uncharacterized. To this end, we leveraged a spot assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Paeschke et al., 2013</xref>) to assess the putative role of <italic>S. cerevisiae REV7</italic> in HR. In this assay, we examined the recombination frequency, under replication stress and standard growth conditions, between the <italic>ura3-1</italic> allele located at its endogenous location on chromosome V and <italic>ura3-G4</italic> allele on the pFAT10-G4 plasmid (<italic>ura3</italic> allele interrupted by G4 motifs) (<italic><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref></italic>). While Ura3<sup>+</sup> papillae formation was not observed in the <italic>ura3-1</italic> strain carrying the empty vector in both selective and non-selective media, the same strain with a plasmid containing G-quadruplex capable sequences exhibited Ura3<sup>+</sup> papillae formation, albeit fewer, only under non-selection conditions. Of note, we found that the <italic>ura3-1 rev7</italic>Δ strain carrying a plasmid with G-quadruplex motifs displayed a significant number of Ura3<sup>+</sup> papillae on non-selective and selective media, indicating that <italic>REV7</italic> suppresses HR frequency (<italic><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref></italic>). Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>), the nuclease-deficient mutant <italic>mre11-D56N,H125N</italic> alone (used as a positive control) and in combination with <italic>rev7</italic>Δ had no discernible effect on Ura3+ papillae formation on selective medium (<italic><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref></italic>). As expected, neither ScRev7-42 residue peptide nor Rev7-C1 altered the frequency of Ura3+ papillae formation on selective medium (<italic><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>, bottom two rows</italic>). Quantification revealed that the <italic>ura3-1 rev7</italic>Δ double mutant showed a 2.4-fold increase in HR frequency as compared to <italic>ura3-1</italic> and <italic>ura3-1 mre11</italic>-<italic>D56N,H125N</italic> mutant strains (<italic><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref></italic>). Since all tested strains formed Ura+ papillae in the absence of HU approximately at a similar frequency, they are likely to arise due to spontaneous DSBs and collapsed replication forks.</p>

<p>To confirm whether the G-quadruplex motifs stimulate HR in the <italic>rev7</italic>Δ strain, the frequency of HR was determined using pFAT10-G4 -mut plasmid with mutated G4 sequences. The results revealed that the rate of HR frequency decreased by 5.8-fold compared to strain carrying plasmid pFAT10-G4 -mut with unmutated sequences, indicating that this decrease is due to mutation of G-quadruplex–forming sequences (<italic><xref rid="fig9s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref></italic>). To assess whether increased frequency of HR is due to the instability of G-quadruplex DNA in <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells, we examined the length of G4 DNA inserts in the plasmids carrying sequences during HR assay. We found a DNA fragment of approximately 829 bp corresponding to the expected size in both WT and <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells (<italic><xref rid="fig9s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref></italic>). It is therefore possible that increased frequency of HR in <italic>rev7Δ</italic> cells could be due to the loss of Rev7 function rather than instability G4 DNA capable sequences. Viewed together, these findings are consistent with the idea that <italic>REV7</italic> completely abolishes DSB-induced HR in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, genetic and biochemical analyses of the wild-type ScRev7 and its 42 residue variant have revealed unanticipated insights into the mechanism by which Rev7 regulates the DSB repair pathway choice between HR and NHEJ in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> Specifically, we show that ScRev7 directly interacts with the individual subunits of the MRX complex via a 42-residue C-terminal fragment (residues 203-245), protects cells form G4 DNA-HU induced toxicity, facilitates NHEJ while blocking HR, thereby suggesting that this minimal region harbors structural principles required for Rev7 function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, we found that ScRev7 impedes Mre11 nuclease and Rad50’s ATPase activities, without affecting the latter’s ATP-binding capacity. We further show that ScRev7 binds with significantly high affinity (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> in the range of 3.22 to 18.26 nM) to G-quadruplex structures, as opposed to no binding to mixed-sequence ssDNA and dsDNA. When seen from a teleological perspective, these findings are conceptually reminiscent of Shieldin complex-mediated suppression of 5′ end resection and repair of DSBs via NHEJ while antagonizing HR in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boersma et al., 2015</xref>). At this stage, we tentatively speculate that this alternative mechanism of regulation of DSB repair pathway choice in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> may be conserved across multiple species.</p>
<p>Historically, <italic>REV7</italic> was discovered as playing an important role in DNA damage-induced mutagenesis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lemontt, 1971</xref>; Lawrence and Das, 1985). Further analyses showed that Rev7 associates with Rev3 and functions as a regulatory subunit of eukaryotic TLS DNA polymerase Polζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Prakash et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Maiorano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ling et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). Of note, Rev7 has no known catalytic activity, but serves as a versatile scaffolding protein: the versatility of Rev7 is underpinned by its unique ability to function in diverse cellular processes, including TLS, DNA repair and cell cycle that were initially considered inconceivable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">de Krijger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Decottignies, 2013</xref>). However, little is known about the nature of specific effector(s) that associate with Rev7 and regulate DSB repair in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> As we discuss below, the Y2H assays showed unequivocally that ScRev7 interacts with the individual subunits of MRX complex. Consistent with this, MST analysis and AlphaFold-Multimer models revealed tight association between the MRX subunits and ScRev7. On the other hand, while co-immunoprecipitation experiments implicated that Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2 subunits exist as a hetero-trimeric complex <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Usui et al., 1998</xref>), <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have shown the formation of dimeric Mre11-Rad50 and trimeric MRX complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arora et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, to our knowledge, the relative amounts of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric species of MRX subunits <italic>in vivo</italic> are unknown. Relatedly, current models suggest that Mre11 and Rad50 bind to DNA in Rad50/Mre11-dependent and -independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Stracker and Petrini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Paull, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Casari et al., 2019</xref>). This leads us to postulate that the monomeric, dimeric and trimeric species of MRX subunits may exist in a dynamic equilibrium under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions.</p>
<p>Given that Rev7 and MRX subunits play essential roles in DNA repair pathways, our findings provide intriguing insights into how ScRev7 interacts with the MRX subunits. Structure-function analysis showed that deletion of 42-amino acid fragment (203-245) at the extreme C-terminus of ScRev7 abolished its binding to the MRX subunits, whereas loss of the N-terminal HORMA domain, an evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interaction module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">de Krijger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Muniyappa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Rosenberg and Corbett, 2015</xref>) had no discernible effect on its interaction. Curiously, further analysis indicated that the 42-residue peptide alone was sufficient for its binding to the MRX subunits and regulation of DSB repair pathway choice between NHEJ and HR. Analogously, it will be of interest to determine the regions/domains of MRX subunits that interact with ScRev7 for a comprehensive understanding of the crosstalk between these components. Work is currently in progress to gather insights into these questions.</p>
<p>The data from MST-based assays informed that ScRev7 binds to MRX subunits with significant affinity, analogous to the interaction between HORMA-domain protein hMAD2 and hCDC20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Piano et al., 2021</xref>). How might ScRev7 suppress the function of Mre11 and Rad50 subunits? Encouraged by the above-mentioned results, we tested the effect of ScRev7 on the biochemical activities of MRX subunits. Reassuringly, we found that nanomolar amounts of ScRev7 besides adversely affecting the Mre11 nuclease activity also impeded Rad50’s ATPase activity without obstructing its ability to bind ATP. Whilst the specific nuances of the interaction await further characterization, we surmise that direct association between ScRev7 and the Mre11/Rad50 subunits might contribute to the observed effects. Although we provide compelling <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that the Rev7 C-terminal 42-residue peptide is critical for binding to the MRX subunits, rescue cells from G4 DNA-HU-induced toxicity and regulate the pathway choice between NHEJ and HR, we could not demonstrate its function <italic>in vitro</italic> because our multiple attempts to express and purify the peptide were unsuccessful. Unexpectedly, however, we found that the Rev7-C1 variant, which lacks the ability to interact with the MRX subunits in Y2H assays, partially blocked the catalytic activities of Mre11 and Rad50 subunits <italic>in vitro</italic>. Why this is the case is not clear, but one possibility is that amino acid residues outside the 42-residue fragment facilitate pairwise interactions between ScRev7 and the Mre11 and Rad50 subunits, as seen in AlphaFold-Multimer models. Conversely, the 42-amino acid fragment as a part of whole protein could potentially block the residues in the Rev7-C1 fragment, thereby enabling it to function effectively as a single site for binding to the MRX subunits in Y2H assays. Future studies are required to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Many lines of evidence indicate that G-quadruplex capable sequences are measurably enriched at certain functional regions in the genomes of all organisms, from humans to plants to microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Capra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huppert and Balasubramanian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lejault et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Castillo Bosch et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, G-quadruplex structures modulate diverse cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, translation, and are associated with certain diseases, characterized by high rates of chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rhodes and Lipps, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Spiegel et al., 2020</xref>). Serendipitously, we found that deletion of <italic>REV7</italic> resulted in G4 DNA-associated genomic instability during DNA replication, rendering cells hypersensitive to HU-induced genotoxic stress and cell death. This is consistent with accumulating evidence that DNA replication stress induced by G-quadruplex structures play a prominent role in triggering genomic instability, which is exacerbated in the presence of HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Sato and Knipscheer, 2023</xref>). To this end, G-quadruplex DNA-specific binding properties of ScRev7 defined here enabled us to provide a possible explanation for its role in protecting cells against G-quadruplex-induced hypersensitivity to HU. Curiously, it was found that Rev7 binds with high affinity to G-quadruplex structures, as opposed to ssDNA or dsDNA containing random sequences. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional, less abundant, preferred DNA substrates may exist for Rev7 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells. Based on published literature and our studies, it is tempting to speculate that ScRev7 may recruit G4-resolving helicase(s) such as Sgs1 and Pif1 to unwind G-quadruplex structures prior to or during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huber et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Paeschke et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, or in addition, it may generate G4 DNA intermediates which may be processed by specific enzymes such as Mus81 or Sgs1/Top3. Regardless, our data align with the notion that G-quadruplex structures are endogenous sources of replication stress and their formation and persistence may lead to genomic instability and cell death.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown that Shieldin complex facilitates NHEJ-dependent DSB repair, while inhibiting DNA end resection and HR in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clairmont and D’Andrea, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). Since 5′ end resection is the primary step in HR-mediated DSB repair, we hypothesized that direct interaction between ScRev7 and MRX subunits might block resection of DNA termini, and then facilitate NHEJ-dependent DSB repair instead of HR. Consistent with this, we found that ScRev7 augments the efficiency of NHEJ while antagonizing HR. However, other regulatory components may also play a role in modulating the levels of NHEJ versus HR-mediated DSB repair. For instance, TRIP13 or p31<sup>comet</sup> inhibits the interaction of Rev7 with the SHLD3 subunit and regulates DNA end resection at DSBs and promotes their repair by HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Sarangi et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, interaction between Rev7 and putative binding partners may be regulated by posttranslational modifications and chromatin accessibility under changing physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Although a comparison of the mechanism of Rev7-mediated regulation of DSB repair between the yeast and cancer cell lines indicate broad similarities, we observed some notable differences. A fundamental difference between the results from cancer cell lines and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is that, while ScRev7 robustly interacts with and suppresses the biochemical activities of both Mre11 and Rad50 subunits to facilitate NHEJ, Rev7-Shieldin complex acts as a downstream effector of 53BP1-RIF1 in restraining DNA end resection to promote NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clairmont and D’Andrea, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Paniagua and Jacobs, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, hRev7 interacts with the SHLD3 subunit via the HORMA domain, which is entirely dispensable in the case of ScRev7. Interpreted broadly, the highly complex, Shieldin complex-mediated regulation of DSB repair pathway choice might be a source of evolutionary innovation as an additional layer of regulation. In summary, our data bridges a notable gap in the current understanding of the molecular mechanism underpinning ScRev7-mediated regulation of DSB repair pathway choice in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

<p>The plasmids FT10/Chr.IV<sub>G4</sub>_lg and FT10/Chr.IV<sub>G4</sub>_le were a kind gift from Dr. Virginia Zakian. <italic>S. cerevisiae REV7</italic> gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the primer pair (forward OSB01 and reverse OSB02) and Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Sambrook and Russell, 2001</xref>). This reaction yielded an amplicon of expected size, which was digested with BamHI/HindIII and ligated into a similarly digested pET28a(+) vector (Novagen) by utilizing the T4 DNA ligase.

<title>ATP crosslinking assay</title>
<p>The assay was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Thakur et al., 2021</xref>). To test for the effect of ScRev7 on ATP binding by Rad50, we first ascertained its capacity to bind ATP. The assay was performed in a 20 μl reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 5.0), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 400 pmol [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and increasing concentrations of Rad50 (0.1-1 μM). In parallel, a fixed concentration of Rad50 (1 μM) was incubated with increasing concentrations of ScRev7 (0.5 - 6 μM) at 4 °C for 15 min, prior to mixing with 20 μl buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 5.0), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 400 pmol [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. After incubation at 4 °C for 25 min, samples were exposed to UV irradiation (1.2 × 10<sup>5</sup> µJ/cm<sup>2</sup> in Hoefer UVC 500 ultraviolet crosslinker) at a distance of 2 cm. All cross-linking reactions were quenched by adding 5 μl of 5X Laemmli buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12.5% SDS, 40% glycerol, and 0.1% bromophenol blue). Samples were heated at 95 °C for 10 min and resolved by SDS/PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gel at 35 mA for 2 h. The images were captured using a Fuji FLA-9000 phosphor imager and the band intensities of radiolabeled species was quantified using UVI-Band Map software (v. 97.04) and graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism software (v5.0).</p>

<title>ATPase assay</title>
<p>The hydrolysis of ATP by ScRad50 was monitored by the release of <sup>32</sup>Pi from [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Thakur et al., 2021</xref>). Where indicated, a fixed concentration of Rad50 (0.5 μM) was incubated on ice for 30 min with increasing concentrations of ScRev7 or ScRev7-C1 to allow protein complex formation, prior to the reaction. Briefly, 200 μM [γ−<sup>32</sup>P] ATP and Rad50 (0.5 μM) were incubated in 10 μl reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 0.2 mg/ ml BSA, 0.1 mM DTT, 1.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 % glycerol, with indicated concentrations of Rad50. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and the reaction was quenched by adding 15 mM EDTA. Aliquots (2 μl) from each sample was spotted onto the PEI-cellulose thin-layer plate and was developed using a solution containing 0.5 M LiCl, 1 M formic acid and 1 mM EDTA as the mobile solvent. The TLC sheets were dried and the autoradiographs were visualized using Fuji FLA-9000 phosphor imager. The images were captured using a Fuji FLA-9000 phosphor imager and the band intensities of <sup>32</sup>Pi and [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP were quantified and plotted using UVI-Band map software.

<title>Malachite green phosphate assay</title>
<p>ATP hydrolysis was monitored by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate released using acidic ammonium molybdate and malachite green assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lanzetta et al., 1979</xref>). The reaction mixtures (80 µl) contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 µM ATP, and increasing concentrations of ScRad50 (0.05 - 1 µM). After incubation at 30°C for 30 min, reaction was stopped by adding 20 µl of malachite green reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, MAK307). Incubation was continued for 15 min at 24°C to allow the formation of phosphomolybdate malachite green chromogenic complex. The absorbance values, as a measure of the extent of ATP hydrolysis, at 620 nm (y-axis) were plotted against increasing concentrations of ScRad50 (x-axis). To test the effect of ScRev7 or ScRev7-C1 on Rad50 ATPase activity, increasing concentrations of ScRev7 or ScRev7-C1 (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 µM) were incubated with 0.25 µM of ScRad50 on ice for 20 min, prior to mixing it with the reaction mixture. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, ATP hydrolysis was monitored as described above. The curves were fitted using non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad prism (v. 5.0).</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry analysis</title>
<p>Identity of Rev7-GFP protein was confirmed using Orbitrap mass spectrometry method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Zubarev and Makarov, 2013</xref>). In-gel trypsin digestion was performed as follows: 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile (7:3) ratio was used for de-staining; following which, samples were reduced for 30 minutes by adding 10 mM DTT diluted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Following reduction, alkylation buffer (55 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate) was added and samples were incubated at room temperature for further 30 min. Samples were treated with 10 ng trypsin enzyme (Mass spectrometry-grade, Sigma Aldrich, India), at 37°C for 12 h. Subsequently, peptides were extracted from the sample by desalting with 300 µL of 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoracetic acid. The extracted peptides are dried in speed vacuum and resuspended in 40 µL resuspension buffer (2% acetonitrile in LC-MS grade Milli-Q). 10 µL of the sample was then injected into Orbitrap Fusion Tribid Mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). Samples were run for 110 minutes using Nanospray Ion source (NSI) and static spray voltage. Ions were detected by Orbitrap detector at 60000 resolution using quadrupole isolation. Daughter ions were detected by Ion Trap detector using quadrupole isolation mode. Following data acquisition, peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) and percentage peptide coverage were obtained for the samples. Collectively, these results confirm that the purified protein is GFP-tagged ScRev7.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The mammalian Shieldin complex consisting of REV7 (aka MAD2L2, MAD2B) and SHLD1-3 affects pathway usage in DSB repair favoring non-homologous endjoining (NHEJ) at the expense of homologous recombination (HR) by blocking resection and/or priming fill-in DNA synthesis to maintain or generate near blunt ends suitable for NHEJ. While the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not have homologs to SHLD1-3, it does have Rev7, which was identified to function in conjunction with Rev3 in the translesion DNA polymerase zeta. Testing the hypothesis that Rev7 also affects DSB resection in budding yeast, the work identified a direct interaction between Rev7 and the Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex by two-hybrid and direct protein interaction experiments. Deletion analysis identified that the 42 amino acid C-terminal region was necessary and sufficient for the 2-hybrid interaction. Direct biochemical analysis of the 42 aa peptide was not possible. Rev7 deficient cells were found to be sensitive to HU only in synergy with G2 tetraplex forming DNA. Importantly, the 42 aa peptide alone suppressed this phenotype. Biochemical analysis with full-length Rev7 and a C-terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region shows G4-specific DNA binding that is abolished in the C-terminal truncation and with a substrate containing mutations to prevent G4 formation. Rev7 lacks nuclease activity but inhibits the dsDNA exonuclease activity of Mre11. The C-terminal truncation protein lacking the 42 aa region also showed some inhibition suggesting the involvement of additional binding sites besides the 42 aa region. Also, the Mre11 ssDNA endonuclease activity is inhibited by Rev7 but not the degradation of linear ssDNA. Rev7 does not affect ATP binding by Rad50 but inhibits in a concentration-dependent manner the Rad50 ATPase activity. The C-terminal truncation protein lacking the 42 aa region also showed some inhibition but significantly less than the full-length protein.</p>
<p>Using an established plasmid-based NHEJ assay, the authors provide strong evidence that Rev7 affects NEHJ, showing a four-fold reduction in this assay. The mutations in the other Pol zeta subunits, Rev3 and Rev1, show a significantly smaller effect (~25% reduction). A strain expressing only the Rev7 C-terminal 42 aa peptide showed no NHEJ defect, while the truncation protein lacking this region exhibited a smaller defect than the deletion of REV7. The conclusion that Rev7 supports NHEJ mainly through the 42 aa region was validated using a chromosomal NHEJ assay. The effect on HR was assessed using a plasmid:chromosome system containing G4 forming DNA. The rev7 deletion strain showed an increase in HR in this system in the presence and absence of HU. Cells expressing the 42 aa peptide were indistinguishable from the wild type as were cells expressing the Rev7 truncation lacking the 42 aa region. The authors conclude that Rev7 suppresses HR, but the context appears to be system-specific and the conclusion that Rev7 abolished HR repair of DSBs is unwarranted and overly broad.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>This is a well-written manuscript with many well-executed experiments that suggest that Rev7 inhibits MRX-mediated resection to favor NEHJ during DSB repair. This finding is novel and provides insight into the potential mechanism of how the human Shieldin complex might antagonize resection.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The nuclease experiments were conducted using manganese as a divalent cation, and it is unclear whether there is an effect with the more physiological magnesium cation. Additional controls for the ATPase and nuclease experiments to eliminate non-specific effects would be helpful. Evidence for an effect on resection in cells is lacking. The major conclusion about the role of Rev7 in regulating the choice between HR and NHEJ is not justified, as only a highly specialized assay is used that does not warrant the broad conclusion drawn. Specifically, the results that the Rev7 C-terminal truncation lacking the 42 aa region still suppresses HR is unexpected and unexplained. The effect of Rev7 on G4 metabolism is underdeveloped and distracts from the main results that Rev7 modulated MRX activity. The authors should consider removing this part and develop a more complete story on this later.</p>

<p>In this study, Badugu et al investigate the Rev7 roles in regulating the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex and in the metabolism of G4 structures. The authors also try to make a conclusion that REV7 can regulate the DSB repair choice between homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining.</p>
<p>The major observations of this study are:</p>
<p>(1) Rev7 interacts with the individual components of the MRX complex in a two-hybrid assay and in a protein-protein interaction assay (microscale thermophoresisi) in vitro.</p>
<p>
(2) Modeling using AlphaFold-Multimier also indicated that Rev7 can interact with Mre11 and Rad50.</p>
<p>
(3) Using a two-hybrid assay, a 42 C terminal domain in Rev7 responsible for the interaction with MRX was identified.</p>
<p>
(4) Rev7 inhibits Mre11 nuclease and Rad50 ATPase activities in vitro.</p>
<p>
(5) Rev 7 promotes NHEJ in plasmid cutting/relegation assay.</p>
<p>
(6) Rev7 inhibits recombination between chromosomal ura3-1 allele and plasmid ura3 allele containing G4 structure.</p>
<p>
(7) Using an assay developed in V. Zakian's lab, it was found that rev7 mutants grow poorly when both G4 is present in the genome and yeast are treated with HU.</p>
<p>
(8) In vitro, purified Rev7 binds to G4-containing substrates.</p>
<p>In general, a lot of experiments have been conducted, but the major conclusion about the role of Rev7 in regulating the choice between HR and NHEJ is not justified.</p>
<p>(1) Two stories that do not overlap (regulation of MRX by Rev7 and Rev7's role in G4 metabolism) are brought under one umbrella in this work. There is no connection unless the authors demonstrate that Rev7 inhibits the cleavage of G4 structures by the MRX complex.</p>
<p>(2) The authors cannot conclude based on the recombination assay between G4-containing 2-micron plasmid and chromosomal ura3-1 that Rev7&quot; completely abolishes DSB-induced HR&quot;. First of all, there is no evidence that DSBs are formed at G4. Why is there no induction of recombination when cells are treated with HU? Second, as the authors showed, Rev7 binds to G4, therefore it is not clear if the observed effects are the result of Rev7 interaction with G4 or its impact on HR. The established HO-based assays where the speed of resection can be monitored (e.g., Mimitou and Symington, 2010) have to be used to justify the conclusion that Rev7 inhibits MRX nuclease activity in vivo.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>REV7 facilitates the recruitment of Shieldin complex and thereby inhibits end resection and controls DSB repair choice in metazoan cells. Puzzlingly, Shieldin is absent in many organisms and it is unknown if and how Rev7 regulates DSB repair in these cells. The authors surmised that yeast Rev7 physically interacts with Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX), the short-range resection nuclease complex, and tested this premise using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and microscale thermophoresis (MST). The results convincingly showed that the individual subunits of MRX interact robustly with Rev7. AlphaFold Multimer modelling followed by Y2H confirmed that the carboxy-terminal 42 amino acid is essential for interaction with MR and G4 DNA binding by REV7. The mutant rev7 lacking the binding interface (Rev7-C1) to MR shows moderate inhibition to the nuclease and the ATPase activity of Mre11/Rad50 in biochemical assays. Deletion of REV7 also causes a mild reduction in NHEJ using both plasmid and chromosome-based assays and increases mitotic recombination between chromosomal ura3-01 and the plasmid ura3 allele interrupted by G4. The authors concluded that Rev7 facilitates NHEJ and antagonizes HR even in budding yeast, but it achieves this by blocking Mre11 nuclease and Rad50 ATPase.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are many strengths to the studies and the broad types of well-established assays were used to deduce the conclusion. Nevertheless, I have several concerns about the validity of experimental settings due to the lack of several key controls essential to interpret the experimental results. The manuscript also needs a few additional functional assays to reach the accurate conclusions as proposed.</p>
<p>(1) AlphaFold model predicts that Mre11-Rev7 and Rad50-Rev7 binding interfaces overlap and Rev7 might bind only to Mre11 or Rad50 at a time. Interestingly, however, Rev7 appears dimerized (Figure 1). Since the MR complex also forms with 2M and 2R in the complex, it should still be possible if REV7 can interact with +-*both M and R in the MR complex. The author should perform MST using MR complex instead of individual MR components. The authors should also analyze if Rev7-C1 is indeed deficient in interaction with MR individually and with complex using MST assay.</p>
<p>(2) The nuclease and the ATPase assays require additional controls. Does Rev7 inhibit the other nuclease or ATPase non-specifically? Are these outcomes due to the non-specific or promiscuous activity of Rev7? In Figure 6, the effect of REV7 on the ATP binding of Rad50 could be hard to assess because the maximum Rad50 level (1 uM) was used in the experiments. The author should use the suboptimal level of Rad50 to check if REV7 still does not influence ATP binding by Rad50.</p>
<p>(3) The moderate deficiency in NHEJ using plasmid-based assay in REV7 deleted cells can be attributed to aberrant cell cycle or mating type in rev7 deleted cells. The authors should demonstrate that rev7 deleted cells retain largely normal cell cycle patterns and the mating type phenotypes. The author should also analyze the breakpoints in plasmid-based NHEJ assays in all mutants, especially from rev7 and rev7-C1 cells.</p>
<p>(4) It is puzzling why the authors did not analyze end resection defects in rev7 deleted cells after a DSB. The author should employ the widely used resection assay after a HO break in rev3, rev7, and mre11 rev7 cells as described previously.</p>
<p>(5) Is it possible that Rev7 also contributes to NHEJ as the part of TLS polymerase complex? Although NHEJ largely depends on Pol4, the authors should not rule out that the observed NHEJ defect in rev7 cells is due at least partially to its TLS defect. In fact, both rev3 or rev1 cells are partially defective in NHEJ (Figure 7). Rev7-C1 is less deficient in NHEJ than REV7 deletion. These results predict that rev7-C1 rev3 should be as defective as the rev7 deletion. Additionally, the authors should examine if Rev7-C1 might be deficient in TLS. In this regard, does rev7-C1 reduce TLS and TLS-dependent mutagenesis? Is it dominant? The authors should also check if Rev3 or Rev1 are stable in Rev7 deleted or rev7-C1 cells by immunoblot assays.</p>
<p>(6) Due to the G4 DNA and G4 binding activity of REV7, it is not clear which class of events the authors are measuring in plasmid-chromosome recombination assay in Figure 9. Do they measure G4 instability or the integrity of recombination or both in rev7 deleted cells? Instead, the effect of rev7 deletion or rev7-C1 on recombination should be measured directly by more standard mitotic recombination assays like mating type switch or his3 repeat recombination.</p>
