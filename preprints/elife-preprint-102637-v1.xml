<p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a group of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mainly affecting the colon. The exact etiology of ulcerative colitis remains elusive. CD131 is a receptor subunit mediating the effects of hematopoietic growth factors GM-CSF and IL-3, which regulate various inflammatory responses.

<title>Methods</title>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the role of CD131 in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, with the use of murine colitis model established by administration of DSS in the drinking water.</p>

<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>By comparing the immune and inflammatory responses between wt and CD131-deficient mice, we found that CD131 contributed to DSS-induced murine colitis, which functioned in synergy with tissue- infiltrating macrophages. Besides, CD131 may have promoted the chemotaxis of macrophages and T cells into the colon through CCL4. In addition, we analyzed clinical data and pathology specimens from ulcerative colitis patients and found that CD131 was associated with the endoscopic and pathological severity of intestinal inflammation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a group of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mainly affecting the colon.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) The exact etiology of ulcerative colitis remains elusive. Available evidence suggests that IBDs are caused by dysregulated immune responses against components of the microbiota and intestinal wall in genetically susceptible individuals.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) The adaptive immunity is classically considered to play a major role in the pathogenesis of IBDs; however, accumulating evidence has shown that the innate immunity is equally as important.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) IBDs may result from impaired functioning of the intestinal innate immune system, which is comprised of the epithelial barrier and a variety of innate immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)</p>
<p>Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and Interleukin-3 (IL-3) are a group of hematopoietic growth factors for the myeloid lineage mainly functioning under inflammatory conditions.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) They regulate various inflammatory responses that promote rapid clearance of pathogens while contribute to the persistence of chronic inflammation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) Besides, these cytokines also mediate the cross-talk between innate and adaptive immunity.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) The receptors for GM-CSF and IL-3, expressed on various immune cells, are both heteromers comprising a ligand-specific α subunit (CD116 and CD123, respectively) and a shared β common subunit (CD131).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) The α chains provide specificity for the cytokines but bind with relatively low affinity, while their association with the β common chain provides high affinity necessary for effective downstream signaling.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>)</p>
<p>The role of these cytokines in the pathogenesis of IBDs has been investigated but is still controversial. For instance, GM-CSF has been shown to deliver pleiotropic effects, either pro-inflammatory or anti- inflammatory, on the intestinal inflammation depending on the cellular and cytokine milieu as well as disease model.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) The different results imply that additional factors influence the overall function of GM-CSF, including the expression and functional status of its receptor. For example, a previous study showed that IBD was characterized by impaired expression and function of CD116 in circulating granulocytes and monocytes, suggesting a defect in innate immunity in response to GM-CSF.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) Besides, in a genetic analysis of Ashkenazi Jewish populations that have a high prevalence of Crohn’s disease, a frameshift mutation in CSF2RB gene (encoding CD131) was shown associated with higher risk for Crohn’s disease and reduced monocyte signaling in response to GM-CSF.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) Indeed, a better understanding of the effect of GM-CSF receptor in the pathogenesis of IBD is necessary.</p>
<p>Here we investigated the role of CD131, the β common chain mediating the effects of GM-CSF and IL-3 signaling, in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. We established murine colitis model by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water and compared the immune and inflammatory responses between wild type and CD131-deficient mice. Besides, we analyzed clinical data and pathology specimens from ulcerative colitis patients to unravel its clinical significance.</p>

<title>CD131 contributed to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis</title>
<p>We firstly explored the change of <italic>Csf2rb</italic> gene (encoding CD131) expression in murine colon tissues in response to DSS administration in the drinking water by analyzing the gene expression dataset GSE22307(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). The expression of <italic>Csf2rb</italic> appeared to elevate with time, but only until day 6 a significantly increased <italic>Csf2rb</italic> expression was demonstrated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). We then subjected our wt mice to 2% DSS in the drinking water for 7 days to establish murine colitis and found that <italic>Csf2rb</italic> mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the distal part of the colon comparing to mice receiving normal drinking water (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). The <italic>Csf2rb</italic> mRNA could not be effectively detected in the proximal part of the colon and therefore only the distal colon was used for further analyses. Nevertheless, we could not find any significant change in <italic>Csf2rb</italic> mRNA expression level in other immune-related tissues, including blood leukocytes, intra-peritoneal lavage cells, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and thymus, following DSS administration (Fig S1a-e). The gene expression dataset analysis also showed a tendency of increase in <italic>Csf2ra</italic> (Fig S1f) and a significant increase in <italic>Il3ra</italic> (Fig S1g), which encode the α subunit of GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors, respectively, in the colon tissues at day 6 of DSS administration. Whereas, we did not find any change in <italic>Csf2ra</italic> mRNA expression level in the colon tissues of our mice following DSS administration (Fig S1h), while <italic>Il3ra</italic> mRNA could not be effectively detected (Fig S1i).</p>

<p>In order to find out the role of CD131 in DSS-induced murine colitis, we subjected CD131-deficient mice (<italic>Csf2rb<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) to DSS administration and compared them to control wt mice. While the wt mice showed reduced body weight, shortened colon length, as well as more tissue destruction seen on H&amp;E staining, increased CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophil infiltration, and <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Il1b</italic> mRNA expression in their colon tissues in response to DSS; the CD131-deficient mice were generally protected from the effects of DSS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c-g</xref>, Fig S2a-b). These demonstrated that CD131 contributed to the effects of DSS on inducing murine colitis. We could only have heterozygous <italic>Csf2rb</italic> knock-out mice, while the homozygous ones were fatal at an early stage. We observed that the <italic>Csf2rb</italic> mRNA expression was elevated only in the colons of wt mice following DSS treatment, rather than their CD131-deficient counterparts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1h</xref>). Nevertheless, the <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Il1b</italic> mRNA expression in blood leukocytes, as well as the neutrophils in the blood, were comparable between DSS-treated and control wt mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1i-j</xref>), indicating a local, but not systemic, inflammation in our model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>CD131 was associated with immune cell infiltration signature</title>
<p>To explore the possible mechanisms that CD131 involved in, we subjected the colonic tissues from control and DSS-treated, wt and CD131-deficient, mice to RNA-seq. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that the M1 subtype of macrophages and γδT cells were significantly enriched in the colonic tissues of DSS-treated wt mice, suggesting the association between CD131 and the infiltration of these cell subpopulations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). Whereas, the colon of CD131-deficient mice which received DSS exhibited increased monocytes and naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as well as decreased naive B cells. Correlation analyses demonstrated that M1 macrophages were significantly correlated with Th1 cells (rs = 0.6906, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016); while γδT cells were positively correlated with resting NK cells (rs = 0.6409, <italic>p</italic> = 0.029), CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells (rs = 0.6457, <italic>p</italic> = 0.027), Th1 cells (rs = 0.7988, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) and Th2 cells (rs = 0.8451, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), but negatively correlated with mast cells (rs = −0.6224, <italic>p</italic> = 0.035), M2 macrophages (rs = −0.8364, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (rs = −0.7619, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate the specific pathways that could be associated with CD131, we performed Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the RNA-seq data. We found that inflammatory bowel disease-related pathway was enriched in wt mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>, Table S1). Besides, several innate and acquired immune- related pathways, including antigen processing and presentation, FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, FcεRI signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, cell adhesion molecules, TNF signaling pathway, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, T cell receptor signaling pathway, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, Th17 cell differentiation and B cell receptor signaling pathway, were also enriched in wt mice (Fig S3, Table S1).</p>
<p>To explore the biological functions of the genes influenced by CD131, we investigated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wt groups and intersected them with the non-DEGs between CD131- deficient groups. There were 1411 DEGs between control and DSS-treated wt mice, as well as 17760 non-DEGs between the CD131-deficient mice; the intersection resulted in 573 genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref>, Table S2), comprising 327 up-regulated and 246 down-regulated genes, for further analyses. The Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that the up-regulated genes were associated with functions of plasma membrane and synapses (Fig S4a, Table S3), while the down-regulated genes were associated with cellular and nuclear activities (Fig S4b, Table S4). Moreover, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the up-regulated genes were involved in the protein digestion and absorption, cholinergic synapse, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways (Fig S4c, Table S5); whereas, the down-regulated genes were involved in the cell cycle, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, Fanconi anemia, and DNA replication pathways (Fig S4d, Table S6).</p>

<title>Macrophages and CD131 synergistically contributed to DSS-induced murine colitis</title>
<p>As RNA-seq analyses suggested that macrophages were influenced by CD131 expression, we investigated their role in DSS-induced murine colitis. The CD11b<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages were elevated in the colonic tissues of DSS-treated wt mice, rather than their CD131-deficient counterparts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). Besides, CD131 was expressed on these macrophages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). Then, we subjected wt and CD131-deficient mice to clodronate liposomes injection to deplete their monocytes/macrophages, and observed their response to DSS administration. The wt mice receiving clodronate liposomes exhibited less body weight loss and colon shortening, as well as reduced macrophage infiltration and <italic>Tnf</italic> mRNA expression in their colon tissues, comparing to those receiving PBS liposomes (control); whereas, the CD131-deficient mice did not show any response to either liposomes or DSS treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c-f</xref>). Besides, the colon-infiltrating macrophages from wt mice expressed elevated level of TNF in response to DSS administration; while those from CD131-deficient mice did not show such alteration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3g</xref>). To validate the effect of CD131 signaling, we subjected cultured RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line to rm-GM-CSF treatment. Cells treated with rm-GM-CSF exhibited higher <italic>Tnf</italic> mRNA expression and lower CFSE fluorescence intensity as compared with control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3h-i</xref>), indicating enhanced pro- inflammatory status and increased proliferation, respectively. These suggested that macrophages mediated the effect of CD131 on contributing to DSS-induced murine colitis, and CD131 might also have mediated the pro-inflammatory effect of macrophages.</p>

<p>We also investigated several other immune cell subpopulations in the colonic tissues (Fig S5), but their association with CD131 expression during DSS-induced colitis was not as clear as macrophages. Of note, however, we found that CD131 was expressed at different levels on various cell types (Fig S6), including neutrophils, CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells, CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup>Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells, CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, EpCAM<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells and EpCAM<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup> cells.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>CCL4 mediated the effect of CD131 on chemotaxis and inflammatory response</title>
<p>Unlike the change of macrophages in the colonic tissues of wt mice in response to DSS treatment, we observed no difference in CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes in their blood among different groups of mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). Besides, we found higher level of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration in the colonic tissues of wt mice, either control or DSS-treated, comparing to CD131-deficient mice; however, the T cells were similar in the blood among the study groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>). These suggested that CD131 might have an effect on the chemotaxis of immune cells to the colon. The RNA-seq data suggested that CCL4 and CCL5 were the only chemotactic factors influenced by CD131 (Table S2). While we found that <italic>Ccl4</italic> mRNA was elevated in the colonic tissues of wt mice treated with DSS comparing to control and CD131-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c</xref>), which was consistent with the change observed in RNA-seq data, <italic>Ccl5</italic> did not show such alteration (Fig S7). To explore if CCL4 was implicated in the chemotaxis of macrophages and T cells into the inflammatory colon, we subjected the wt mice to anti-CCL4 antibody injection to antagonize its effect. Mice treated with anti-CCL4 antibody exhibited reduced macrophage and T cell infiltration into the colonic tissues in response to DSS administration as compared with those treated with IgG isotype control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d-e</xref>). Besides, we found that these mice showed a tendency of less body weight loss (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f</xref>), less colon shortening (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4g</xref>), as well as lower neutrophil infiltration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4h</xref>) and <italic>Tnf</italic> mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4i</xref>) in the colonic tissues in response to DSS administration, indicating a suppressed inflammatory response in these mice. These suggested that CCL4 might have mediated the effect of CD131 on chemotaxis of macrophages and T cells into the colon, as well as on inflammatory response in DSS-induced murine colitis.</p>

<title>CD131 was associated with endoscopic and pathological severity of ulcerative colitis as well as macrophage and T cell infiltration into the colon</title>
<p>To validate the role of CD131 in intestinal inflammation as demonstrated by mouse models, we firstly explored the change of CSF2RB gene expression in colonic tissues from a human IBD cohort by analyzing the gene expression dataset GSE179285(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The expression of CSF2RB was elevated in the inflamed colonic tissues from UC patients as compared to the uninflamed colonic tissues from UC patients or healthy controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>). Next, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data and colonic tissue specimens from a cohort of ulcerative colitis patients. The demographic characteristics of the patients were summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, while the demographic and clinical data were available in Table S7. The tissue damage and inflammatory cell infiltration were evaluated by H&amp;E staining; while CD131 expression, together with macrophage and T cell infiltration, in the colonic tissues were determined by IHC staining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b-e</xref>). We did not find any correlation between CD131 expression in the colonic tissues and clinical parameters of the patients (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, CD131 expression was significantly correlated with the mucosal appearance evaluated under endoscopy (τ = 0.378, <italic>p</italic> = 0.023). Besides, CD131 expression was significantly correlated with Robarts histopathology index (rs = 0.4983, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5f</xref>), which reflects the histopathological severity of the intestinal inflammation. In addition, we found that CD131 expression was also correlated with CD68 (rs = 0.7734, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5g</xref>) and CD3 (rs = 0.3616, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5h</xref>), indicating the infiltration of macrophages and T cells, respectively. These suggested that CD131 was associated with the endoscopic and histopathological severity of the intestinal inflammation, as well as macrophage and T cell infiltration in the colon during ulcerative colitis, reflecting its clinical significance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CD131 is a receptor subunit mediating the effects of hematopoietic growth factors GM-CSF and IL-3, which regulate various inflammatory responses.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) The pleiotropic effects of the cytokines on intestinal inflammation suggest that additional factors influence their overall function, where the receptor may play a role. In the present study, we investigated the role of CD131 in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, with the use of murine colitis model established by administration of DSS in the drinking water. By comparing the immune and inflammatory responses between wt and CD131-deficient mice, we found that CD131 contributed to DSS-induced murine colitis, which functioned in synergy with tissue- infiltrating macrophages. Besides, we also demonstrated that the effect of CD131 on chemotaxis of macrophages, together with T cells, was mediated by CCL4. In addition, we analyzed clinical data and pathology specimens from ulcerative colitis patients and found that CD131 was associated with the endoscopic and pathological severity of intestinal inflammation, as well as macrophage and T cell infiltration. Taken together, we demonstrated the pro-inflammatory effect of CD131 on murine colitis, which may have clinical significance.</p>
<p>There is currently no published study to date dedicated to investigating the role of CD131 in inflammatory bowel disease. In a recent study investigating its ligand cytokine, IL-3, in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, the authors showed that CD131 knock-out mice exhibited depressed neutrophil infiltration into the colon in response to DSS administration,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) which was in accordance with our findings. Reduced neutrophil infiltration indicated milder inflammatory response; and we also showed less body weight loss and shortened colon length, less tissue destruction on histology sections, as well as lower inflammatory cytokine expression in the colonic tissues in CD131-deficient mice, which all suggested that CD131 contributed to the intestinal inflammation. Interestingly, however, another study found that activating the heteromer receptor formed by CD131 and erythropoietin receptor could exert potent anti-inflammatory effects and thus ameliorate experimental colitis in mice.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) Obviously, the conversion from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory effects was attributable to the interaction between CD131 and erythropoietin receptor, and the underlying mechanism warrants further investigation. One concern about our findings was that our CD131-deficient mice were all heterozygous, while homozygous ones were fatal at an early stage. It appears that homozygous CD131-deficient mice were used by others;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) the gene knock-out manipulation of our mice might be different from theirs which accounts for the early fatality, but it is unknown. Nevertheless, we observed significantly lower <italic>Csf2rb</italic> mRNA expression in these mice, and performed repeated experiments to confirm our findings.</p>
<p>Macrophages are key players in inflammation which exert both pathogenic and protective functions depending on the subset differentiation and polarization in response to local microenvironment signals.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) We showed that macrophages were elevated in the colonic tissues of DSS-treated wt mice, while depleting macrophages with clodronate liposomes was protective with respect to body weight loss, colon shortening, and inflammatory cytokine expression. These were consistent with the previous studies showing that macrophages contributed to murine colitis.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) Of note, however, studies also indicated that M2-like macrophages were also present in the intestine to alleviate inflammation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) As simply defining the macrophages as M1 or M2 phenotypes is not readily suitable in the intestine,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) we demonstrated elevated expression of TNF in intestinal macrophages in DSS-treated wt mice, suggesting a pro-inflammatory role and possibly predominance of M1-like phenotype in murine colitis. Besides, we showed that CD131 was expressed on colonic macrophages, as is already known,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) which allows them to respond to the stimulation by cytokines GM-CSF and IL-3. By stimulating cultured murine macrophage cell line with rm-GM-CSF, we demonstrated elevated TNF expression, which indicated that CD131 signaling could exert pro-inflammatory effect. Thus, our results suggested that macrophages mediated the pro-inflammatory effect of CD131 on DSS-induced colitis in wt mice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our CD131-deficient mice did not exhibit elevation in colon macrophages upon DSS administration, nor did these macrophages produce more TNF. Besides, the changes following macrophage depletion, as seen in wt mice, were absent in the CD131-deficient counterparts subjected to DSS administration. It is reasonable to believe that, as a result of lacking CD131, these mice were not able to effectively respond to GM-CSF and IL-3 stimulation. Therefore, the macrophage-mediated inflammatory response in the colonic tissues of DSS-treated wt mice was, at least in part, attributable to CD131 signaling. Our findings were consistent with previous studies showing that GM-CSF promoted pro-inflammatory function of macrophages and thus facilitated intestinal inflammation by various mechanisms,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) although these studies were not dedicated to the investigation of the function of CD131. Admittedly, our findings were limited by the fact that we did not have macrophage-specific CD131-deficient mice, therefore we could not confirm the effect of macrophage-specific CD131 on DSS- induced murine colitis, which awaits further investigations.</p>
<p>As macrophages and T cells were higher in the colonic tissues, but not in the blood, of DSS-treated wt mice instead of CD131-deficient ones, we speculated that a possible mechanism affecting the chemotactic process was involved. It is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that the circulating monocytes migrate to the intestine to maintain a normal intestinal macrophage pool.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) CCL4, previously known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), is a chemokine produced in high amounts by monocytes and macrophages.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) CCL4 signals through its receptor CCR5, and is involved in the chemotaxis and trans-endothelial migration of monocytes, T cells and other immune cells, which possibly contributes to local inflammatory response. It is in accordance with our findings that antagonizing CCL4 with antibodies resulted in decreased macrophage and T cell infiltration into the colon and alleviation of intestinal inflammation. We showed that the expression of CCL4 was elevated in colonic tissues of DSS-treated wt mice, but not their CD131-deficient counterparts. To the best of our knowledge, there is so far no study investigating the effect of CD131 signaling on chemokines like CCL4. One of the down-stream signaling mechanisms of GM-CSF/IL-3 receptor complexes is the JAK2/STAT5 pathway, which controls the differentiation and inflammatory signature of immune cells.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) A previous study demonstrated that blocking SOCS3 on macrophages, a feedback inhibitor protein of JAK/STAT signaling pathway, resulted in enhanced and prolonged activation of JAK/STAT pathway, as well as elevated expression of M1 phenotype-associated genes.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) Notably, the authors showed that mice with SOCS3-deficient macrophages experienced exacerbated LPS-induced sepsis, which was associated with enhanced JAK/STAT pathway activation and increased plasma levels of cytokines/chemokines such as CCL4. Therefore, their results appear to support our findings that CD131 signaling could possibly contribute to the elevation of CCL4 expression. Of note, however, CD131 signaling might also contribute to the local proliferation of macrophages, as indicated by the accelerated proliferation of cultured macrophage cell line in response to GM-CSF stimulation, but apparently it warrants future investigation in colitis.</p>
<p>The major limitation of the present study is that we did not investigate the role of CD131 expressed on other immune cell populations. Apart from monocytes and macrophages, we also showed that CD131 was expressed at different levels on various cell types, as is already known from previous studies.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) Although the role of these cells in CD131-contributed intestinal inflammation needs to be investigated in future studies, the effect of CD131, in synergy with macrophages, on murine colitis is still important as shown in the present study. Besides, the functional status of CD131 molecule was not studied in the present work. Its ligand cytokine GM-CSF appears to exert pleiotropic effects in the intestine: although GM-CSF is generally accepted as a pro-inflammatory cytokine contributing to colitis, treatment with a recombinant human GM-CSF agent, sargramostim, has shown some benefit in Crohn’s disease patients.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) This inconsistency raised the possibility that the functional status of the receptor molecules might play a role in the overall effect of GM-CSF stimulation. In support of this, a genetic analysis of Ashkenazi Jewish populations, which show a high prevalence of Crohn’s disease, demonstrates that monocytes from carriers of a frameshift mutation in CSF2RB gene exhibit reduced responses to GM-CSF treatment.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) It suggests that an intact wild-type CD131 molecule is essential in mediating proper response to GM-CSF treatment; nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms await further studies. Lastly, the present study may be limited by the low number of ulcerative colitis patients included in the analysis. Although we have a high volume of ulcerative colitis patients in our medical center, the need for surgical intervention is significantly decreased since the advent of biologicals. Those who did receive surgical treatment were generally suffering from severe colitis, which could explain the reason why CD131 expression had no significant correlation with clinical evaluation. Therefore, caution need to be exercised when interpreting the results of our patient cohort analysis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that CD131 and tissue-infiltrating macrophages synergistically contributed to DSS-induced murine colitis. Besides, CD131 may have promoted the chemotaxis of macrophages and T cells into the colon through CCL4. In addition, CD131 was associated with the endoscopic and pathological severity of intestinal inflammation in clinical ulcerative colitis patients. The present study provides a novel way to the understanding of the mechanisms of GM- CSF and IL-3 effects in the intestine, which will benefit the development of therapeutic approaches. For instance, as discussed above, IBD patients with a functionally intact wild-type CD131 receptor molecule may have better clinical responses to sargramostim treatment and should be selected for future clinical trials. Indeed, more insightful studies are needed to improve the understanding of GM-CSF-CD131 signaling in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, which may shed light on an alternative avenue of IBD therapy avoiding immunosuppression.</p>

<title>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for mice genotyping</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was isolated from murine tail biopsies by enzymatic digestion with Willy buffer [100 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Solarbio), 200 mM sodium chloride (Rhawn, China), 10 mM EDTA disodium salt dihydrate (Solarbio), and 0.2% sodium dodecylsulfate (Solarbio)] containing 0.6 mg/ml proteinase K (GlpBio) at 56 °C for at least 150 min while shaking at 750 rpm to disrupt the extracellular matrix. The amplification was performed using the 2x Rapid Taq Master Mix (Vazyme, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amplification products were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis to visualize the DNA bands. The following primer pair (Sangon Biotech, China) was used for genotyping: P1 (fwd): TCA GGA AAC AGA GGC AGG AGG AT, P2 (rev): AGT GGC AGG GGC AGT TTG GTT T.

<p>Total RNA was isolated from homogenized murine colonic tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). RNA quality was assessed using RNase-free agarose gel electrophoresis on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA). Afterwards, the mRNA was enriched with Oligo(dT) beads. Subsequently, the enriched mRNA was fragmented by using fragmentation buffer and reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNA by using NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting ds cDNA was sequentially purified, end-repaired, adenine base-added, and ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. The ligation reaction was purified with AMPure XP Beads; while the adapter-ligated cDNA was subjected to PCR enrichment and again purification. Finally, the resulting cDNA library was sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System (Illumina, USA). The original RNA-seq data that support the findings of the present study have been deposited into CNGB Sequence Archive (CNSA) of China National GeneBank DataBase (CNGBdb) with accession number CNP0005868. <italic>Data processing.</italic> Raw sequencing reads were processed with fastp(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) to remove adapters, unknown nucleotides, and low-quality bases. The reads were then mapped to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) database by using bowtie2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) to remove possible rRNA reads; while the remaining clean reads were aligned to the murine reference genome assembly GRCm39 by using HISAT2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) with default parameters. The mapped reads of each sample were assembled with StringTie(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) and annotated with gene annotation from Ensembl release 110, followed by normalization to transcripts per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (TPM) for quantification of the gene abundance by using RSEM software(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). <italic>Immune cell infiltration analyses.</italic> The estimation of immune cell subset abundances within the tissues based on their gene expression profiles was performed by the cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) method(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) on R statistical software v4.3.3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). The expression profile of marker genes for the murine immune cell populations was referenced to the results of Chen and colleagues.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) The Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) was calculated to indicate the relationship between different infiltrating immune cells. <italic>Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).</italic> GSEA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) was performed to identify the pathways that were significantly different between 2 study groups by using the clusterProfiler package (v4.12.2)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) on R. The input genes were ranked by the Signal2Noise method. The gene sets database “m2.cp.v2023.2.Mm.symbols.gmt” was chosen as the reference database. A pathway with false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. <italic>Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analyses.</italic> The identification of DEGs between 2 study groups was performed by calculating TPM differences using limma package(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Genes with FDR &lt; 0.05 and absolute log2(fold change [FC]) &gt; 1 were considered as DEGs. As we were investigating the role of CD131 on murine colitis, we intersected the DEGs between wt groups and non-DEGs between CD131-deficient groups, and subjected the acquired genes to further analyses. The Gene Ontology (GO)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) enrichment analyses were performed by subjecting the intersect gene lists to DAVID bioinformatics(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) to explore the main biological functions of these genes. The enrichment was considered significant at FDR &lt; 0.05.</p>

<p>We selected a human IBD gene expression dataset GSE179285(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) and a DSS-induced murine colitis gene expression dataset GSE22307(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). In GSE179285 study, patients with IBD and healthy volunteers from multiple centers in North America were enrolled in separate studies, where in one cohort none of the patients were taking any medications for their disease, and in the other cohort none of the patients received treatment with investigational drugs or biologics within the previous 3 months. The normal intestinal tissues from healthy controls (n = 31), uninflamed (n = 32) and inflamed (n = 23) tissues from ulcerative colitis patients, as well as uninflamed (n = 121) and inflamed (n = 47) tissues from Crohn’s disease patients were collected during ileocolonoscopy. Total RNA was extracted from the intestinal tissues and gene expression profile was generated based on Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (GPL6480 platform) and uploaded by the research group. The Crohn’s disease patients were not included in our analysis. In GSE22307 study, C57BL/6J mice were given 3% DSS in the drinking water and the colon tissues were collected at days 0 (n = 5, control group euthanized prior to DSS treatment), 2 (n = 6), 4 (n = 6) and 6 (n = 6). Subsequently, total RNA was extracted from the colon tissues and gene expression profile was generated based on Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (GPL1261 platform) and uploaded by the research group. The normalized expression levels of genes of interest were extracted manually and analyzed.</p>

<p>The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check for the Gaussian distribution of the data. For comparing between 2 groups, unpaired t test with or without Welch’s correction (when Gaussian distribution was assumed) or Mann-Whitney test (when Gaussian distribution was not assumed) was performed. The <italic>p</italic> values are two-tailed. For the comparison among 3 or more groups, the statistical methods included one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison correction (when Gaussian distribution was assumed) and Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison correction (when Gaussian distribution was not assumed). Adjusted <italic>p</italic> values are reported. All differences were considered statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. For correlation analysis between continuous variables, the Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) was determined, where rs &gt; 0.5 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered high correlation. For correlation analysis involving ordinal variables, the Kendall’s tau-b coefficient (τ) was determined.</p>

<p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition affecting the colon in humans. This study uses human samples as well as a mouse model of colitis induced by a chemical, DSS, to investigate the role of an immune marker, CD131, in UC pathogenesis. The study, as presented, is <bold>incomplete</bold>, as experimental details are lacking, the statistical analyses are deficient, and there is not yet direct evidence for a CD131-mediated mechanism of gut inflammation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the role of CD131, a receptor subunit for GM-CSF and IL-3, in ulcerative colitis pathogenesis using a DSS-induced murine colitis model. By comparing wild-type and CD131-deficient mice, the authors demonstrate that CD131 contributes to DSS-induced colitis, working in concert with tissue-infiltrating macrophages.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The research shows that CD131's influence on macrophage and T cell chemotaxis is mediated by CCL4. The authors conclude by proposing a pro-inflammatory role for CD131 in murine colitis and suggest potential clinical relevance in human inflammatory bowel disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The statistical association between increased CD131 expression and clinical IBD was not observed in Table 1, indicating that the main results from animal experiments were not reproduced in human subjects. Additionally, due to the absence of experimental results regarding the downstream signaling pathways through CD131, it is difficult to infer the precise differentiated outcomes of this study. Furthermore, the effects of CD131 on immune cells other than macrophages were not presented, and the results specific to macrophage-selective CD131 were not shown. Therefore, I conclude that it is challenging to provide a detailed review as there is a lack of supporting evidence for the core arguments made in this paper.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the potential role of CD131, a cytokine receptor subunit shared by GM-CSF and IL-3, in intestinal inflammation. Using heterozygous mice with an inactivating mutation on this gene, the study demonstrates ameliorated inflammation, associated with less infiltration of macrophages. Moreover, the depletion of macrophages prevented many of the inflammatory effects of DSS and made both WT and mutant mice equivalent in terms of inflammation severity. Correlative data showing increased CD131+ cells in tissues of patients with ulcerative colitis is also demonstrating, evidence for plausibility for these pathways in human disease.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The phenotype of mutant mice seems quite robust and the pathways proposed, GM-CSF signaling in macrophages with CCL4 as a downstream pathway, are all plausible and concordant with existing models. Many of the experiments included meaningful endpoints and were overall well performed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Experimental rigor was lacking in this manuscript, which provided limited or no details on the number of independent iterations that each experiment was done, the number of animals per group, the number of technical or biological replicates in each graph, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Details of animal model validation showing that this particular mutant allele results in a lack of CD131 protein expression were not shown. Moreover, since the paper uses heterozygous mice, it is critical to show that at the protein level, there is indeed reduced expression of CD131 in het mice compared to controls (many heterozygous states do not lead to appreciable protein depletion).</p>
<p>(3) Another major weakness is that the paper asserts a causal relationship between CD131 signaling and CCL4 production: the data shown indicates that the phenotypes of CCL4 deficiency (through Ab blockade) and CD131 partial deficiency (in het mice) are similar. However, this does not establish that CD131 signaling acts through CCL4.</p>
<p>(4) Lastly, while the paper claims that CD131 acts through macrophage recruitment, the evidence is circumstantial and not direct. DSS-induced acute colitis is largely mediated by macrophages, so any manipulation associated with less severe inflammation is accompanied by lesser macrophage infiltration in this model: this does not directly establish that CD131 acts directly on macrophages, which would require cell-specific knockout or complex cell reconstitution experiments.</p>

<p><bold>Our response to Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of our work. Whether the effect of GM-CSF/IL-3 on the bowel is pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory has been controversial. In the present study, we have shown that CD131 mediated a pro-inflammatory effect of GM-CSF on the intestine, which may have worked in synergy with tissue-infiltrating macrophages. While its down-stream signaling has been investigated back and forth, we did not put effort into it. Using macrophage-specific CD131-deficient animals is important to clarify the effects of macrophage-specific CD131 on bowel inflammation. Our present work is indeed incomplete, and we anticipate to work on it further in future research. Concerning the results on human subjects, it is indeed that results from animal experiments were not completely reproduced. We believe that CD131 does have an effect on ulcerative colitis; however, due to the use of biological agents (e.g. anti-TNFs), the need for surgery in the treatment of ulcerative colitis has dramatically decreased and we could not get enough samples to reach a more convincing statistical analysis. Twenty-nine patients shown in the present study were all that received surgical intervention at our center during the past decade, and more human subjects will be needed in future research, possibly from multi-center study.</p>
<p><bold>Our response to Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Many appreciations for the valuable reviewer’s comments and suggestions. We realized that the number of animals per group was not indicated in each figure; in order to clarify the experimental rigor, we have deposited data used to generate the results of the present study in Dryad. Concerning the heterozygous CD131 knock-out animals, we think that others have used the homozygous mice in their studies; however, we observed premature deaths in those animals and we could not get any single homozygous mouse. We could not tell the exact reason, but we did observe robust phenotypes in these heterozygous mice. We do realize that our present work is incomplete, and more experiments need to be done to establish a causal relationship between CD131 and down-stream effects. We anticipate to use macrophage-specific homozygous CD131-deficient mice in our future research, which we believe will produce more meaningful and convincing results.</p>
