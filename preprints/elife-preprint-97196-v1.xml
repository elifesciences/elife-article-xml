<title>Abstract</title><p>It is well-studied that type-III effectors are essential required by gram-negative bacteria to directly target different cellular pathways from hosts, thus enhancing their infection. However, in the unique context of legume-rhizobium symbiosis, the role of rhizobial effectors in regulating plant symbiotic pathways remains a subject of hypothesized understanding. Here, we show that NopT, a YopT-type cysteine protease from <italic>Sinorhizobium fredii</italic> NGR234 that could directly target symbiotic signaling pathway by associating with two Nod Factor Receptors (NFR1 and NFR5) from <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>. NopT is the only effector out of 15 effectors from <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 that inhibits cell death triggered by co-overexpression of NFR1 and NFR5 in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. NopT interacts with both NFR1 and NFR5. NopT proteolytically cleaves NFR5 in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, but is later inactivated <italic>via</italic> phosphorylation by NFR1. NopT plays an essential role in mediating rhizobial infection in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>. The truncated NopT, lacking 50 N–terminal amino acids post-autocleavage, retains the ability to cleave NFR5 but no longer interacts with NFR1. Intriguingly, certain <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> species exclusivley harbor this truncated NopT in their genomes. These findings unveil an intricate regulatory interplay between rhizobia and legumes, wherein rhizobial NopT actively cleaves NFR5, and this cleavage process is subsequently suppressed following NopT phosphorylation by NFR1. This discovery presents a compelling narrative of a nuanced regulatory interplay between rhizobia and legumes, highlighting rhizobial effector as a direct mediator targeting symbiotic pathway from plants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The legume–rhizobial symbiosis stands as one of the most crucial and intricate mutualistic interactions in nature. Its significance extends beyond the supply of the substantial amount of ammonium provided by rhizobia, influencing plant growth and ecosystem sustainability, to serving as a pivotal model for investigating plant–microbe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). The orchestration of this symbiosis involves the perception of small molecules, such as nod factors (NFs) and surface polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Madsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kawaharada et al., 2015</xref>), along with the secretion of proteins, inlcuding the type three secretion system (T3SS) effectors, to regulate legume–rhizobial symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sugawara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>A receptor heterocomplex, consisting of two Lysin–motif receptor kinases (LYKs), plays a central role in recognizing various polysaccharide molecules. In nonlegumes like Arabidopsis, AtLYK5 and AtCERK1 (Chitin elicitor receptor kinase) are required for perception of chitin, triggering plant immunity to combat fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, in legumes, structurally similar receptors like <italic>L. japonicus</italic> NF receptor1 (LjNFR1) and LjNFR5 are vital for recognizing rhizobial lipo– chitooligosaccharide NF, initiating symbiotic signaling transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Broghammer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bozsoki et al., 2017</xref>). The intricate regulation of NFRs is highlighted by the instances of hypersensitive cell death induced by their simultaneous overexpression in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Madsen et al., 2011</xref>) and defense–like responses in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> nodules upon overexpression of MtNFP (Nod factor perception, the ortholog of NFR5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Moling et al., 2014</xref>), perhaps reflecting potential conservation of the plant LYK receptors in interactions with both pathogens and symbionts. Therefore, the protein abundance of NFRs must be tightly controlled to avoid this resistance response, allowing rhizobial infection to proceed, emphasizing the need for tight control to enable rhizobial infection.</p>
<p>T3SS effectors play a critical role in suppressing pattern–triggered immunity (PTI) during pathogen infections in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>). To avoid diseases, specific resistance (R) genes are employed to recognize successful avirulence (Avr) effectors which enable pathogens overcome PTI, known as effector-triggered immunity (ETI), a much stronger immnune response combined with programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). However, in contrast to the well-studied fucntion of Avr effectors from phytopathogenic bacteria in mitigating immunity by different mechanisms, how these effectors from symbiotic bacteria might contribute to mutualistic interaction is largely unknown.</p>
<p>Some effectors, such as YopT-type cysteine protease family, including <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> AvrPphB, <italic>Yersinia</italic> YopT, and <italic>Rhizobial</italic> NopT, are well conserved across different bacteria. AvrPphB from <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> can directly proteolytically cleaves Arabidopsis receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) family proteins including PBS1, PBS1-like proteins, and BIK1, to suppress PTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). While, the cleavage of PBS1 serves as a “decoy” in activating RPS5 (RESISTANCE TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE5)–mediated ETI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shao et al., 2003b</xref>). <italic>Yersinia</italic> YopT directly cleaves Rho family leading to their inactivation to disrupt actin cytoskeleton of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shao et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shao et al., 2003a</xref>). While, in <italic>Rhizobium</italic> species, NopT have a dual function in regulating symbiosis. The exogenous expression of NopT from <italic>Sinorhizobium fredii</italic> NGR234 in <italic>S. fredii</italic> USDA257 almost blocks nodulation in soybean Nanfeng 15 but not other soybean cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Khan et al., 2022</xref>), implying that NopT might act as an Avr effector. However, NopT positively regulates nodule formation in the interaction betwen <italic>S. fredii</italic> HH103 and soybean Suinong 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2023</xref>). NopT from <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> sp. ORS3257 promotes rhizobial infection in nodules of <italic>Aeschynomene indica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Teulet et al., 2019</xref>). Despite this, little is understood about how NopT precisely modulates rhizobial infection and the variations among NopTs from different rhizobia strains.</p>
<p>The challenge in studying rhizobial effectors lies in the availability of suitable assays by which to characterize their phenotypes. In this study, we capitalized on the observation that ectopic expression of NFR1 and NFR5 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves induces programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Madsen et al., 2011</xref>), a response that might be modulated by rhizobial effectors. Among the 15 known T3SS effector proteins encoded within the <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 genome, only NopT, a homolog of the pathogenic effectors, YopT and AvrPphB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>), could specifically suppress this cell death response. This suggests that NopT might be an effector associated with NFRs. Our findings demonstrate that NopT interacts with both NFR1 and NFR5 at the plasma membrane, and cleaves NFR5 proteolytically at the juxtamembrane position to suppresses NF–mediated physiological responses. Perhaps as a means to regulate NopT activity, NFR1 phosphorylates intact NopT, inactivating its protease activity. However, the autocleaved NopT retains the ability to cleave NFR5 but loses its association with NFR1. Intriguingly, some <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> species possess only the truncated versions of NopT (relative to NGR234 NopT) that might evade suppression by NFR1. This study enveils a distinct and mutual regulatory model, in which the rhizobial effector NopT directly targets NFR5 to suppress symbiotic signaling, and NFR1-mediated phosphorylation acts as a negative feedback mechanism. The model provides essential insights into the intricate interplay between legumes and rhizobia, revealing a counteraction where a rhizobal T3SS effector impairs NF signaling by directly targeting NFR5, and NFR1 phosphorylates and inactivates the rhizobal T3SS effector in response.</p>

<title>NopT suppresses the cell death response from overexpression of NFR1 and NFR5</title>
<p>To examine the role of effector proteins in regulating rhizobial infection, <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234, a strain with exceptionally broad host–range was chosen. Initial experiments were performed to screen all 15 effector proteins identified from <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kimbrel et al., 2013</xref>), for their ability to suppress or enhance the cell death response in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves due to co–expression of LjNFR1 and LjNFR5 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A–S1C</xref>). Out of the effectors tested, only NopT, a cysteine protease belonging to the YopT family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>), could suppress LjNFR1 and LjNFR5–induced cell death (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and S1D–S1F). Cysteine–93 of NopT is a known residue essential for its protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast to the wild–type NopT protein, expression of NopT<sup>C93S</sup>, an inactive version, was unable to suppress cell death induced by NFR1 and NFR5 compared with controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), indicating the protease activity of NopT is essential for suppression of cell death in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. In contrast to the suppressive function on cell death, NopM, an effector protein from <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 reported to have an E3 ligase activity, induced strong cell death when overexpressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>As controls, we tested whether the action of NopT was specific for NFR1/NFR5 expression or whether it could act generally to suppress cell death. A variety of other proteins have been reported to induce cell death when expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves; specifically, Avr3a and R3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bos et al., 2006</xref>), apoptosis regulator BAX (Bcl-2-associated X protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gan et al., 2009</xref>), INF1, an elicitor from <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Vleeshouwers et al., 2006</xref>), Arabidopsis AtCERK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cao et al., 2014</xref>), and NopM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast to the case with LjNFR1 and LjNFR5, expression of NopT was unable to suppress the cell death induced when each of these proteins was expressed in tobacco leaves (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Hence, the effect of NopT appears to be specific for the NF receptors. These results suggested a hypothesis that rhizobial NopT protease might act directly on the NFR1 and/or NFR5 proteins.</p>

<title>NopT colocalizes with and interacts with NFR1 and NFR5 at the plasma membrane</title>
<p>NopT contains an acylation site that appears to localize NopT to cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dowen et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we tested the possibility that NopT, NFR1 and NFR5 co–localize on the plasma membrane. <italic>In vivo</italic> bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays were used to examine the colocalization of NopT with LjNFR1 and LjNFR5. NopT, LjNFR1 and LjNFR5 were all C–terminally tagged with nYFP and cYFP. Fluorescence signals representing the associations between NopT and LjNFR1, LjNFR5, as well as itself, were detected at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), suggesting that NopT colocalized with and interacted with both LjNFR1 and LjNFR5.</p>

<caption><title>NopT interacts with NFR1 and NFR5.</title>
<p>Interactions between NopT and NFR1 and NFR5 were detected using Split–YFP assay (A) and (B), Split–LUC (C) and co–IP (D) assays in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>.

All data in Figure are representative of three biological replicates.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="583716v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Interactions between NopT and LjNFR1 and LjNFR5 were further verified using a Split– luciferase (Split–LUC) assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Co–expression of NopT–cLUC and LjNFR1– nLUC or LjNFR5–nLUC produced strong luminescence signals in leaf discs compared with the negative control expressing FLS2–nLUC and NopT–cLUC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been known that the acylation of NopT could change its subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dowen et al., 2009</xref>). We then exaimed the interaction between NFR1/NFR5 and NopT<sup>G50A/C51A/C52A</sup>, a mutant version on the acylation sites. The interactions between NopT<sup>G50A/C51A/C52A</sup> and NFR1/NFR5 were significantly reduced compared to NopT<sup>WT</sup> in Split–LUC assays (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref> and S2B). While the mutation at catalytic site of NopT (NopT<sup>C93S</sup>) remained similar interaction with NFR1 and NFR5 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>). The interaction results were further confimred by co–immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay. The C–terminally HA–tagged LjNFR1 and LjNFR5 could be precipitated by anti–FLAG antibody in the sample expressing NopT–FLAG compared with controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The interaction between NopT and LjNFR1 and LjNFR5 suggested that LjNFR5 or LjNFR1 might be a target protein for proteolysis by NopT.</p>

<title>NopT proteolytically cleaves LjNFR5 at the juxtamembrane domain</title>
<p>A previous study showed that NopT protease activity is detectable upon autocleavage of about 50 amino acids from its N–terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>). We next tested whether NopT could directly proteolyze LjNFR1 and/or LjNFR5 when co–expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. The addition of NopT but not NopT<sup>C93S</sup>, an inactive version, resulted in proteolytic cleavage of LjNFR5–GFP but not LjNFR1–GFP as shown by immunoblotting of the SDS–PAGE gel (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and S3A). The <italic>in vivo</italic> cleavage assay in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> transgenic root also showed that NopT but not NopT<sup>C93S</sup> resulted in proteolytic cleavage of LjNFR5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Based on the molecular weight change, the cleavage sites were predicted to occur within the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of LjNFR5. Therefore, the CD of NFR5 was constructed as a recombinant protein (Strep–NFR5<sup>CD</sup>– HA) and then co–expressed with NopT–FLAG or the inactive version NopT<sup>C93S</sup>–FLAG in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells. The results showed that the active NopT protease could cleave NFR5<sup>CD</sup> resulting in a band roughly ∼5 kDa less than the control as detected using anti– HA antibody (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In the same experiment, when the CD of NFR1 was co– expressed with NopT, no cleavage product was detected in immunoblotting assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, migration of the bands representing NopT or NopT<sup>C93S</sup> was significantly retarded as seen after immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This retardation of NopT protein band may be the result of phosphorylation by NFR1.</p>

<p>The cleavage product with ∼5 kDa lower molecular weight in the cleavage assay, suggested that the cleavage site is located within the juxtamembrane (JM) position of NFR5. To test this hypothesis, SUMO–NFR5<sup>KD</sup>–HA, a recombinant protein with the JM of NFR5 replaced with a SUMO tag, was constructed and used for the cleavage assay.</p>
<p>Indeed, NopT could not cleave SUMO–NFR5<sup>KD</sup>–HA (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). To confirm this conclusion, the JM of NFR5 was used to bridge SUMO and GFP tags to create a recombinant protein, SUMO–JM–GFP. <italic>In vitro</italic> cleavage assay, strong band intensity representing GFP was detected in the flow though sample incubated with NopT but not NopT<sup>C93S</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). These data strongly indicated that the cleavage site for NopT is located at the JM of NFR5.</p>

<title>The cleavage of LjNFR5 at JM by NopT is dependent on multiple residues of NFR5</title>
<p>NopT has an autocleavage site within its N–terminus, we identified the peptide (DKLLSGV) from Asp–288 to Val–294 of NFR5 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>) as showing the highest similarity with the NopT autocleavage region (DKMGCCA). However, the mutant version of NFR5<sup>CD</sup> with the peptide (DKLLSGV) replaced with 7 alanines could still be cleaved by NopT (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>). NopT and its homlog AvrPphB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shao et al., 2003b</xref>), an effector from the pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringa</italic>, belong to the same protein family.</p>
<p>Hence, we set up a control experiment by constructing a version of NFR5<sup>CD</sup>, where the “DKLLSGV” motif was replaced with the cleavage sites of AvrPphB. In the cleavage assay, we found that this modified NFR5<sup>CD</sup> was cleaved by both AvrPphB and NopT, and the cleaved product of modified NFR5<sup>CD</sup> by AvrPphB shifting faster than by NopT (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>), suggesting that the cleavage site of NFR5 by NopT located ahead of “DKLLSGV” motif. As mentioned above, NopT undergoes autocleavage but it is not clear whether this is due to inter–proteolysis or intra–proteolysis. His–205 and Aps–220 of NopT are two other conserved residues required for the protease activity of YopT, another homolog of NopT from <italic>Yesinia</italic> whose function has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shao et al., 2003b</xref>). Therefore, we targeted these residues for site–directed mutagenesis. The cleavage assay showed that NopT could not proteolyze NopT<sup>C93S</sup>, NopT<sup>H205A</sup>, or NopT<sup>D220A</sup> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>), suggesting that intra–proteolysis might occur and the autocleavage site of NopT could not be used to predict the cleavage site of substrate.</p>
<p>To define the cleavage site of NFR5, we created a variety of point mutations covering the JM domain of NFR5 (Val-269 to Cys-320) and first seven a.a. of the kinase domain (Lys-321 to Tyr-327). First, 17 mutant versions of NFR5<sup>JM</sup> were created with three adjacent amino acids replaced with three alanines for proteolysis assay in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. However, all 17 mutant versions of NFR5<sup>CD</sup> could be cleaved by NopT but not NopT<sup>C93S</sup> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E–S3H</xref>). An additional 7 truncated versions of NFR5<sup>JM</sup>, with deletion of 10 adjacent residues, were created and tested for cleavage by NopT. Surprisingly, the cleavage products were still observed from all 7 truncated versions of NFR5<sup>JM</sup> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3I</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assay suggested that the JM domain might have multiple sites susceptible to be cleaved by NopT, which is different from the specific cleavage site identified for its homologous protein AvrPphB. In a parallel experiment, the recombinant protein, His-SUMO-NFR5<sup>CD</sup>-GST expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> was subjected for N-terminal protein sequencing determined by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry analysis after cleavage. Based on allignment using identified peptides, the cleavage site of NFR5 by NopT was mapped to be after four basic amino acids in the JM of NFR5, “RRKK” from 271 to 275 a.a. of NFR5 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref>). However, the result is not consistance with the data from cleavage assay. When the region from Tyr-268 to Leu-277 was deleted, NopT could still proteolyze NFR5-CD (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4I</xref>). The cleavage assay suggested that NopT might prefer to proteolyze NFR5 after four polybasic residues in the NFR5<sup>JM</sup>, but other sites could also be cleaved by NopT.</p>
<p>Because LjNFR5 belongs to a subfamily of plant LYK family proteins that lacks kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yang et al., 2022</xref>), we then asked whether NopT could proteolyze other LYK proteins in this subfamily, which might be helpful to characterize the biochemical function of NopT. Hence, the CDs from Arabidopsis AtLYK5, <italic>L. japonicus</italic> LjLYS11 and <italic>M. truncatula</italic> MtNFP were used for cleavage assays in the presence of NopT. As shown in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3J</xref>, NopT, but not NopT<sup>C93S</sup>, could cleave the CDs of both AtLYK5 and LjLYS11. Replacement of NFR5<sup>JM</sup> with the JM domains from either AtLYK5 or LjLYS11 also resulted in cleavage by NopT (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3J</xref>). The data strongly indicated that NopT could cleave both AtLYK5 and LjLYS11 at their JM domains. Based on sequence analysis of the JM region of NFR5 and its homologous proteins, five conserved residues (Ser-283, Gly-294, Tyr-303, Ala-310, Thr-311) were identified and mutated for the proteolysis assay (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>, the mutant version of NFR5 (i.e., NFR5<sup>CD</sup> with five amino acid mutations) could not be cleaved by NopT. Interestingly, NopT coud not protelyze MtNFP<sup>CD</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Then, we generated two recombinant proteins, by switching the JM between NFR5<sup>CD</sup> and NFP<sup>CD</sup>, generating NFR5<sup>JM</sup>-NFP<sup>KC</sup> (KC represents kinase domain and C-terminal tail region) and NFP<sup>JM</sup>-NFR5<sup>KC</sup> for <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assays. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, NopT could proteolyze NFP<sup>JM</sup>-NFR5<sup>KC</sup> but not NFR5<sup>JM</sup>-NFP<sup>KC</sup>. The data suggested that the cleavage of NFR5 by NopT might be dependent on the confirmational structure of NFR5<sup>KC</sup> and/or other specific amino acids in NFR5<sup>KC</sup>. To define this, two additional recombinant proteins with large switch between NFR5<sup>CD</sup> and NFP<sup>CD</sup>, NFR5<sup>268-445</sup>-NFP<sup>458-595</sup> and NFP<sup>270-457</sup>-NFR5<sup>456-595</sup>, were constructed for proteolysis (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3K</xref>). However, both of them could be cleaved by NopT, suggesting that a much large region on NFR5<sup>KC</sup> is required for being proteolyzed by NopT. Based on all these cleavge results, we concluded that NopT could proteolyze NFR5 at the JM domain, which nonadjacent mutiple residues within the NFR5<sup>JM</sup> and the specific KC region are required for the proteolysis.</p>

<title>NopT phosphorylation by LjNFR1 suppresses its proteolytic activity</title>
<p>The perception of rhizobia NFs by the heterocomplex of NFR1 and NFR5 involves the trans–phosphorylation from the NFR1 kinase to the pseudo–kinase NFR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Madsen et al., 2011</xref>). Rhizobial effector NopT associates with both NFR1 and NFR5, which suggests that NopT might be a phosphorylation target of NFR1 and involved in the transphosphorylation process between the two receptors. Kinase assays showed that NFR1–CD but not the kinase–inactive NFR1<sup>K351E</sup>–CD (Lys-351 is the conserved residue required for ATP binding) could phosphorylate NopT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>) and NFR5–CD (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>) as shown by band retardation on SDS–PAGE gels identified using immunoblotting. The band representing phosphorylated NopT shifted upon the addition of a commercial phosphatase, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), indicating that NopT as well NFR5<sup>CD</sup> are phosphorylation targets of the NFR1 kinase. NopT autocleavage also gives two bands and the site mutant of NopT at C93S did not affect the interactions between NFRs(<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>). To avoid multi-bands interference of cleaved NopT, NopT<sup>C93S</sup> was expressed in both wild type plants and <italic>nfr1</italic> mutant then treated with rhizobia or water. After analyzed by Zn<sup>2+</sup>-Phos-tag PAGE gel, several shifted bands were strengthened after rhizobia treatment in WT roots but not in the <italic>nfr1</italic> mutant roots (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting that the phosphorylation of NopT could be induced by NFR1 and multi-sites of NopT were phosphorylated <italic>in planta</italic>. The phosphorylation sites of NopT were further identified using Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). We then addressed whether NopT phosphorylation by NFR1 regulates its proteolytic activity on NFR5. All the potential phosphorylation sites of NopT were substituted into either alanine in order to block phosphorylation of these sites or aspartate, which mimicks the acidic condition representing a phosphorylated status. These mutant proteins were then used in the cleavage assay. Aspartate substitutions on three phosphorylation sites of NopT, Thr–97, Ser–119, and Thr–257, resulted in the loss of the ability of NopT to cleave NFR5–CD, as well as the ability to autocleave (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, NopT proteins with alanine substitutions on these three sites retained the ability to cleave NFR5–CD and to autocleave (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The data suggest that phosphorylation of NopT by NFR1 likely inhibits proteolytic activity, retaining a fully functional NFR5 and a full length NopT.</p>

<title>NopT dampens rhizobial infection</title>
<p>The fact that <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 NopT could directly target and cleave NFR5 indicates that NopT may be an important player regulating rhizobial infection in legumes. Nod factor signal is known to function in the early stage of rhizobial infection and nodulation specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Geurts et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Prior work showed that type three secretion system of <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 might not regulate nodule numbers few weeks after inoculation in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ausmees et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we focused on the early stage of rhizobial infection. Indeed, inoculation with GFP–labelled <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234Δ<italic>nopT</italic> induced a massive infection within the root hairs of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> (Gifu) plants compared with the favorable infection by the NGR234 wild type strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Transgenic expression of NopT in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> root hair reduced the infection of <italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic> MAFF303099 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). In <italic>L. japonicus</italic> plants transgenically expressing <italic>pNIN</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic>, greater range of GUS expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>) and formation of more nodule primordia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>) also reflected a stronger plant response to infection by NGR234Δ<italic>nopT</italic> relative to the wild–type strain. To confirm the massive infection is due to the loss of NopT, NopT was expressed in the <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234Δ<italic>nopT</italic> strain and used for inoculation in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>. Complementation with NopT in NGR234Δ<italic>nopT</italic> reduced the massive infection foci to the similar levels as the WT strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>).

<p>The protease–dead version of NopT<sup>C93S</sup> and three phosphorylation mimic versions of NopT, i.e., NopT<sup>T97D</sup>, NopT<sup>S119D</sup>, and NopT<sup>T257D</sup>, which lack proteolytic activity, were individually expressed in NGR234Δ<italic>nopT</italic>. Compared with the high levels of infection foci induced by NGR234Δ<italic>nopT</italic> in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> plants, inoculation with these four mutant strains induced much lower levels of infection, albeit slightly higher than that induced by the wild–type strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Inoculation with NGR234Δ<italic>nopT</italic> produced more nodule primordia compared with wild–type strain inoculation 14 dpi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). To verify whether the cleavage of NFR5 reduce rhizobial infection, NFR5–WT and NFR5<sup>5m</sup>, a mutant version with 5 amino acids substitutions at JM that is resistant to NopT cleavage, were expressed in the <italic>nfr5-3</italic> roots under the control of its native promoter. However, expression of NFR5<sup>5m</sup> was not observed to rescue the infection phenotype of <italic>nfr5-3</italic> mutant plants (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). The possible reason is that amino acids substitutions at JM might lead to a conformation change of NFR5 that is required for its function in symbiotic signaling transduction. Therefore, NFR5-NFP<sup>KC</sup>, the KC domain of NFR5 replaced with KC domain of NFP, was expressed in the roots under the control of native promoter (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). In the <italic>nfr5-3</italic> roots expressing NFR5-NFP<sup>KC</sup>, no difference of rhizobial infection was observed between <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234Δ<italic>nopT</italic> and <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 wild type strain, suggesting that the cleavage of NFR5 reduced the rhizobial infection levels.

<title>The truncated version NopT<sup>ΔN50</sup> cleaves NFR5 but fails to interact with NFR1</title>
<p>The significance of rhizobial NopT in mediating rhizobial infection led us to analyze its homologs from other rhizobium species. Sequence comparisons based on the amino acids of NopT homologs showed that <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> and <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> were located in different clades (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). <italic>B. diazoefficiens</italic> (USDA110) is a typical <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> strain used to study the symbiotic interaction with soybean. Two NopT homologous genes, named <italic>NopT1<sub>USDA110</sub></italic> and <italic>NopT2<sub>USDA110</sub></italic> were identified from the USDA110 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fotiadis et al., 2012</xref>). However, when tested, neither NopT1<sub>USDA110</sub> or NopT2<sub>USDA110</sub> could not cleave NFR5 compared to NopT<sub>NGR234</sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). The possible scenario is that NopT homologs from <italic>Bradyrhizbium</italic> species might have lost the ability to cleave NFR5 and/or may act on other, unknown cellular target proteins. The genome of some <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> species, for example <italic>S. fredii</italic> USDA257 and S<italic>. fredii</italic> HH103, encode <italic>NopT</italic> homologous genes predicted to produce same truncated proteins with a 57 aa deletion from its N–terminus, relative to the NGR234 NopT sequence, which is almost the same as the truncated NopT<sub>NGR234</sub> after autocleaveage. When these NopT homologs (i.e., NopT<sub>USDA257</sub> and NopT<sub>HH103</sub>) were tested, both were observed to have the ability to cleave NFR5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, these NopT homologs could not suppress the cell death triggered by NFR1 and NFR5 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) and failed to complement the massive infection of NGR234Δ<italic>nopT</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>), suggesting that NopT<sub>USDA257</sub> and NopT<sub>HH103</sub> retained the same catalytic activity as NopT<sub>NGR234</sub> but might have different substrates. We then asked whether the truncated version of NopT<sup>ΔN50</sup>, which mimics the truncated NopT after autocleavage, retained the ability to interact with NFR1. However, after repeated tests, the direct interaction between NopT<sup>ΔN50</sup> and NFR5 could be detected but not the corresponding interaction with NFR1 using Split–LUC assays (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>). The data suggest that some <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> species, for example, <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234, <italic>S. fredii</italic> USDA257 and <italic>S. fredii</italic> HH103, use a truncated NopT to regulate the rhizobial infection process in a way that avoids negative regulation by NFR1 phosphorylation, which is not true of all rhizobial strains that possess NopT homologs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Plant-microbe interactions involve two sophisticated and intelligent organisms, each employing distinct “weapons” or strategies to communicate mutually, thereby securing more nutrients for their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>). A well-established regulatory model arises from the study of plant-pathogen interactions, where T3SS effectors from gram-negative bacteria are injected into plant cells to directly target and suppress the plant’s immune pathway, favoring pathogenic bacterium infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). However, the unique model of mutual regulation between legumes and rhizobia in symbiotic interactions remains largely unknown. The broad goal of this study was to offer essential insights into the mutual regulation mechanisms whereby rhizobial effectors directly target symbiotic signaling pathways to dampen their infection in host cells.</p>
<p>Understanding how plants recognize different microbes as “friends” or “foes” is a central question in biology. As the first line of plant response to microbes, the perception of microbial signals by receptor proteins from plants is essential for inducing different signaling pathways to establish various interaction patterns–either symbiotic, pathogenic, or no responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zipfel and Oldroyd, 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is not surprising to discover that the direct targeting of these receptors by bacterial effectors represents an efficient strategy to manipulate plant signaling pathways for enhancing bacterium infection. In the well-studied <italic>Arabidopsis–Pseudomonas syringa</italic> interaction model, the flagellin receptor FLS2 (Flagellin Sensing 2) and its coreceptor BAK1 (BRI1-[Brassinosteroid insensitive 1]-associated receptor kinase 1), triggering plant immunity against pathogenic infection, are targeted by several effectors from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zipfel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). For example, AvrPto and HopB1 could suppress the kinase activity and cleave the Arabidopsis receptor complex, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Xiang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2016</xref>). AvrPtoB, an E3 ligase in <italic>P. syringae</italic>, targets FLS2 to promote its degradation, resulting in decreased immune responses in plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Goehre et al., 2008</xref>). Considering the evolutionary importance of effectors in infection, it is rational to identify that the rhizobial effector NopT, a member of the C58 protease family, can directly target NFRs, manipulating symbiotic signaling pathways in plants. This was demonstrated using a unique screening system in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A-C</xref>), in which co-expression of two symbiotic receptors, NFR1 and NFR5, could lead to plant cell death to identify NopT, the only effector from <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234. <italic>S. fredii NGR234</italic>Δ<italic>nopt</italic> mutant strains hyperinfect <italic>L. japonicus</italic> roots, and overexpression of NopT in the roots reduces rhizobial infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-5D</xref>), consistent with the observed suppression of cell death in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>). The interaction between NopT and NFRs has been verified and is impaired by the acylation site of NopT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref> and S2A), suggesting that the plasma membrane localization of NopT is essential for targeting NFRs.</p>
<p>In the extensively studied context of microbial pathogenesis, various effectors from pathogens have been proposed to directly suppress the immune system and promote virulence in host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>). The C58 protease family, including YopT and AvrPphB, represents such effectors that disarm the host defense system to favor pathogenic infection in both animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shao et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Yersinia</italic> YopT cleaves the Rho family GTPase to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton, inhibiting the phagocytosis of pathogens by hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shao et al., 2003a</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, <italic>P. syringae</italic> AvrPphB cleaves multiple members of the RLCK (receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase) subfamily VII to suppress the PTI response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, the cleavage of PBS1 functions as a “decoy” to trigger strong immunity against bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shao et al., 2003b</xref>). We confirmed that NopT cleaves NFR5 at the JM domain through different assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3</xref>). Mutants with five dispersed residues (S283, G294, Y303, A310, T311) at the JM domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3F</xref>) and the replacement of NFR5<sup>KD-CT</sup> with NFP<sup>KD-CT</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3G</xref>) resist cleavage by NopT, suggesting a joint decision of cleavage involving both the JM domain and KD-CT domain. Although belonging to the same protease family, the cleavage sites of NopT and YopT are polybasic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shao et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Schmidt, 2011</xref>), in contrast to AvrPphB, whose cleavage site is canonical with seven adjacent amino acids involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). The different cleavage sites of YopT-type effectors indicate that bacteria regulate different physiological pathways to establish specific interactions with host plants.</p>
<p>Similar to the plant pathogenic effector AvrPphB, the protease activity of NopT appears to be conserved for this function by cleaving the soybean PBS1 homolog protein to restrict symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Khan et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, transient expression of <italic>S. fredii</italic> NopT in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>N. tabacum</italic> could induce strong immune responses and hypersensitive cell death (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>), indicating that rhizobial NopT might act as an avirulent effector in some nonhost plant species. Interestingly, we failed to obtain stable transgenic lines constitutively expressing NopT in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>. However, the generation of transgenic root hairs was not affected, implying that NopT might act as an Avr effector whose overexpression leads to whole plant lethality but not root growth. Therefore, given this conservation of protease function, it is consistent with a successful Avr effector that NopT has the ability to proteolyze not only NFR5 but also Arabidopsis AtLYK5 and <italic>L. japonicus</italic> LjLYS11, two receptors with chitin-binding affinities that mediate plant PTI responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gysel et al., 2021</xref>). NFR5, AtLYK5, and LjLYS11 are LYKs belonging to the same subfamily that lacks kinase activities. Thus, NopT may not only suppress the nod factor<italic>–</italic>mediated symbiotic signal to avoid excessive infection by <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234 but also function in inhibiting the signal triggered by chitin-like compounds. The cleavage of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) may be an overlooked strategy to regulate their function in plant biology compared to the well-studied phosphorylation to control RLK activation. While cleavage regulation is well studied in neurobiology, e.g., the Notch signal, the proteolysis of each Notch molelue leads to signaling activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). Arabidopsis BAK1, identified as an universal co-receptor to regulate plant growth and MAMPs perception, undergoes proteolytic cleavage, which is important for both BR signaling and PTI response with an unclear mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). NFR5 is a pseudokinase that functions as an output of NF signaling. The cleavage of NFR5 by rhizobial NopT releases the cytoplasmic domain of NFR5, but the precise function of whom is of interest to be determined.</p>
<p>The legume–rhizobial symbiosis is a unique case in the context of plant–microbe interactions. Mutual regulation between pathogenic effectors and host proteins has been reported in plant pathogenesis. For example, the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> conserved effector AvrPtoB could directly target key components in the immunity pathway to promote its virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Goehre et al., 2008</xref>). However, the virulent function of AvrPtoB could either be enhanced or dampened by host proteins. AvrPtoB could be phosphorylated by SnRK2.8 to promote its virulence activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lei et al., 2020</xref>). Plant lectin receptor-like kinase LexRK-IX.2, Pto, and Fen kinases could also phosphorylate AvrPtoB to inactivate its E3 ligase activity and undermine its ability to suppress PTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ntoukakis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). A similar strategy was used by legumes to dampen the “virulence” of the rhizobial effector NopT, favoring mutualistic infection. NFR1 phosphorylates NopT at several residues. The phosphomimetic NopTs (i.e., NopT<sup>T97D</sup>, NopT<sup>S119D</sup>, and NopT<sup>T257D</sup>) are unable to cleave itself and NFR5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The expression of these phosphomimetic NopTs separately in <italic>S. fredii</italic> NGR234Δnopt mutant strains cannot complement the hyperinfection phenotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5F</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>L. japonicus</italic> deploys NFR1 to phosphorylate NopT to dampen its catalytic activity and may protect NFR5 from cleavage, favoring rhizobial infections. However, NopT<sup>ΔN50</sup>, mimic version of autocleaved NopT, retained the ability to interact with NFR5 but not NFR1 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>). Moreover, intact NopT, but not autocleaved NopT, are migrated by expressing NFR1<sup>CD</sup> in immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), suggesting autocleaved NopT may escape from being phosphorylated and inactivated by NFR1.</p>
<p>In different rhizobium species, a variety of NopT homologs were characterized. NopT homologs from some <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> species lose the ability to cleave NFR5, while NopT homologs from some <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic>, truncated versions without about 50 a.a. at its N-terminus, retain the ability to cleave NFR5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). The type three secretion signal depends on the N-terminal of effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akeda and Galán, 2005</xref>). However, an earlier study has shown that NopT from <italic>S. fredii</italic> HH103 exhibited a positive effector on nodulation in soybean SN14 cultivar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that another unknown mechanism might be involved in NopT<sub>HH103</sub> secretion. Interestingly, these truncated</p>
<p>NopTs still keep the function to cleave NFR5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) and autocleaved NopT<sub>NGR234</sub> cannot interact with NFR1 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>), indicating that NopTs from those strains and autocleaved NopT<sub>NGR234</sub> might lose the ability to be suppressed by NFR1. Notably, natural truncated NopT from <italic>S. fredii</italic> USDA257 and <italic>S. fredii</italic> HH103 are the same in protein sequence, but they lack the acylation site compared with NopT<sub>NGR234</sub>. Therefore, NopT<sub>USDA257</sub> and NopT<sub>HH103</sub> lose the ability to suppress cell death triggered by NFR1 and NFR5 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) and failed to complement the massive infection of NGR234<italic>ΔnopT</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>), implying NopT<sub>USDA257</sub> and NopT<sub>HH103</sub> may have a different target from NopT<sub>NGR234</sub> in the host plant. In addition, knockout of NopT in <italic>Bradyrhizobium</italic> sp. ORS3257 was shown to result in uninfected nodule formation, suggesting that, in this system, NopT<sub>ORS3257</sub> might play a role in nodule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Teulet et al., 2019</xref>). The versatile function of NopT homologs in different rhizobium species suggests that different regulatory processes might be involved in specific rhizobial symbiosis.</p>
<p>In this study, we present a mutual regulation model in which the rhizobial effector NopT directly targets NFR5 to suppress symbiosis signals and is then inactivated by NFR1 <italic>via</italic> phosphorylation. NopT appears to retain some pathogenic-like features in that it can cleave the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chitin receptor AtLYK5 and induce cell death in some non-leguminous plants, such as <italic>N. tabacum</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Thus, the cleavage of NFR5 by NopT might be due to the structure similarity to AtLYK5 targeted by NopT. The suppression of proteolytic activity of NopT <italic>via</italic> phosphorylation by NFR1 appears to work as a feedback loop to allow symbiotic signaling in compatible hosts. The model (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>) provides essential insights into the legume–rhizobial symbiosis, where rhizobia deploy an effector to dampen symbiotic signaling, and legumes slightly recur infection by suppressing NopT to employthe nod factor signal in response. Even though this couple, legume and rhizobia, tries to get together and strives to improve their living conditions, we catch a glimpse into the arguments and the recovery conversations between them.</p>

<p>Bacterial effectors that interfere with the inner molecular workings of eukaryotic host cells are of great biological significance across disciplines. On the one hand they help us to understand the molecular strategies that bacteria use to manipulate host cells. On the other hand they can be used as research tools to reveal molecular details of the intricate workings of the host machinery that is relevant for the interaction/defence/symbiosis with bacteria. The authors investigate the function and biological impact of a rhizobial effector that interacts with and modifies, and curiously is modified by, legume receptors essential for symbiosis. The molecular analysis revealed a bacterial effector that cleaves a plant symbiosis signaling receptor to inhibit signaling and the host counterplay by phosphorylation via a receptor kinase. These findings have potential implications beyond bacterial interactions with plants.</p>
<p>Bao and colleagues investigated how rhizobial effector proteins can regulate the legume root nodule symbiosis. A rhizobial effector is described to directly modify symbiosis-related signaling proteins, altering the outcome of the symbiosis. Overall, the paper presents findings that will have a wide appeal beyond its primary field.</p>
<p>Out of 15 identified effectors from Sinorhizobium fredii, they focus on the effector NopT, which exhibits proteolytic activity and may therefore cleave specific target proteins of the host plant. They focus on two Nod factor receptors of the legume Lotus japonicus, NFR1 and NFR5, both of which were previously found to be essential for the perception of rhizobial nod factor, and the induction of symbiotic responses such as bacterial infection thread formation in root hairs and root nodule development (Madsen et al., 2003, Nature; Tirichine et al., 2003; Nature). The authors present evidence for an interaction of NopT with NFR1 and NFR5. The paper aims to characterize the biochemical and functional consequences of these interactions and the phenotype that arises when the effector is mutated.</p>
<p>Evidence is presented that in vitro NopT can cleave NFR5 at its juxtamembrane region. NFR5 appears also to be cleaved in vivo. and NFR1 appears to inhibit the proteolytic activity of NopT by phosphorylating NopT. When NFR5 and NFR1 are ectopically over-expressed in leaves of the non-legume Nicotiana benthamiana, they induce cell death (Madsen et al., 2011, Plant Journal). Bao et al., found that this cell death response is inhibited by the coexpression of nopT. Mutation of nopT alters the outcome of rhizobial infection in L. japonicus. These conclusions are well supported by the data.</p>
<p>The authors present evidence supporting the interaction of NopT with NFR1 and NFR5. In particular, there is solid support for cleavage of NFR5 by NopT (Figure 3) and the identification of NopT phosphorylation sites that inhibit its proteolytic activity (Figure 4C). Cleavage of NFR5 upon expression in N. benthamiana (Figure 3A) requires appropriate controls (inactive mutant versions) that have been provided, since Agrobacterium as a closely rhizobia-related bacterium, might increase defense related proteolytic activity in the plant host cells.</p>
<p>Key results from N. benthamiana appear consistent with data from recombinant protein expression in bacteria. For the analysis in the host legume L. japonicus transgenic hairy roots were included. To demonstrate that the cleavage of NFR5 occurs during the interaction in plant cells the authors build largely on western blots. Regardless of whether Nicotiana leaf cells or Lotus root cells are used as the test platform, the Western blots indicate that only a small proportion of NFR5 is cleaved when co-expressed with nopT, and most of the NFR5 persists in its full-length form (Figures 3A-D). It is not quite clear how the authors explain the loss of NFR5 function (loss of cell death, impact on symbiosis), as a vast excess of the tested target remains intact. It is also not clear why a large proportion of NFR5 is unaffected by the proteolytic activity of NopT. This is particularly interesting in Nicotiana in the absence of Nod factor that could trigger NFR1 kinase activity.</p>
<p>It is also difficult to evaluate how the ratios of cleaved and full-length protein change when different versions of NopT are present without a quantification of band strengths normalized to loading controls (Figure 3C, 3D, 3F). The same is true for the blots supporting NFR1 phosphorylation of NopT (Figure 4A).</p>
<p>It is clear that mutation of nopT results in a quantitative infection phenotype. Nodule primordia and infection threads are still formed when L. japonicus plants are inoculated with ∆nopT mutant bacteria, but it is not clear if these primordia are infected or develop into fully functional nodules (Figure 5). A quantification of the ratio of infected and non-infected nodules and primordia would reveal whether NopT is only active at the transition from infection focus to thread or perhaps also later in the bacterial infection process of the developing root nodule.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents data demonstrating NopT's interaction with Nod Factor Receptors NFR1 and NFR5 and its impact on cell death inhibition and rhizobial infection. The identification of a truncated NopT variant in certain Sinorhizobium species adds an interesting dimension to the study. These data try to bridge the gaps between classical Nod-factor-dependent nodulation and T3SS NopT effector-dependent nodulation in legume-rhizobium symbiosis. Overall, the research provides interesting insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic interactions between rhizobia and legumes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript nicely demonstrates NopT's proteolytic cleavage of NFR5, regulated by NFR1 phosphorylation, promoting rhizobial infection in L. japonicus. Intriguingly, authors also identify a truncated NopT variant in certain Sinorhizobium species, maintaining NFR5 cleavage but lacking NFR1 interaction. These findings bridge the T3SS effector with the classical Nod-factor-dependent nodulation pathway, offering novel insights into symbiotic interactions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In the previous study, when transiently expressed NopT alone in Nicotiana tobacco plants, proteolytically active NopT elicited a rapid hypersensitive reaction. However, this phenotype was not observed when expressing the same NopT in Nicotiana benthamiana (Figure 1A). Conversely, cell death and a hypersensitive reaction were observed in Figure S8. This raises questions about the suitability of the exogenous expression system for studying NopT proteolysis specificity.</p>
<p>(2)NFR5 Loss-of-function mutants do not produce nodules in the presence of rhizobia in lotus roots, and overexpression of NFR1 and NFR5 produces spontaneous nodules. In this regard, if the direct proteolysis target of NopT is NFR5, one could expect the NGR234's infection will not be very successful because of the Native NopT's specific proteolysis function of NFR5 and NFR1. Conversely, in Figure 5, authors observed the different results.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 6E, the model illustrates how NopT digests NFR5 to regulate rhizobia infection. However, it raises the question of whether it is reasonable for NGR234 to produce an effector that restricts its own colonization in host plants.</p>
<p>(4) The failure to generate stable transgenic plants expressing NopT in Lotus japonicus is surprising, considering the manuscript's claim that NopT specifically proteolyzes NFR5, a major player in the response to nodule symbiosis, without being essential for plant development.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This valuable study reveals how a rhizobial effector protein cleaves and inhibits a key plant receptor for symbiosis signaling, while the host plant counters by phosphorylating the effector. The molecular evidence for the protein-protein interaction and modification is solid, though biological evidence directly linking effector cleavage to rhizobial infection is incomplete. With additional functional data, this work could have implications for understanding intricate plant-microbe dynamics during mutualistic interactions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this helpful comment. In the revised manuscript version, we will be more prudent with directly linking cleavage of Nod factor receptors by NopT and rhizobial infection.</p>
<p>We plan to modify the Title, the One-Sentence Summary, Abstract, and Discussion regarding this point.</p>

<p>Bacterial effectors that interfere with the inner molecular workings of eukaryotic host cells are of great biological significance across disciplines. On the one hand they help us to understand the molecular strategies that bacteria use to manipulate host cells. On the other hand they can be used as research tools to reveal molecular details of the intricate workings of the host machinery that is relevant for the interaction/defence/symbiosis with bacteria. The authors investigate the function and biological impact of a rhizobial effector that interacts with and modifies, and curiously is modified by, legume receptors essential for symbiosis. The molecular analysis revealed a bacterial effector that cleaves a plant symbiosis signaling receptor to inhibit signaling and the host counterplay by phosphorylation via a receptor kinase. These findings have potential implications beyond bacterial interactions with plants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting the broad significance of rhizobial effectors in understanding legume-rhizobium interactions. We fully agree with your assessment and will emphasize these points in the revised Introduction and Discussion sections of our manuscript. Specifically, we will expand our Discussion regarding the potential impact of the NopT interaction with symbiotic receptor kinases on plant immune signaling and regarding the general significance of our work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Bao and colleagues investigated how rhizobial effector proteins can regulate the legume root nodule symbiosis. A rhizobial effector is described to directly modify symbiosis-related signaling proteins, altering the outcome of the symbiosis. Overall, the paper presents findings that will have a wide appeal beyond its primary field.</p>
<p>Out of 15 identified effectors from Sinorhizobium fredii, they focus on the effector NopT, which exhibits proteolytic activity and may therefore cleave specific target proteins of the host plant. They focus on two Nod factor receptors of the legume Lotus japonicus, NFR1 and NFR5, both of which were previously found to be essential for the perception of rhizobial nod factor, and the induction of symbiotic responses such as bacterial infection thread formation in root hairs and root nodule development (Madsen et al., 2003, Nature; Tirichine et al., 2003; Nature). The authors present evidence for an interaction of NopT with NFR1 and NFR5. The paper aims to characterize the biochemical and functional consequences of these interactions and the phenotype that arises when the effector is mutated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your positive feedback on our manuscript. In the revised Introduction and Discussion sections, we plan to better emphasize the interdisciplinary significance of our work. We will show how the knowledge gained from our study can contribute to a better understanding of microbial interactions with eukaryotic hosts in general, which may have a stimulating effect on future research in various research areas such as pathogenesis and immunity.</p>
<p>To ensure that the readers can easily follow the rationale behind our experiments, we will improve the Results section and provide more detailed explanations of how NopT among 15 examined effectors was selected. Additionally, we will provide more background information on NopT and the roles of NFR1 and NFR5 in symbiotic signaling in the Introduction section. As suggested, we will include the references Madsen et al. (2003) and Tirichine et al. (2003) as well as additional references on rhizobial NopT proteins into our revised manuscript version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Evidence is presented that in vitro NopT can cleave NFR5 at its juxtamembrane region. NFR5 appears also to be cleaved in vivo. and NFR1 appears to inhibit the proteolytic activity of NopT by phosphorylating NopT. When NFR5 and NFR1 are ectopically over-expressed in leaves of the non-legume Nicotiana benthamiana, they induce cell death (Madsen et al., 2011, Plant Journal). Bao et al., found that this cell death response is inhibited by the coexpression of nopT. Mutation of nopT alters the outcome of rhizobial infection in L. japonicus. These conclusions are well supported by the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate that you recognize the value of our data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors present evidence supporting the interaction of NopT with NFR1 and NFR5. In particular, there is solid support for cleavage of NFR5 by NopT (Figure 3) and the identification of NopT phosphorylation sites that inhibit its proteolytic activity (Figure 4C). Cleavage of NFR5 upon expression in N. benthamiana (Figure 3A) requires appropriate controls (inactive mutant versions) that have been provided, since Agrobacterium as a closely rhizobia-related bacterium, might increase defense related proteolytic activity in the plant host cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for recognizing the use of an inactive NopT variant in Figure 3A. In fact, increased activity of plant proteases induced by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> is an important point that should not be neglected. We plan to mention this aspect in our revised Discussion.</p>
<p>In the context of your comments, we are planning to make the following improvements to the manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) We will add a more detailed description of the experimental conditions under which the cleavage of NFR5 by NopT was observed in vitro and in vivo.</p>
<p>(2) We plan to provide more comprehensive data on the phosphorylation of NopT by NFR1, including phosphorylation assays and mass spectrometry results. These additional data support the proposed mechanism by which NFR1 inhibits the proteolytic activity of NopT.</p>
<p>(3) We will expand the Discussion on the cell death response induced by ectopic expression of NFR1 and NFR5 in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. We will include more details from Madsen et al. (2011) to contextualize our findings with published literature.</p>
<p>We believe these additions and clarifications will enhance the clarity and impact of our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Key results from N. benthamiana appear consistent with data from recombinant protein expression in bacteria. For the analysis in the host legume L. japonicus transgenic hairy roots were included. To demonstrate that the cleavage of NFR5 occurs during the interaction in plant cells the authors build largely on western blots. Regardless of whether Nicotiana leaf cells or Lotus root cells are used as the test platform, the Western blots indicate that only a small proportion of NFR5 is cleaved when co-expressed with nopT, and most of the NFR5 persists in its full-length form (Figures 3A-D). It is not quite clear how the authors explain the loss of NFR5 function (loss of cell death, impact on symbiosis), as a vast excess of the tested target remains intact. It is also not clear why a large proportion of NFR5 is unaffected by the proteolytic activity of NopT. This is particularly interesting in Nicotiana in the absence of Nod factor that could trigger NFR1 kinase activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments regarding the cleavage of NFR5 and its functional implications. In the revised version, we will change our manuscript taking into account the following considerations:</p>
<p>(1) We acknowledge that the Western blots indicate only a small proportion of NFR5 is cleaved when co-expressed with NopT. It is worth noting in this context that the proteins were expressed at high levels which likely do not reflect the natural situation in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>. Low production of cleaved NFR5 in our Western blots with transformed <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> or <italic>L. japonicus</italic> cells thus may simply reflect an experimental effect due to high NFR5 protein synthesis. We suggest that the presence of high amounts of intact NFR5 does not have a significant functional impact on plant responses (cell death in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, rhizobial infection of <italic>L. japonicus</italic>) whereas NFR5 cleavage (or formation of NFR5 cleavage products) may be crucial for the observation of the observed phenotypic changes. The fraction of cleaved NFR5, although small, may be sufficient to disrupt crucial signaling pathways, leading to observable phenotypic changes. We will address possible differences between experimental and natural protein levels in our revised Discussion.</p>
<p>(2) We studied in our work three biochemical aspects of NopT: (i) physical binding of NopT to NFR1 and NFR5 (ii) proteolytical cleavage of NFR5 by NopT and (iii) phosphorylation of NopT by NFR1. These three biochemical properties appear to influence each other. Phosphorylation of NopT by NFR1 appears to reduce its proteolytic activity, thereby counteracting NFR5 degradation by NopT (NFR5 homeostasis). Moreover, as NopT is a phosphorylation substrate for NFR1, NopT probably interferes with kinase mediated downstream responses of NFR1. Thus, NFR5 cleavage activity of NopT appears to be only one feature of NopT. We plan to mention these considerations in our revised Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is also difficult to evaluate how the ratios of cleaved and full-length protein change when different versions of NopT are present without a quantification of band strengths normalized to loading controls (Figure 3C, 3D, 3F). The same is true for the blots supporting NFR1 phosphorylation of NopT (Figure 4A).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this aspect. Following your recommendation, we will quantify the band intensities for cleaved and full-length NFR5 in the experiments with different versions of NopT. These values will be normalized to loading controls. Similarly, the Western blots supporting NFR1 phosphorylation of NopT will be quantified. The data for normalized band intensities will be included into the revised figures. The quantifications will provide a clearer understanding of how the ratios of cleaved to full-length proteins change with different NopT variants and also will provide information to which extent NopT is phosphorylated by NFR1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is clear that mutation of nopT results in a quantitative infection phenotype. Nodule primordia and infection threads are still formed when L. japonicus plants are inoculated with ∆nopT mutant bacteria, but it is not clear if these primordia are infected or develop into fully functional nodules (Figure 5). A quantification of the ratio of infected and non-infected nodules and primordia would reveal whether NopT is only active at the transition from infection focus to thread or perhaps also later in the bacterial infection process of the developing root nodule.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. In the revised version of our manuscript, we will provide data showing that there are no obvious differences in nodule formation in plants inoculated with ∆nopT and wild-type NGR234, respectively. However, quantification of infection threads containing our GFP-labeled rhizobia in primordia and nodules would be difficult to perform due to strong autofluorescence signals in these tissues. The main goal of our study was to identify and characterize the interaction between NopT and Nod factor receptors. We therefore believe that an in-depth analysis of the bacterial infection process at later symbiotic stages is out of the scope of the present work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents data demonstrating NopT's interaction with Nod Factor Receptors NFR1 and NFR5 and its impact on cell death inhibition and rhizobial infection. The identification of a truncated NopT variant in certain Sinorhizobium species adds an interesting dimension to the study. These data try to bridge the gaps between classical Nod-factor-dependent nodulation and T3SS NopT effector-dependent nodulation in legume-rhizobium symbiosis. Overall, the research provides interesting insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic interactions between rhizobia and legumes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript nicely demonstrates NopT's proteolytic cleavage of NFR5, regulated by NFR1 phosphorylation, promoting rhizobial infection in L. japonicus. Intriguingly, authors also identify a truncated NopT variant in certain Sinorhizobium species, maintaining NFR5 cleavage but lacking NFR1 interaction. These findings bridge the T3SS effector with the classical Nod-factor-dependent nodulation pathway, offering novel insights into symbiotic interactions.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In the previous study, when transiently expressed NopT alone in Nicotiana tobacco plants, proteolytically active NopT elicited a rapid hypersensitive reaction. However, this phenotype was not observed when expressing the same NopT in Nicotiana benthamiana (Figure 1A). Conversely, cell death and a hypersensitive reaction were observed in Figure S8. This raises questions about the suitability of the exogenous expression system for studying NopT proteolysis specificity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your attention to these plant-specific differences. In view of your comments, we plan to revise the Discussion and explain the different expression systems used for studying NopT effects <italic>in planta</italic>. Previous studies showed that NopT expressed in tobacco (<italic>N. tabacum</italic>) or in specific <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotypes (with <italic>PBS1/RPS5</italic> genes) causes rapid cell death (Dai et al. 2008; Khan et al. 2022). Our data shown in Fig. S8 confirm these findings. As cell death (effector triggered immunity) is usually associated with induction of protease activities, we considered <italic>N. tabacum</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants as not suitable for testing NFR5 cleavage by NopT. In fact, no NopT/NFR5 experiments were performed with these plants in our study. In contrast, the expression of NopT in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> did not lead to cell death in our experiments. Khan et al. 2022 also reported that cell death does not occur in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> unless the cells were transformed with PBS1/RPS5 constructs. Thus, <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> is a suitable expression system to analyze NopT protease activity on co-expressed substrates. Our revision aims to better understand the advantages of the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> expression system for studying NopT mediated proteolysis of NFR5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) NFR5 Loss-of-function mutants do not produce nodules in the presence of rhizobia in lotus roots, and overexpression of NFR1 and NFR5 produces spontaneous nodules. In this regard, if the direct proteolysis target of NopT is NFR5, one could expect the NGR234's infection will not be very successful because of the Native NopT's specific proteolysis function of NFR5 and NFR1. Conversely, in Figure 5, authors observed the different results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our inoculation experiments clearly show that NopT of NGR234 has a negative effect on formation of infection foci (Fig. 5A) and nodule primordia (Fig. 5E). Our biochemical analysis indicates that NopT targets the NFR1/NFR5 complex, which most likely impairs activation of downstream responses such as <italic>NIN</italic> gene expression. Accordingly, <italic>NIN</italic> promoter activity was found to be higher in roots inoculated with the Δ<italic>nopT</italic> mutant as compared to the NGR234 wild-type (Fig. 5B and 5D). It is therefore plausible that NopT impairs rhizobial infection of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> due to inhibition of NFR1/NFR5 functions. We agree with this Reviewer that it can be expected that “NGR234's infection will not be very successful”. Fig. 5 confirms that Δ<italic>nopT</italic> mutant is indeed a better symbiont and we do not think that we obtained “unexpectedly different results”. In the revised version, we will try to formulate our discussion text better in order to avoid any misunderstandings. Furthermore, will write as figure title “NopT dampens rhizobial infection…” instead of “NopT regulates rhizobial infection…”. We are also considering changing the title of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 6E, the model illustrates how NopT digests NFR5 to regulate rhizobia infection. However, it raises the question of whether it is reasonable for NGR234 to produce an effector that restricts its own colonization in host plants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the potential paradox of NGR234 producing an effector that appears to restrict its own colonization in host plants. In fact, depending on the host plant, most rhizobial effectors are “double-edged swords” that play either a positive or negative role in the symbiosis. In response to your comment, we will discuss the possibility that NopT may confer selective advantages in interactions between NGR234 and host plants where NopT plays a positive symbiotic role (Dai et al. 2008; Kambara et al. 2009). Inhibition of NFR1/NFR5 functions by NopT in these host plants could be a feedback response in cells in which symbiotic signaling has already started. It is tempting speculate that the interaction between NopT and Nod factor receptors reduces Nod factor perception and downstream signaling to avoid a possible overreaction of symbiotic signaling, which may result in hypernodulation or formation of empty nodules without bacteria. Furthermore, it is tempting to speculate that NopT targets not only Nod factor receptors but also other host proteins to promote symbiosis, e.g. by suppressing excessive immune responses triggered by hyperinfection of rhizobia. In our revised manuscript, we will highlight the need for further investigations to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the observed infection phenotype and the role of NopT in modulating symbiotic signaling pathways.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The failure to generate stable transgenic plants expressing NopT in Lotus japonicus is surprising, considering the manuscript's claim that NopT specifically proteolyzes NFR5, a major player in the response to nodule symbiosis, without being essential for plant development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. The failure to obtain <italic>L. japonicus</italic> plants constitutively expressing NopT was indeed surprising and suggests that NopT targets not only NFR5 but also other proteins in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>. The number of NopT substrates in plants could be greater than assumed. For example, we show in our work that NopT can cleave AtLYK5 and LjLYS11. In our manuscript, we don’t provide protocols and data on our efforts to construct <italic>L. japonicus</italic> plants stably expressing NopT. Indeed, it cannot be completely ruled out that the observed failure is not due to NopT expression, but rather to other factors that influence the transformation and regeneration of explants into whole plants. Our results should therefore not be over-interpreted. We consider a discussion of our failed transformation experiments to be somewhat preliminary and not central to this manuscript. herefore, we plan to modify our Discussion and delete the sentence reporting that stable transgenic plants expressing NopT have not been successfully generated.</p>
