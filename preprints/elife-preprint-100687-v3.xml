<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Recent studies have established a reciprocal causal link between aging and the activation of transposable elements, characterized in particular by a de-repression of LINE-1 retrotransposons. These LINE-1 elements represent 21% of the human genome, but only a minority of these sequences retain the coding potential essential for their mobility. LINE-1 encoded proteins can induce cell toxicity implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, our knowledge of the expression and localization of LINE-1-encoded proteins in the central nervous system is limited. Using a novel approach combining atlas-based brain mapping with deep-learning algorithms on large-scale pyramidal brain images, we unveil a heterogeneous, neuron-predominant and widespread ORF1p expression throughout the murine brain at steady-state. In aged mice, ORF1p expression increases significantly which is corroborated in human post-mortem dopaminergic neurons by an increase in young LINE-1 elements including those with open reading frames. Mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous mouse ORF1p revealed novel, neuron-specific protein interactors. These findings contribute to a comprehensive description of the dynamics of LINE-1 and ORF1p expression in the brain at steady-state and in aging and provide insights on ORF1p protein interactions in the brain.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>In summary, we have strengthened the manuscript by including additional control data for the human and mouse ORF1p antibodies used throughout the study (Suppl Fig. 2B, 2E), including knock-down experiments in mouse ((Suppl Fig. 1D) and human dopaminergic neurons in vitro (Suppl Fig. 2C).

Moreover, the analysis of repeat element expression in human post-mortem dopaminergic neurons is now accompanied by post-hoc statistical tests and improved data visualization (Fig. 5E). We also added new co-staining experiments of the neuronal subtype marker parvalbumin together with ORF1p (Suppl Fig. 4). Additional methodological details have been provided regarding the large-scale analysis pipeline, particularly the ABBA framework and the deep learning algorithm.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Only about 2 % of the human genome are DNA sequences that will be translated into protein. The remaining 98 % are comprised of introns, regulatory elements, non-coding RNA, pseudogenes and repetitive elements including transposable elements. However, some sequences in what is generally considered “non-coding genome” do in fact contain sequences which encode proteins. This is true for specific lncRNAs which can encode peptides or functional proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> but also for a few copies of two transposable element families, Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) and Human Endogenous RetroViruses (HERV). Non-functional copies of retrotransposons, to which LINE-1 and HERV belong, cover about 44% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> of the human genome as remnants of an evolutionary ancient activity. Depending on the source, about 100 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> to 146 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> full-length LINE-1 elements with two open reading frames encoding ORF1 and ORF2 are present in the Human reference genome (GRCh38 Genome Assembly) and several incomplete HERV sequences encoding either or any combination of envelope (env), gag, pro or pol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The LINE-1 encoded protein ORF1p, an RNA binding protein with “cis” preference <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and ORF2p, an endonuclease and reverse transcriptase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> are required for the mobility of LINE-1 elements. As many other transposable elements (TEs) including HERVs, LINE-1 elements are repressed by multiple cellular pathways. It was thus generally thought that TEs are repressed in somatic cells with no expression at steady-state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, the aging process reduces the reliability of these repressive mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. It is now, 31 years after the initial proposition of the “transposon theory of aging” by Driver and McKechnie <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, still a matter of debate whether TE activation can be both, a cause and a consequence of aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Sparse data has shown that the LINE-1 encoded protein ORF1p is expressed at steady-state in the mouse ventral midbrain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, the mouse hippocampus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and in some regions of the human post-mortem brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and recent data informed about the presence of full-length transcripts in cancer cells, human epithelial cells and mouse hippocampal neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Repression of LINE-1 might thus be incomplete and if so, it remains unclear how cells then prevent cell toxicity associated with LINE-1 encoded protein activity. Indeed, LINE-1 encoded proteins have been demonstrated to induce genomic instability (ORF2p endonuclease-mediated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)</sup> and inflammation (ORF2p reverse transcriptase-mediated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)</sup> and these cellular activities might be causally related to organismal aging, cancer, autoimmune and neurological diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. For instance, LINE-1 activation can drive neurodegeneration of mouse dopaminergic neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, of drosophila neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and of mouse Purkinje neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> which can be at least partially rescued with nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or other anti-LINE-1 strategies. NRTIs are currently being tested in several clinical trials designed to target either the RT of HERVs or the RT encoded by the LINE-1 ORF2 protein. It is not known today, however, to which extend LINE-1 encoded proteins are expressed at steady-state throughout the mouse and human brain, whether there is cell-type specificity and whether activation of LINE-1 encoded proteins is associated with brain aging or human neurodegeneration. Here, using a deep-learning assisted cellular detection methodology applied to pyramidal large-scale images of the mouse brain mapped to the Allen mouse brain atlas combined with post-mortem human brain imaging, co-IP mass spectrometry and transcriptomic analysis of LINE-1 expression, we describe a brain-wide map of ORF1p expression and interacting proteins at steady-state and in the context of aging. We find a heterogenous but widespread expression of ORF1p in the mouse brain with predominant expression in neurons. In aged mice, neuronal ORF1p expression increases brain-wide and in some brain regions to up to 27%. In human dopaminergic neurons, young LINE-1 transcripts and specific full-length and coding LINE-1 copies are increased in aged individuals. We further describe endogenous mouse ORF1p interacting proteins revealing known interactors and unexpected interacting proteins belonging to GO categories related to RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling, cytoskeleton and the synapse.</p>

<title>Widespread and heterogenous expression of the LINE-1 encoded ORF1p protein in the wildtype mouse brain</title>
<p>To investigate the expression pattern and intensities of endogenous LINE-1 encoded ORF1p protein throughout the entire mouse brain, we devised a deep-learning assisted cellular detection methodology applied to pyramidal large-scale images using a comprehensive workflow complemented by an approach based on confocal imaging as schematized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. Briefly, starting from sagittal slide scanner images of the mouse brain, we defined anatomical brain regions by mapping the Allen Brain Atlas onto the slide scanner images using Aligning Big Brains &amp; Atlases (ABBA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. We then employed a deep-learning detection method to identify all cell nuclei (Hoechst) and categorize all detected cells into neuronal cells (NeuN+) or non-neuronal cells (NeuN-) and ORF1p-expressing cells (ORF1p+) or cells that do not express ORF1p (ORF1p-). This workflow allowed us then to characterize the cell identity of ORF1p+ cells and ORF1p intensity throughout the whole brain but also in specific anatomical regions. In parallel, we completed the approach using confocal microscopy on selected anatomical regions allowing for comparison with higher resolution. Importantly, the specificity of the ORF1p antibody, a widely used, commercially available antibody <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, was confirmed by blocking the ORF1p antibody with purified mouse ORF1p protein resulting in the complete absence of immunofluorescence staining (Suppl Fig. 1A), by using an in-house antibody against mouse ORF1p<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> which colocalized with the anti-ORF1p antibody used (Suppl Fig. 1B, quantified in Suppl Fig. 1C), by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry used in this study (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, Suppl Table 2) and by siRNA-mediated knock-down of ORF1 in a differentiated mouse dopaminergic cell line (MN9D; Suppl Fig. 1D). Unexpectedly, we found a generalized and widespread expression of ORF1p throughout the brain of wildtype mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>; Swiss OF1 mice, three months-old; whole brain except regions with particularly high cellular density (cerebellum, hippocampus, olfactory bulb) which impedes nuclei detection by deep-learning. ORF1p is detectable in all regions and subregions analyzed with heterogenous expression patterns (density and intensity) per region/subregions. The ten regions shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> exemplify visible different densities of ORF1p+ cells with varying levels of expression. Notably, the expression pattern of ORF1p in the hippocampus is similar to what has recently been published <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, panel 2). Throughout the entire brain, the mean density of ORF1p+ cells per mm² was ≈ 305 ±18 (mean ±SEM), representing up to 20% of all detected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). ORF1p+ cells in each mouse brain analyzed showed up to eight-fold disparities in intensity between low- and high-expressed cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We then quantified nine anatomical regions according to the Allen Brain Atlas on four brains of three-month old mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) using the automated workflow (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) with regard to cell density (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), cell proportions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and fluorescent intensity of ORF1p+ cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). This approach permitted the analysis of about 10 000 ORF1p+ cells per animal highlighting the power of our large-scale analysis. Densities of ORF1p+ cells ranged from the lowest density in the hindbrain with 154 ±19 cells per mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> (mean ±SEM) to the highest density of ORF1p+ cells in the isocortex with 451 ±44 cells per mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> (mean ±SEM) and the thalamus with 446 ±50 cells per mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> (mean ±SEM). The proportion of ORF1p+ cells per anatomical region fluctuated between 10% ±2.1 (ventral striatum, mean ±SEM) and 31% ±1.6 (thalamus, mean ±SEM). The dorsal striatum (“striatal dorsal” in the Allen Brain Atlas denomination) exhibited the lowest ORF1p expression intensity (658 ±3 mean ±SEM) of all regions tested, the hindbrain the highest mean intensity of ORF1p per cell (mean ±SD 1221 ±548) as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and quantified in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>. Interestingly, cell density did not correlate with expression levels. Dorsal and ventral striatum for instance displayed similar ORF1p intensities per cell but exhibited significant differences in ORF1p cell density and proportion. The “midbrain motor” region as defined by the Allen Brain Atlas showed an intermediate cell density (mean ±SEM 265 ±16 cells per mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) and a rather high ORF1p expression intensity (mean ±SEM 1006 ±533). Statistical analysis comparing mean density of ORF1p+cells per mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> or mean intensity per ORF1p+ cells among regions confirmed the heterogeneity concerning ORF1p expression throughout the mouse brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, 1F). Slide scanner and confocal images revealed an exceptionally high ORF1p expression intensity in the ventral region of the midbrain which we identified as the <italic>Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc)</italic>. This region displayed an important density of ORF1p+ cells and a comparatively high level of ORF1p expression as illustrated by confocal imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, panel 8), but could not be quantified independently with our brain-wide approach due to the geometrically-complex anatomy of this region and its small size (subregion-level in the Allen Brain Atlas hierarchy). Another region which could not be included in our brain-wide analysis was the cerebellum due to its extremely high density of cell nuclei. However, slide scanner and confocal imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, panel 10) revealed that ORF1p is expressed in Purkinje cells, while not detectable in the molecular or granular layers.</p>

<caption><title>Widespread and heterogenous expression of ORF1p protein in the mouse brain</title>
<p>(A) Schematic representation of the unbiased cell detection pipeline on large-scale and confocal images. Immunofluorescent images on sagittal mouse brain slices were acquired on a digital pathology slide scanner or on a confocal microscope (DNA stain: Hoechst, neuronal marker; NeuN, protein of interest: ORF1p). Pyramidal images aquired with the slide scanner were then aligned with the hierarchical anatomical annotation of the Allen Brain Atlas using ABBA. Once the regions defined, a deep-learning based detection of cell nuclei (Hoechst staining, Stardist) and cell cytoplasm (NeuN staining, Cellpose) was performed on each sub-region of the atlas. Objects were filtered according to the background intensity measured in each sub-region for each channel (NeuN and ORF1p). The identity and intensity measures were analyzed at the regional and whole brain level. In parallel, confocal images (multiple z-stacks) of two selected regions (frontal cortex and ventral midbrain) were also acquired and identity and intensity were quantified using Cellpose.

<p>In order to confirm ORF1p expression by an independent method, we performed Western blot analysis on six micro-dissected regions from the mouse brain (Swiss/OF1 mouse, three-month old). As shown in Suppl Fig. 1E, ORF1p is expressed in all six regions with varying expression levels confirming the overall presence of ORF1p throughout the brain. We then chose two regions with significantly divergent ORF1p expression intensities as identified and quantified on pyramidal large-scale images: the frontal cortex (low) and the ventral midbrain (intermediate to high). We confirmed a significant higher expression of ORF1p in the ventral midbrain compared to the frontal cortex using an approach based on the unbiased, automated quantification of multiple z-stacks using a confocal microscope (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>) and by Western-blotting on micro-dissected regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>, 1I). In concordance with the findings stemming from the large-scale image quantification pipeline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), the ventral midbrain showed ≈ 2-times higher expression of ORF1p than the frontal cortex as quantified in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> (1.8-fold) and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref> (2.3-fold) validating our cellular detection methodology for pyramidal large-scale imaging and underscoring the heterogeneity of ORF1p expression levels in the mouse brain.</p>
<p>To investigate intra-individual expression patterns of ORF1p in the post-mortem human brain, we analyzed three brain regions of a neurologically-healthy individual (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>, entire Western blot membrane in Suppl Fig. 2A) by Western blotting using a commercial and well characterized antibody which we further validated by several means. While there is some discrepancy in the field, the double band pattern in Western blots has been observed in other studies for human ORF1p outside of the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> as well as for mouse ORF1p <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. The nature of this lower band is unknown, but it might be due to truncation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, specific proteolysis or degradation. Nevertheless, it appears that in cell culture models, a single ORF1p band is observed, whereas in murine and human samples, the ORF1p band is, to our knowledge, consistently associated with a lower molecular weight band <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. We validated the antibody by immunoprecipitation and siRNA knock-down in human dopaminergic neurons in culture (differentiated LUHMES cells, Suppl Fig. 2B <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">and 2C</xref>) where we detected in most cases the upper band only. ORF1p was expressed at different levels in the human post-mortem cingulate gyrus, the frontal cortex and the cerebellum underscoring a widespread expression of human ORF1p across the human brain. This was in accordance with ORF1p immunostainings of the human post mortem cingulate gyrus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref> and Suppl Fig. 2E) and frontal cortex (Suppl Fig. 2E), with an absence of ORF1p staining when using the secondary antibody only (Suppl Fig. 2E).</p>

<p>In summary, our findings reveal the consistent presence of ORF1p expression throughout the mouse brain in all anatomical regions analyzed with high regional variability in terms of density of ORF1p+ cells and ORF1p+ cell intensity. ORF1p is also expressed in the human brain in at least three brain regions. This finding raises several questions concerning cell-type identity of ORF1p expressing cells and potential functions or consequences of ORF1p expression in the mouse and human brain at steady-state.</p>

<title>ORF1p is predominantly expressed in neurons</title>
<p>Following our observation of a wide-spread expression of endogenous ORF1p throughout the brain, we first addressed the question of the cellular identity of ORF1p+ cells. To this end, we used the neuron-specific marker NeuN, commonly used to identify post-mitotic neurons in the central nervous system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. This allowed us to determine the proportion of neuronal (NeuN+) or non-neuronal cells (NeuN-) expressing ORF1p (ORF1p+) or not (ORF1p-). Making use of our large-scale imaging approach (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), we observed drastic dissimilarities in detected cellular proportions between the white and grey brain matter. As expected, we observed only 1% of NeuN+ cells in the white matter (corpus callosum; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) validating both, the neuronal marker NeuN as such and the ABBA superposition of the Allen Brain Atlas onto the sagittal brain slices. In the grey matter, our approach detected 30.5% NeuN+ cells (dark red and yellow bars in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) which, according to the literature, should include all post-mitotic neurons with only minor exceptions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and corresponds to the reported proportion of neurons present in the mouse brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The nine identified grey matter regions in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> display the proportions of the different cell types per region. The proportion of all cells in a given region which are positive for ORF1p (dark red bars) differed between regions (lowest proportion: hindbrain: 7%; highest proportion dorsal striatum: 26.6%). In the isocortex and the midbrain motor-related regions, the majority of neurons detected express ORF1p (54% and 59% by large-scale analysis, Suppl Fig. 3A; 68.7% and 68.8% by confocal imaging, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, quantified in C), while in the midbrain sensory related regions the proportion dropped to 25% whereas it reached 82% in the thalamus (Suppl Fig. 3A). Altogether, nearly half of all NeuN+ cells throughout the mouse brain expressed ORF1p (mean of all regions: 48.2%; Suppl Fig. 3A). Regarding the cell identity of ORF1p+ cells brain-wide, more than 70% were identified as neuronal by the large-scale approach (Suppl Fig. 3B). This contrasted somewhat with results obtained by the second approach using confocal imaging on multiple z-stacks which indicated that 91.3% (frontal cortex) and 88.5% (ventral midbrain) of ORF1p+ cells were neuronal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). This difference in percentages of ORF1p+ expressing neurons among all neurons between the large-scale image cell detection methodology and the confocal workflow is most probably due to technical limitations inherent to the large-scale pipeline. Indeed, with the latter approach, region-dependent differences in cell density and signal intensity might be the cause for an underestimation of the proportion of ORF1p+ cells being neuronal due to difficulties in cell detection by StarDist/Cellpose (high cell density) on a single focal plan, technical difficulties which are widely reduced by the multiple z-stack based approach when using a confocal microscope. Moreover, the large-scale pipeline involves background measurements in each sub-region in order to apply stringent filtering. This, however, results in a loss of true positives cells, but avoids cells which are out-of-focus, the presence of which is inherent to the slide scanner microscope which lacks optical sectioning (see Materials &amp; methods section for evaluated model performance). Notably, frontal cortex and ventral midbrain present similar proportion of neurons expressing ORF1p (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), although the percentage of NeuN+ cells between these two regions is significantly different (Suppl Fig. 3C). As we could not rule out that ORF1p might also be expressed in non-neuronal cells, we turned to non-neuronal markers specific for different glial cell populations using two different astrocytic markers (GFAP, Sox9), the astro-and oligodendrocytic marker S100β and the microglial marker Iba1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and performed co-staining with ORF1p followed by confocal imaging as illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>. We screened multiple images of frontal cortex, ventral midbrain, hippocampus and striatum and did not find a single ORF1p+ cell which could unambiguously be defined as non-neuronal. This indicated that ORF1p is not or only very rarely expressed in non-neuronal cells. To further confirm the predominant presence of expression of ORF1p in neurons and the absence of ORF1p expression in non-neuronal cells, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate neurons (using a NeuN antibody) and non-neuronal cells (NeuN-) from the adult mouse brain followed by Western blotting with an antibody against ORF1p (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). As described above, this antibody is well characterized, extensively used and was validated further in this study. After FACS-sorting of neurons from the adult mouse brain using an antibody against NeuN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, G</xref>), we detected ORF1p exclusively in the neuronal population (NeuN+, internal control = heavy chain), confirming the results based on two different imaging approaches. Finally, to assess whether predominant, if not exclusive ORF1p expression in neurons is mouse brain specific or a pattern also applicable to the human brain, we investigated the identity of ORF1p expressing cells in the post-mortem cingulate gyrus of a healthy human brain. Similar to what we found in the mouse brain, we observed sparse NeuN expression in the white and extensive NeuN staining in the grey matter corresponding to the cortical layers (Suppl Fig. 2D, grey and white matter separated by a dashed line) with ORF1p+ cells predominantly located in the grey matter (confocal images in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>, Suppl Fig 2E are located in the grey matter). All cells stained by ORF1p were co-stained with NeuN indicating that ORF1p was expressed in neuronal cells in the human brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). However, due to the lower signal quality inherent to human post-mortem sections compared to mouse sections, the identity of ORF1p+ cells was estimated to be 80% neuronal by the automated image analysis pipeline of confocal images (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>), although no ORF1p+ / NeuN- cells could be clearly identified. Of all neurons identified, 37.2% were ORF1p+ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>), indicating that, similar to the mouse brain, only a fraction of neurons express ORF1p (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>, right).</p>
<p>Next, we asked the question of a neuron-subtype specific expression of ORF1p. Our previous study had revealed a higher expression of ORF1p in tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons compared to TH-negative neurons in the mouse ventral midbrain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. A recent study reported that endogenous LINE-1 RNA and ORF1p expression were higher in parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons compared to PV-negative neurons in the mouse hippocampus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. To address the question of a generalized co-expression of ORF1p and PV cells, we co-stained sagittal brain sections of young mice with antibodies against ORF1p and PV and, in some cases the lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA), which specifically stains glycoproteins surrounding PV+ neurons. Confocal imaging on several brain regions including the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, hindbrain, ventral midbrain and thalamus revealed ORF1p+ neurons co-expressing PV, but also many examples of equally intense ORF1p+ neurons that do not express PV (Suppl Fig. 4).</p>
<p>In summary, ORF1p expression in the mouse and human brain is widely restricted to neurons of which a proportion express ORF1p. This raises the question of the function and consequences of ORF1p expression specifically in neurons but also on the dynamic regulation of this expression upon exogenous (exposome) or endogenous (aging) challenges.</p>

<title>ORF1p expression is increased in the aged mouse brain</title>
<p>ORF1p is expressed at steady-state throughout the brain, but whether this expression is dynamically regulated remains unknown. Aging has been linked to LINE-1 regulation in some studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> potentially as both, a trigger and as a consequence of LINE-1 activation, but whether this is true for the brain and if yes, whether this might be region-specific has not been investigated brain-wide. We therefore addressed the question whether advanced age was paralleled by a change of expression patterns or expression levels of ORF1p in the brain. We first analyzed ORF1p expression levels comparing young (3-month) to aged (16-month) mouse brains using the cell detection workflow applied to large-scale images described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. Interestingly, the mean intensity of ORF1p expression increased moderately but significantly with advanced age throughout the brain (13% increase brain-wide; n=4 young mice; n=4 aged mice; p=0.03; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This was in contrast to another protein, NeuN, which we used as a control and whose intensity did not change between young and aged brains (n=4 young mice; n=4 aged mice; p=0.27; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Frequency distribution analysis unveiled a shift in ORF1p mean expression per cell in aged mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Importantly, the Hoechst mean intensity within nuclei of ORF1p+ cells, serving as an internal control, showed no significant change (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Among nine analyzed regions, five demonstrated a general increase in ORF1p mean intensity per cell in aged mice (p≤0.05), a change independent from inter-individual variations in both young and aged mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The increase of ORF1p expression (fold change intensity) throughout the brain, reaching nearly a 30% increase in some regions, is represented on the heatmap in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>. These results were confirmed by the confocal imaging approach; ORF1p expression in the frontal cortex remained unchanged but increased significantly in the ventral midbrain region in aged mice as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> and quantified in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>.</p>

<p>We then asked whether the increase in ORF1p expression levels observed in several brain areas in aged compared to young mice was also accompanied by a change in expression patterns. We therefore analyzed cell proportions and densities comparing young and aged mouse brains. Globally, we observed a reduction in the proportion of ORF1p+/NeuN+ cells in aged mouse brains using the cell detection workflow applied to large-scale images described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, a phenomenon mainly driven by the midbrain motor, the dorsal striatum, the pallidum and the thalamus regions (Suppl Fig. 5A, dark red bars, Suppl_Table1). The confocal approach applied to two regions, the frontal cortex and the ventral midbrain (Suppl Fig. 5B), confirmed this reduction in ORF1p+/NeuN+ cell proportions in favor of the ORF1-/NeuN- cell population in the ventral midbrain with no change in cell proportions in the frontal cortex in accordance with the large-scale imaging approach (Suppl Fig. 5A). The predominantly neuronal identity of ORF1p+ cells, however, was unchanged in the ventral midbrain (Suppl Fig. 5C) just as the proportion of neurons expressing ORF1p (Suppl Fig. 5D). We observed a significant shift in NeuN+/- cell proportions (Suppl Fig. 5E) which could either suggest a decrease in NeuN+ cells or a gain of NeuN- cells in this region with age. While proportions are less sensitive to technical variability and can identify cell population shifts, cell densities allow for absolute comparisons. When quantifying global cellular densities throughout the brain, we did not observe a significant reduction of ORF1p expressing cells (Suppl Fig. 5F), neurons (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 5G</xref>) or non-neuronal cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 5H</xref>). When analyzing cell densities in the nine brain regions separately, there were no significant changes in ORF1p positive (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 5I</xref>), NeuN positive (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 5J</xref>) or NeuN negative (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 5K</xref>) cell densities in eight out of nine brain regions. The only exception was the dorsal striatum, but technical limitations applying to this particular brain region might account for these changes. Indeed, the dorsal striatum is different from the other brain regions as it represents the only region consisting of a single ABBA sub-region resulting in only one overall background measurement. Taken together, while there were no major changes in cell proportions, densities nor in ORF1p+ cell identities, we observed an age-dependent increase in ORF1p expression per cell of up to 27%.</p>

<title>Coding LINE-1 transcripts are increased in aged human dopaminergic neurons</title>
<p>Following the observation of increased ORF1p expression in the aged mouse brain, among which the ventral midbrain, and given the age-related susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons in the <italic>SNpc</italic> to cell death and to degeneration in PD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, we turned to a previously published RNA-seq dataset of laser-captured micro-dissected post-mortem human dopaminergic neurons of brain-healthy individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, in order to interrogate full-length LINE-1 mRNA expression profiles as a function of age. To avoid read-length bias to which TE analysis is particularly sensitive, we analyzed only the data derived from 50bp paired-end reads of linearly amplified total RNA as this dataset represented all age categories (n=41; with ages ranging from 38 to 97; mean age: 79.88 (SD ±12.07); n=6 ≤65y; n=35 &gt;65y; mean PMI: 7.07 (SD ±7.84), mean RIN: 7.09 (±0.94), metadata available in Suppl_Table5). As age-related dysregulation of TEs might not be linear, we considered individuals with ages-at-death younger or equal to 65 years as “young” (n=6, 38-65 years, mean age 57.5 years (SD ±9.9)) and individuals older than 65 years as “aged” (n=35, 65-97 years, mean age 83 years (SD±7.8). The expression of the dopaminergic markers tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and LMX1B were similar in both populations indicating no apparent change of dopaminergic identity of analyzed melanin-positive dopaminergic neurons (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 6A</xref>, B). Next, we compared the expression of repeat elements at the class, family and name level based on the repeat masker annotation implemented in the UCSC genome browser using a commonly used mapping strategy for repeats consisting of randomly assigning multi-mapping reads <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. No overt dysregulation of repeat elements at either level of repeat element hierarchy was observed (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 6C-F</xref>). There was a modest but significant increase in several younger LINE-1 elements including L1HS and L1PA2 at the “name” level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>), an analysis which was however underpowered (post-hoc power calculation; L1HS: 28.4%; L1PA2: 32.8%) and thus awaits further confirmation in independent studies. No expression changes were observed for HERVK-int, a human endogenous retrovirus family with some copies having retained coding potential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) or other potentially active TEs like HERVH- int, HERV-Fc1, SVA-F or AluYa5 transcripts in the &gt;65y group (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 6G</xref>). Interestingly, L1HS expression was highly correlated with L1PA2 expression and this correlation extended to almost all younger LINE-1 subfamilies weaning down with evolutionary distance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). This was not true for other active TEs as L1HS was negatively correlated with HERVK-int expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Several regulators of LINE-1 activity have been identified <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and correlation of their expression with L1HS might allow to infer their relevance of interaction (activation or repression) with L1HS in human dopaminergic neurons. Spearman correlation analysis revealed three known repressors of LINE-1 activity whose expression was negatively correlated with LINE-1 expression; EN1 (Engrailed 1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 7A</xref>) with important functions for dopaminergic neuron homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, CBX5/HP1a, a heterochromatin binding protein binding to the histone mark H3K9me3, thereby mediating epigenetic repression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 7B</xref>) and XRCC5/6, also known as Ku86/Ku70, which are essential for DNA double-stranded break repair through the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway and limit LINE-1 full-length insertions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 7C</xref>). The transcripts of these genes showed, although not statistically significant, a trend for decreased expression in the elderly (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 7D-G</xref>). Based on the increase of young LINE-1 families L1HS and L1PA2 in aged human dopaminergic neurons and the finding that ORF1p was increased in the aged mouse brain, we focused our attention on LINE-1 elements with coding potential for ORF1 and ORF2 according to the L1Basev2 annotation which are specific elements comprised in the L1HS and L1PA2 annotation at the “name” level. Most of the 146 full-length and coding LINE-1 termed UIDs (= Unique Identifier) in the L1Base are L1HS elements (76.03%), whereas the remaining 35 UIDs belong to the evolutionary older L1PA2 family (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 7A</xref>). The L1Base annotation is based on the human reference genome (GRCh38) and annotates 146 human full-length (&gt;6kB), intact LINE-1 elements (ORF1 and ORF2 intact) with a unique identifier from 1 to 146 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Attribution of sequencing reads to a specific, individual TE copy is problematic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and several approaches have been proposed to circumvent this problem including the mapping of unique reads <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>.While several tools using expectation maximization algorithms in assigning multi-mapping reads have been developed and successfully tested in simulations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, we used a different approach in mapping unique reads to the L1Base annotation of full-length LINE-1. Specific “hot” LINE-1 loci in a given cellular context have been identified <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, but usage of the L1Base annotation enabled an unbiased approach albeit ignoring polymorphic LINE-1 sequences. Unique read mapping strategies for repeat elements, especially young LINE-1 elements, will unavoidably underestimate LINE-1 locus-specific expression levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, but will be most accurate in assigning reads to a specific genomic location while allowing the comparison of two different conditions analyzed in parallel. Of the 146 full-length LINE-1 elements in the L1Base annotation, 111 were of the L1HS family and 35 belonged to the L1PA2 family (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 8A</xref>). Assuming that expression of UIDs was correlated with mappability, we plotted a mappability count of each UID against its mean normalized read count expression of the six individuals ≤65y (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 8B</xref>, C). Non-parametric Spearman correlation revealed no correlation between UID mappability and expression (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 8C</xref>) indicating no apparent bias between the two parameters. However, individual UID dependency of mappability on expression cannot be excluded, especially for high expressing UIDs like UID-16 for example (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 8B</xref>, C). Expression of LINE-1 at the locus-level has been attributed to artefacts not representing autonomous transcription including differential high intronic read counts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, pervasive transcription or reads attributable to passive co-transcription with genes when the LINE-1 element is intronic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. To evaluate the latter, we determined the number of intronic (46.58%) and intergenic UIDs (78/146; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 8D</xref>) and identified the corresponding genes for intronic UIDs (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 8E</xref>). Of the 146 UIDs, 140 passed the threshold of &gt;3 reads in at least 6 individuals. Differential expression of UID between “young” and “aged” dopaminergic neurons revealed several significantly deregulated full-length LINE-1 loci (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Paired analysis of the expression of all UIDs indicated a general increase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), especially of low expressed UIDs. The comparative analysis of the sum expression of UIDs per individual comparing young (≤65y) with elderly human dopaminergic neurons, however, did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Several specific loci were dysregulated, in particular UID-68 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>), a L1HS element located on chromosome 7 (chr7: 141920659-141926712) in between two genes, OR9A4 (olfactory receptor family 9 subfamily A member 4) and CLEC5A (C-type lectin domain containing 5A; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref> and Suppl Fig.7E). This specific full-length LINE-1 element had a high mappability count of 16 (range of all UIDs: 1-30, mean 9.0 (SD ±6.05), <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig. 7C</xref>) and a post-hoc power analysis score of 96.6% (continuous endpoint, two independent samples, alpha 0.05). To rule out any influence of “hosting” gene transcription interference on measurable UID-68 expression differences, we performed Spearman correlation which did not indicate any correlation between OR9A4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>) or CLEC5A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) expression with UID-68. Together, this indicated that UID-68 might be a candidate for an age-dependent gain of activity. Other dysregulated UIDs (i.e. UID-129, UID-37, UID-127 and UID-137) had either a low mappability score, a low post-hoc power or did not pass the visualization check in IGV, reinforcing the notion that a combination of quality control criteria is crucial to retain a specific locus with confidence. In conclusion, TE expression analysis of this human dataset covering an age-span of 59 years (mean age difference between both groups 25.5 years) indicates an increase in the expression of young LINE-1 elements including those which have coding potential in elderly dopaminergic neurons, particularly a specific full-length LINE-1 element on chromosome 7 (UID-68). A slight net sum increase of UID transcripts/cell might be sufficient for the production of “above steady-state” levels of ORF1p and ORF2p. Other TEs with coding potential, namely members of the HERV family, were not increased. Further, correlation analyses suggest that L1HS expression might possibly be controlled by the homeoprotein EN1, a protein specifically expressed in dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, the heterochromatin binding protein HP1 and the DNA repair proteins XRCC5/6.</p>

<title>Endogenous ORF1p interactors in the mouse brain</title>
<p>To go further in our understanding of steady-state neuronal ORF1p expression across the mouse brain, we immunoprecipitated ORF1p and performed quantitative label-free LC-MS/MS to identify potential protein partners of ORF1p in the adult mouse brain. We successfully immunoprecipitated endogenous ORF1p from whole brain lysates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), where we detect ORF1p exclusively in the 5 independent ORF1p-IP samples (and not at all in 5 independent IgG-IP control samples; Suppl_Table2) and identified a total of 424 potential protein interactors associated with ORF1p (Suppl_Table2; n=5 mice). Using Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we identified several interacting proteins belonging to GO terms related to known functions of the ORF1p protein in RNA binding, preferentially <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> but not exclusively <italic>in cis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, for instance RNA decapping and mRNA catabolic process, or related to the known presence of ORF1p in ribonucleoprotein particles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> (GO: cytoplasmic ribonucleotide granule) or the presence of ORF1p in p-bodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and listed in Suppl_Table3. Other GO terms that emerged, to our knowledge not previously associated with ORF1p, were related to cGMP-mediated signaling (GO: cGMP-mediated signaling and 3’-5’phosphodiesterase activity: i.e. PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4DIP) and the cytoskeleton (GO: microtubule depolymerization, cytoskeleton organization, microtubule and tubulin binding, cytoskeletal motor activity and protein binding). cGMP signaling is regulated by 3’-5’ phosphodiesterases (PDEs) which degrade 3’,5’-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and 3’,5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an activity essential for cell physiology for the integration of extra- and intracellular signals including neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and neuroplasticity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Further, several ORF1p interacting proteins were constituents of the mating-type switching/sucrose nonfermenting complex (SWI/SNF complex), i.e. ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCA2, SMARCB1, SMARCC2), an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler complex disrupting nucleosome/DNA contacts to facilitate DNA/chromatin accessibility by shifting, removing or exchanging nucleosomes along DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Finally, we also observed proteins belonging to the GO term “neuronal cell body”, corroborating with the neuron-specific presence of ORF1p in the brain. A comparative analysis with previous mass spectrometry studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> aimed at identifying ORF1p interacting proteins unveiled significantly more common proteins than randomly expected (overrepresentation test; representation factor 2.6, p&lt; 5.4e-08; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), including LARP1, STAU2, ATXN2, RALY, TARBP2 or DDX21 (for a full list see Suppl_Table4). The presence of a significant number of overlapping ORF1p interactors in different non-neuronal human cells (HEK <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, HeLa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, human breast and ovarian tumors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> and hESCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>) and mouse brain cells (our study), suggest conserved key interactors between both species and between cell types, with a subset of these proteins regulating RNA degradation and translation potentially relevant for the LINE-1 lifecycle itself. However, differences in experimental conditions in between studies could also influence this overlap. ORF1p interactors found in mouse spermatocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> were also present in our analysis including CNOT10, CNOT11, PRKRA and FXR2 among others (Suppl_Table4). To unravel the physical interactions between the identified interactors of endogenous ORF1p within the mouse brain, we used the STRING database (Search Tool for Recurring Instances of Neighboring Genes, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org/">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>). This analysis generated a network representation, where physical interactions are represented by edges (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). In analogy with the GO term analysis, ORF1p displayed interactions with various clusters, including well-known RNA decapping complexes directed against LINE-1 RNA, which also encompassed DCP2 and DCP1A which had not previously been identified as interacting with ORF1p <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Furthermore, ORF1p exhibited interactions with the SWI/SNF complex (highlighted in red) as well as subunits of the RNA polymerase II complex suggesting a direct or indirect association with accessible chromatin, a hitherto unknown interaction of ORF1p with chromatin compartments within the nucleus. Notably, a multitude of novel interactors belonged to the “neuronal cell body” and “neuron projections” clusters, proposing potential neuron-specific partners of ORF1p such as GRM2/5, BAI1, EPHA4, KCNN2, GRIK2 and DMD among others. A last cluster, formed by NCOA5 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 5), NXF1 (Nuclear RNA Export Factor 1), RANBP2 and NU133 (both nucleoporins), might imply a role for these interactions in L1-RNA nuclear export and/or a mechanism for the LINE-1 RNP to gain access to the nucleus in post-mitotic neurons. Altogether, the identification of known and novel interactors of ORF1p in the mouse brain suggests roles of ORF1p in the LINE-1 life cycle (RNA binding and metabolism, RNP formation, nuclear access) but also suggests potential novel physiological roles of ORF1p in the brain related to cytoskeleton organization, cGMP signaling, neuron-specific functions (i.e. synaptic signaling, Suppl_Table3) and chromatin organization and/or transcription regulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While LINE-1 derepression in aging has been extensively explored in peripheral tissues and various pathologies, including cancer, our understanding of LINE-1, particularly ORF1p, in the central nervous system remains limited <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. A recent search of ORF1p peptides in mass spectrometry data spanning 29 different healthy tissues did not reveal the presence of ORF1p in the brain, suggesting that its presence might lie below detection limits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Only a few studies explored and detected ORF1p expression in the brain, most focusing on a specific region (in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> in rats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> and in human post-mortem brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>), but it remained unclear if ORF1p is expressed throughout the entire brain, exhibits cell-type specificity, and most intriguingly, if its expression is influenced by the aging process. Here, using well characterized and validated antibodies, we demonstrate that ORF1p is expressed throughout the entire mouse brain and in at least three regions of the human post-mortem brain at steady-state. Leveraging a comprehensive workflow that incorporates brain atlas registration and machine learning algorithms, we quantified tens of thousands of brain cells, enabling a profound analysis of cell proportions, cell identities, densities and ORF1p expression levels across the entire brain. Surprisingly, more than one-fifth of detected cells expressed ORF1p. Regional variations in ORF1p expression levels were observed, with each region exhibiting distinct proportions, cell density, and signal intensity of ORF1p+ cells. In a non-neurologically diseased human brain, ORF1p was expressed in all three regions examined, that is the cingulate gyrus, the frontal cortex and the cerebellum. This is in accordance to an earlier study using histological staining, which found ORF1p expression in the human frontal cortex, the hippocampus, in basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain and the spinal cord <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This suggests, similarly to the mouse brain, a generalized expression across the human brain. On the transcriptomic level using long-read sequencing of GTEx tissues, brain and liver were highlighted as the organs displaying the highest expression of putatively active, full-length LINE-1 elements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. However, when the authors looked at sub-regions, they found transcript expression in cerebellar hemispheres and the putamen, but not in the caudate and the anterior cingulate gyrus and frontal cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. This is in contrast to our data and the data from Sur et al, where ORF1p was found to be expressed in the latter two regions using two different antibodies. We used the anti-human LINE-1 ORF1p antibody clone 4H1, a well characterized antibody <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. While the sample size for the staining of human post-mortem tissues certainly needs to be increased in order to draw quantitative conclusions, the presence of the protein in two independent studies does point to a steady-state expression of ORF1p in the human brain.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that ORF1p is expressed at steady-state in both, the mouse and human brain, despite the fact that evolutionary young and thus potentially ORF1-encoding LINE-1 elements in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> (L1A, Tf/Gf) and in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> (L1HS, L1PA2) differ significantly in number, sequence and regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. Most differences lie in the 5’promoter region, but also ORF1 and ORF2 sequences are strikingly divergent between mouse and humans. For example, mouse LINE-1 promoters are composed of a varying number of monomers, a structure not found in human-specific LINE-1 promoters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. This has obvious implications for LINE-1 expression regulation which can be very different, but examples of co-evolution of regulatory networks have been described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> and might operate in the brain to regulate LINE-1 and thereby ORF1p expression.</p>
<p>In the mouse brain, we find ORF1p to be expressed predominantly if not exclusively in neurons using immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) followed by Western blotting. This result is consistent with previous studies, such as the identification of ORF1p in excitatory neurons within the mouse frontal cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>, in parvalbumin neurons in the hippocampus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, its presence in neurons in the ventral midbrain including in dopaminergic neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and the recognition of morphological similarities between stained neurons and ORF1p+ cells in a post-mortem hippocampus sample of a healthy individual <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. We also detected ORF1p in Purkinje cells in the mouse and human cerebellum. Neuronal specificity or preference of LINE-1 expression was also shown on the transcriptomic level in recent studies investigating LINE-1 expression in the mouse hippocampus, where neuronal LINE-1 expression exceeded that of astrocytes and microglia by approximately twofold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, is abundant in parvalbumin interneurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and single-nuclei RNA-seq data from the mouse hippocampus and frontal cortex which confirmed globally that repetitive elements including LINE-1 are more active in neurons than in glial cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. In the human brain, LINE-1 transcripts were found in greater quantities in neurons compared to non-neuronal cells by single-nucleus sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. Furthermore, retrotransposition-competent LINE-1 elements were found expressed exclusively in neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. While ORF1p expression is suggested to be expressed in microglia under experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis conditions in the spinal cord <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>, no evidence of such expression was observed in non-neuronal cells under non-pathological condition.</p>
<p>On average, throughout the mouse brain, the majority of neurons were positive for ORF1p and in some regions (i.e. the thalamus) around 80% of neurons expressed ORF1p. Comparing the results of both imaging approaches, the percentages of neurons expressing ORF1p in the ventral midbrain and frontal cortex were roughly similar (around 70% of neurons expressed ORF1p as quantified by confocal imaging and about 60% of neurons were identified as ORF1p+ using the slide scanner approach). In the human cingulate gyrus, we found that 37.2% of neurons express ORF1p and that 80% of cells expressing ORF1p were neurons, which are proportions similar to some regions of the mouse brain. It is however possible that these percentages are underestimated due to technical issues inherent to the machine-learning based algorithm for cell detection as our observations often indicated a positive signal in neurons which were classified as negative due to a particular shape or our stringent intensity threshold. A question which arises based on these findings is whether specific features distinguish ORF1p+ and ORF1p-neurons. One hint comes from a recent study suggesting that in the mouse hippocampus, it is the parvalbumin positive neurons that predominantly express ORF1p <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, as we show here, while PV-positive neurons often co-stain with ORF1p, not all ORF1p positive cells are PV-positive. In the mouse ventral midbrain, TH-positive dopaminergic neurons express higher levels of ORF1p compared to surrounding, non-dopaminergic neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (and this study <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, panel 8). In the mouse cerebellum, ORF1p staining was detected in Purkinje cells and in the human post-mortem brain in Purkinje and possibly in Basket cells. Parvalbumin positive neurons are inhibitory neurons, so are Purkinje and Basket cells. However, dopaminergic neurons are modulatory neurons exerting excitatory and inhibitory effects depending on the brain region they act on. Specific neurons in the granular layer (i.e. Golgi and unipolar brush cells) of the cerebellum are inhibitory, but ORF1p negative, indicating that the decisive feature might not be the excitatory or inhibitory nature of a neuron. Further, ORF1p is expressed in excitatory (CamKIIa-positive) and CamKIIa-negative neurons in the mouse frontal cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup> and there is evidence of full-length L1 RNA expression in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. While further studies are necessary to define the neuronal subtypes expressing ORF1p and their epigenetic make-up allowing this expression, it seems reasonable to conclude on the above-mentioned data that there is no neuronal sub-type specificity characterizing ORF1p expressing neurons. Another possibility is a cell-type specific chromatin organization permissive for the expression of LINE-1 and future single-cell studies in the mouse and human brain might reveal those differences.</p>
<p>Because transposable elements are known to become active in somatic tissues during aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, we aimed to investigate whether there was a corresponding increase at the protein level. In aged mice, ORF1p expression significantly increased throughout the mouse brain consistent with a previously documented increase in ORF1p outside the central nervous system in aged rats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup> and aged mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> and in neurons of layer 2/3 of the mouse frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. By quantifying the mean intensity of ORF1p in over 70 000 cells identified as ORF1p+, we were able to characterize the extent of this increase in each anatomical sub-region. Remarkably, apart from the isocortex which did not show any change, ORF1p expression increased in all other brain regions by 7% to 27%, indicating a generalized increase of ORF1p expression in neurons throughout the brain (13%). We did not detect any change in cell identity of ORF1p expressing cells, that is, ORF1p expression remained predominantly if not exclusively neuronal. Globally, there was also no change in ORF1p-positive, neuronal or non-neuronal cell densities in the aged mouse brain. Further investigations are necessary to investigate the underlying mechanism of the loss of ORF1p+ cells in the dorsal striatum in the aged mouse brain and to examine a possible relationship to the change of proportions of cells in the ventral midbrain, a structure which contains the <italic>SNpc</italic> which projects to the dorsal striatum and which is prone to LINE-1 driven neuronal degeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, while ORF1p intensities per cell increase significantly in older mice in several brain regions, here is no global change in ORF1p+ cell numbers.</p>
<p>An increase of ORF1p might have several direct or indirect consequences on a cell or here, on a neuron. As ORF1p is translated from a polycistronic LINE-1 RNA together with ORF2p, albeit in much higher amounts (the estimated ratio ORF1p to ORF2p is 240:1 in non-native conditions) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>, it can be expected that a LINE-1 ribonucleotide particles are formed and ORF2-dependent cell toxicity in form of genomic instability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and single-stranded cytoplasmic DNA triggered inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> might result. This has been shown in mouse dopaminergic neurons where oxidative stress induced LINE-1 causally contributed to neurodegeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Neurodegeneration was partially prevented by anti-LINE-1 strategies among which NRTIs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and similar LINE-1 protein-dependent neuronal toxicity has been shown in drosophila<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and the mouse cerebellum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In order to test whether an increase in LINE-1 is a feature of human brain aging, we turned to a unique RNA-seq dataset of human laser-captured dopaminergic neurons of 41 individuals ranging from 38 to 99 years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. In accordance with our focus on LINE-1 sequences which are full-length and coding, we developed a rationale to interrogate LINE-1 families with representatives that are coding (L1HS, L1PA2, multimappers; RepeatMasker) and to specifically investigate full-length LINE-1 elements that have intact open reading frames for ORF1p and ORF2p (unique reads; L1Basev2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>). Indeed, we find an increase in L1HS and L1PA2 elements in individuals ≥65y as well as an increase in specific full-length LINE-1 elements but only a trend for increase of all full-length LINE-1 in sum in the elderly. This analysis has technical limitations inherent to transcriptomic analysis of repeat elements especially as it is based on short-read sequences and on a limited and disequilibrated number of individuals in both groups. Nevertheless, we tried to rule out several biases by demonstrating that mappability did not correlate with expression overall and used a combination of visualization, post-hoc power analysis and analysis of the mappability profile of each differentially expressed full-length LINE-1 locus. Interestingly, dysregulated full-length LINE-1 elements in aged dopaminergic neurons did not correspond to those identified in bladder cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup> indicating the intricate nature of this expression across tissues and pathological conditions. Overall, a slight net sum increase of UID transcripts/cell might be sufficient for the production of “above steady-state” levels ORF1p and ORF2p. Further, a dissociation of LINE-1 transcript and protein levels in aging has been observed recently in excitatory neurons of the mouse cortex. In the absence of transcriptional changes of LINE-1, protein levels of ORF1p were increased <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We can only speculate about the reason for an increase in ORF1p in the aged brain. A recent single-cell epigenome analysis of the mouse brain suggested a specific decay of heterochromatin in excitatory neurons of the mouse brain with age which was paralleled by an increase in ORF1p, albeit equally in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, again not indicating any dependency of ORF1p regulation on the excitatory or inhibitory nature of neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Chromatin and particularly heterochromatin disorganization are a primary hallmark of aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup> but other repressive cellular pathways which control the LINE-1 life cycle might also fail with aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Another possibility is a loss of accessibility of repressive factors to the LINE-1 promoter or an age-dependent decrease in their expression. Matrix correlation analysis of several known LINE-1 regulators, both positive and negative, revealed possible regulators of young LINE-1 sequences in human dopaminergic neurons. Despite known and most probable cell-type unspecific regulatory factors like the heterochromatin binding protein CBX5/HP1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> or the DNA repair proteins XRCC5 and XRCC6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, we identified the homeoprotein EN1 as negatively correlated with young LINE-1 elements including L1HS and L1PA2. EN1 is an essential protein for mouse dopaminergic neuronal survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> and binds, in its properties as a transcription factor, to the promoter of LINE-1 in mouse dopaminergic neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. As EN1 is specifically expressed in dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain, our findings suggest that EN1 controls LINE-1 expression in human dopaminergic neurons as well and serves as an example for a neuronal sub-type specific regulation of LINE-1. Although these proteins are known regulators of LINE-1, this correlative relationship awaits experimental validation. The heterogenous, brain-wide presence of ORF1p expression at steady-state is intriguing. In cancer cell lines or mouse spermatocytes, ORF1p interacts with several “host” proteins, some if not most of which are related to the LINE-1 life cycle. However, a profile of endogenous ORF1p interactors in the mouse brain might inform on possible other and organ-specific functions besides its binding to the LINE-1 RNA in “cis”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Among the total 424 potential interactors of endogenous ORF1p in the mouse brain, 38 partners had been previously identified by mass spectrometry in human cancers, cancerous cell lines and mouse spermatocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> (Suppl_Table4). This supports the validity of the list of ORF1p partners identified, although we cannot rule out the possibility that unspecific protein partners might be pulled down due to colocalization in the same subcellular compartment. GO term analysis contained expected categories like “P-body”, mRNA metabolism related categories and “ribonucleoprotein granule”. We also identified NXF1 as a protein partner of ORF1p, a protein found to interact with LINE-1 RNA related to its nuclear export <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. This suggests the conservation of key interactors probably essential for completing or repressing the LINE-1 life cycle in both species, despite the divergence of mouse and human ORF1p protein sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. Along these lines, several ORF1p protein partners we identified might complete the list of post-transcriptional regulators implicated in LINE-1 silencing. Recent work conducted on human cancerous cell lines has demonstrated that MOV10 orchestrates the recruitment of DCP2 for LINE-1 RNA decapping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. In our analysis, we identified DCP2 along with DCP1A, known to enhance the decapping activity of DCP2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>, and DCP1b, a pivotal component of the mRNA decapping complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, MOV10 was not detected in our mass spectrometry analysis, despite its established role in recruiting DCP2 and forming a complex with L1-RNP to mediate LINE-1 RNA decapping, as reported by Liu et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. However, we found two enhancers of mRNA decapping, EDC3 and EDC4, both core components of P-bodies, a membrane-less organelle known to contain L1-RNP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Multiple ubiquitin-ligase proteins were found although not appearing as a significantly enriched GO term. These results add to the picture of the post-transcriptional and translational control of ORF1p and suggest that these mechanisms, despite a steady-state expression, are operational in neurons. Further, several neuron-specific interactors were identified belonging to GO term categories “neuron projection” (75 proteins) and “neuronal cell body” (5 proteins), again pointing to the neuron-predominant expression of ORF1p in the mouse brain. Other interesting aspects were raised from this analysis. Among significantly enriched GO terms, several were related to the cytoskeleton, the functional consequences of which need to be determined in future studies. Our screen also identified PDE10A as an interactor of ORF1p in the mouse brain, a PDE almost exclusively expressed in medium spiny neurons of the striatum and a target for treatment of neurological diseases related to basal ganglia function like Huntington’s disease, schizophrenia and Tourette syndrome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. Interestingly, PDE10A inhibition is related to beta-catenin signaling, another GO term which emerged from our screen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. Finally, we found components of RNA polymerase II and the SWI/SNF complex as partners of ORF1p. This might further indicate that ORF1p has access to the nucleus in mouse brain neurons as described for other cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>, however a bias due to a post-lysis effect cannot be excluded. These findings give rise to intriguing questions regarding the potential function of ORF1p in neuron in health and disease as (i) ORF1p is widely distributed throughout the brain under normal physiological conditions, (ii) ORF1p shows a wide range expression levels within and in between regions, (iii) ORF1p is expressed predominantly if not exclusively in neurons, (iv) but not in all neurons and (v) interacts with proteins that might not directly relate to the LINE-1 life cycle, some of which are neuron-specific. In addition, physicochemical properties of ORF1p to form compacted nucleic acid - bound complexes with sequestration potential were shown <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. Future loss-of-function studies should help to shed light on the necessity of ORF1p for neuronal functions if they exist. This data spurs the idea of a possible “physiological” function of ORF1p as an integrative protein with exapted function in neuronal homeostasis and a loss of restriction in the aged brain limiting LINE-1 expression to steady-state levels.</p>

Finally, each cell was associated with a nucleus having its centroid located inside the cell mask. Cells without an assigned nucleus were discarded, cells with associated nuclei were classified as NeuN+ or NeuN- and ORF1p+ or ORF1p-.

<p>Mouse brains were dissociated with Adult Brain Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-107-677) and incubated with the coupled antibody NeuN Alexa 647 (Abcam, ab190565) or the control isotype IgG Alexa 647 (Abcam, ab199093). Stained cells were filtered a last time with a 40µm filter before FACS sorting (FACS ARIA II). Neuronal and non-neuronal cells were separately collected in PBS -/- 2m EDTA and then centrifugate (5min at 700rpm). Pellets were resuspended in RIPA for protein extraction in an appropriate volume in order to achieve equal cell concentrations (10 000 cells/µl).</p>

<title>RNA-seq analysis</title>
<p>The RNA-seq dataset from Dong et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> was downloaded from dbGAP (phs001556.v1.p1) and contains unstranded paired-end 50bp and 75bp reads from pooled laser-capture micro-dissected dopaminergic neurons from human post-mortem brain (107 samples) from 93 individuals w/o brain disease. RNA-seq had been done on total and linearly amplified RNA. We focused our analysis on data obtained with 50bp reads, in order to avoid mappability bias, while still regrouping all age categories (n=41; with ages ranging from 38 to 97 (mean age: 79.88 (SD ±12.07); n=6 ≤65y; n=35 &gt;65y; mean PMI: 7.07 (SD ±7.84), mean RIN: 7.09 (±0.94)). Sequencing reads were aligned on the Human reference genome (hg38) using the STAR mapper (v2.7.0a) 3 and two different sets of parameters. Genome-wide individual repeat quantification was performed using uniquely mapped reads and the following STAR parameters: --outFilter mapNmax 1–-alignEndsType EndToEnd–-outFilterMismatchNmax 999–-outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.06. Repeats class, family and name quantification was performed using a random mapping procedure and the following parameters : -- outFilterMultimapNmax 5000–-outSAMmultNmax 1–-alignEndsType EndToEnd–-outFilterMismatchNmax 999–-outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.06–-outSAMprimaryFlag OneBestScore–-outMultimapperOrder Random. Repeats annotations were downloaded from the UCSC Table Browser (repeatMasker database: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables">https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables</ext-link>) and coordinates of LINE-1 full length and coding elements were downloaded from the L1base database 2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://l1base.charite.de/l1base.php">http://l1base.charite.de/l1base.php</ext-link>; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>) selecting LINE-1 full length elements containing two predicted complete open reading frames for ORF1 and ORF2 (UID= Unique IDentifier) from the LINE-1 database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://l1base.charite.de/l1base.php">http://l1base.charite.de/l1base.php</ext-link>) and corrected genomic intervals with the repeat masker annotation of the corresponding genomic locus. Repeat quantification from the aligned data was done using a gtf file composed of all genes (Gencode v29) and all individual repeat elements. This strategy was used to avoid overestimation of repeat elements due to overlaps with expressed genes. For individual repeat quantification of the full length L1 elements (L1base), we therefore used a gtf of all genes and all L1base entries, and ran the FeatureCounts tool <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref></sup> with the following parameters: -g gene_id -s 0 -p. In the context of the family-based analysis, we used a gtf with all genes and all annotated repeats elements and ran FeatureCounts with -g gene_family -s 0 -p -M. Before DeSeq2 analysis, we remove all genes and repeat elements with less than 10 reads in a minimum of n individuals, n being the number of individuals in the condition containing the fewest individuals (“young” condition: n=6, 38-65y, mean 57.5 years). We use the same conditions with genes and UIDs with less than 3 reads in a minimum of n individuals. Finally, we calculated the scaling factors using DeSeq2 on all genes + all repeat elements or all gene + UID according to the quantification method and then applied these scaling factors to the corresponding counts tables.</p>
<p>In order to test for the mappability of each UID (= full-length and coding LINE-1), we extracted the bed track « main on human:umap50 (genome hg38) from the UCSC genome browser (≈ 7Mio regions) directly into Galaxy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://usegalaxy.org">usegalaxy.org</ext-link>) and joined genomic intervals with a minimum overlap of 45bp of this dataset with a dataset containing the annotation of UIDs extracted from L1Basev2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> corrected in length with repeat masker and completed with information on whether the UID is intra- or intergenic and, if intragenic, in which gene (NM_ID, chr, strand, start, end, gene length, number of exons, gene symbol) the fl-LINE-1 is located, which resulted in 1266 regions. We then used the “group on data and group by” function in Galaxy and counted the number of overlapping 50kmers with all 146 UIDs (=mappability score). Correlation analysis (non-parametric Spearman) was then done between the mappability score and the normalized read counts.</p>
<p>For visualization of expression, bigwig files were generated for each age group, that is &lt;/=65y and &gt;65y, respectively. We used bamcoverage to obtain bigwig files (normalized by cpm). Then for each age group an average bigwig was generated using bigwigAverage from deeptools (galaxy version 3.5.4); Bigwigs were loaded into IGV alongside tracks showing mappability (Umap50) and selected tracks from repeat masker (LINE, SINE and LTR).</p>
<p>Post-hoc power analysis was performed using the “Post-hoc Power Calculator” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clincalc.com/stats/Power.aspx">https://clincalc.com/stats/Power.aspx</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Immpunoprecipitation of ORF1p from the mouse brain</title>
<p>For immunoprecipitation, we used ORF1p (abcam, ab245122) and IgG rabbit (abcam, ab172730) antibodies. The antibodies were coupled to magnetic beads using the Dynabeads® Antibody Coupling Kit (Invitogen, 14311D) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used 5µg of antibody for 1 mg of beads and used 1.5mg of beads for IP. Individual mouse brain lysates (n=5), homogenized using dounce and sonicated, were incubated with ORF1p or IgG-control coupled beads and a small fraction was kept as input. Each of these two tubes containing coupled beads and brain lysates were diluted in 5 ml buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, protease inhibitor). The samples were then incubated overnight on a wheel at 4°C. Samples were then washed 3 times with 1 ml buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH 8, 200 mM NaCl) using a magnet and then resuspended in the same buffer. The samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer (95°C, 10 min) and 20 µl of each sample were loaded on a 4-12% Nupage gel (Invitrogen, NP0336) to be revealed by WB. For samples used in Mass Spectrometry study, beads were washed with buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH 8, 200 mM NaCl) using a magnet. After 3 washes with 1ml buffer the beads were washed twice with 100 µL of 25 mM NH4HCO3 (ABC buffer). Finally, beads were resuspended in 100 μl of 25mM ABC buffer and digested by adding 0.20 μg of trypsine/LysC (Promega) for 1 hour at 37 °C. A second round of digestion was applied simultaneously on the beads by adding 100 µL of 25 mM ABC buffer and to the previous digest by adding 0.20 µg of trypsin/LysC for 1 hour at 37 °C. Samples were then loaded into homemade C18 StageTips packed by stacking three AttractSPE® disk (#SPE-Disks-Bio-C18-100.47.20 Affinisep) into a 200 µL micropipette tip for desalting. Peptides were eluted using a ratio of 40:60 CH3CN:H2O + 0.1% formic acid and vacuum concentrated to dryness with a SpeedVac device. Peptides were reconstituted in 10 µL of injection buffer in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) before liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation of ORF1p from LUHMES cells (human) differentiated into mature dopaminergic neurons</title>
<p>For immunoprecipitation, we used ORF1p (Millipore, MABC 1152) and IgG mouse (Thermofisher, #31903) antibodies. The antibodies were coupled to magnetic beads using the Dynabeads® Antibody Coupling Kit (Invitogen, 14311D) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. We used 8 µg of antibody for 1 mg of beads. The appropriate volume of buffer was added to the coupled beads to achieve a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Cells were washed with 1X PBS and harvested using 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, NP40 0.5% v/v, protease inhibitor 10 µl/ml). Samples were sonicated for 15 min at 4°C, then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatants obtained were transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and then separated into 3 tubes. One tube was used as the input and the two other two tubes were used for the control and ORF1p IP, respectively. Each of these two tubes were then diluted to 1.5 ml with buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH8, 150 mM NaCl, 10 µl/ml protease inhibitor) to dilute the NP40. The samples were then incubated overnight on a wheel at 4°C, then washed 3 times (first wash corresponds to post-bead samples) with 1 ml buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 10 µl/ml protease inhibitor) using a magnet and then resuspended in the same buffer. The samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer (95°C, 10 min) and 20 µl of each sample were deposited on a 4-12% Nupage gel (Invitrogen, NP0336).</p>

<title>Mass Spectrometry</title>
<p>Online chromatography was performed with an RSLCnano system (Ultimate 3000, Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X with a Nanospay Flex ion source (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were first trapped on a C18 column (75 μm inner diameter × 2 cm; nanoViper Acclaim PepMap<sup>TM</sup> 100, Thermo Scientific) with buffer A (2/98 MeCN/H2O in 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 2.5 µL/min over 4 min. Separation was then performed on a 50 cm x 75 μm C18 column (nanoViper Acclaim PepMap<sup>TM</sup> RSLC, 2 μm, 100Å, Thermo Scientific) regulated to a temperature of 50°C with a linear gradient of 2% to 30% buffer B (100% MeCN in 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min over 91 min. MS full scans were performed in the ultrahigh-field Orbitrap mass analyzer in ranges m/z 375–1500 with a resolution of 120 000 at m/z 200. The top 20 intense ions were subjected to Orbitrap for further fragmentation via high energy collision dissociation (HCD) activation and a resolution of 15 000 with the intensity threshold kept at 1.3 x 105. We selected ions with charge state from 2+ to 6+ for screening. Normalized collision energy (NCE) was set at 27 and the dynamic exclusion of 40s. For identification, the data were searched against the Mus Musculus (UP000000589_10090 012019) Uniprot database using Sequest HT through proteome discoverer (version 2.4). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin and a maximum of two-missed cleavage sites were allowed. Oxidized methionine, Met-loss, Met-loss-Acetyl and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. Maximum allowed mass deviation was set to 10 ppm for monoisotopic precursor ions and 0.02 Da for</p>
<p>MS/MS peaks. The resulting files were further processed using myProMS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup> v3.10.0. FDR calculation used Percolator and was set to 1% at the peptide level for the whole study. The label free quantification was performed by peptide Extracted Ion Chromatograms (XICs), reextracted by conditions and computed with MassChroQ version 2.2.21 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>. For protein quantification, XICs from proteotypic peptides shared between compared conditions (TopN matching) with missed cleavages were used. Median and scale normalization at peptide level was applied on the total signal to correct the XICs for each biological replicate (n=5). To estimate the significance of the change in protein abundance, a linear model (adjusted on peptides and biological replicates) was performed, and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini– Hochberg FDR procedure. Proteins with at least three peptides, identified in each biological replicates of ORF1p condition, a 10-fold enrichment and an adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered significantly enriched in sample comparisons. Unique proteins were considered with at least three peptides in all replicates. Protein selected with these criteria were used for Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and string network analysis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Bonnifet et al. profile the presence of L1 ORF1p in the mouse and human brain and report that ORF1p is expressed in the human and mouse brain specifically in neurons at steady state and that there is an age-dependent increase in expression. This is a timely report as two recent papers have extensively documented the presence of full-length L1 transcripts in the mouse and human brain (PMID: 38773348 &amp; PMID: 37910626). Thus, the finding that L1 ORF1p is consistently expressed in the brain is important to document and will be of value to the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Several parts of this manuscript appear to be well done and include the necessary controls. In particular, the documentation of neuron-specific expression of ORF1p in the mouse brain is an interesting finding with nice documentation. This will be very useful information for the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The transcriptomic data using human postmortem tissue presented in Figures 4 and 5 are not convincing. Quantification of transposon expression on short read sequencing has important limitations. Longer reads and complementary approaches are needed to study the expression of evolutionarily young L1s (see PMID: 38773348 &amp; PMID: 37910626 for examples of the current state of the art). As presented, the human RNA data is inconclusive due to the short read length and small sample size. The value of including an inconclusive analysis in the manuscript is difficult to understand. With this data set, the authors cannot investigate age-related changes in L1 expression in human neurons.</p>
<p>In line with these comments, the title should be changed to better reflect the findings in the manuscript. A title that does not mention &quot;L1 increase with aging&quot; would be better.</p>
<p>Comments on Revisions:</p>
<p>It is notable that the expression of ORF1p in the human brain shows two strong bands in the WB. As the authors acknowledge in their discussion, some labs report only one band. The authors have performed a number of controls to address this issue, acknowledge remaining uncertainty, and discuss the discrepancy in the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bonnifet et al. sought to characterize the expression pattern of L1 ORF1p expression across the entire mouse brain, in young and aged animals and to corroborate their characterization with Western blotting for L1 ORF1p and L1 RNA expression data from human samples. They also queried L1 ORF1p interacting partners in the mouse brain by IP-MS.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength of the study is the use of two approaches: a deep-learning detection method to distinguish neuronal vs. non-neuronal cells and ORF1p+ cells vs. ORF1p- cells across large-scale images encompassing multiple brain regions mapped by comparison to the Allen Brain Atlas, and confocal imaging to give higher resolution on specific brain regions. These results are also corroborated by Western blotting on six mouse brain regions. Extension of their analysis to post-mortem human samples, to the extent possible, is another strength of the paper. The identification of novel ORF1p interactors in brain is also a strength in that it provides a novel dataset for future studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the IP-MS portion of the study is that none of the interactors were individually validated or subjected to follow-up analyses. The list of interactors was compared to previously published datasets, but not to ORF1p interactors in any other mouse tissue.</p>

<p>The co-staining of Orf1p with Parvalbumin (PV) presented in Supplemental Figure S5 is a welcome addition exploring the cell type-specificity of Orf1p staining, and broadly corroborates the work of Bodea et al. while revealing that Orf1p also is expressed in non-PV+ cells, consistent with L1 activity across a range of neuronal subtypes. The authors also have strengthened their findings regarding the increased intensity of ORF1p staining in aged compared to young animals, and the newly presented results are indeed more convincing. The prospect of increased neuronal L1 activity with age is exciting, and the results in this paper have provided the groundwork for ongoing discoveries in this area. While it is disappointing that no Orf1p interactors were followed up, this is understandable and the data are nonetheless valuable and will likely prove useful to future studies.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Bonnifet et al. profile the presence of L1 ORF1p in the mouse and human brain and report that ORF1p is expressed in the human and mouse brain specifically in neurons at steady state and that there is an age-dependent increase in expression. This is a timely report as two recent papers have extensively documented the presence of full-length L1 transcripts in the mouse and human brain (PMID: 38773348 &amp; PMID: 37910626). Thus, the finding that L1 ORF1p is consistently expressed in the brain is important to document and will be of value to the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Several parts of this manuscript appear to be well done and include the necessary controls. In particular, the documentation of neuron-specific expression of ORF1p in the mouse brain is an interesting finding with nice documentation. This will be very useful information for the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this positive comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several parts of the manuscript appear to be more preliminary and need further experiments to validate their claims. In particular, the data suggesting expression of L1 ORF1p in the human brain and the data suggesting increased expression in the aged brain need further validation. Detailed comments:</p>
<p>(1) The expression of ORF1p in the human brain shown in Fig. 1j is puzzling. Why are there two strong bands in the WB? How can the authors be sure that this signal represents ORF1p expression and not non-specific labelling? While the authors discuss that others have found double bands when examining human ORF1p, there are also several labs that report only one band. This discrepancy in the field should at least be discussed and the uncertainties with their findings should be acknowledged.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see also our extensive response to this comment we made in round #1 of the revisions.</p>
<p>As a summary, in response to the initial review, we included several lines of additional evidence in the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>siRNA-mediated knockdown of ORF1p in human neurons, resulting in ≈50% signal reduction using the antibody in question (Suppl. Fig. 2C) immunoprecipitation using the human ORF1p antibody in question confirming signal specificity (Suppl. Fig. 2B) use of a second antibody in immunostainings, including a new control (Suppl. Fig. 2E) and a revised discussion acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding the lower band:</p>
<p>“The double band pattern in Western blots has been observed in other studies for human ORF1p outside of the brain as well as for mouse ORF1p. […] The nature of the lower band is unknown, but might be due to truncation, specific proteolysis or degradation.”</p>
<p>We have also now added more content to the paragraph starting from line 183 : &quot;While there is some discrepancy in the field, the double band pattern in Western blots...&quot;</p>
<p>To our understanding, this combination of independent methods using two antibodies and complementary validation strategies supports the presence of ORF1p in human brain tissue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The data showing a reduction in ORF1p expression in the aged mouse brain is an interesting observation, but the effect magnitude of effect is very limited and somewhat difficult to interpret. This finding should be supported by orthogonal methods to strengthen this conclusion. For example, by WB and by RNA-seq (to verify that the increase in protein is due to an increase in transcription).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This would indeed be valuable but at this point, we will not be able to perform these experiments at this point (please also see revision #1 for a more detailed answer)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The transcriptomic data using human postmortem tissue presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5 are not convincing. Quantification of transposon expression on short read sequencing has important limitations. Longer reads and complementary approaches are needed to study the expression of evolutionarily young L1s (see PMID: 38773348 &amp; PMID: 37910626 for examples of the current state of the art). As presented, the human RNA data is inconclusive due to the short read length and small sample size. The value of including an inconclusive analysis in the manuscript is difficult to understand. With this data set, the authors cannot investigate age-related changes in L1 expression in human neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see also our extensive response to this comment we made in round #1 of the revisions.</p>
<p>In the revised version, we have added further statistical analyses, incorporated locus-specific mappability scores and provided an even more nuanced interpretation of our findings, as illustrated in lines 390 and 427.</p>
<p>We have acknowledged the limitations of short-read sequencing in this context, while referencing established methodologies (e.g., Teissandier et al., 2019) and recent benchmarking studies (e.g., Schwarz et al., 2022) that validate the use of such data under specific precautions—many of which we have implemented.</p>
<p>Given these considerations, and with the guidance of a co-author with specific expertise in TE bioinformatics, we believe our approach is justified and robust.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In line with these comments, the title should be changed to better reflect the findings in the manuscript. A title that does not mention &quot;L1 increase with aging&quot; would be better.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In line with our response to Point (3), we prefer to retain the current analyses and discussion, which we believe strike an appropriate balance between caution and added scientific value.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bonnifet et al. sought to characterize the expression pattern of L1 ORF1p expression across the entire mouse brain, in young and aged animals and to corroborate their characterization with Western blotting for L1 ORF1p and L1 RNA expression data from human samples. They also queried L1 ORF1p interacting partners in the mouse brain by IP-MS.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength of the study is the use of two approaches: a deep-learning detection method to distinguish neuronal vs. non-neuronal cells and ORF1p+ cells vs. ORF1p- cells across large-scale images encompassing multiple brain regions mapped by comparison to the Allen Brain Atlas, and confocal imaging to give higher resolution on specific brain regions. These results are also corroborated by Western blotting on six mouse brain regions. Extension of their analysis to post-mortem human samples, to the extent possible, is another strength of the paper. The identification of novel ORF1p interactors in brain is also a strength in that it provides a novel dataset for future studies.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for these positive comments.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the IP-MS portion of the study is that none of the interactors were individually validated or subjected to follow-up analyses. The list of interactors was compared to previously published datasets, but not to ORF1p interactors in any other mouse tissue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we had stated in the first round of revision, the list of previously published datasets does include a mouse dataset with ORF1p interacting proteins in mouse spermatocytes (please see line 478-4479: “ORF1p interactors found in mouse spermatocytes were also present in our analysis including CNOT10, CNOT11, PRKRA and FXR2 among others (Suppl_Table4).”) -&gt; De Luca, C., Gupta, A. &amp; Bortvin, A. Retrotransposon LINE-1 bodies in the cytoplasm of piRNA-deficient mouse spermatocytes: Ribonucleoproteins overcoming the integrated stress response. PLoS Genet 19, e1010797 (2023)). We agree that a validation of protein interactors of ORF1p in the mouse brain would have been valuable. However, the significant overlap with previously published interactors highlights the validity of our data. As reviewer #2 points out in the comments on revisions, we hope that follow-up studies will address these points and we anticipate that this list of ORF1p protein interactors in the mouse brain will be of further use for the community.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>We would recommend that the human RNA-seq analysis is removed from the manuscript. The human RNA data is inconclusive due to the short read length and small sample size. The value of including an inconclusive analysis in the manuscript is difficult to understand. With this data set, the authors cannot investigate age-related changes in L1 expression in human neurons.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Thank you for addressing my suggestions. I have no further recommendations at this time.</p>
