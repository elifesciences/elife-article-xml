<title>Abstract</title>
<p>A neuroanatomical minimal network model was revisited to elucidate the mechanism of salt concentration memory-dependent chemotaxis observed in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans</italic> memorizes the salt concentration during cultivation, manifesting a pronounced taste preference for this concentration. The right-side head sensory neuron, designated ASER, exhibits a response to a decrease in salt concentration. The basal level of glutamate transmission from ASER has been demonstrated to transiently increase and decrease when the current environmental salt concentrations are lower and higher, respectively, than that during previous cultivation. Given the sensitivity of excitatory/inhibitory glutamate receptors expressed on the postsynaptic AIY interneurons, it can be anticipated that the ASER-AIY synaptic transmission will undergo a reversal due to alterations in the basal glutamate release. The neural network, derived from the hypothesis, reproduced the salt concentration memory-dependent preference behavior and revealed that the circuit downstream of ASE functions as a module that is responsible for salt klinotaxis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is a fundamental biological principle that all animals have evolved the ability to efficiently access the optimal food patches or nesting sites for survival. This ability is achieved by the animals temporarily memorizing the intensity of sensory cues (e.g., temperature, concentration of substances, etc.) that coincide with the favorable environmental conditions they have previously experienced. The neural system should determine a preferred direction based on both the previously memorized sensory information and the change in the stimulus intensity currently received by the sensory neurons, and regulate the motor neurons to efficiently direct the animal to the optimal location in the real time. However, the precise mechanisms by which the intensity of experienced sensory stimuli is memorized or encoded in the neural system and the favorable direction is varied as a function of those sensory cues remain unclear for a considerable number of sensory stimuli.</p>
<p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has been demonstrated to exhibit chemotaxis to sodium chloride, a phenomenon termed salt chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ward, 1973</xref>). In the context of salt chemotaxis, the amphid taste neurons ASE play a crucial role in sensing the concentration of NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991</xref>). These sensory neurons, which consist of two morphologically symmetric neurons on the left (ASEL) and the right (ASER), are essential for the detection of alterations in the concentration of NaCl. These neurons exhibit a functional asymmetry in which the ASER is depolarized by decreases in salt concentration, whereas the ASEL responds to increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Two distinct behavioral strategies that direct <italic>C. elegans</italic> towards a favorable NaCl concentration during salt chemotaxis have been characterized by an analysis of the migratory behaviors exhibited by the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999</xref>). The first is klinokinesis, which is also referred to as the pirouette. In this strategy, the frequency of redirecting turns is increased when the current direction of locomotion is determined to be unfavorable in relation to the gradient of salt concentration and decreased when it is determined to be favorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999</xref>). The second strategy is referred to as klinotaxis or weathervane. In this behavioral strategy, <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits a continuous turning behavior in a direction that is favorable based on the gradient of salt concentration perpendicular to the direction of locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the salt concentration preferred by <italic>C. elegans</italic> is demonstrated to depend on the difference in salt concentration between the pre-assay culture (<italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub>) and the current environment on the test plate (<italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>). In the presence of food, if the previously cultivated salt concentration is higher than the current environmental concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub> &gt; <italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>), the preferred salt concentrations are demonstrated to become higher than the current concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, if the previously cultivated salt concentration is lower than the current concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub> &lt; <italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>), the preferred salt concentrations are demonstrated to become lower than the current ambient concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The neural circuit mechanism underlying such salt concentration memory-dependent chemotaxis has been intensively investigated, particularly in the context of klinokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sato et al., 2021</xref>). The interneuron postsynaptic to the ASER, AIB, which is involved in the behavior of klinokinesis (i.e., the redirecting turn), exhibits a bidirectional response to changes in NaCl concentration in the current environment, dependent on the previously experienced NaCl concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sato et al., 2021</xref>). The bidirectional neural responses have been demonstrated to be mediated by a change in the basal level of glutamate neurotransmitter released from the ASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sato et al., 2021</xref>). The alteration in the basal glutamate transmission results in a bidirectional response of the postsynaptic AIB due to the distinct sensitivities of the excitatory glutamate receptor GLR-1 and the inhibitory glutamate receptor AVR-14, which are expressed on the AIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>). These findings demonstrate that the reversal of the redirecting turn behaviors in klinokinesis is attributed to the synaptic plasticity between ASER and AIB neurons, which is altered by cultivated salt concentration. In contrast, the salt concentration memory-dependent mechanism underlying another NaCl chemotaxis, klinotaxis, remains largely unexplored.</p>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> has 302 neurons, all of which have been fully mapped on its connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">White et al., 1986</xref>). Although its neural network is relatively simple compared to other multicellular organisms, <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits a wide range of behaviors, including locomotion, foraging, feeding, touch withdrawal, and taxis involving smell, taste, and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bargmann, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">de Bono and Maricq, 2005</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> is, therefore, an ideal organism for the detailed investigation of the relationship between neural connectivity and behavior. However, despite these advances in the connectome, the neural connectivity alone is insufficient for a comprehensive understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying behavior. The integration of neural connectivity information with neurophysiological and behavioral observations is essential for adequately simulating the dynamic interactions within neural networks.</p>
<p>A number of neural network models have been proposed to address this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Appleby, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dunn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ferrée et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ferrée and Lockery, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Izquierdo and Lockery, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Izquierdo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Matsumoto et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Soh et al., 2018</xref>). A neural network model has been developed based on the neuroanatomical minimal network circuit (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which has been demonstrated to reproduce salt klinotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>). The neuroanatomical minimal model is an extension of a previously proposed sensory-motor model that omits interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Izquierdo and Lockery, 2010</xref>). After the presentation of the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>), a neurophysiological discovery regarding the synaptic connections between AIY and AIZ interneurons was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, it was demonstrated that the AIY plays a crucial role in initiating the curving turn by forming an inhibitory synapse with the AIZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, it was observed that the inhibitory synaptic transmission is induced when the Cl<sup>-</sup> ion channel of the acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter receptor, ACC-2, on the postsynaptic AIZ is activated by the ACh neurotransmitter released from the presynaptic AIY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<p>In the present study, the electrophysiological parameters involved in the neuroanatomical minimal network model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>) were re-examined by constraining the AIY-AIZ synaptic transmission to be inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2014</xref>). An evolutionary algorithm with the abovementioned constraints was used to extensively search the parameters within the model and optimize the behavioral performance of the model for salt klinotaxis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> cultivated at a NaCl concentration higher than the current environmental concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub> &gt; <italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>) in the presence of food. The most optimized model indicated that the ASER is connected to the postsynaptic AIY interneurons via an inhibitory synaptic transmission. The validity of the resulting network was corroborated by the experimental observation that the excitation of the ASER in response to a decrease in NaCl was synchronized with that of the AIZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Matsumoto et al., 2024</xref>). Specifically, the synchrony of the excitation of the ASER and AIZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Matsumoto et al., 2024</xref>) taken together with the experimentally identified inhibitory synaptic transmission between the AIY and AIZ revealed that the ASER-AIY synaptic connections should be inhibitory, which was consistent with the network obtained from the most optimized model. It was then hypothesized that the ASER-AIY inhibitory synaptic connections are altered to become excitatory due to a decrease in the baseline release of glutamate from the ASER when individuals are cultured under <italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub> &lt; <italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>. This is due to the substantial difference in the sensitivity of excitatory/inhibitory glutamate receptors expressed on the postsynaptic AIY interneurons. It was postulated that this reversal would result in a reversal of the salt preference behavior observed in klinotaxis. The most optimized model in which solely the ASER-AIY inhibitory synaptic connections were replaced with an excitatory connection, demonstrated a preference for a lower NaCl concentration than the current concentrations, as expected. Finally, the most optimized model was used to investigate the impact of the experimentally suggested reduced activity of the SMB motor neurons in the absence of food on klinotaxis behavior.</p>

<title>An evolutionary algorithm discovered a highly chemotaxis-performing network that reproduced the experimentally observed pattern of neuronal activity</title>
<p>Two types of extensive evolutionary searches for the electrophysiological parameters of the neuroanatomical minimal network model were performed by optimizing a chemotaxis index (CI). The first approach was a conventional evolutionary search without additional neurophysiological constraints, as had been employed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>). The second evolutionary search was conducted with the constraint that the AIY-AIZ synaptic connections be inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2014</xref>). In these genetic algorithms, the networks evolved in chemotaxis assays where conical shapes were employed as salt concentration profiles (Eq. A15). In contrast, the CI for optimized networks was evaluated using a Gaussian shape of salt concentration profile (Eq. A16), which mimics the salt concentration gradients observed in laboratory tests of chemotaxis in <italic>C. elegan</italic>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ferrée and Lockery, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ward, 1973</xref>). The CI values for the most optimized networks with and without the neurophysiological constraints were 0.877 and 0.855, respectively, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. These values were found to be comparable to those reported in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>). The difference between these CI values is slight, while the model optimized with the constraints exhibits a marginally accelerated attainment of the salt concentration peak, as shown by the trajectories. The slightly higher chemotaxis performance observed in the constrained model is not essentially attributed to the introduction of the AIY-AIZ synaptic constraints but rather depends on the specific individuals selected from the optimized individuals obtained from the evolutionary algorithm. In fact, even when the AIY-AIZ constraints are taken into consideration, the model retains a significant degree of freedom to reproduce salt klinotaxis due to the presence of a substantial parameter space. Consequently, the impact of the AIY-AIZ constraints on the optimization of the CI is expected to be negligible.</p>

<p>The locomotion trajectories of the most optimized network with the constraints are depicted for the cases in which the model worm was oriented at ten different angles at the initial position (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>; see also Video 1). For comparison, the trajectories of the most optimized network without the constraints are also depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>. These trajectories show that both the model worms rapidly turned in the direction of the steepest gradient. These model worms exhibited the salt preference behavior in klinotaxis that were consistent with the experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</xref>) and previous simulation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Izquierdo and Lockery, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, in order to determine how the signal arising from alterations in salt concentration was transmitted through the neural circuit to regulate motor systems, we examined the impact of step changes in salt concentration of varying magnitude with different sign on the neurotransmitter release <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> (defined by Eq. A5) from each neuron. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3a</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> present the sign and strength of the weight of the synaptic connection, <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, in the unconstrained and constrained most optimized models employed in this analysis, respectively. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3c</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> illustrate the results of the analysis of <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for the most optimized networks where the additional neurophysiological constraints are not considered and are considered, respectively. It is noted that <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> differs from the membrane potential <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> as a consequence of the influence of the bias term <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> in Eq. A5. Moreover, the neuronal activities involved in signal transmission across chemical synapses are primarily detected through <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. In contrast, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> correlates with the neuronal activity that are involved in gap junction connections, which can be observed experimentally through an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, the evolutionary search with the constraints successfully yielded the network with inhibitory AIY-AIZ synaptic connections as the most optimized model. Coincidentally, the evolutionary search without the constraints also yielded the network with inhibitory AIY-AIZ synaptic connections as the most optimized model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). However, this is an incidental finding, as the unconstrained evolutionary search also yielded high-CI networks with excitatory AIY-AIZ synaptic connections, which were analogous to the network that had been presented as a representative model presented in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>). A noteworthy distinction between <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs 3a</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> is that the ASER-AIY synaptic connections in the constrained model are inhibitory (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) whereas those in the unconstrained model are excitatory (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>

<p>Related to these, the signal transmissions between the neurons that are involved in the neural circuit for klinotaxis have been investigated using calcium imaging techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Matsumoto et al., 2024</xref>). As the salt concentration decreased, the activity of the salt-sensing neuron ASER increased, resulting in an observed activation pattern of the interneuron AIZ that was synchronized with the activation of ASER. As illustrated by the red patterns of <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, the constrained model exhibited a depolarization of AIZ interneurons as the signal output from ASER increased during a decrease in the salt concentration. This indicates that the model reproduces the pattern of neuronal activity observed in the experiments. In contrast, the unconstrained model exhibited an inverse activity pattern of AIZs, namely, a hyperpolarization of AIZs, in response to a decrease in the salt concentration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Nevertheless, the CI performance in the unconstrained model was as high as that in the constrained model. It is therefore essential to consider not only the connectome but also the available neurophysiological information in order to identify potential neural circuits that are consistent with the actual worm among the high-CI networks obtained by the evolutionary search. The inhibitory connections between ASER and AIYs are essential for synchronizing the activation of AIZs with the activity of ASER, provided that the AIY-AIZ connections are inhibitory, as has been identified through experiments. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Matsumoto et al., 2024</xref>).

<title>The model worm turns to move toward higher salinity based on the concentration gradient normal to its direction of movement</title>
<p>Next, it was investigated how the most optimized model with the constraints reaches the peak of the salt gradient during klinotaxis. To elucidate the mechanism of klinotaxis, the curving rate was examined in relation to the bearing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). The curving rate, as defined in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, was introduced to quantify the behavior of worms during klinotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</xref>). The bearing is defined in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and described in detail under <bold>Bearing</bold> in <bold>METHOD</bold>. The positive correlation between the curving rate and the bearing, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, indicates that the model worm continuously turns in the direction of the steepest increase in salt concentration (see <xref rid="figA3" ref-type="fig">Fig A3</xref>). It is, next, necessary to reveal how the model worm determines the direction of its turn in order to increase the salt concentration as it moves. The positive correlation between the curving rate and the normal gradient of the salt concentration, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, indicates that the model worm is able to sense the concentration gradient normal to the travel direction and thus turn in the direction that increases the salt concentration. These results are consistent with the mechanism that will be proposed later, which indicates that the model worms efficiently sense a slight concentration gradient normal to the direction of travel based on a change in salt concentration with sweeping of the head sensory neurons due to the undulating motions and utilize this information to turn in the correct direction. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref> illustrates the positive and negative components of curving rate, as well as the average of these components, as a function of the translational gradient of salt concentration. The translational gradient is defined in <bold>Normal and Translational Salt Concentration Gradient</bold> in <bold>METHOD</bold>. The positive and negative components of the curving rate are respectively sampled from the trajectory during leftward turns (as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) and rightward turns, respectively. The average of the positive and negative components of the curving rate was close to zero regardless of the translational gradient, due to the symmetry between the dorsal and ventral regions of the model worm. In contrast, the magnitude of the positive and negative components of the curving rate increased as the translational gradient varied from positive to negative. This indicates that, when the translational gradient is negatively large, the model worm regulates the direction of movement with a large positive or negative curving rate based on the normal gradient. Conversely, when the translational gradient is positive, the worm fine-tunes the direction of movement with a small positive or negative curving rate, which is determined by the normal gradient.</p>

<title>The minimal neural circuits transmit the signals from the sensory input to the motor systems via both the chemical and electrical connections</title>
<p>Next, focusing on the most optimized network with the constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Matsumoto et al., 2024</xref>), the signaling pathways in response to step changes in salt concentration are discussed in detail. Changes in the <italic>z</italic><sub>ON</sub> signal from the ASEL are transmitted to the AIYL via the excitatory connection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The signals indicating increases in <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> from the AIYL are transmitted to the AIZL via the inhibitory connection between AIYL and AIZL displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, resulting in a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> in the AIZL (see Fig. S1f in the SI). The hyperpolarization signals in the AIZL are transmitted to the AIZR via the gap junction (Figs. S1d and S1f and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>). This is because the neuron dynamics via gap junctions results from the equilibration of the membrane potential <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of two neurons connected by gap junctions rather than the <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. The signals indicating decreases in <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> from the AIZR are transmitted to the SMBDR and SMBVR via the excitatory connection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Note that the oscillatory components <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="621960v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, as defined by Eqs. A10a and A10b, are introduced into the SMBD and SMBV, respectively. Consequently, the baseline components of <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> from the SMBDR and SMBVR are shifted by half a cycle from each other (see the right side of the fourth and third panels from the bottom in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The discrepancies between the <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> values from the SMBD and SMBV neurons (see Eq. A13a) result in an increase in the turning angle <italic>φ</italic> relative to its ideal oscillatory component (black line), as illustrated on the left side of the second panel from the bottom in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>. The implications of the changes in <italic>φ</italic> will be discussed later.</p>
<p>Changes in the <italic>z</italic><sub>OFF</sub> signal from the ASER are transmitted to the AIYL via the inhibitory connection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The signals indicating decreases in <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> from the AIYL are transmitted to the AIZL via the inhibitory connection displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, resulting in a depolarization of the membrane potential <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> in the AIZL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The signals of the depolarization in the AIZL are transferred to the AIZR via the gap junction (see Figs. S1d and S1f and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The signals indicating increases in <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> from the AIZR are transmitted to the SMBDR and SMBVR via the excitatory connection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The disparities between the <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> values from the SMBD and SMBV neurons (see Eq.

It is remarkable that although the signaling pathway in the most optimized network without the constraints (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and Fig. S1c and S1e) is largely different from that with the constraints, the regulatory mechanisms of <italic>φ</italic> exhibited by these networks are analogous. This is evident from a comparison of the second panels from the bottom in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>. As illustrated by the analysis of these signaling pathways, the transmission of signals via electrical gap junctions plays a crucial role in both the neural circuits. Indeed, it was observed in those neural circuits that blocking the gap junctions led to significant changes in neurotransmitter release <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and resulted in changes in the turning angle <italic>φ</italic> (see Fig S2).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>The turning direction is regulated based on both the direction of sweep of the head sensory neurons due to the sinusoidal motion of the worm and the timing of sensory signal input</title>
<p>It was then analyzed how changes in <italic>φ</italic> in response to step changes in salt concentration caused the worm to move in the correct direction. From the sinusoidal trajectory of the model worm (the left side of the first panel from the bottom in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), it can be observed that the head sensory neurons sweep toward the positive y-axis direction during step increases in <italic>z</italic><sub>ON</sub> occurred. This corresponds to a situation where the salt concentrations on the positive side of the <italic>y</italic>-axis are greater than those on the negative side. The turning angle <italic>φ</italic> is increased from its ideal oscillatory component to a value close to zero, causing the model worm to deviate from the ideal sinusoidal trajectory and gradually turn toward higher salt concentrations. Conversely, in the case of step increases in <italic>z</italic><sub>OFF</sub>, the head sensory neurons sweep toward the positive <italic>y</italic>-axis direction, as illustrated in the right lowest panel of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>. This corresponds to a situation where the salt concentrations on the positive side of the <italic>y</italic>-axis are lower than those on the negative side. The turning angle <italic>φ</italic> is reduced from its ideal oscillatory component to be a more negative value, allowing the model worm to turn faster than the ideal sinusoidal trajectory and thus reach higher salt concentrations with greater efficiency. As illustrated by the second panel from the bottom in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, the most optimized network without the constraints also uses a similar regulatory mechanism of <italic>φ</italic> to efficiently reach the peak of the salt gradient. To verify the applicability of the elucidated regulatory mechanism of <italic>φ</italic> to other situations, the changes in <italic>φ</italic> in response to step increases in <italic>z</italic><sub>ON</sub> and <italic>z</italic><sub>OFF</sub> that were delayed by half of the cycle were examined as a further representative case. This ensured that the regulatory mechanism was operating as intended (see Fig. S3). These observations demonstrate that the change in <italic>φ</italic> relative to its ideal oscillatory component is properly regulated based on the direction of the sensory neuron sweeps at the time of receiving ON and OFF signals via the sensory neurons. The regulatory mechanism of <italic>φ</italic> was found to be essentially identical to that reported in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Izquierdo and Lockery, 2010</xref>). It is remarkable that this regulatory mechanism derived via the optimization of the CI has been observed in the context of chemotaxis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wystrach et al., 2016</xref>) and phototaxis in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>). The principle of operation, in which the dependence of motor responses to sensory inputs on the phase of motor oscillation, therefore, may serve as a convergent solution for taxis and navigation across species.</p>

<title>Modifications in the basal glutamate release from the ASER have the potential to elicit bidirectional responses from the postsynaptic AIY</title>
<p>The neural networks generated by the evolutionary algorithm using the CI (Eq. A17) as the fitness function exhibited klinotaxis, with the model worm turning to move toward higher salt concentrations. This salt preference behavior is consistent with the chemotaxis observed in well-fed individuals cultivated at a higher salt concentration than the current environmental concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub> &gt; <italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>). Conversely, experimental observations have shown that well-fed individuals that are cultivated at a lower salt concentration than the current environment (<italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub> &lt; <italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>) exhibit the opposite salt preference behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>). However, the neural circuit mechanism underlying the reversal of preference behavior in klinotaxis remains unclear.</p>
<p>The reversal of chemotaxis, which depends on the cultivated environmental salt concentration, has been investigated in detail with respect to klinokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sato et al., 2021</xref>). The interneuron postsynaptic to the ASER, AIB, which is involved in the behavior of klinokinesis, exhibits the bidirectional responses to changes in salt concentration in the current environment, depending on the cultivated salt concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sato et al., 2021</xref>). The bidirectional responses of the AIB are found to be attributed to a change in the basal level of glutamate neurotransmitter released from the ASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sato et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, the differential sensitivities of the excitatory glutamate receptor GLR-1 and the inhibitory glutamate receptor AVR-14, which are expressed on the AIB, result in the bidirectional response of the postsynaptic AIB depending on the changes in the basal level of glutamate release from the ASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>). The GLR-1 is a glutamate-gated cation channel, whereas the AVR-14 is a glutamate-gated chloride anion channel. In addition, the sensitivity of GLR-1 (EC<sub>50</sub> 5 mM) is several tens of times lower than that of the AVR-14 (EC<sub>50</sub> 0.2 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>). Consequently, the synaptic transmission between the ASER and AIB is excitatory and inhibitory, respectively, when the basal level of glutamate release from the ASER is high and low. In addition, the biochemical mechanism of the change in the basal level of glutamate neurotransmitter released from the ASER was also elucidated. When the cultivated salt concentration exceeds the current environmental concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub> &gt; <italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>), the basal glutamate release from the ASER is enhanced by the phosphorylation of UNC-64/Syntaxin 1A at Ser65 through the protein kinase C (PKC-1) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, in the case of <italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub> &lt; <italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>, the basal glutamate release is decreased as a consequence of the reduced PKC-1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>). The AIB and the neurons further downstream of the AIB show the salt concentration memory-dependent bidirectional responses that correlate with the reversal of the salt preference behavior in klinokinesis (pirouettes). These observations suggest that the reversal of salt preference behavior in klinokinesis is attributed to the synaptic plasticity, which varies from the excitatory to inhibitory synaptic connections between ASER and AIB.</p>
<p>Given those experimental findings, we propose a potential mechanism that may underlie the salt concentration memory-dependent reversal of preferential behavior in klinotaxis. At least two glutamate receptors, the inhibitory glutamate-gated chloride anion channel GLC-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ohnishi et al., 2011</xref>) and the excitatory metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kang and Avery, 2009</xref>), have been demonstrated to be expressed in the AIY, the postsynaptic interneuron to the ASER. The EC<sub>50</sub> for GLC-3 has been reported to be 1.9 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Horoszok et al., 2001</xref>), while the EC<sub>50</sub> for MGL-1 is not available in the literature. On the other hand, the EC<sub>50</sub> for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue of MGL-1, MGL-2, has been reported to be 9 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tharmalingam et al., 2012</xref>). The sensitivity of MGL-2 is ~200 times higher than that of GLC-3, suggesting that the sensitivity of MGL-1 may also be sufficiently higher than that of GLC-3. In the case of <italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub> &gt; <italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>, if the basal level of glutamate release from the ASER is nearly comparable to the level of EC<sub>50</sub> for the GLC-3, the activity of MGL-1 is saturated so that the MGL-1 does not contribute to a change in the membrane potential of the AIY upon the depolarization of the ASER (for more details regarding the release of internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum, see e.g. the reference on a metabotropic acetylcholine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sumi and Harada, 2023</xref>)). Thus, an inhibitory synaptic transmission between the ASER and the AIY results from the influx of Cl<sup>−</sup> into the cytosol of the AIY via the GLC-3 upon depolarization of the ASER due to a decrease in salt concentration. Conversely, in the case of <italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub> &lt; <italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>, when the basal level of glutamate release from the ASER is sufficiently lower than the level of EC<sub>50</sub> for the GLC-3 but still nearly comparable to the level of EC<sub>50</sub> for the MGL-1, the synaptic transmissions between the ASER and the AIY become excitatory as a result of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum, which is mediated by the activation of MGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ashida et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Shidara et al., 2013</xref>). A similar increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the AIY was also observed in a previous study on a thermotaxis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ohnishi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ohta and Kuhara, 2013</xref>), although the precise mechanism remains unclear. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that the biochemical mechanism proposed here does not contradict the ASER-AIY inhibitory connections, as identified in the most optimized network with the constraints.</p>

<title>Synaptic plasticity between ASER and AIY results in the reversal of salt preference behavior in klinotaxis</title>
<p>In light of the above argument, we investigated the impact of the salt concentration memory-dependent synaptic plasticity between ASER and AIY on the salt preference behavior in klinotaxis. To this end, we used the most optimized network with the constraints, in which we varied the synaptic connections between ASER and AIY from inhibitory to excitatory (see the caption of Fig. S4). <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref> illustrates the curving rates obtained from the most optimized network with the inhibitory (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>) and excitatory (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) connections as a function of the normal gradient of salt concentration. For comparison, the curving rate obtained from the ninth intermediate connection (see #9 in Fig. S4), which is derived by introducing an increment of 1.5 in the synaptic weight <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ji</italic></sub> between ASER and AIY at each step, is also presented in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> (also shown as #9 in Fig. S5). Note that the most optimized model with the inhibitory connections (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, also shown as #0 in Fig. S4) is considered as an individual that is well fed and cultivated at a higher salt concentration than the current environment. The curving rate was varied from an increasing trend function with increasing the normal concentration gradient to a function with a decreasing trend (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, see also Fig. S5) when the weight of the ASER-AIY synaptic connection <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>ji</italic></sub> was increased from a negative (inhibitory) to a positive (excitatory) value. These findings are consistent with the experimental observation shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5d</xref>, indicating that the most optimized network with the constraints, of which only the inhibitory connections between ASER and AIY were replaced by excitatory connections (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), can reproduce the salt preference behavior of a well-fed individual cultivated at a lower salt concentration than the current environment.</p>

<p>A similar analysis to that displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> is presented in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, with the exception that the inhibitory connections between ASER and AIY have been replaced by the excitatory connections as illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>. Note that the changes in <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>φ</italic> in response to step changes in <italic>z</italic><sub>ON</sub> (depicted in blue) observed in the neurons further downstream of the ASEL are fully identical to those illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, as the synaptic connections between ASEL and AIY remain unaltered. The direction of changes in <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>φ</italic> in response to step changes in <italic>z</italic><sub>OFF</sub>, as indicated in red, accords with that of <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>φ</italic> in response to step changes in <italic>z</italic><sub>ON</sub>, as shown in blue (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). This observation indicates that even when either <italic>z</italic><sub>OFF</sub> or <italic>z</italic><sub>ON</sub> increases during a head sweep, the <italic>φ</italic> is varied from its ideal oscillatory component to zero. This causes the model worm diverging from the ideal sinusoidal trajectory and gradually turning in the direction of the head sweep that occurred during the ON or OFF signal. More specifically, the model worm gradually turns in the direction of either the lower or higher side of the salt concentration upon receiving the OFF or ON signal, respectively (see both the first and second panels from the bottom in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5e</xref> and S6). Nevertheless, as evidenced by the curving rate in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, the model worm clearly shows a preference for lower salt concentrations in klinotaxis. Therefore, the behavior of turning to lower salt concentrations upon increasing <italic>z</italic><sub>OFF</sub> should play a more decisive role in the reversal of the salt preference behavior than the behavior of turning towards higher salt concentrations upon increasing <italic>z</italic><sub>ON</sub>. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig. S8b, the majority of trajectories yielded by the neural circuit shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref> demonstrated that the worm model turned to move in the opposite direction of the peak of the salt concentration gradient (see also Video 2). However, a subset exhibited a slight curve toward the gradient peak, which then proceeded straight and passed without any discernible response (Fig. S8b and Video 2). These behaviors can be interpreted in terms of the changes in the turning angle <italic>φ</italic> in response to step increases in <italic>z</italic><sub>ON</sub> and <italic>z</italic><sub>OFF</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5e</xref> and S6). In the case of step increases in <italic>z</italic><sub>OFF</sub> as illustrated in the second right panel from the bottom in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3d</xref>, the turning angle <italic>φ</italic> is increased from its ideal oscillatory component to a value close to zero, causing the model worm to deviate from the ideal sinusoidal trajectory and gradually turn toward lower salt concentrations. On the other hand, in the case of step increases in <italic>z</italic><sub>ON</sub> as illustrated in the second left panel from the bottom in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3d</xref>, the turning angle <italic>φ</italic> is again increased from its ideal oscillatory component to a value close to zero, causing the model worm to deviate from the ideal sinusoidal trajectory and gradually turn toward higher salt concentrations. The behaviors that are consistent with these analyses are observed in the trajectory illustrated in Fig. S8b. In summary, the reversal of salt preference behavior in klinotaxis of a well-fed individual cultivated at a lower salt concentration than the current concentrations can be primarily attributed to the change in synaptic connections between ASER and AIY from inhibitory to excitatory connections.</p>

<p>For <italic>C. elegans</italic>, finding food and dwelling at the food source are essential survival strategies. In the absence of food, the release of dopamine from PDE neurons is suppressed, the AVK interneurons, which make inhibitory connections with the PDE, in turn results in the release of FLP-1 neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Oranth et al., 2018</xref>). As a result, the FLP-1 neuropeptides inhibit SMB motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Oranth et al., 2018</xref>), which, in conjunction with the reversal of starvation-induced klinokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>), may result in the dispersal behavior observed in starved individuals. The dispersal behavior of starved individuals, which is necessary for searching distant food, has been reported to manifest as alterations in salt preference behavior in klinotaxis as well as klinokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, the salt concentration memory-dependent preference behavior observed in well-fed individuals (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>) is markedly suppressed in starved individuals, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>). This implies that in order to efficiently reach distant food sources, the worm suppresses turning and tends to move in a straight line. Given the above neurophysiological findings, we investigated the impact of inhibiting SMB activity on the salt preference behavior in klinotaxis. To this end, we employed the neural circuits in which the ASER-AIY transmission was inhibitory, excitatory, and intermediate between the two, i.e., the three circuits that yielded the results shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref> shows that the inhibition of the SMB activity by reducing the strength of synaptic connections between AIZ and SMB resulted in the suppression of salt preference behavior, which is consistent with the experimental observations presented in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>. Moreover, the inhibition of SMB function through the reduction of bias terms in the SMB motor neurons resulted in the suppression of the salt preference behavior (see Fig. S9b), which is a comparable result to that shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref> and is also consistent with the experimental data presented in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> or S9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, the neuroanatomical minimal network model was revisited to optimize the electrophysiological parameters using the evolutionary algorithm, where it is important to note that the AIY-AIZ connections were constrained to be inhibitory, as elucidated by experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The most optimized network, constrained by the abovementioned conditions, successfully reproduced the synchronization of the ASER and AIZ activation patterns observed experimentally in well-fed individuals cultivated at a higher salt concentration than the current environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Matsumoto et al., 2024</xref>). The inhibitory synaptic connections between ASER and AIY were found to be essential for the synchronization of ASER and AIZ activation patterns, as demonstrated in the most optimized network. The mechanism of the ASER-AIY inhibitory connections can be interpreted based on the expression of two glutamate receptors on the AIY, the postsynaptic interneuron of the ASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ohnishi et al., 2011</xref>): the inhibitory glutamate-gated chloride anion channel GLC-3 and the excitatory metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kang and Avery, 2009</xref>). Based on the EC<sub>50</sub> values for GLC-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Horoszok et al., 2001</xref>) and MGL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tharmalingam et al., 2012</xref>), the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue of MGL-1, the sensitivity of MGL-1 to glutamate is expected to be sufficiently higher than that of GLC-3. Given these facts, it can be proposed that if the basal level of glutamate release from the ASER is close to the EC<sub>50</sub> for GLC-3, the influx of Cl<sup>−</sup> into the cytosol of the AIY via the activation of the GLC-3 upon glutamate release from the ASER due to a decrease in the salt concentration will result in the inhibitory synaptic transmission between the ASER and the AIY. It is remarkable that the inhibitory connections derived from these biochemical arguments are consistent with the abovementioned neurophysiological conclusion, which has been demonstrated by the most optimized network with the constraints. The argument presented here is also supported by evidence that a similar inhibitory synaptic transmission to the AIY due to the influx of Cl<sup>−</sup> via the GLC-3, which is activated by glutamate signals from the AFD sensory neurons, has been demonstrated in the context of thermotaxis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ohnishi et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the previous studies on the salt concentration memory-dependent bidirectional regulation of klinokinesis (i.e., pirouettes), it was demonstrated that the basal level of glutamate release from the ASER either increased or decreased when well-fed individuals were cultivated at either a higher or lower salt concentration than the current environment, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sato et al., 2021</xref>). In light of the experimental findings on klinokinesis and the differential sensitivities of the inhibitory GLC-3 and excitatory MGL-1 that are expressed on the postsynaptic AIY interneurons of the ASER involved in klinotaxis, we proposed a hypothesized mechanism of the salt concentration memory-dependent bidirectional regulation of the preferential behaviors observed in klinotaxis. Specifically, when the well-fed individuals are cultivated at a lower salt concentration than the current environment, and the basal glutamate release from the ASER becomes sufficiently lower than the EC50 for GLC-3 but still nearly comparable to the EC50 for MGL-1, the ASER-AIY inhibitory connections are thought to be altered to become excitatory. This is due to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol, which is mediated by the activation of MGL-1. The most optimized network, in which the ASER-AIY inhibitory connections were replaced with excitatory ones, successfully reproduced the reversal of salt preference behavior in klinotaxis that had been previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>) (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5c</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). These findings indicate that the salt concentration memory is encoded as a basal level of glutamate release from the ASER. This memory is then decoded by the difference in the sensitivity of the glutamate-gated inhibitory channel GLC-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ohnishi et al., 2011</xref>) and the excitatory metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kang and Avery, 2009</xref>), which are expressed on the AIY. The sensory input from the ASER regarding a reduction in salt concentration is transmitted to the AIY as either an inhibitory or an excitatory signal, depending on the decoded memory. The signaling from the ASER to the AIY is therefore regulated by synaptic plasticity arising from alterations in the basal glutamate release from the ASER. This regulatory process enables the reproduction of salt concentration memory-dependent reversal of preference behavior in klinotaxis, despite the remaining neurons further downstream of the ASER not undergoing alterations and simply functioning as a modular circuit to transmit the received signals to the motor systems. Consequently, the sensorimotor circuit allows a simple and efficient bidirectional regulation of salt preference behavior in klinotaxis.</p>
<p>For individuals experiencing starvation, the expansion of dispersal behaviors is a crucial survival strategy to acquire and dwell distant food sources. Indeed, such behavioral changes have also been observed in the context of salt preference behaviors in klinotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore necessary to ascertain how the worm’s neural network regulates the behavioral strategies in the presence or absence of food. In the absence of food, the PDE neurons do not release dopamine, which causes AVK interneurons that form inhibitory connections with the PDE to release FLP-1 neuropeptides that inhibit SMB motor neurons. This has been postulated to contribute to the dispersal behavior observed in starved individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Oranth et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the impact of inhibiting SMB activity on salt preference behavior in klinotaxis was investigated. The most optimized network, in which the strength of the synaptic connections between AIZ and SMB was reduced to suppress SMB activity, while the remainder remained unchanged, showed the suppression of salt preference behavior in klinotaxis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>), as observed in the experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). These findings indicate that the worms are capable of efficiently switching between dwelling and dispersing behaviors by activating or inhibiting only the most downstream motor neurons in the sensorimotor circuit of klinotaxis depending on the presence or absence of food.</p>
<p>The principle of operation, in which the dependence of motor responses to sensory inputs on the phase of motor oscillation, appears to be a convergent solution for taxis and navigation across species. In fact, analogous mechanisms have been postulated in the context of chemotaxis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wystrach et al., 2016</xref>) and phototaxis in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, the synaptic reversal mechanism highlighted in this study offers the framework for understanding how the behaviors that are adaptive to the environment are embedded within sensorimotor systems and how experience shapes these neural circuits across species.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>The modeling of ASE sensory neurons does not include either the all-or-none depolarization characteristic of the ASEL or the hyperpolarization characteristic of the ASER in response to step increases in salt concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>). As a result, a comprehensive understanding of the specific roles played by each the ASEL and ASER could not be achieved. In the present study, the oscillator components of the SMB are not intrinsically generated by an oscillator circuit but are instead externally imposed via <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="621960v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Furthermore, the complex and context-dependent responses of ASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Luo et al., 2014</xref>) were not taken into consideration. It should be acknowledged as a limitation of this study that these omitted factors may interact with circuit dynamics in ways that are not captured by the current simplified implementation. The available data on synaptic transmission between the AIZ and the SMB, as well as the available information on the activation pattern of the SMB in response to changes in salt concentration, were insufficient to perform the evolutionary search of parameters involving the SMB with the application of appropriate constraints. Consequently, a comprehensive investigation of the role of the SMB in the regulation of the turning direction was hindered by these limitations.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>In the present study, a neuroanatomical minimal network model developed by Izquierdo and Beer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>) was employed as the basis for the modeling. The neuroanatomical minimal circuit was derived from the connectome by applying two constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>). The first constraint is to minimize the path length between ASE and SMB cells, resulting in a minimum number of three. Since two neurons can be connected by one or more chemical synapses or electrical connections, the total number of neuronal connections was defined as the number of contacts. The second step is to eliminate the interneurons that are connected by neuronal connections other than those with the maximum number of contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Oshio, 2003</xref>). It is noteworthy that the two interneurons, AIY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kocabas et al., 2012</xref>) and AIZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</xref>), which have been experimentally shown to be involved in klinotaxis, are included in the resulting minimal network. The primary difference between our model and the neuroanatomical minimal network model is that our modeling constrains the synaptic transmissions between AIY and AIZ to be inhibitory, as experimentally demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2014</xref>).

<title>Modeling of Salt Concentration</title>
<p>The salt concentrations observed during a typical salt chemotaxis assay have a Gaussian distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ward, 1973</xref>). However, in the context of evolutionary algorithms, however, Gaussian gradients are problematic because the local steepness depends on the distance from the gradient peak. To circumvent this problem, conical gradients with randomly varying steepness were implemented in each simulation throughout the evolutionary process. Salt concentrations are proportional to the Euclidean distance from the gradient peak (<italic>x</italic><sub>peak</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>peak</sub>),

<list-item><p>An initial population of 60 individuals was randomly generated in which the parameters of the model were encoded in a 22-element vector of real values between [−1, 1], and these parameters were linearly mapped to their corresponding ranges.</p></list-item>

<title>Evaluation of Fitness</title>
<p>The fitness of the individuals generated during the evolutionary algorithm was evaluated by performing the simulations with the chemotaxis assays. At the beginning of each simulation, the model worm was placed at the origin (<italic>x, y</italic>) = (0.0, 0.0) with an initial orientation randomized over the range [0.0, 2<italic>π</italic>] and motor neuron activations were randomized over the range [0, 1]. The gradient steepness <italic>α</italic> in Eq. A15 was randomized over the range [−0.38, −0.01] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>). Fitness was quantified as the chemotaxis index (CI), defined as the time average of the distance to the peak of the gradient at S<italic>x</italic><sub>peak</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>peak</sub>U = (4.5, 0.0),

<italic>h</italic>(0) is the initial distance of the worm from the salt peak, namely, 4.5 cm, and <italic>T</italic><sub>sim</sub> is the total simulated assay time. <italic>T</italic><sub>sim</sub> was set to 500 s in the evolutionary algorithm and 1000 s in the evaluation of the CI value for the individuals obtained. For simplicity, negative CI values were set to zero. The fitness of an individual generated during the evolutionary algorithm was determined as the averaged CI values over 50 trials, in which the gradient steepness <italic>α</italic> of the salt concentration in Eq. A15 was randomly chosen in the range of [−0.38, −0.01] and the orientation of the worm at the starting point (0.0, 0.0) was randomized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Izquierdo and Beer, 2013</xref>). To ensure the survival of individuals moving in an undulating manner, the CI value was reduced when sinusoidal movements were not present. Specifically, the sign of the turning angle <italic>φ</italic> was checked at 1/4 and 3/4 cycles within each period, and if they had the same sign, the CI value was reduced by 0.008 each time as a penalty.</p>

<title>Analysis of the Salt Preference Behavior in Klinotaxis</title>
<p>In the calculation of the quantities that were used to characterize the klinotaxis behavior, i.e., curving rate, bearing, and salt concentration gradients, the coordinates of the trajectory for the first three cycles of the worm’s sinusoidal locomotion were not used because the time derivative of the NaCl concentration history in Eq. A1 could not be precisely determined around the starting point, thus affecting the locomotion. The ensemble average of these quantities was determined by performing 100,000 sets of the simulation with a simulation time of <italic>T</italic><sub>sim</sub> = 200 sec. The Gaussian distribution of the salt concentration given by Eq. A16 was used in the analysis of the salt preference behavior in klinotaxis.</p>

<p>With a computational analysis of a neuroanatomical network model in C. elegans, this <bold>valuable</bold> work investigates the synaptic mechanism for memory-dependent klinotaxis, i.e., salt concentration chemotaxis. By incorporating experimental data altering the ASER neuron's basal glutamate release into their model, the authors demonstrate the possibility of a transition between excitatory and inhibitory signaling at the ASER-AIY synapse, depending on environmental and cultivated salt concentrations. These <bold>solid</bold> findings offer a proposal for how synaptic plasticity plays a role in sensorimotor navigation, and will be of interest to worm biologists and theoretical neuroscientists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study explores how a simple sensorimotor circuit in the nematode C. elegans enables it to navigate salt gradients based on past experiences. Using computational simulations and previously described neural connections, the study demonstrates how a single neuron, ASER, can change its signaling behavior in response to different salt conditions, with which the worm is able to &quot;remember&quot; prior environments and adjust its navigation toward &quot;preferred&quot; salinity accordingly.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The key novelty and strength of this paper is the explicit demonstration of computational neurobehavioral modeling and evolutionary algorithms to elucidate the synaptic plasticity in a minimal neural circuit that is sufficient to replicate memory-based chemotaxis. In particular, with changes in ASER's glutamate release and sensitivity of downstream neurons, the ASER neuron adjusts its output to be either excitatory or inhibitory depending on ambient salt concentration, enabling the worm to navigate toward or away from salt gradients based on prior exposure to salt concentration.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the model successfully replicates some behaviors observed in previous experiments, some key assumptions of the work still need to be verified by biological validation of further experiments.</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>The authors utilize a valuable computational approach to exploring the mechanisms of memorydependent klinotaxis, with a hypothesis that is both plausible and testable. Although they provide a solid hypothesis of circuit function based on an established model, the model's lack of integration of newer experimental findings, its reliance on predefined synaptic states, and oversimplified sensory dynamics, make the investigation incomplete for both memory and internal-state modulation of taxis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to the editor for the assessment of our work. However, we respectfully disagree with the assessment that our investigation is incomplete, if the negative assessment is primarily due to the impact of AIY interneuron ablation on the chemotaxis index (CI) which was reported in Reference [1]. It is crucial to acknowledge that the CI determined through experimental means incorporates contributions from both klinokinesis and klinotaxis [1]. It is plausible that the impact of AIY ablation was not adequately reflected in the CI value. Consequently, the experimental observation does not necessarily diminish the role of AIY in klinotaxis. Anatomical evidence provided by the database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ims.dse.ibaraki.ac.jp/ccep-tool/">http://ims.dse.ibaraki.ac.jp/ccep-tool/</ext-link>) substantiates that ASE sensory neurons and AIZ interneurons, which have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in klinotaxis [Matsumoto et al., PNAS 121 (5) e2310735121], have the much higher number of synaptic connections with AIY interneurons. These findings provide substantial evidence supporting the validity of the presented minimal neural network responsible for salt klinotaxis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This research focuses on C. elegans klinotaxis, a chemotactic behavior characterized by gradual turning, aiming to uncover the neural circuit mechanism responsible for the context-dependent reversal of salt concentration preference. The phenomenon observed is that the preferred salt concentration depends on the difference between the pre-assay cultivation conditions and the current environmental salt levels.</p>

<p>We would like to express our gratitude for the time and consideration you have dedicated to reviewing our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors propose that a synaptic-reversal plasticity mechanism at the primary sensory neuron, ASER, is critical for this memory- and context-dependent switching of preference. They build on prior findings regarding synaptic reversal between ASER and AIB, as well as the receptor composition of AIY neurons, to hypothesize that similar &quot;plasticity&quot; between ASER and AIY underpins salt preference behavior in klinotaxis. This plasticity differs conceptually from the classical one as it does not rely on any structural changes but rather synaptic transmission is modulated by the basal level of glutamate, and can switch from inhibitory to excitatory.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, the study employs a previously established neuroanatomically grounded model [4] and demonstrates that reversing the ASER-AIY synapse sign in the model agent reproduces the observed reversal in salt preference. The model is parameterized using a computational search technique (evolutionary algorithm) to optimize unknown electrophysiological parameters for chemotaxis performance. Experimental validity is ensured by incorporating constraints derived from published findings, confirming the plausibility of the proposed mechanism.</p>
<p>Finally. the circuit mechanism allowing C. elegans to switch behaviour to an exploration run when starved is also investigated. This extension highlights how internal states, such as hunger, can dynamically reshape sensory-motor programs to drive context-appropriate behaviors.</p>

<p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors' approach of integrating prior knowledge of receptor composition and synaptic reversal with the repurposing of a published neuroanatomical model [4] is a significant strength. This methodology not only ensures biological plausibility but also leverages a solid, reproducible modeling foundation to explore and test novel hypotheses effectively.</p>
<p>The evidence produced that the original model has been successfully reproduced is convincing.</p>
<p>The writing of the manuscript needs revision as it makes comprehension difficult.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for recognizing the usefulness of our approach. In the revised version, we improved the explanation according to your suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>One major weakness is that the model does not incorporate key findings that have emerged since the original model's publication in 2013, limiting the support for the proposed mechanism. In particular, ablation studies indicate that AIY is not critical for chemotaxis, and other interneurons may play partially overlapping roles in positive versus negative chemotaxis. These findings challenge the centrality of AIY and suggest the model oversimplifies the circuit involved in klinotaxis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude for the constructive feedback we have received. We concur with some of your assertions. In fact, our model is the minimal network for salt klinotaxis, which includes solely the interneurons that are connected to each other via the highest number of synaptic connections. It is important to note that our model does not consider redundant interneurons that exhibit overlapping roles. Consequently, the model is not applicable to the study of the impact of interneuron ablation. In the reference [1], the influence of interneuron ablations on the chemotaxis index (CI) has been investigated. The experimentally determined CI value incorporates the contributions from both klinokinesis and klinotaxis. Consequently, it is plausible that the impact of AIY ablation was not significantly reflected in the CI value. The experimental observation does not necessarily diminish the role of AIY in klinotaxis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reference [1] also shows that ASER neurons exhibit complex, memory- and context-dependent responses, which are not accounted for in the model and may have a significant impact on chemotactic model behaviour.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer has noted, our model does not incorporate the context-dependent response of the ASER. Instead, the impact of the salt concentration-dependent glutamate release from the ASER [S. Hiroki et al. Nat Commun 13, 2928 (2022)] as the result of the ASER responses was in detail examined in the present study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The hypothesis of synaptic reversal between ASER and AIY is not explicitly modeled in terms of receptor-specific dynamics or glutamate basal levels. Instead, the ASER-to-AIY connection is predefined as inhibitory or excitatory in separate models. This approach limits the model's ability to test the full range of mechanisms hypothesized to drive behavioral switching.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewer for their constructive feedback. As you correctly noted, the hypothesized synaptic reversal between ASER and AIY is not explicitly modeled in terms of the sensitivity of the receptors in the AIY and the glutamate basal levels by the ASER. On the other hand, in the present study, under considering a substantial difference in the sensitivity of the two glutamate receptors on the AIY, we sought to endeavored to elucidate the impact of salt-concentration-dependent glutamate basal levels on klinotaxis. To this end, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the full range gradual change in the ASER-to-AIY connection from inhibitory to excitatory, as illustrated in Figures S4 and S5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the main results - such as response dependence on step inputs at different phases of the oscillator - are consistent with those observed in chemotaxis models with explicit neural dynamics (e.g., Reference [2]), the lack of richer neural dynamics could overlook critical effects. For example, the authors highlight the influence of gap junctions on turning sensitivity but do not sufficiently analyze the underlying mechanisms driving these effects. The role of gap junctions in the model may be oversimplified because, as in the original model [4], the oscillator dynamics are not intrinsically generated by an oscillator circuit but are instead externally imposed via $z_¥text{osc}$. This simplification should be carefully considered when interpreting the contributions of specific connections to network dynamics. Lastly, the complex and contextdependent responses of ASER [1] might interact with circuit dynamics in ways that are not captured by the current simplified implementation. These simplifications could limit the model's ability to account for the interplay between sensory encoding and motor responses in C. elegans chemotaxis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We might not understand the substance of your assertions. However, we understand that the oscillator dynamics were not intrinsically generated by the oscillator neural circuit that is explicitly incorporated into our modeling. On the other hand, the present study focuses on how the sensory input and resulting interneuron dynamics regulate the oscillatory behavior of SMB motor neurons to generate klinotaxis. The neuron dynamics via gap junctions results from the equilibration of the membrane potential <italic>yi</italic> of two neurons connected by gap junctions rather than the <italic>zi</italic>. We added this explanation in the revised manuscript as follows.</p>
<p>“The hyperpolarization signals in the AIZL are transmitted to the AIZR via the gap junction (Figs. S1d and S1f and Fig. 3d). This is because the neuron dynamics via gap junctions results from the equilibration of the membrane potential <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic> of two neurons connected by gap junctions rather than the <italic>z<sub>i</sub></italic>.”</p>
<p>In the limitation, we added the following sentence:</p>
<p>“In the present study, the oscillator components of the SMB are not intrinsically generated by an oscillator circuit but are instead externally imposed via <italic>𝑧<sub>i</sub></italic><sup>OSC</sup>. Furthermore, the complex and context-dependent responses of ASER {Luo:2014et} were not taken into consideration. It should be acknowledged as a limitation of this study that these omitted factors may interact with circuit dynamics in ways that are not captured by the current simplified implementation.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Appraisal:</p>
<p>The authors show that their model can reproduce memory-dependent reversal of preference in klinotaxis, demonstrating that the ASER-to-AIY synapse plays a key role in switching chemotactic preferences. By switching the ASER-AIY connection from excitatory to inhibitory they indeed show that salt preference reverses. They also show that the curving/turn rate underlying the preference change is gradual and depends on the weight between ASER-AIY. They further support their claim by showing that curving rates also depend on cultivated (set-point).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for assessing our work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Thus within the constraints of the hypothesis and the framework, the model operates as expected and aligns with some experimental findings. However, significant omissions of key experimental evidence raise questions on whether the proposed neural mechanisms are sufficient for reversal in salt-preference chemotaxis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with your opinion. The present hypothesis should be verified by experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Previous work [1] has shown that individually ablating the AIZ or AIY interneurons has essentially no effect on the Chemotactic Index (CI) toward the set point ([1] Figure 6). Furthermore, in [1] the authors report that different postsynaptic neurons are required for movement above or below the set point. The manuscript should address how this evidence fits with their model by attempting similar ablations. It is possible that the CI is rescued by klinokinesis but this needs to be tested on an extension of this model to provide a more compelling argument.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude for the constructive feedback we have received. In the reference [1], the influence of interneuron ablations on the chemotaxis index (CI) has been investigated. It is important to acknowledge that the experimentally determined CI value encompasses the contributions of both klinokinesis and klinotaxis. It is plausible that the impact of AIY ablation was not reflected in the CI value. Consequently, these experimental observations do not necessarily diminish the role of AIY in klinotaxis. The neural circuit model employed in the present study constitutes a minimal network for salt klinotaxis, encompassing solely interneurons that are connected to each other via the highest number of synaptic connections. Anatomical evidence provided by the database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ims.dse.ibaraki.ac.jp/cceptool/">http://ims.dse.ibaraki.ac.jp/cceptool/</ext-link>) substantiates that ASE sensory neurons and AIZ interneurons, which have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in klinotaxis [Matsumoto et al., PNAS 121 (5) e2310735121], have the much higher number of synaptic connections with AIY interneurons. Our model does not take into account redundant interneurons with overlapping roles, thus rendering it not applicable to the study of the effects of interneuron ablation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The investigation of dispersal behaviour in starved individuals is rather limited to testing by imposing inhibition of the SMB neurons. Although a circuit is proposed for how hunger states modulate taxis in the absence of food, this circuit hypothesis is not explicitly modelled to test the theory or provide novel insights.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer noted, the experimentally identified neural circuit that inhibits the SMB motor neurons in starved individuals is not incorporated in our model. Instead of incorporating this circuit explicitly, we examined whether our minimal network model could reproduce dispersal behavior under starvation conditions solely due to the experimentally demonstrated inhibitory effect of SMB motor neurons.</p>

<p>Impact:</p>
<p>This research underscores the value of an embodied approach to understanding chemotaxis, addressing an important memory mechanism that enables adaptive behavior in the sensorimotor circuits supporting C. elegans chemotaxis. The principle of operation - the dependence of motor responses to sensory inputs on the phase of oscillation - appears to be a convergent solution to taxis. Similar mechanisms have been proposed in Drosophila larvae chemotaxis [2], zebrafish phototaxis [3], and other systems. Consequently, the proposed mechanism has broader implications for understanding how adaptive behaviors are embedded within sensorimotor systems and how experience shapes these circuits across species.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude for useful suggestion. We added this argument in Discussion of the revised manuscript as follows.</p>
<p>“The principle of operation, in which the dependence of motor responses to sensory inputs on the phase of motor oscillation, appears to be a convergent solution for taxis and navigation across species. In fact, analogous mechanisms have been postulated in the context of chemotaxis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae chemotaxis {Wystrach:2016bt} and phototaxis in zebrafish {Wolf:2017ei}. Consequently, the synaptic reversal mechanism highlighted in this study offers the framework for understanding how the behaviors that are adaptive to the environment are embedded within sensorimotor systems and how experience shapes these neural circuits across species.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although the reported reversal of synaptic connection from excitatory to inhibitory is an exciting phenomenon of broad interest, it is not entirely new, as the authors acknowledge similar reversals have been reported in ASER-to-AIB signaling for klinokinesis ( Hiroki et al., 2022). The proposed reversal of the ASER-to-AIY synaptic connection from inhibitory to excitatory is a novel contribution in the specific context of klinotaxis. While the ASER's role in gradient sensing and memory encoding has been previously identified, the current paper mechanistically models these processes, introducing a hypothesis for synaptic plasticity as the basis for bidirectional salt preference in klinotaxis.</p>
<p>The research also highlights how internal states, such as hunger, can dynamically reshape sensory-motor programs to drive context-appropriate behaviors.</p>
<p>The methodology of parameter search on a neural model of a connectome used here yielded the valuable insight that connectome information alone does not provide enough constraints to reproduce the neural circuits for behaviour. It demonstrates that additional neurophysiological constraints are required.</p>

<p>We would like to acknowledge the appropriate recognition of our work.</p>

<p>Additional Context</p>
<p>Oscillators with stimulus-driven perturbations appear to be a convergent solution for taxis and navigation across species. Similar mechanisms have been studied in zebrafish phototaxis [3], Drosophila larvae chemotaxis [2], and have even been proposed to underlie search runs in ants. The modulation of taxis by context and memory is a ubiquitous requirement, with parallels across species. For example, Drosophila larvae modulate taxis based on current food availability and predicted rewards associated with odors, though the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The synaptic reversal mechanism highlighted in this study offers a compelling framework for understanding how taxis circuits integrate context-related memory retrieval more broadly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude for the insightful commentary. In the revised manuscript, we incorporated the argument that the similar oscillator mechanism with stimulus-driven perturbations has been observed for zebrafish phototaxis [3] and Drosophila larvae chemotaxis [2] into Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As a side note, an interesting difference emerges when comparing C. elegans and Drosophila larvae chemotaxis. In Drosophila larvae, oscillatory mechanisms are hypothesized to underlie all chemotactic reorientations, ranging from large turns to smaller directional biases (weathervaning). By contrast, in C. elegans, weathervaning and pirouettes are treated as distinct strategies, often attributed to separate neural mechanisms. This raises the possibility that their motor execution could share a common oscillator-based framework. Re-examining their overlap might reveal deeper insights into the neural principles underlying these maneuvers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to acknowledge your thoughtfully articulated comment. As the reviewer pointed out, the anatomical database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ims.dse.ibaraki.ac.jp/ccep-tool/">http://ims.dse.ibaraki.ac.jp/ccep-tool/</ext-link>) shows that that the neural circuits underlying weathervaning and pirouettes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are predominantly distinct but exhibit partial overlap. When we restrict our search to the neurons that are connected to each other with the highest number of synaptic connections, we identify the projections from the neural circuit of weathervaning to the circuit of pirouettes; however we observed no reversal projections. This finding suggests that the neural circuit of weathervaning, namely, our minimal neural network, is not likely to be affected by that of pirouettes, which consists of AIB interneurons and interneurons and motor neurons the downstream.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the model successfully replicates some behaviors observed in previous experiments, many key assumptions lack direct biological validation. As to the model output readouts, the model considers only endpoint behaviors (chemotaxis index) rather than the full dynamics of navigation, which limits its predictive power. Moreover, some results presented in the paper lack interpretation, and many descriptions in the main text are overly technical and require clearer definitions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback. As the reviewer noted, the fundamental assumptions posited in the study have yet to be substantiated by biological validation, and consequently, these assumptions must be directly assessed by biological experimentation. The model performance for salt klinotaxis has been evaluated by multiple factors, including not only a chemotaxis index but also the curving rate vs. bearing (Fig. 4a, the bearing is defined in Fig. A3) and the curving rate vs. normal gradient (Fig. 4c). These two parameters work to characterize the trajectory during salt klinotaxis. In the revised version, we meticulously revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestions. We would like to express our sincere gratitude for your insightful review of our work.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>An interesting and engaging methodology combining theoretical and computational approaches. Overall I found the manuscript up to discussion a difficult read, and I would suggest revising it. I would also recommend introducing the general operating principle of the oscillator with sensory perturbations before jumping into the implementation details of signal propagation specific to C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>elegans.</p>
<p>In order to elucidate the relation between the general operating principle of the oscillator with sensory perturbations and the results shown by the two graphs from the bottom in Fig. 3d, the following statement was added on page 12.</p>
<p>“It is remarkable that this regulatory mechanism derived via the optimization of the CI has been observed in the context of chemotaxis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae chemotaxis {Wystrach:2016bt} and phototaxis in zebrafish {Wolf:2017ei}. The principle of operation, in which the dependence of motor responses to sensory inputs on the phase of motor oscillation, therefore, may serve as a convergent solution for taxis and navigation across species.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The abstract could benefit from a clarification of terms to benefit a broader audience:  The term &quot;salt klinotaxis&quot; is used without prior introduction or definition. It would be beneficial to briefly explain this term, as it may not be familiar to all readers.</p>

<p>Due to the limitation of the word number in the abstract, the explanation of salt klinotaxis could not be included.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although ASER is introduced as a right-side head sensory neuron, AIY neurons are not similarly introduced. It may also benefit to introduce here that ASER integrates memory with current salt gradients, tuning its output to produce context-appropriate behaviour.</p>

<p>&quot;it can be anticipated that the ASER-AIY synaptic transmission will undergo a reversal due to alterations in the basal glutamate Release&quot;: Where is this expectation drawn from? Is it derived from biophysical or is it a functional expectation to explain the network's output constraints?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As delineated before this sentence, it is derived from a comprehensive consideration of the sensitivity of excitatory/inhibitory glutamate receptors expressed on the postsynaptic AIY interneurons, in conjunction with varying the basal level of glutamate transmission from ASER.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The statement that the model &quot;revealed the modular neural circuit function downstream of ASE&quot; could be more explicit. What specific insights about the downstream circuit were uncovered?</p>
<p>Highlighting one or two key findings would strengthen the impact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Due to the limitation of the word number in the abstract, no more details could be added here, while the sentence was revised as “revealed that the circuit downstream of ASE functions as a module that is responsible for salt klinotaxis.” This is because the salt-concentration dependent behaviors in klinitaxis can be reproduced through the modulation of the ASRE-AIY synaptic connections alone, despite the absence of alterations in the neural circuit downstream of AIY.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I believe the authors should cite Luo et al. 2014, which also studies how chemotactic behaviours arise from neural circuit dynamics, including the dynamic encoding of salt concentration by ASER, and the crucial downstream interaction with AIY for chemotactic actions.</p>

<p>We would like to express our gratitude for useful suggestion. We cited Luo et al. 2014 in the discussion on the limitation of our work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The introduction could also be improved for clarity. Specifically in the last paragraph authors should clarify how the observed synchrony of ASER excitation to the AIZ (Matsumoto et al., 2024), validates the resulting network.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude for useful suggestion. We added the following explanation in the last paragraph of the introduction.</p>
<p>“Specifically, the synchrony of the excitation of the ASER and AIZ {Matsumoto:2024ig} taken together with the experimentally identified inhibitory synaptic transmission between the AIY and AIZ revealed that the ASER-AIY synaptic connections should be inhibitory, which was consistent with the network obtained from the most evolved model.”</p>
<p>In addition, we added the following explanation after “It was then hypothesized that the ASER-AIY inhibitory synaptic connections are altered to become excitatory due to a decrease in the baseline release of glutamate from the ASER when individuals are cultured under <italic>C</italic><sub>cult</sub> &lt; <italic>C</italic><sub>test</sub>.”</p>
<p>This is due to the substantial difference in the sensitivity of excitatory/inhibitory glutamate receptors expressed on the postsynaptic AIY interneurons.</p>

<p>I would also strongly recommend replacing the term &quot;evolved model&quot;, with &quot;Optimized Model&quot; or &quot;Best-Performing Model&quot; to clarify this is a computational optimization process with limitations - optimization through GAs does not guarantee finding global optima.</p>

<p>(1) Overall, the language of the paper is not properly organized, making the paper's logic and purpose hard to follow. In the Results Section, many observations or findings lack explicit interpretation. To address this issue, the authors should consider (1) adopting the contextcontent-conclusion scheme, (2) optimizing the logic flow by clearly identifying the context and goals prior to discussing their results and findings, (3) more explicitly interpreting their results, especially in a biological context.</p>

<p>We would like to express our gratitude for helpful suggestion. According to your suggestion listed below, we revised the main and SI texts.</p>

<p>(2) In Figure 2, trajectories from the model with AIY-AIZ constraints show a faster convergence than those from the constraint-free model. However, in the corresponding texts in the Results section, the authors claimed no significant difference. It seems that the authors made this argument only based on CI (Chemotaxis Index). Therefore, in order to address such inconsistency, the authors need more explanation on why only relying on CI, which is an endpoint metric, instead of the whole navigation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I would like to thank you for the helpful comment. In the present study, not only the CI but also the curving rate shown in Fig. 4 were applied to characterize the behavior in klinotaxis.</p>
<p>According to your comments, we revised the related description in the main text as follows:</p>
<p>“The difference between these CI values is slight, while the model optimized with the constraints exhibits a marginally accelerated attainment of the salt concentration peak, as shown by the trajectories. The slightly higher chemotaxis performance observed in the constrained model is not essentially attributed to the introduction of the AIY-AIZ synaptic constraints but rather depends on the specific individuals selected from the optimized individuals obtained from the evolutionary algorithm. In fact, even when the AIY-AIZ constraints are taken into consideration, the model retains a significant degree of freedom to reproduce salt klinotaxis due to the presence of a substantial parameter space. Consequently, the impact of the AIY-AIZ constraints on the optimization of the CI is expected to be negligible.”</p>

<p>(3) In Figures 3a and b, some inter-neuron connections are relatively weak (e.g., AIYR to AIZR in Figure 3a) - thus it is unclear whether the polarity of such synapses would significantly influence the behavioral outcome or not. The authors could consider plotting the change of the connection strengths between neurons over the course of model optimization to get a sense of confidence in each inter-neuron connection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the evolutional algorithm, the parameters of individuals are subject to discontinuous variation due to the influence of selection, crossover, and mutations. Consequently, it is not straightforward to extract information regarding parameter optimization from parameter changes due to the non-systematic nature of parameter variation..</p>

<p>(4) In Figure 3, the order of individual figure panels is incorrect: in the main text, Figure 3 a and b were mentioned after c and d. Also, the caption of Figure 3c &quot;negative step changes I the&quot; should be &quot;in&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The main text underwent revision, with the description of Figures 3a and 3b being presented prior to that of Figures 3c and 3d. The typo was revised.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 4, the order of individual figure panels is messed up: in the main text, Figure 4 a was mentioned after b.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The main text underwent revision, with the description of Figure 4a being presented prior to that of Figure 4b.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Also in Figure 4, the authors need to provide a definition/explanation of &quot;Bearing&quot; and &quot;Translational Gradient&quot;. In Figure 4d, the definition of positive and negative components is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Normal and Translational Salt Concentration Gradient in METHOD was referenced for the definition and explanation of the bearing and the translational gradient. We added the following explanation on the positive and negative components.</p>
<p>“The positive and negative components of the curving rate are respectively sampled from the trajectory during leftward turns (as illustrated in Fig. 4b) and rightward turns, respectively.”</p>

<p>(7) Figure 5: the authors need to explain why c has an error bar and how they were calculated, as this result is from a computational model. Figure 5d is experimental results - the authors need to add error bars to the data points and provide a sample size.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As explained in Analysis of the Salt Preference Behavior in Klinotaxis in METHOD, the ensemble average of these quantities was determined by performing 100,000 sets of the simulation with randomized initial orientation for a simulation time of T_sim=200 sec. The error bars for the experimental data were added in Figs. 5c, 6a, and S9a.</p>

<p>(8) On Page 14, the authors said, &quot;To this end, this end, we used the best evolved network with the constraints, in which we varied the synaptic connections between ASER and AIY from inhibitory to excitatory.&quot; How did the model change the ASER-AIY signaling specifically? The authors should provide more explanation or at least refer to the Methods Section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The caption of Fig. S4 was referred as the explanation on the detailed method.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Page 15: &quot;a subset a subset exhibited a slight curve...&quot;. This observation from the model simulation is contradictory to experiments. However, their explanation of that is hard to understand.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I would like to thank you for the helpful comment. To improve this, we added the following explanation:</p>
<p>“In the case of step increases in 𝑧OFF as illustrated in the second right panel from the bottom in Fig.3d, the turning angle φ is increased from its ideal oscillatory component to a value close to zero, causing the model worm to deviate from the ideal sinusoidal trajectory and gradually turn toward lower salt concentrations. On the other hand, in the case of step increases in 𝑧ON as illustrated in the second left panel from the bottom in Fig.3d, the turning angle φ is again increased from its ideal oscillatory component to a value close to zero, causing the model worm to deviate from the ideal sinusoidal trajectory and gradually turn toward higher salt concentrations. The behaviors that are consistent with these analyses are observed in the trajectory illustrated in Fig. S8b.”</p>

<p>(10) Last result session: inhibited SMB in starved worms is due to a mechanism unrelated to their neural network model upstream to SMB. Therefore, their results recapitulating the worms' dispersal behaviors cannot strengthen the validity of their model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with your opinion. We think that the findings from the study of starved worms do not provide evidence to validate the neural network model upstream of SMB.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Discussion: &quot;in contrast, the remaining neurons...&quot;. This argument lacks evidence or references.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This argument is based on the results obtained from the present study. This sentence was revised as follows:</p>
<p>“This regulatory process enables the reproduction of salt concentration memory-dependent reversal of preference behavior in klinotaxis, despite the remaining neurons further downstream of the ASER not undergoing alterations and simply functioning as a modular circuit to transmit the received signals to the motor systems. Consequently, the sensorimotor circuit allows a simple and efficient bidirectional regulation of salt preference behavior in klinotaxis.”</p>

<p>(12) To increase the predictive power of their model, can the authors perform simulations on mutant worms, like those with altered glutamate basal level expression in ASER?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude for useful suggestion. The simulations, in which the weight of the ASER-AIY synaptic connection is increased from negative (inhibitory connection) to positive (excitatory connection), as illustrated in Figure S4, provide valuable insights into the relationship between varying glutamate basal levels from ASER and behavior in klinotaxis, such as the chemotaxis index.</p>
