<title>Summary</title>
<p>Phosphorylation of receptor kinase (RK) is pivotal for signaling in pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE2 (FLS2) is a conserved 22 amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region of flagellin (flg22), initiating plant defense pathways. However, the dynamic FLS2 phosphorylation regulation at the plasma membrane in response to flg22 needs further elucidation. Through single-particle tracking, we demonstrated that the Ser-938 phosphorylation site influences flg22-induced FLS2 spatiotemporal dynamics and dwell time. Förster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime (FRET-FLIM) imaging microscopy, coupled with protein proximity indexes (PPI), revealed increased co-localization of FLS2/FLS2<sup>S938D</sup>-GFP with <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-mCherry in response to flg22. In contrast, FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>-GFP shows no significant changes, indicating that Ser-938 phosphorylation influences the efficient FLS2 sorting into <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-associated microdomains. Significantly, Ser-938 phosphorylation enhanced flg22-induced internalization and immune responses, thus demonstrating its regulatory role in FLS2 partitioning into functional <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-associated microdomains for activating flg22-induced plant immunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Receptor kinase (RK) are structurally conserved proteins, featuring an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. The cytoplasmic kinase domain consists of a protein kinase catalytic domain (PKC) and a juxtamembrane region, containing crucial phosphorylation sites on specific Ser and/or Thr residues essential for pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), the initial defense layer in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mitra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gada et al., 2022</xref>). PTI efficiently inhibits pathogen infection by activating defense responses, exemplified by the FLS2 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yu et al., 2023</xref>). Upon recognizing flg22, FLS2 interacts with the co-receptor Brassinosteroid-Insensitive 1-associated Kinase 1 (BAK1), initiating phosphorylation events through the activation of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) such as BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) to elicit downstream immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chinchilla et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Majhi et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Protein phosphorylation, a vital posttranslational modification, plays a well-established and significant role. Research suggests that alterations in protein phosphorylation affect protein dynamics and subcellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Palladino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kontaxi et al., 2023</xref>). In plants, phosphorylation of proteins can coalesce into membrane microdomains, forming platforms for active protein function at the plasma membrane (PM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bücherl et al., 2017</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Xue et al. (2018)</xref> demonstrated that phosphorylation of the blue light receptor phot1 accelerates PM movement, enhancing interaction with <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-mCherry, a sterol-rich lipid marker. This underscores protein phosphorylation’s crucial role in PM dynamics and membrane partitioning. Upon flg22 treatment, multiple FLS2 phosphorylation sites activate, with FLS2 Serine-938 phosphorylation playing a pivotal role in defense activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). While FLS2 Ser-938 is crucial for plant PTI, its impact on immunity through spatiotemporal dynamics remains unknown.</p>
<p>Membrane microdomains, dynamic structures rich in sterols and sphingolipids, are crucial in regulating plasma membrane (PM) protein behavior (Boutté et al., 2020). Specific proteins like Flotillins and Remorins can uniquely label these microdomains within living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bücherl et al., 2017</xref>). Various stimuli can induce PM proteins to move into mobile or immobile microdomains, suggesting a connection between microdomains and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Xing et al. (2022)</xref> demonstrated that sterol depletion significantly impacts the dynamics of flg22-activated FER–GFP, emphasizing microdomains’ role in the lateral mobility and dissociation of FER from the PM under flg22 treatment. However, the spatial coordination of FLS2 dynamics and signaling at the PM, along with their relationships with microdomains, remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>To investigate if FLS2 Ser-938 phosphorylation-mediated immune response is linked to its microdomain, we analyzed diffusion and dwell time of FLS2 phospho-dead and phospho-mimic mutants at the PM before and after flg22 treatments. Our results show that flg22-induced dynamic and dwell time changes are abolished in FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>. Using FLIM-FRET and smPPI techniques, we discovered that FLS2 in different phosphorylation states exhibited distinct membrane microdomain distribution and endocytosis. Additionally, various phenotypic experiments demonstrated that the immune response of phosphorylated FLS2<sup>S938D</sup> was similar to wild-type FLS2, while weakened in transgenic plants with dephosphorylated FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>. These findings contribute to the theoretical foundation for studying plant immunity regulation through phosphorylation.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>The Ser-938 phosphorylation site changed the spatiotemporal dynamics of flg22-induced FLS2 at the plasma membrane</title>
<p>Previous studies highlight the crucial role of membrane protein phosphorylation in fundamental cellular processes, including PM dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Vitrac et al., 2019</xref>; Offringa et al., 2013). <italic>In vitro</italic> mass spectrometry (MS) identified multiple phosphorylation sites in FLS2. Genetic analysis further identified Ser-938 as a functionally important site for FLS2 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). FLS2 Ser-938 mutations impact flg22-induced signaling, while BAK1 binding remains unaffected, thereby suggesting Ser-938 regulates other aspects of FLS2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). To unravel the immune response regulation mechanisms via FLS2 phosphorylation, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing C-terminal GFP-fused FLS2, S938A, or S938D under the FLS2 native promoter in the <italic>fls2</italic> mutant background (Figure S1A). Using VA-TIRFM with single-particle tracking (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), we investigated the diffusion dynamics of FLS2 phospho-dead and phospho-mimic mutants, following previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Geng et al., 2022</xref>). Upon flg22 treatment, FLS2<sup>S938D</sup>-GFP spots exhibited longer motion trajectories, while FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>-GFP spots were limited to shorter motion tracks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The results indicate significant changes in the diffusion coefficients and motion ranges of FLS2/FLS2<sup>S938D</sup>-GFP after flg22 treatment, whereas FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>-GFP showed no significant differences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Similar outcomes were observed using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dorrity et al., 2020</xref>) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (Greig et al., 2021) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref> and S1B, F), supporting the essential role of the S938 phosphorylation site in flg22-induced lateral diffusion of FLS2 at the PM.</p>

<p>Using VA-TIRFM, we analyzed FLS2 particle dwell time across various phosphorylation states. The results revealed that flg22 treatment significantly reduced the fluorescence trajectory of FLS2 molecules compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and S1C), indicating that Ser-938 phosphorylation influences flg22-induced dwell times of FLS2 at the PM. Subsequently, real-time dynamic analysis through the Kymograph technique provided spatiotemporal information via frame-by-frame tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Compared to FLS2-GFP and FLS2<sup>S938D</sup>-GFP, FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>-GFP showed nearly linear fluctuations in fluorescence intensity under flg22 conditions, and the duration of fluorescence retention was essentially unchanged (Figure S1D). To further confirm this, we quantified FLS2 dwell times using exponential function fitting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref> and S1E). After flg22 treatment, FLS2<sup>S938D</sup>-GFP dwell times significantly decreased, resembling those of FLS2-GFP. Although the FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>-GFP plants, dwell times appeared to slightly decrease with flg22 treatment, the change was not significant. This aligns with previous findings that NRT1.1 phosphorylation affects dynamics and dwell time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, numerous FLS2 exhibited short-lived dwell times, indicating abortive endocytic events associated with the endocytic pathway and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bertot et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, these results underscore the impact of Ser-938 phosphorylation on the spatiotemporal dynamics of flg22-induced FLS2.</p>

<title>Ser-938 phosphorylation enhances recruitment of FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization into <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-associated microdomains</title>
<p>Proteins rarely act independently; they typically form multimers to enhance downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Previous studies have shown that inactive FLS2 mainly exists as monomers. Flg22 treatment induces FLS2 and BAK1 to heterodimerize at the PM, signifying flg22 as a ligand promoting this heterodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Orosa et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we further investigated if Ser-938 phosphorylation affects FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization. Tesseler segmentation, FRET-FLIM, and smPPI analyses revealed no impact of Ser-938 phosphorylation on FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref> and S2). This aligns with the previous finding that flg22 acts as a molecular glue for FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sun et al., 2013</xref>), confirming the independence of FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization from phosphorylation, with these events occurring sequentially.</p>

<p>Membrane microdomains serve as pivotal platforms for protein regulation, impacting cellular signaling dynamics (Martinière et al., 2021). Studies reveal that specific plasma membrane (PM) proteins, responsive to developmental cues and environmental stimuli, exhibit dynamic movements within and outside these microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, treatment with the secreted peptides RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF1 and RALF23) enhances the presence of FERONIA (FER) in membrane microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gronnier et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, flg22-activated BSK1 translocates from membrane microdomains to non-membrane microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Su et al., 2021</xref>). In a previous investigation, we demonstrated that flg22 induces FLS2 translocation from AtFlot1-negative to AtFlot1-positive nanodomains in the plasma membrane, implying a connection between FLS2 phosphorylation and membrane nanodomain distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cui et al., 2018</xref>). To validate this, we assessed the association of FLS2/FLS2<sup>S938D</sup>/FLS2<sup>S938A</sup> with membrane microdomains, using <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-associated microdomains as representatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Employing SPT, FRET–FLIM, and Pearson correlation, we found increased correlation coefficients between FLS2-GFP/FLS2<sup>S938D</sup>-GFP and <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-mCherry during flg22 treatment compared to the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref> and Movies 1-3). Significantly, flg22 treatment did not increase colocalization levels of FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>-GFP and <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3, indicating the necessity of phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). These findings suggest that the phosphorylation state of FLS2 at Ser-938 influences its aggregation into <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-associated microdomains, providing an efficient mechanism for triggering the immune response.</p>

<title>Ser-938 phosphorylation maintains FLS2 protein homeostasis via flg22-induced endocytosis</title>
<p>The PM protein endocytosis is crucial for regulating intercellular signal transduction in response to environmental stimuli. Notably, Thr 867 mutation, a potential phosphorylation site on FLS2, results in impaired flg22-induced endocytosis, underscoring the significance of phosphorylation in FLS2 endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Robatzek et al., 2006</xref>). As mentioned earlier, FLS2 phosphomimetic mutants showed a reduced dwell time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> H and 1I), implying a probable connection between FLS2 dwell time and endocytosis. Results found that FLS2/FLS2<sup>S938D</sup>/FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>-GFP accumulated in BFA compartments labeled with FM4-64, indicating that various Ser-938 phosphorylation states of FLS2 undergo BFA-dependent constitutive endocytosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, S3A).</p>

<p>Next, we investigated the impact of Ser-938 on flg22-induced FLS2 internalization. Results revealed increased endocytic vesicles for FLS2 during flg22 treatment, aligning with previous studies (Leslie et al., 2017; Loiseau et al., 2017). Employing confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) during 10μM flg22 treatment, we tracked FLS2 endocytosis and quantified vesicle numbers over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). It is evident that both FLS2 and FLS2<sup>S938D</sup> vesicles appeared 15 min after-flg22 treatment, significantly increasing thereafter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, only a few vesicles were detected in FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>-GFP, indicating Ser-938 phosphorylation’s impact on flg22-induced FLS2 endocytosis. Additionally, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2009</xref>) monitored molecular density changes at the PM before and after flg22 treatment (Figure S3F). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> shows that both FLS2-GFP and FLS2<sup>S938D</sup>-GFP densities significantly decreased after flg22 treatment, while FLS2<sup>S938A</sup>-GFP exhibited minimal changes, indicating Ser-938 phosphorylation affects FLS2 internalization. Western blotting confirmed that Ser-938 phosphorylation influences FLS2 degradation after flg22 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), consistent with single-molecule analysis findings. Therefore, our results strongly support the notion that Ser-938 phosphorylation expedited FLS2 internalization, potentially regulating its immune response capacity.</p>

<title>Ser-938 Phosphorylation affects FLS2-mediated responses</title>
<p>PTI plays a pivotal role in host defense against pathogenic infections (Lorrai et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2022). Previous studies demonstrated that FLS2 perception of flg22 initiates a complex signaling network with multiple parallel branches, including calcium burst, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation, callose deposition, and seedling growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baral et al., 2015</xref>; Marcec et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Huang et al., 2023</xref>).

<p>In summary, our study confirmed that FLS2 phosphorylation regulated PAMP-triggered plant immunity by influencing spatiotemporal dynamics at the PM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). Following flg22 treatment, activated FLS2 undergoes hetero-oligomerization and phosphorylation sequentially. Crucially, phosphorylation at the Ser-938 site promotes FLS2 recruitment into <italic>At</italic>Rem1.3-associated microdomains and endocytosis. These results provided new insights into the phosphorylation-regulated dynamics of plant immunity, thereby providing a reference for future studies on signal transduction in intracellular complex nanostructures.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Organization of cell surface receptors in membrane nanodomains is important for signaling, but how this is regulated is poorly understood. In this study the authors employ TIRFM single-molecule tracking combined with multiple analyses to show that ligand exposure increases diffusion of the immune receptor FLS2 in the plasma membrane and its co-localization with remorin REM1.3 in a manner dependent on the phosphosite S938. They additionally show that ligand increases dwell time of FLS2, and this is linked to FLS2 endocytosis, also in a manner dependent on S938 phosphorylation. The study uncovers a regulatory mechanism of FLS2 localization in the nanodomain crucial for signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>TIRFM single-molecule tracking, FRAP, FRET and endocytosis experiments were nicely done. A role of S938 phosphorylation is convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the previous submission, reviewers pointed out multiple issues, which the reviewers believed the authors can address in the revision. The revised version does improve to some extent but still contains many issues in terms of data analysis and writing.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The research conducted by Yaning Cui and colleagues delves into understanding FLS2-mediated immunity. This is achieved by comparing the spatiotemporal dynamics of a FLS2-S938A mutant and FLS2-WT, especially in relation to their association with the remorin protein. To delineate the differences between the FLS2-S938A mutant and FLS2-WT, they utilized a plethora of advanced fluorescent imaging techniques. By analyzing surface dynamics and interactions involving the receptor signal co-receptor BAK1 and remorin proteins, the authors propose a model of how FLS2 and BAK1 are assembled and positioned within a remorin-specific nano-enviroment during FLS2 ligand-induced immune responses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>These techniques offer direct visualizations of molecular dynamics and interactions, helping us understand their spatial relationships and interactions during innate immune responses.</p>
<p>Advanced cell biology imaging techniques are crucial for obtaining high-resolution insights into the intracellular dynamics of biomolecules. The demonstrated imaging systems are excellent examples to be used in studying plant immunity by integrating other functional assays.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It's essential to acknowledge that every fluorescence-based method, just like biochemical assays, comes with its unique limitations. These often pertain to spatial and temporal resolutions, as well as the sensitivity of the cameras employed in each setup. Meticulous interpretation is pivotal to guarantee an accurate depiction and to steer clear of potential misunderstandings when employing specific imaging systems to analyze molecular attributes. Moreover, a discerning interpretation and accurate image analysis can offer invaluable guidance for future studies on plant signaling molecules using these nice cell imaging techniques.</p>
<p>For instance, although single-particle analysis couldn't conclusively link FLS2 and remorin, FLIM-FRET effectively highlighted their ligand-triggered association and the disengagement brought on by mutations. While these methodologies seemed to present differing outcomes, they were described in the manuscript as harmonious. In reality, these differences could highlight distinct protein populations active in immune responses, each accentuated differently by the respective imaging techniques due to their individual spatial and temporal limitations. Addressing these variations is imperative, especially when designing future imaging explorations of immune complexes.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We greatly thank you and the reviewers for your expert comments and valuable suggestions on our manuscript. After reading these comments, we realized that the previous version of the manuscript contained some weak points. Surely, the issues raised by the six reviewers were of great help in the revision of our manuscript.</p>
<p>According to the comments, we have now fully revised the manuscript to address most of the questions and suggestions. In addition, we reworded some parts of the Introduction, Results and Discussion, Figures, Figure legends and Experimental Methods to increase the rigor of our conclusions.</p>
<p>Overall, you will see that we have paid serious attention to all the concerns and criticisms expressed by reviewers. Addressing these various issues has most certainly allowed us to prepare a much-improved manuscript and for this we offer our hearty thanks.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>TIRFM single-molecule tracking, FRAP, FRET, and endocytosis experiments were nicely done. The role of S938 phosphorylation is convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Question 1: The model suggests that S938 is phosphorylated upon flg22 treatment. This is actually not known.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Thank you for your expert comments. Although the phosphorylation of Ser-938 upon flg22 treatment is not known, the model presented in the manuscript is based on previous studies that have shown the importance of Ser-938 phosphorylation for the function of FLS2 (Cao et al, 2013). When it is mutated to the phosphorylation-mimicking residues aspartate or glutamate, immune responses remain normal. These findings suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser-938 plays a critical role in activating defense mechanisms upon flagellin detection (Cao et al, 2013). Now we added the results of Cao et al. (2013) to the introduction to strengthen in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 2: In addition, the S938D mutant does not show constitutively increased diffusion and co-localization with remorin. It is necessary to soften the tone in the conclusion.</p>
<p>Reply: We appreciate the valuable suggestions from the reviewer. Based on our findings, we observed that the phosphorylation of Ser-938 significantly impacts the dynamics of flg22-induced FLS2. However, it does not alter the diffusion coefficient of FLS2 itself. In the revised manuscript, we have carefully adjusted the conclusion by softening the tone to reflect these findings.</p>
<p>Question 3: The introduction (only two paragraphs) and discussion are not properly written in the context of the current understanding of plant receptors in nanodomains. The authors basically just cited a few publications of their own, and this is not acceptable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We accepted the criticisms here. Now, we have reworded the introduction and discussion sections to improve clarity. Furthermore, we have incorporated several new reports on plant receptors in nanodomains into the revised manuscript. Besides, we deleted some publications from our own group, while citing the latest references on plant receptors and nanodomains.</p>

<p>Reply: Thank you for your insightful comments and suggestions. We appreciate your expertise in fluorescence-based methods and the importance of careful interpretation and accurate image analysis. We agree with you that different imaging techniques may have their limitations and can highlight distinct aspects of protein dynamics and interactions.</p>
<p>In our study, we used single-particle analysis and FLIM-FRET to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of FLS2 and its association with remorin. While single-particle analysis did not conclusively link FLS2 and remorin, FLIM-FRET effectively highlighted their ligand-triggered association and the disengagement caused by mutations. We acknowledge that these techniques may have different spatial and temporal resolutions, leading to the discrepancy in their results. However, after the normalized treatment, we can provide very similar conclusions. Accordingly, we have revised the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Receptor kinases (RKs) perceive extracellular signals to regulate many processes in plants. FLS2 is an RK that acts as a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) to recognize bacterial flagellin and activate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). PRRs such as FLS2 have been previously shown to reside within PM nanodomains, which can regulate downstream PTI signaling. In the current manuscript, Cui et al use single particle tracking to characterize the effect of previously-described phosposite mutants (FLS2-S938A/D) on the PM organization, endocytosis, and signaling functions of FLS2. The authors confirm that FLS2-S938D but not -S938A is functional for flg22-induced responses, while also demonstrating that phopshodead mutation at this site (S938A) prevents flg22-induced sorting into nanodomains and endocytosis. These results are consistent with S938 being an important phosphorylation site for FLS2 function, however, they fall short of demonstrating that membrane disorganization of FLS2-938A is responsible for downstream signaling defects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors' experiments (single particle tracking, co-localization, etc) do a good job of demonstrating how a non-functional version of FLS2 (S938A) does not alter its spatio-temporal dynamics, nanodomain organization, and endocytosis in response to flg22, suggesting that these require a functional receptor and are regulated by intracellular signaling components.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Question 1: The authors do not provide direct evidence that S938 phosphorylation specifically affects membrane organization, rather than FLS2 signaling more generally. All evidence is consistent with S938A being a non-functional version of FLS2, wherein an activated/functional receptor is required for all downstream events including membrane re-organization, downstream signalling, internalization, etc. Furthermore, the authors never demonstrate that this site is phosphorylated in planta in the basal or flg22-elicited state.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Sorry that we did not describe clearly in the original manuscript. In fact, we found in our study that the phosphorylation of the Ser-938 site influences the efficient sorting of FLS2 into AtRem1.3-associated microdomains rather than membrane organization, as depicted in Figure 2. Furthermore, we found that the immune responses are disrupted when Ser-938 is mutated to alanine, which is consistent with previously reported results (Cao et al, 2013). However, they remain normal when mutated to the phosphorylation-mimicking residues aspartate or glutamate. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser-938 is crucial for activating defense mechanisms upon flagellin detection. Although the phosphorylation of Ser-938 in plant at the basal or flg22-elicited state is not known, the model presented in the manuscript is based on the results of our current investigation together with those in the previous study that have shown the importance of Ser-938 phosphorylation for FLS2 function (Cao et al, 2013).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 2: As written, the manuscript also has numerous scientific issues, including a misleading/incomplete description of plant immune signaling, lack of context from previous work, and extensive use of inappropriate references.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We accept the criticism here. After reading the comments, we realized the problem. Now we have revised the misleading or incomplete description of plant immune signaling, added the context of previous works and deleted inappropriate references in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Question 1: The description of the data has no details. How many biological repeats were done? How were statistical analyses done? What is the concentration of flg22? How was the calcium flux done (Fig. 4A)? The method also lacks details and relevant references.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We apologize for the lack of detail in presenting the data. Following your suggestion, we added comprehensive figure legends that provide clear explanations for each figure. Additionally, we included supplementary information on the measurement methods and references pertaining to calcium flux in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 2: Data in Fig. 4 basically repeated the 2013 PLoS Pathog paper. Why were these experiments even performed? Were GFP-tagged FLS2 lines used in these experiments? If this is the case, the data just verified that the GFP-tagged FLS2 functions as expected and should be moved to supporting data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Thanks for the expert suggestions. In our study, we utilized GFP-tagged FLS2 lines to generate FLS2-S938 mutants and conducted experiments to investigate the flg22-induced immune response. Although some experiments in Figure 4 are similar to those reported (Cao et al, 2013), we provided a more detailed analysis of the immune response. The comprehensive analysis included early immune responses and late immune responses, e.g., the activation of a calcium burst, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the induction of immune-responsive genes and callose deposition, ultimately resulting in the inhibition of plant growth. As some results are analogous to the previous paper, we transfer some of the experiments as suggested, including the analysis of MAPKs and callose deposition, to the supporting data section of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 3: Flg22-induced FLS2-BAK1 association does not require S938, this is consistent with prior study that flg22 acts as a molecular glue for the ectodomains of FLS2 and BAK1 (Sun et al., 2013 Science). This needs to be cited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Yes, we agree with the comment. Now we added an additional sentence in the revised manuscript: “ This aligns with the previous finding that flg22 acts as a molecular glue for FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains (Sun et al., 2013).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 4: Line 50, the references cited do not match what they say here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We are sorry for the mistake in citing inappropriate references. In the revised manuscript, we deleted this sentence as well as the incorrect reference.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 5: Line 105, &quot;flg22 can act as a ligand-like factor&quot;. It is a ligand!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Sorry for the mistake. Now, the sentence was corrected in the revised manuscript by deleting the word “like”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 6: Line 107, FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization, not heteroologomerization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Now we used “heterodimerization” to replace “heteroologomerization” in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 7: Line 114, are these really the best references to cite here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: After reading the comment, we found the references were not suitable here. Now we changed references by citing “(Martinière et al., 2021)” in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 8: Lines 123-124, the sentence is incomplete.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: In the revised manuscript, we reworded the sentence to make it complete now. We changed “In a previous investigation, we demonstrated that flg22 induces FLS2 translocation from AtFlot1-negative to AtFlot1-positive nanodomains in the plasma membrane, implying a connection between FLS2 phosphorylation and membrane nanodomain distribution (Cui et al., 2018). To validate this, we assessed the association of FLS2/FLS2S938D/FLS2S938A with membrane microdomains, using AtRem1.3-associated microdomains as representatives (Huang et al., 2019).” in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 9: Lines 169-170, Why is this &quot;most important&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Sorry for the unsuitable description. As we have dramatically changed the manuscript, this sentence was deleted from the new version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Here are some specific areas of ambiguity in the study to be improved.</p>
<p>Question 1: Clarity in statistical analysis is necessary. Many figure legends omit details such as the sample size &quot;n&quot;, and the nature of the measurements, like ROIs, images, and dots, the size of the seedlings, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We appreciated this suggestion, which was raised by the reviewer I as well. Now, we provided the details for each figure, including the sample size, the nature of the measurements in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 2: Additional background about the choice of FLS2-S938 mutant would be beneficial, given that this mutant doesn't affect the BAK1 interaction but nullifies several PTI responses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Yes, we agreed that some additional background is required for the FLS2-S938 mutant. Therefore, we added a sentence here: “FLS2 Ser-938 mutations impact flg22-induced signaling, while BAK1 binding remains unaffected, thereby suggesting Ser-938 regulates other aspects of FLS2 activity (Cao et al., 2013).” in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 3: A specific segment &quot;... Using CLSM, Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and Western blotting, we found that the endocytic vesicles of FLS2S938D increased significantly after flg22 treatment (Figure 3B-3E)...&quot; is not easy to follow. The author may want to differentiate these methods and highlight them by indicting them as endocytic vesicle counting, receptor density on PM measurement by FCS, and WB-based protein degradation characterization to understand such mixed descriptions better. By the way, &quot;Number of Endocytosis&quot; should be &quot;number of endocytic vesicles&quot;. Endocytosis is a process and uncountable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We thank the reviewer for kindly reminding us to differentiate experimental methods. Therefore, we changed the sentences in the revised manuscript: “Employing confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) during 10μM flg22 treatment, we tracked FLS2 endocytosis and quantified vesicle numbers over time (Figure 3B). It is evident that both FLS2 and FLS2S938D vesicles appeared 15 min after-flg22 treatment, significantly increasing thereafter (Figure 3C). Notably, only a few vesicles were detected in FLS2S938A-GFP, indicating Ser-938 phosphorylation's impact on flg22-induced FLS2 endocytosis. Additionally, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)  (Chen et al., 2009) monitored molecular density changes at the PM before and after flg22 treatment (Figure S3F). Figure 3D shows that both FLS2-GFP and FLS2S938D-GFP densities significantly decreased after flg22 treatment, while FLS2S938A-GFP exhibited minimal changes, indicating Ser-938 phosphorylation affects FLS2 internalization. Western blotting confirmed that Ser-938 phosphorylation influences FLS2 degradation after flg22 treatment (Figure 3E), consistent with single-molecule analysis findings.” Besides, we also changed “number of endocytosis” to “the number of endocytic vesicles” in Figure 3C as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 4: In Figure 1 E, a discrepancy exists where the total percentages in the red and black columns don't sum up to 100%, while other groups look right. This needs clarification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We are sorry for our carelessness in making the data incomplete. Now we thoroughly supplemented, collated, and rechecked the data in Figure 1E. Due to an oversight during the production of the figure, some data was inadvertently omitted, resulting in the red column not reaching 100%. Besides, we checked the data in the black column again, and the total percentage indeed added up to 100%.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 5: Although Figure 1F uses UMAP analysis to differentiate between FLS2WT and A mutants, only data pertaining to the &quot;D&quot; mutant is shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Thank you for the expert comments. Because there are several images in Figure 1, we only selected the data related to the “D” mutant as a representative for display. As suggested, we have added all the UMAP images in the revised supplement figure S1F.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 6: There are apparent inconsistencies in the FRAP results, particularly regarding the initial recovery points post-bleaching. A detailed statistical analysis, supplemented with FRAP images over time, should be included for clarity. Were they bleached to a similar ground level before monitoring their recovery? The data points from &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after &quot;bleaching were not shown. I found the red and blue curves showed similar recovery slop, which suggests no long-distance movement changes for all three FLS2 versions, with or without flg22. This is opposite from the conclusions made by the author.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Thank you for the expert comments. After reading the comments, we recognized this terrible problem. Therefore, we carried out a new FRAP experiment. The new results showed that, following complete bleaching of three samples of FLS2 to ground level, the recovery rates of FLS2 and FLS2S938D under flg22 treatment were significantly higher compared to the control group (Fig. 1G). In contrast, the recovery rates of the FLS2S938A-GFP after flg22 treatment remain similar to that before treatment (Fig. 1G), indicating that the Ser-938 phosphorylation site indeed affects the flg22-induced lateral diffusion of FLS2 at the PM. The new results are basically consistent with the motion range of single-molecule results, which is not contradictory to long-distance movement changes. Accordingly, we incorporated the new time-lapse FRAP images into Figure 1G and S1B.</p>

<p>Question 7: There's a potential typo in Figure 1B regarding the bar size. It could neither possibly be 200 um nor 200 nm. Figure 1A also needs a scale bar.</p>

<p>Reply: Apologies for the mistake. We now corrected “200 μm” to “2 μm”. Besides, we also included a scale bar in Figure 1A in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 8: Due to the unreliable tracking for a long-time by Imaris, the authors analyzed the tracks within 10s and quantified very short live particles under 4s. Such 4S surface retention for a receptor does not seem to match functional endocytic internalization time for cargo. Even after the endocytic adaptor module recruitment, it would take at least more than 10s to finish the internalization. In the field of endocytosis, these events are often described as abortive endocytic events. However, the disappearance of cargoes, FLS2 in this case, indicates internalization into the cytoplasm, which is interesting. May the author discuss more on how these short events analyzed enhance our understanding of the functional behavior of FLS2?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We greatly appreciated the valuable comments provided by the reviewer. After thorough consideration, we acknowledged that in our original manuscript, we failed to distinguish the short-lived from the long-lived particles and vaguely put them collectively into the internalized particles. We realized that and it is inappropriate to ambiguously categorize all particles as internalized. Therefore, we added the sentence “Additionally, numerous FLS2 exhibited short-lived dwell times, indicating abortive endocytic events associated with the endocytic pathway and signal transduction (Bertot et al., 2018)” in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Question 9: Figure 2D should be comprehensive, presenting data for the WT, A, and D versions.</p>

<p>Question 10: In Figure 2D, TIRM-SIM should be a typo and rectified to TIRF-SIM. Also, a detailed explanation of the TIRF-SIM setup and its specifics would be important. The imaging approach of SIM, especially the time duration for finishing all frames before reconstruction, is essential to rationalize its use in capturing and measuring an appropriate speed range of particle movement. May the author elaborate on the technique details and the use of TIRF-SIM for colocalization analysis? To clarify these, the author may provide additional TIRF-only movies of FLS2 (WT, A, D) and AtRem1.3 for comparison with TIRF-SIM still images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Sorry for the mistake. In the revised manuscript, we have corrected “TIRM-SIM” to “TIRF-SIM”. In order to rationalize its use in capturing and measuring an appropriate speed range of particle movement, we included a more detailed description of the imaging approach and the colocalization analysis of TIRF-SIM in the Materials and Methods section as follows: “The SIM images were taken by a 60 × NA 1.49 objective on a structured illumination microscopy (SIM) platform (DeltaVision OMX SR) with a sCMOS camera (Camera pixel size, 6.5 μm). The light source for TIRF-SIM included diode laser at 488 nm and 568 nm with pixel sizes (μm) of 0.0794 and 0.0794 (Barbieri et al., 2021). For the dual-color imaging, FLS2/FLS2S938A/FLS2S938D-GFP (488 nm/30.0%) and AtRem1.3-mCherry (561 nm/30.0%) were excited sequentially. The exposure time of the camera was set at 50 ms throughout single-particle imaging. The time interval for time-lapse imaging was 100 ms, the total time was 2s, and the total time points were 21s. The Imaris intensity correlation analysis plugin was used to calculate the co-localization ratio.” in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, we provided additional TIRF-SIM movies of FLS2 (WT, A, D) and AtRem1.3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 11: The colocalization displayed in Figure 2D is hard to tell. A colocalization ratio of FLS2-AtRem1.3 is shown as ~0.8%, which has only ~0.2% difference from the flg22-treated condition. &quot;n&quot; of Figure 2F should be specified in the legend, such as a line with a specific length, or an ROI with a specific area size.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Thank you for the expert comments. Although the increased colocalization after flg22 treatment is not high, the change is statistically significant as compared with the wild type. We agreed that every fluorescence-based method, like biochemical analysis, has its own unique limitations, which were raised by the Reviewer #2 (Public Review) as well. In order to provide strong evidence, we also carried out the FLIM-FRET experiment as a supplement, which can effectively detect their ligand-triggered association or disassociation. From figure 2G and H, we clearly found that the co-localization of FLS2/FLS2S938D-GFP with AtRem1.3-mCherry significantly increase in response to flg22 treatment (FLS2-GFP control: 2.45 ± 0.019 s; FLS2-GFP flg22-treated: 2.39 ± 0.016 s; FLS2S938D-GFP control: 2.42 ± 0.010 ns; FLS2S938D-GFP flg22-treated: 2.35 ± 0.028 ns). In contrast, FLS2S938A-GFP shows no significant changes (control: 2.53 ± 0.011 ns; flg22-treated: 2.56 ± 0.013 ns), indicating that Ser-938 phosphorylation influences efficient sorting of FLS2 into AtRem1.3-associated microdomains. Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we now rearranged the order of 2E and 2F, in which N represents the entire image region used for analysis rather than a specific region of interest.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 12: I appreciate the nice results of the FLIM-FRET results for FLS2-Rem1.3. Figure 2H should be supplemented with additional representative images of all FLS2 variants including WT and mutants.</p>

<p>Reply: Thanks for your warm encouragement. As suggested, we added all the representative images in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Question 13: The unit of the X-axis of Figure 2E can not be pixel. Should it be, um? In the method, the author could specify the camera model and magnification for TIRF-SIM to understand pixel size of the image better.</p>

<p>Reply: Sorry for the mistake here. Indeed, the unit of the X-axis in Figure 2E should be μm. Now we correct this mistake in Figure 2E in the revised manuscript. Besides, we included a detailed description of the imaging approach of TIRF-SIM in the Materials and Methods section as follows: “The SIM images were taken by a 60 × NA 1.49 objective on a structured illumination microscopy (SIM) platform (DeltaVision OMX SR) with a sCMOS camera (Camera pixel size, 6.5 μm)”.</p>

<p>Question 15: I recommend that the authors exercise caution when drawing conclusions based on the Rem1.3 data and when representing the &quot;microdomain&quot; concept in their final model. While Rem1.3 punctate is a nanometer-sized protein cluster specific to its identity, its shape can be categorized as a nanodomain. Conceptually, however, it neither universally represents all nanodomains nor microdomains, as depicted in Figure 4. We should exercise caution to prevent providing misleading information to the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We thank the reviewer for expert comments. To avoid misleading conclusions, we changed “nanodomains” to “AtRem1.3-associated microdomains” in the revised manuscript. Besides, we have also made modifications to Figure 4.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Question 1: The manuscript needs to be extensively re-written and has severe issues as-is. Many references are either not quite appropriate or are completely unrelated to the use in the text. In general, the current state-of-the-art of PTI and RK signaling is not correctly described or incorporated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We accepted the criticisms here. As suggested, we thoroughly rewrote the manuscript to address the concerns raised. Furthermore, we have thoroughly checked and revised the manuscript by removing 21 irrelevant references and adding 30 relevant references. We also incorporated the most up-to-date descriptions of the PTI and RK signaling pathways.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 2: Receptor-like kinase (RLK) should generally be receptor kinase (RK) as receptor functions are now well established.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Yes, we agreed with your expert comment here. Now, we changed “Receptor-like kinase (RLK)” into “receptor kinase (RK)” in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 3: Line 20 - is this really true?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Sorry for the mistake. In the revised manuscript, we changed “However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of FLS2 phosphorylation activity at the plasma membrane in response to flg22 remain largely enigmatic.” to “However, the dynamic FLS2 phosphorylation regulation at the plasma membrane in response to flg22 needs further elucidation.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 4: S938D sorts better in response to Flg22; S938A is unaffected - suggests phosphorylation of S938 is not dynamic in response to Fig 22 but is required for pre-elicitation sorting. Overall, there is a chicken-and-egg problem in this paper: which comes first, immune/signalling functionality or nanodomain sorting? And which is explaining the defects of S938A?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We thank the reviewer for expert suggestions. In fact, the previous studies showed that membrane microdomains serve as signaling platforms that mediate cargo protein sorting and protein-protein interactions in a variety of contexts (Goldfinger et al. 2017). Since our previous research showed that the disruption of membrane microdomains affected flg22-induced immune signaling (Cui et al. 2018), we speculate that the immune signal occurred after entering the membrane microdomains.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 1 and 2, ligand exposure leads to an increase in diffusion coefficient and enhanced co-localization with REM1.3, both of which are dependent on the phosphorylation of the Ser-938 site. Deducing from these results, we inferred that the defects in S938A resulted largely from its failure to sort into membrane microdomains. The phosphorylation of the Ser-938 site can regulate FLS2 into functional AtRem1.3-associated microdomains, thereby affecting flg22-induced plant immunity.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 6: Lines 40-42 - not all phosphorylation sites are within the kinase domain, for example, sites are well-described on the JM and/or C-tail regions outside of the kinase domain.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 7: Line 42 - what is BIK1? Intro to relevant topics is severely lacking.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Sorry for the incomplete introduction here. We added the relevant introduction of BIK1 by adding that “Upon recognizing flg22, FLS2 interacts with the co-receptor Brassinosteroid-Insensitive 1-associated Kinase 1 (BAK1), initiating phosphorylation events through the activation of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) such as BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) to elicit downstream immune responses (Chinchilla et al., 2006; Li et al., 2016b; Majhi et al., 2021). ” in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 8: Lines 42-44 - not sure this sequence of events is being properly described (e.g. BIK1 release is unlikely to precede activation by BAK1/SERKs).</p>

<p>Reply: We apologize for not expressing this sentence clearly. Now, we reworded the sentence: “Upon recognizing flg22, FLS2 interacts with the co-receptor Brassinosteroid-Insensitive 1-associated Kinase 1 (BAK1), initiating phosphorylation events through the activation of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) such as BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) to elicit downstream immune responses (Chinchilla et al., 2006; Li et al., 2016b; Majhi et al., 2021).” in the revised manuscript.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 11: Lines 104-106 - this is wildly misleading. Flg22 is more than a ligand-like factor, as it is a bona fide ligand, and the heterodimerization with BAK1/SERKs is extremely well-established (and relevant foundational papers should be cited here in place of the authors' previous work).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We apologize for the incorrect expression here. After reading the comments, we realized the problem which was raised by the reviewer I as well.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Question 12: Lines 107-112 - again, this is confusing. There is a decade of (uncited, undiscussed) work previously establishing that heterodimerization of RK-co-receptor complexes is mediated by extracellular ligand binding and independent of intracellular phosphorylation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We thank the reviewer for expert suggestions. Now, we added several sentences in the revised manuscript: “Therefore, we further investigated if Ser-938 phosphorylation affects FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization. Tesseler segmentation, FRET-FLIM, and smPPI analyses revealed no impact of Ser-938 phosphorylation on FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization (Figure 2A-C and S2). This aligns with the previous finding that flg22 acts as a molecular glue for FLS2 and BAK1 ectodomains (Sun et al., 2013), confirming the independence of FLS2/BAK1 heterodimerization from phosphorylation, with these events occurring sequentially.”</p>

<p>Reply: As suggestion, we reworded and added a section in the revised manuscript as follows: “PTI plays a pivotal role in host defense against pathogenic infections (Lorrai et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2022). Previous studies demonstrated that FLS2 perception of flg22 initiates a complex signaling network with multiple parallel branches, including calcium burst, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation, callose deposition, and seedling growth inhibition (Baral et al., 2015; Marcec et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2023). Our focus was to investigate the significance of Ser-938 phosphorylation in flg22-induced plant immunity. Figure 4A-F illustrates diverse immune responses in FLS2 and FLS2S938D plants following flg22 treatment. These responses encompass calcium burst activation, MAPKs cascade reaction, callose deposition, hypocotyl growth inhibition, and activation of immune-responsive genes. In contrast, FLS2S938A (Figure S4A-D) exhibited limited immune responses, underscoring the importance of Ser-938 phosphorylation for FLS2-mediated PTI responses”.</p>
