<abstract><p>Women represent about 80% of patients with autoimmune diseases. This may partly result from sex-based differences in T cell receptor (TCR) selection during thymocyte development, potentially influenced by hormones and the lower expression of the Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE) transcription factor in females. To investigate this, we analyzed sex-specific differences in TCR generation and selection. We examined TCR repertoires in double-positive thymocytes and single-positive thymic cells, including CD8⁺ and CD4⁺ effector T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), derived from male and female organ donors. Minimal sex-based differences were observed in V and J gene usage, and there were no notable differences in TCR repertoire diversity, complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length, amino acid composition, or network structure. No TCR sequences were exclusive to either sex. However, female effector T cells exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of TCRs specific to self-antigens implicated in autoimmunity compared to males, while female Tregs showed a reduced frequency of such TCRs. These differences were not observed for TCRs targeting self-antigens unrelated to autoimmunity or antigens associated with cancer or viruses. Our findings highlight a sex-specific imbalance in thymic selection of TCRs with autoimmunity-associated specificities, providing mechanistic insight into the increased susceptibility of women to autoimmune diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Several studies have highlighted a sex imbalance in diseases involving the immune system. This is particularly the case for autoimmune diseases (AIDs), where 80% of those affected are women and the severity between the sexes vary depending on the pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In addition, men are more severely affected by infectious disease such as COVID-19 and tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The response to preventive immunotherapies such as vaccination, and to curative treatments, like immune checkpoint inhibitors or anti-TNF alpha, is also sex dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). All of these observations suggest intrinsic biological differences in immune responses between males and females.</p>
<p>A variety of factors have been identified that could help explain these observed sex-based differences. Among these, sex hormones have been shown to influence immune responses by acting on immune cells that express specific receptors to these hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Sex hormones could directly influence the adaptive immune response at the level of thymocyte differentiation and selection by acting on the expression of Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE) in thymic epithelial cells. AIRE drives the thymic expression of otherwise tissue-specific antigens, contributing to both the negative selection of effector cells and the positive selection of Tregs that recognize such antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Testosterone increases AIRE expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells, whereas estradiol decreases it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study has shown that the transcriptomic profiles of these specialized antigen-presenting cells in the thymus differ between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). This clearly suggests that there could be differences in the selection of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire between males and females.</p>
<p>Despite these findings, little is known about potential differences in the TCR repertoire between the sexes. The generation of the TCR is a key process in T-cell development that takes place in the thymus. The TCR consists of two chains, alpha (TRA) and beta (TRB), each of which resulting from a random genetic rearrangement involving the V (variable), D (diversity) [for the TRB], and J (joining) genes. The combination of these gene segments is accompanied by insertions and deletions, creating a highly diverse region, the Complementarity Determining Region 3 (CDR3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). It is this region of the TCR that mostly interacts with the peptide, a critical interaction for antigen recognition and subsequent T cell activation. The ability to specifically recognize diverse antigens via the CDR3 is central to the efficiency and specificity of the adaptive immune response.</p>
<p>Because TCRs are randomly generated, many could be useless while some could be harmful by recognizing self-antigens and causing autoimmunity. The current paradigm is that during thymocyte development, thymocytes are selected based on the avidity of their TCRs for antigens presented by cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells. Thymocytes expressing TCRs with too low or too high avidity are eliminated (negative selection), while those with an intermediate avidity are positively selected and mature into single-positive cells, either CD4+ or CD8+. Thymocytes with the highest of these intermediate affinities develop in Tregs. Since AIRE plays a major role in these processes, sex differences in AIRE expression could have a major impact on thymic selection.</p>
<p>The TCR repertoire of female and male peripheral T cells have shown that their diversity, particularly that of the TRB repertoire, is influenced not only by the age of the individuals but also by their sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). However, another study showed no association between the sex of individuals and the diversity of their TCR repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Nevertheless, the study of peripheral blood TCRs reflects that of an immune system that has gone through multiple immune responses. For example, differences observed between males and females for responses to self-antigens associated with autoimmunity could reflect either the cause (the TCRs drive the disease) or the consequence (the TCRs are expanded because of the disease).</p>
<p>To assess whether there are significant differences in the generation and thymic selection of the TCR repertoire between males and females, we therefore focused on analyzing the TCR repertoires of thymocytes. These cells are the most recent product of T cell development and have not yet been involved in immune responses. Their repertoires thus represent the mechanisms of TCR generation for the analysis of CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) cells, and of TCR selection for CD4 and CD8 simple positive (SP) T cells. We generated a unique data set comprising the sequences of the TRA and TRB chains of DP cells, CD8 and CD4 SP effector cells, and CD4 SP Tregs from organ donors, both infants and adults. The analysis of TRA and TRB repertoires using state-of-the-art strategies revealed no sex differences in repertoire generation (DP cell repertoire), but a bias towards autoimmunity in the selection of the CD8 SP T cells in females.</p>

<title>Minimal sex-based differences in TCR V and J gene usage across thymic cell subsets</title>
<p>The first level of diversity in generating TCRs is the usage of V and J genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). We analyzed the usage of TRA and TRB V and J genes and their combinations in each thymocyte population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p><bold><underline>Top Panel:</underline></bold> Generation of the thymic TCR dataset. From deceased human thymuses of males and females, we isolated key T-cell subtypes through cell sorting. These subtypes included double-positive (DP) cells (CD3+ CD4+ CD8+), single-positive (SP) CD8+ cells (CD3+ CD4-CD8+), SP CD4+ cells (CD3+ CD4+ CD8-), and further separated SP CD4+ cells into T effector (Teff, CD3+ CD4+ CD8-CD25-) and Treg (CD3+ CD4+ CD8-CD25+) cells. TCR libraries were generated from the RNA of each cell population using rapid amplification of cDNA-ends by PCR (5’RACE PCR). Following sequencing, data preprocessing involved quality sequencing checks, contig alignment, and quality control. The final dataset comprised 20 DP samples (male-to-female ratio of 1:1), 21 SP CD8+ samples (1.1:1), 6 SP CD4+ samples (1:5), 16 SP CD4 Teff samples (1.67:1), and 14 SP CD4 Treg samples (1.33:1). Males are depicted in violet and females in orange. <bold><underline>Bottom Panel:</underline></bold> Analytical pipeline. We compared the TCR repertoires of males and females across various dimensions. General aspects of the TCR repertoire were evaluated, including diversity, gene usage, CDR3aa length distribution, and aa usage within the CDR3 region. Additionally, we analyzed the probability of sequence generation, the TCR repertoire structure based on CDR3aa sequence similarity, identification of differentially expressed TRB CDR3aa motifs between sex, and TRB CDR3aa sequence specificity.</p></caption>

<p>Males and females had a relatively similar V gene usage as attested by the absence of a clear separation in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), for both TRA and TRB, and across all studied cell subtypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). However, we observed some individual differences in V and J gene usage between males and females, with some being specific to certain cell subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figures 2-5</xref>), and others observed across multiple cell subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figures 2-5</xref>).

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Comparable TCR repertoire diversity between males and females</title>
<p>A high diversity of the TCR repertoire is essential for generating a broad potential reactivity against a variety of antigens. We thus compared the TCR repertoire diversity between males and females. To achieve this, we analyzed Rényi diversity curves (from zero to infinite 𝛼 parameters) that measure various aspects of TCR repertoire diversity. At different 𝛼 values, the Rényi index places more or less weight on the contribution of the most frequent clonotypes. Higher 𝛼 values emphasize on the most abundant clonotypes, thereby revealing the impact of expanded clones on the overall diversity.</p>
<p>Rényi curves showed comparable diversities between sexes in DP and CD4 Teff cells, for both TRA and TRB, and a difference in CD8 and CD4 Treg cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>). In CD8 cells, the curves begin to diverge at low 𝛼 values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>), with an earlier inflection in males, indicating a less balanced distribution of TCR clones. This suggests that in males, fewer clones dominate the repertoire at lower diversity thresholds compared to females. In Tregs, while the inflection point is similar, the difference seems to be characterized by higher diversity and richness in females compared to males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>). However, no significant differences were observed for the Shannon diversity index (𝛼 = 1), the Simpson index (𝛼 = 2), and the Berger-Parker index (𝛼 = infinite), for both chains and all cell subtypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicate that the thymic TCR repertoire diversity is similar between males and females.</p>

<title>Comparable CDR3aa length distribution in male and female TCR repertoires</title>
<p>Most of the repertoire diversity is generated by the random addition of nucleotides within the VDJ junctions, generating the hypervariable CDR3 region that is interacting with the peptide-MHC complex, and is mostly driving the TCR specificity. The CDR3 length directly influences the TCR’s ability to interact with the peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). We thus studied the distribution of CDR3 aa (CDR3aa) sequence lengths between males and females to identify potential TCR generation and/or selection biases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results showed that males and females have a comparable distribution of CDR3aa lengths for both TRA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>) and TRB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). CDR3aa sequences in TRA were shorter than those in TRB, as previously described in peripheral blood T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Although there were subtle differences in certain CDR3aa lengths between males and females, these variations were minimal, involving sequences that represent less than 2% of the total TCR repertoire (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>). Altogether, the overall distribution of CDR3aa length is similar between males and females.</p>

<title>Minimal differences in CDR3aa usage in thymic TCR repertoires of males and females</title>
<p>We analyzed the aa usage in the FG loop of the CDR3, which is in contact with the peptide-MHC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). We classified the aa according to their hydropathy property: hydrophilic, hydrophobic, or neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). We observed significant differences in the usage of some aa between males and females for both TRA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>) and TRB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In DP cells, the differences preferentially involve hydrophobic aa: females exhibit higher alanine (A) usage in TRA and lower in TRB compared to males (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>). Additionally, females show increased usage of phenylalanine (F) and isoleucine (I) in TRB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, other aa with varying hydropathy characteristics are differentially used between males and females in CD4 Teff and Treg populations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p>We then analyzed in more detail the usage of aa at positions p109 and p110 as the presence of hydrophobic aa at these two positions in TRB has been associated with a stronger recognition of self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).

<title>Slight sex-based variations in thymic TCR generation probability distribution</title>
<p>Another approach to evaluate biases in the generation and selection of the TCR repertoire is to compare the probability of generation (Pgen) of CDR3 nucleotide sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Pgen represents the likelihood of a sequence being produced, according to models of V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). For DP and CD8 cells only and for each TCR chain, a sequence generation model was created using 100,000 non-productive nucleotide sequences. Based on this model, the Pgen of all productive TCR sequences composing each repertoire was calculated.</p>
<p>When comparing the distribution of Pgen between males and females, we observe a very slight difference of distribution characterized by a nearly null Kolmogorov-Smirnov score (D<sub>K-S</sub>&lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This difference is more pronounced in the TRB compared to the TRA chain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). As this small difference could reflect differences linked to variation among individuals irrespective of their sex, we generated 20,000 permuted mixed-sex groups with our dataset. We found the same significant distribution difference of Pgen sequences between these mixed groups population (DP – TRA: D<sub>K-S</sub> = 0.0183 ± 0.0145 (μ ± sd), DP – TRB: D<sub>K-S</sub> = 0.0190 ± 0.0161, CD8 – TRA: D<sub>K-S</sub> = 0.0227 ± 0.0153, and CD8 – TRB: D<sub>K-S</sub> = 0.0259 ± 0.0140). However, the difference observed in the Pgen distribution between males and females is higher than that between the mixed groups in the DP TRB.</p>

<title>Similar network structure of thymic TCR repertoires in males and females</title>
<p>Next, we evaluated whether thymic selection in males and females is directed towards similar or distinct sequences. For each TCR repertoire, CDR3aa sequences are connected if they differ by one aa, i.e. have a Levenshtein distance of =1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Such linked sequences have high probability to share the same specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).

<p>To analyze more precisely these clustering we used various metrics. When comparing the number of clustered sequences in each individual network between males and females, no significant differences were observed for any cell type in either chain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Similarly, the degree of sequence similarity, reflected by the density of edges between sequences within an individual’s TCR repertoire, was comparable between males and females (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These findings indicate that there are no significant sex-specific differences in the similarity of CDR3aa sequences, suggesting that males and females produce CDR3aa sequences with the same degree of variability within their TCR repertoires.</p>

<title>Absence of sex-specific CDR3aa motifs in thymic TCR repertoires of males and females</title>
<p>We then sought whether we could detect CDR3aa sequence motifs that were more present in one group compared to the other, in order to evaluate whether the selection of CDR3aa was biased towards particular sequences differently between males and females (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). To identify sequences with shared characteristics that might indicate a probable common specificity among individuals of the same group, the analysis focused exclusively on CDR3aa sequences of the TRB, as this region has a greater influence on TCR specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Local motifs were defined using Gliph2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), which are a sequences of three to five aa, as well as global motifs, which are a sequence of more than three aa where, at one position, an aa can be substituted by another aa if it has a positive BLOSUM62 score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
<p>We found several hundred motifs differentially expressed between males and females for each cell subpopulation. Larger number of motifs were specific to females, ranging from 426 motifs for DP to 278 motifs for CD4 Tregs, compared to males, ranging from 328 motifs for CD4 Teffs to 34 motifs for CD4 Tregs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).

<p>We observed minimal motif overlap between different cell subtypes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Only two female associated motifs overlapped: one between CD4 Teffs and CD4 Tregs, and another between CD4 Teffs and CD8 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). In contrast, no overlap was found between male-associated motifs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).

<p>We next evaluated the usage of the differentially expressed motifs in external datasets. No public thymic TCR dataset reports repertoires according to cell subsets.

We calculated the usage of these differentially expressed motifs in each sample of this dataset.

<p>We further evaluated these motifs using a peripheral blood TCR dataset from healthy individuals, where CD8, CD4 Teff, and CD4 Treg cells had been sorted.

<title>Sex-biased enrichment of TCRs associated with autoimmune diseases and bacterial antigens</title>
<p>We looked for the usage of TCRs with known specificity as represented in IEDB, Mc-PAS and VDJdb public databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). We compiled the TCRs from these three databases, retaining only those with high sequence reliability scores (see Materials and Methods). We focused on TRB sequences only, due to their greater representation in the databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). We identified 55 368 unique TRB CDR3aa sequences with high reliability and specificity assignment scores for at least one specificity.</p>
<p>We classified the TCR specificities based on the antigen they recognize: viral or bacterial peptides, or human peptides overexpressed in cancers, autoimmune diseases (AIDs), or neither of these diseases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 11A</xref>). We looked for these TRB CDR3aa sequences in our thymocyte dataset. Depending on the individuals and cell subtypes, they represented around 0.82% to 3.58% of the TRB repertoires.</p>
<p>We then compared the distribution of these CDR3aa between males and females for each cell subtype. We observed a significant enrichment of unique TRB CDR3aa sequences specific to self-antigens not associated with pathologies and those associated with cancers in our thymic TCR dataset, for both females and males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 11B</xref>). This enrichment is observed across all cell subtypes and is approximately 1.25 to 1.5 times higher than the baseline distribution of specificities in the pooled database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 11B</xref>). Strikingly, in the TCR repertoires with one specificity only, we observed in CD8 SP cells, a significantly higher proportion of unique TRB CDR3aa sequences associated with AIDs of females compared to males (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 12</xref>).

<p>From a pooled and curated database, an exact match with this database infers the specificity of TRB CDR3aa of our thymic dataset.

These sequences were enriched across all cell subtypes, compared to their representation in the reference database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 11C</xref>). However, no significant differences were observed in the proportion or usage of these polyspecific sequences between males and females. Interestingly, an inverse usage trend was noted between CD8 and CD4 Treg SP cells: females exhibited higher usage of these sequences in the CD8 SP repertoire but a lower usage in the CD4 Treg SP repertoire compared to males (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>-<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is striking that so little is known about possible differences in the TCR repertoire between sexes given the yet unexplained much higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases in females. Exploring the hypothesis that the generation and/or the selection of the TCR repertoires may be different between sexes requires studying the TCR repertoire where they are formed and selected, in the thymus. We thus generated a unique and valuable dataset comprising thymic samples collected from deceased organ donors of various ages, and young children with cardiac surgery. Most importantly, we separated the various thymocytes population to be able to study both TCR repertoire generation at the level of DP cells, and repertoire selection at the level of CD8, CD4 Teff and Treg SP cells. We performed bulk sequencing of the TCRs from these cells, the only method that yet generates enough sequences for sensitive comparison. Indeed, single cell sequencing that analyzes on a few thousand cells would not have allowed making the analyses that can be performed with hundreds of thousand cells.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>TCR generation</title>
<p>Our analyses first revealed similarities rather than dissimilarities in TCR generation. There were no significant sex differences for most of the variables that we analyzed comparing males and females DP cells’ repertoires, except for differences in the usage of few V and J genes from both TCR chains. However, these few differences are likely a result of random variation, considering that we performed hundreds of comparisons. This is supported by the fact that there are no significant differences in the usage of TRBV-TRBJ and TRAV-TRAJ gene associations between males and females. We also observed no differences in diversity indexes in DP cells’ repertories between males and females. Altogether, the overall combinatorial diversity of the TCR repertoire remains comparable between sexes.</p>
<p>A detailed analysis of the CDR3aa region in DP cells showed a differential usage of some hydrophobic aa in the FG loop region for both TCR chains. However, no significant sex-based differences were found in the usage of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or neutral aa at the critical p109 and p110 positions in TRB that have been described as influencing self-antigen recognition due to the impact of hydrophobic aa on TCR self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). These findings suggest that the subtle sex-based differences in the FG loop’s aa usage are minor and do not significantly impact the overall characteristics of the CDR3 region in a sex-dependent manner. The Pgen analysis of DP cells revealed only minimal differences in the distribution of Pgen between males and females, which were similar to those observed in control groups. This indicates that the mechanisms governing TCR generation are largely conserved across sexes, with only minor, likely random, deviations.</p>
<p>Additionally, although we identified TRB CDR3aa sequence motifs differentially expressed between males and females at the DP cell stage in our dataset, these motifs could not reliably differentiate individuals by sex in external datasets. This indicates that they are more dataset specific than sex-specific. This might also be explained by the different characteristics of our data and other dataset. For example, in the Arstila dataset, the analyses were performed on unsorted cells from young subjects. Younger individuals typically have a more diverse and richer TCR repertoire, with greater repertoire sharing in the periphery, which could obscure sex-specific patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). This suggests that these motifs might be context-specific or influenced by other factors such as age, genetic background, or environmental exposures. Moreover, we did not observe any sex-specific differences in CDR3 TRB specificity usage in DP cells’ repertoires. In summary, our results from DP cells analyses could not identify any relevant sex differences in TCR generation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>TCR selection</title>
<p>We identified three genes with differential usage between males and females. While some of these differences could be random, resulting from multiple comparisons, the preferential use of TRBV6-5 in females has previously been observed in the peripheral TCR repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Notably, this gene is overrepresented in female lupus patients compared to their controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Further research is needed to validate this observation and then elucidate its significance.</p>
<p>Our most striking observation relates to significant sex-specific differences in specificities of CD8 T cells, with a biased CD8 selection process in the thymus favoring sequences associated with autoimmune diseases and bacterial antigens in females. The fact that this bias does not affect DP cells indicates that it is related to TCR selection rather than generation. Its relevance is strongly supported by the fact that (i) there is no such bias for other self-antigens that are not associated with autoimmunity and (ii) the bias affects both the effectors and regulators of autoimmunity with a directionality compatible with the increased prevalence of autoimmune disease in females. TCRs specific for autoimmunity related self-antigen are increased in the CD8 effector T cells while decreased in the CD4 Tregs. It is worth nothing that some bacterial antigens, but not viral antigens, are also affected by this bias. This could potentially be explained by the fact that bacterial antigens are expressing numerous mimotopes of self-antigens and are known to contribute to the shaping of the TCR repertoire. The observed bias towards bacterial antigens in female CD8 T cells could likewise provide more effector cells specific for bacterial antigens that are mimics of self-antigens, contributing to autoimmune disease development by molecular mimicry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). In this line, antigens linked to celiac disease (CeD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) are highly represented in the database and these two AIDs have been linked to bacterial components that may mimic self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Similarly, it is well-established that the gut microbiota influences thymic development of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Sexual hormones could influence this biased selection by affecting the composition of the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) and/or by affecting the selection of the TCRs specific for these antigens.</p>
<p>Finally, we have recently described polyspecific TCRs that can respond to multiple unrelated viral antigens and hypothesized their possible involvement in autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). We observed a tendency towards higher usage of polyspecific sequences in the CD8 SP repertoire of females, although not statistically significant. This may indicate a preferential cross-activation of CD8 T cells in females, potentially enhancing protection against pathogens as well as increasing the risk of heightened inflammatory reactivity and autoimmunity.</p>
<p>Conversely, the frequency of polyspecific TCR sequence usage was lower in female CD4 Tregs SP cells. This could limit CD4 Treg antigen coverage and be detrimental to prevent autoimmunity. However, little is known about polyspecific TCRs and these observations warrant further investigation.</p>
<p>To further evaluate the robustness of our findings, we performed additional analyses to assess whether donor age could confound the observed sex-specific differences. A potential limitation of our study is the relatively wide age range of donors. However, the absence of age-related clustering in repertoire features (data not shown), and the lack of age impact on CD8 and CD4 Treg bacterial-specific TRB usage and CD8 and CD4 Treg self-associated to autoimmune disease-specific TRB usage patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Figure 13</xref>), argue against age as a confounding factor. These results support an intrinsic sex bias in thymic TCR selection rather than an age-related effect.</p>
<p>While our findings provide valuable insights into sex-specific differences in thymic selection of TCR repertoires, our TCR specificity analyses were limited. Indeed, we only studied the TRB CDR3aa region of the TCR, which is the most critical for defining TCR specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) while both the TRA and the TRB chains contribute to TCR specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). This limitation is intrinsic to the limited number of TRA with assigned specificity in databases and to the fact that, given the nature of our studies, there is a need to study large repertoires, which is currently not feasible by single cell TCR sequencing. However, as methods for inferring specificity continue to evolve, they will likely allow more refined analyses of our dataset in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). In addition, the continuous development of the TCR database should enrich these analyses.</p>
<p>Altogether, our analyses of TCR specificity revealed a biased selection in females towards sequences associated with autoimmune diseases, potentially underlying the higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases in females. Future research should focus on validating these observations in larger datasets.</p>

For the sorted SP CD4, the Treg percentage varied between 5.8% and 16% across samples, with an average of 9.63%. Six SP CD4 samples were not sorted into Teffs and Tregs, we thus considered them as SP CD4 Teff by assuming a purity of Teff within the total SP CD4 around 90%.</p>
<p>RNA was isolated using the RNAqueous extraction kit (Invitrogen<sup>®</sup>), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA were quantified and sample integrity were determined on Nanodrop (ThermoFisher) or on Tapestation 4200 (Agilent, RNA screentape).</p>

<title>TCR library preparation and sequencing</title>
<p>TCR library preparation and sequencing were performed as described by Barennes et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Briefly, RNA was processed using the SMARTer Human TCR a/b profiling v1 kit (Takarabio) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Amplicons were purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), quantified, and their integrity assessed using 2100 Bioanalyzer System (Agilent, DNA 1000 kit) or Tapestation 4200 (Agilent, D1000 screentape). Bulk Next-Generation Sequencing was performed using either a Hiseq 2500 (Illumina) with SR-300 protocol plus 10% PhiX on the LIGAN-PM Genomics platform (Lille, France), or a Novaseq 6000 (Illumina) with PE-250 protocol plus 10% PhiX on the LIGAN-PM Genomics platform or ICM platform (Paris, France).</p>

<title>Data processing</title>
<p>Raw FASTQ/FASTA files were aligned to TRA and TRB using MiXCR (v3.0.13, RNA-seq parameters), which corrects for sequencing and PCR errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Samples with fewer than 1,000 CDR3aa sequences, an imbalanced TRA/TRB ratio (&lt;1/9), or a low sequence count relative to sorted cell counts (&lt; 0.9 ratio) were removed. Sequences with CDR3aa lengths outside 6-23 amino acids were also discarded. To standardize clonotype counts and unique number of clonotypes across sequencing techniques, initial counts for each clonotype were reduced by 1 to exclude those with counts of 0 (singletons).</p>
<p>Additionally, due to high similarity between certain TRBV sequences, which could bias the analysis depending on the sequencing method used, TRBV06-2 and TRBV06-3 were merged as TRBV06-2/3, and TRBV12-3 and TRBV12-4 were merged as TRBV12-3/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>).</p>

The usage of the V gene and the VJ gene combinations was investigated through dimensional reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (MASS package v7.3-60, factoMineR package v2.8, factoextra package v1.0.7). Confidence ellipses were represented with a 5% alpha risk. Additionally, for VJ gene combinations usage, a heatmap was constructed using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) distance to measure the distance between samples based on their gene usage distribution (complexHeatmap package v2.16.0, philentropy package v0.7.0). Hierarchical clustering was performed using the Euclidean distance and the complete linkage method.</p>

<title>Usage of amino acid in CDR3 region</title>
<p>For each CDR3aa sequence, alignment was performed following the IMGT convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). The aa usage is defined at different scales. Firstly, usage at the sequence level, within the CDR3 loop region (positions p108 to p114), involved in MHC-peptide complex interactions, assessed for CDR3aa sequences 9-21 aa long in both TRA and TRB chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). This aa usage was defined as the percentage of their representation within the sequence as follow:

</disp-formula>
Where 𝑛<sub>𝑎𝑎</sub> is the count of the specific amino acid within the sequence and <italic>L</italic> is the total length of the sequence.</p>
<p>Secondly, the CDR3aa usage is calculated at particular positions, the p109 and p110 in the repertoire of each individual. The usage of each aa 𝑎 at position 𝑝 is calculated as the proportion of CDR3 sequences in which 𝑎 appears at 𝑝 and can be defined as follow:

<title>Probability of generation analysis</title>
<p>The probability of generation analysis of DP and CD8 cell subtypes consisted initially in the creation of a generative model of V(D)J recombination using 400,000 randomly selected non-productive sequences from all samples for both TRA and TRB chains, with the IGOR tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Generation probabilities (Pgen) for all sequences in the dataset were then calculated using the OLGA tool, based on the respective generative models for each cell subtype and TCR chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Comparisons of Pgen values at the nucleotide level between males and females were performed. To ensure statistical robustness, control groups with equivalent male and female sample numbers were created by permuting the samples into two groups 20,000 times.</p>

<title>TCR network structure by sequence similarity</title>
<p>For each sample, 100 random sub-samplings of CDR3aa sequences were performed, using the minimum CDR3aa count per cell subtype. Two CDR3aa were connected if their Levenshtein distance was = 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Network analysis focused on two metrics: the proportion of connected sequences and network density, defined as the ratio of actual connections to all possible connections. Median values across 100 subsampling iterations were used for analysis. Levenshtein distances were computed with the stringdist package (v0.9.10), networks were visualized using Cytoscape (v3.8.2), and network density was calculated with igraph package (v1.5.1).</p>

<title>TRB CDR3aa motif search</title>
<p>Two types of structural motifs were searched: local motifs (strict sequential motifs) and global motifs (sequences with substitutions preserving a positive BLOSUM62 score) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Enriched motifs were selected using gliph2 function with turboGliph package (v0.99.2), with specific parameters defined as follow:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>-Input sequences were from the sex group of interest (male or female), with reference sequences matched for TRBV gene usage</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>-Only motifs constituted with strictly more than two unique CDR3aa are conserved</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>-No boost of local motif significance of Fisher test</p></list-item>

Additional filters were applied so that: (i) a motif includes public CDR3aa sequences (shared by at least two individuals), (ii) a significant enrichment (Fisher’s test, p &lt; 0.01) and (iii) a usage difference between groups of at least twofold (Wilcoxon test, p &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>Motif validation was performed on an publicly published pediatric thymic dataset from Arstila team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) consisting in a bulk TCR dataset from infants aged from seven days to eight months. Here, we removed one boy named “Thymus A” corresponding to a twin of the “Thymus B” and the “Thymus 1” neonate sample so that we analyze height samples with a male-to-female ratio of 5:3. Additional validation was carried out on sorted peripheral blood TCR repertoires (CD8, CD4 Teff and CD4 Treg) from seventy-five healthy volunteers aged from eighteen to eighty-four years (male-to-female ratio of 1.03:1), whose libraries were generated under the same conditions as those of our thymic dataset. They were recruited within the Transimmunom observational trial (NCT02466217) and HEALTHIL-2 (NCT03837093) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). PBMCs from healthy individuals were isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and enriched for CD4+ T cells via EasySep™ Human CD4+ T Cell magnetic beads (Stemcell). Further separation into effector T cells (CD4+ CD25-) and Tregs (CD4+ CD25+) was performed using EasySep™ Human Pan-CD25 magnetic beads (Stemcell). Purity was assessed by flow cytometry based on the expression of CD4 and FoxP3, with a purity threshold of &gt;80%. From the frozen PBMC aliquots, CD8+ T cells (CD3+ CD8+) were sorted using a FACS ARIA II cell sorter.</p>

<title>TRB CDR3aa specificity analysis</title>
<p>We established a curated and harmonized TCR specificity database by integrating data from three public TCR repositories: Mc-PAS, IEDB, and VDJdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Reliability levels for sequences and specificity assignments were added based on the identification methods used in the original studies, ensuring a robust dataset for specificity analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Specificity groups were categorized by antigen class, including viral, bacterial, yeast, parasitic and self-antigens linked to diseases (e.g. autoimmune conditions, cancer) or unrelated to diseases, as well as antigens from wheat, plants or animals.</p>
<p>This harmonized database was used to identify exact matches with the CDR3aa sequences of our TRB sequences. Enrichment of CDR3aa sequences associated with a given specificity group in male and female thymic repertoires for each cell subtype compared to the specificity distribution in the database was tested. Specificity group distributions between male and female samples were also performed, as was the overall usage of these sequences across the entire TCR repertoire.</p>
<p>Additionally, we focused on polyspecific sequences defined as CDR3aa TRB sequences recognizing at least two different species in case of microorganisms, or belonging to multiple specificity groups for other antigens. The same analyses as described above were conducted for these polyspecific sequences.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>For V-J gene usage, CDR3aa length usage, CDR3aa usage, network similarity and specificity analyses, the comparison between males and females were statistically analysed using the Wilcoxon test. The statistical tests were performed using ggpubr library (v0.6.0) in R. Significance was denoted by the number of asterisks from one to four, each representing respectively p ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.01, p ≤ 0.001, and p ≤ 0.0001. The comparisons of the Rényi curves and Pgen were evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The comparisons of the proportions of specific sequences in male and female relative to those in the specificity database were tested using the Wilcoxon test.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The goal of this paper was to determine whether the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire differs between a male and a female human. To address this, this group sequenced TCRs from double-positive and single-positive thymocytes in male and female humans of various ages. Such an analysis on sorted thymocyte subsets has not been performed in the past. The only comparable dataset is a pediatric thymocyte dataset where total thymocytes were sorted.</p>
<p>They report on participant ages and sexes, but not on ethnicity, race, nor provide information about HLA typing of individuals. Though the experiments themselves are heroic, they do represent a relatively small sampling of diverse humans. They observed no differences in TCRbeta or TCRalpha usage, combinational diversity, or differences in the length of the CDR3 region, or amino acid usage in the CD3aa region between males or females. Though they observed some TCRbeta CD3aa sequence motifs that differed between males and females, these findings could not be replicated using an external dataset and therefore were not generalizable to the human population.</p>
<p>They also compared TCRbeta sequences against those identified in the past using computational approaches to recognize cancer-, bacterial-, viral-, or autoimmune-antigens. They found very little overlap of their sequences with these annotated sequences (depending on the individual, ranging from 0.82-3.58% of sequences). Within the sequences that were in overlap, they found that certain sequences against autoimmune or bacterial antigens were significantly over-represented in female versus male CD8 SP cells. Since no other comparable dataset is available, they could not conclude whether this is a finding that is generalizable to the human population.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a novel dataset. Overall, the methodologies appear to be sound. There was an attempt to replicate their findings in cases where an appropriate dataset was available. I agree that there are no gross differences in TCR diversity between males and females.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the sample size is small given that it is an outbred population. The cleaner experiment would have been to study the impact of sex in a number of inbred MHC I/II identical mouse strains or in humans with HLA-identical backgrounds.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether there was consensus between the three databases they used regarding the antigens recognized by the TCR sequences. Given the very low overlap between the TCR sequences identified in these databases and their dataset, and the lack of replication, they should tone down their excitement about the CD8 T cell sequences recognizing autoimmune and bacterial antigens being over-represented in females.</p>
<p>The dataset could be valuable to the community.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study addresses the hypothesis that the strikingly higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases in women could be the result of biased thymic generation or selection of TCR repertoires. The biological question is important, and the hypothesis is valuable. Although the topic is conceptually interesting and the dataset is rich, the study has a number of major issues that require substantial improvement. In several instances, the authors conclude that there are no sex-associated differences for specific parameters, yet inspection of the data suggests visible trends that are not properly quantified. The authors should either apply more appropriate statistical approaches to test these trends or provide stronger evidence that the observed differences are not significant. In other analyses, the authors report the differences between sexes based on a pulled analysis of TCR sequences from all the donors, which could result in differences driven by one or two single donors (e.g., having particular HLA variants) rather than reflect sex-related differences.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The key strength of this work is the newly generated dataset of TCR repertoires from sorted thymocyte subsets (DP and SP populations). This approach enables the authors to distinguish between biases in TCR generation (DP) and thymic selection (SP). Bulk TCR sequencing allows deeper repertoire coverage than single-cell approaches, which is valuable here, although the absence of TRA-TRB pairing and HLA context limits the interpretability of antigen specificity analyses. Importantly, this dataset represents a valuable community resource and should be openly deposited rather than being &quot;available upon request.&quot;</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) The authors state that there is &quot;no clear separation in PCA for both TRA and TRB across all subsets.&quot; However, Figure 2 shows a visible separation for DP thymocytes (especially TRA, and to a lesser degree TRB) and also for TRA of Tregs. This apparent structure should be acknowledged and discussed rather than dismissed.</p>
<p>(2) Supplementary Figures 2-5 involve many comparisons, yet no correction for multiple testing appears to be applied. After appropriate correction, all the reported differences would likely lose significance. These analyses must be re-evaluated with proper multiple-testing correction, and apparent differences should be tested for reproducibility in an external dataset (for example, the pediatric thymus and peripheral blood repertoires later used for motif validation).</p>
<p>(3) Supplementary Figure 6 suggests that women consistently show higher Rényi entropies across all subsets. Although individual p-values are borderline, the consistent direction of change is notable. The authors should apply an integrated statistical test across subsets (for example, a mixed-effects model) to determine whether there is an overall significant trend toward higher diversity in females.</p>
<p>(4) Figures 4B and S8 clearly indicate enrichment of hydrophobic residues in female CDR3s for both TRA and TRB (excluding alanine, which is not strongly hydrophobic). Because CDR3 hydrophobicity has been linked to increased cross-reactivity and self-reactivity (see, e.g., Stadinski et al., Nat Immunol 2016), this observation is biologically meaningful and consistent with higher autoimmune susceptibility in females.</p>
<p>(5) The majority of &quot;hundreds of sex-specific motifs&quot; are probably donor-specific motifs confounded by HLA restriction. This interpretation is supported by the failure to validate motifs in external datasets (pediatric thymus, peripheral blood). The authors should restrict analysis to public motifs (shared across multiple donors) and report the number of donors contributing to each motif.</p>
<p>(6) When comparing TCRs to VDJdb or other databases, it is critical to consider HLA restriction. Only database matches corresponding to epitopes that can be presented by the donor's HLA should be counted. The authors must either perform HLA typing or explicitly discuss this limitation and how it affects their conclusions.</p>
<p>(7) Although the age distributions of male and female donors are similar, the key question is whether HLA alleles are similarly distributed. If women in the cohort happen to carry autoimmune-associated alleles more often, this alone could explain observed repertoire differences. HLA typing and HLA comparison between sexes are therefore essential.</p>
<p>(8) In some analyses (e.g., Figures 8C-D) data are shown per donor, while others (e.g., Fig. 8A-B) pool all sequences. This inconsistency is concerning. The apparent enrichment of autoimmune or bacterial specificities in females could be driven by one or two donors with particular HLAs. All analyses should display donor-level values, not pooled data.</p>
<p>(9) The reported enrichment of matches to certain specificities relative to the database composition is conceptually problematic. Because the reference database has an arbitrary distribution of epitopes, enrichment relative to it lacks biological meaning. HLA distribution in the studied patients and HLA restrictions of antigens in the database could be completely different, which could alone explain enrichment and depletions for particular specificities. Moreover, differences in Pgen distributions across epitopes can produce apparent enrichment artifacts. Exact matches typically correspond to high-Pgen &quot;public&quot; sequences; thus, the enrichment analysis may simply reflect variation in Pgen of specific TCRs (i.e., fraction of high-Pgen TCRs) across epitopes rather than true selection. Consequently, statements such as &quot;We observed a significant enrichment of unique TRB CDR3aa sequences specific to self-antigens&quot; should be removed.</p>
<p>(10) The overrepresentation of self-specific TCRs in females is the manuscript's most interesting finding, yet it is not described in detail. The authors should list the corresponding self-antigens, indicate which autoimmune diseases they relate to, and show per-donor distributions of these matches.</p>
<p>(11) The concept of polyspecificity is controversial. The authors should clearly explain how polyspecific TCRs were defined in this study and highlight that the experimental evidence supporting true polyspecificity is very limited (e.g., just a single TCR from Figure 5 from Quiniou et al.).</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>(1) Clarify why the Pgen model was used only for DP and CD8 subsets and not for others.</p>
<p>(2) The Methods section should define what a &quot;high sequence reliability score&quot; is and describe precisely how the &quot;harmonized&quot; database was constructed.</p>
<p>(3) The statement &quot;we generated 20,000 permuted mixed-sex groups&quot; is unclear. It is not evident how this permutation corrects for individual variation or sex bias. A more appropriate approach would be to train the Pgen model separately for each individual's nonproductive sequences (if the number of sequences is large enough).</p>
