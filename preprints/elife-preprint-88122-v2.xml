<title>Abstract</title><p>Viral inclusion bodies (IBs) commonly form during the replication of Ebola virus (EBOV) in infected cells, but their role in viral immune evasion has rarely been explored. Here, we found that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), but not TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) or IκB kinase epsilon (IKKε), was recruited and sequestered in viral IBs when the cells were infected by EBOV transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs). NP/VP35-induced IBs formation was critical for IRF3 recruitment and sequestration, probably through interaction with STING. Consequently, the association of TBK1 and IRF3, which plays a vital role in type I interferon (IFN-I) induction, was blocked by EBOV trVLPs infection. Additionally, IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation induced by Sendai virus (SeV) or poly(I:C) stimulation were suppressed by EBOV trVLPs. Furthermore, downregulation of STING significantly attenuated VP35-induced IRF3 accumulation in IBs. Coexpression of the viral proteins by which IBs-like structures formed was much more potent in antagonizing IFN-I than expression of the IFN-I antagonist VP35 alone. These results suggested a novel immune evasion mechanism by which EBOV evades host innate immunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ebola virus disease is the deadliest infectious disease caused by infection with Ebola virus (EBOV), an enveloped, nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Feldmann, Jones, Klenk, &amp; Schnittler, 2003</xref>). The 19-kb viral genome comprises seven genes encoding the nucleoprotein (NP), virion protein 35 (VP35), VP40, glycoprotein (GP), VP30, VP24 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mahanty &amp; Bray, 2004</xref>). Inclusion bodies (IBs) that form in EBOV-infected cells are specialized intracellular compartments that serve as sites for EBOV replication and the generation of progeny viral RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hoenen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Nanbo, Watanabe, Halfmann, &amp; Kawaoka, 2013</xref>). In IBs, the EBOV genome is replicated and transcribed by viral polymerase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Misasi &amp; Sullivan, 2014</xref>). VP35 serves as a cofactor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and contributes to viral replication by homo-oligomerization through a coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Reid, Cardenas, &amp; Basler, 2005</xref>) as well as through its phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which was recently discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">van Tol et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Innate interferon responses constitute the first lines of host defense against viral infection. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, play pivotal roles in the response to RNA virus infection. After the recognition of RNA virus infection, RIG-I is recruited to the mitochondrial antiviral adaptor protein (MAVS) through the caspase activation and recruitment domain. The activation of MAVS recruits multiple downstream signaling components to mitochondria, leading to the activation of inhibitor of κ-B kinase ε (IKKε) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which in turn phosphorylate IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Phosphorylated IRF3 forms a dimer that translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of type I interferon (IFN-I) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fitzgerald et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>To promote viral replication and persistence, viruses have evolved various strategies to evade or subvert host antiviral responses. For example, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) has developed a mechanism to evade host immune responses through the interaction between nonstructural proteins and IFN-I induction proteins, including TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lee &amp; Shin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), sequestering them inside SFTSV-induced cytoplasmic structures known as IBs. In addition to inhibiting IFN-I induction, SFTSV nonstructural proteins can hijack STAT1 and STAT2 in IBs to suppress IFN-I signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ning et al., 2015</xref>). These studies highlight the role of viral IBs as virus-built “jails” that sequester some crucial host factors and interfere with the corresponding cellular processes.</p>
<p>EBOV uses various approaches to evade the host immune response, including antagonizing IFN production, inhibiting IFN signaling, and enhancing IFN resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Basler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">McCarthy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Reid et al., 2006</xref>). VP35 is an IFN-I inhibitor that antagonizes host innate immunity by interacting with TBK1 and IKKε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Basler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Prins, Cardenas, &amp; Basler, 2009</xref>), suppressing RNA silencing and inhibiting dendritic cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Haasnoot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Yen, Mulder, Martinez, &amp; Basler, 2014</xref>). Here, we report that viral IBs in EBOV transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs)-infected cells appear to play a role in immune evasion by sequestering IRF3 into IBs and preventing the interaction of IRF3 with TBK1 and IKKε.</p>

<title>IRF3 is hijacked into cytoplasmic IBs in EBOV transcription and replication-competent virus-like particles infected cells</title>
<p>When HepG2 cells were infected with EBOV trVLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hoenen, Watt, Mora, &amp; Feldmann, 2014</xref>), which authentically model the complete virus life cycle, IBs with a unique structure and viral particles formed in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 – figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that a substantial percentage of endogenous IRF3 was trapped in viral IBs in EBOV trVLPs-infected cells with large IBs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), while no detectable TBK1 or IKKε, the essential upstream components of IRF3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fitzgerald et al., 2003</xref>), was sequestered in the viral IBs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-F</xref>). These results suggested that IRF3 was specifically compartmentalized in viral IBs, and this compartmentalization spatially isolated IRF3 from its upstream activators TBK1 and IKKε.</p>

<p>The sequestration of IRF3 in IBs was further investigated at different hours post infection (hpi) of EBOV trVLPs. Detectable IRF3 puncta colocalized with viral proteins were apparent at 36 hpi in infected cells and correlated significantly with the size and shape of the viral IBs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). As the size of IBs increased at 48 hpi, nearly all IRF3 colocalized with viral IBs, whereas the IRF3 distribution was completely different in the uninfected cells nearby (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Using a fluorophore line of interest analysis, we assessed the intensity profiles of cytoplasmic IRF3 intensity in IBs as well as the increase in the diameter of the aggregates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). As infection proceeded, the intensity of the IRF3 signal in the puncta increased as the level of cytoplasmic-dispersed IRF3 decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), indicating that the total amount of IRF3 in the cells did not dramatically change during infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>) and that only its subcellular localization changed. Taken together, the results above showed that IRF3, but not TBK1 or IKKε, was sequestered in viral IBs.</p>

<title>EBOV trVLPs infection attenuates the TBK1-IRF3 association and IRF3 nuclear translocation</title>
<p>Upon virus infection, IRF3, as a critical transcription factor in the IFN induction pathway, can be phosphorylated and activated by TBK1, and then phosphorylated IRF3 translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, eliciting the expression of antiviral IFNs. Given the sequestration of IRF3 by EBOV trVLPs in IBs, the TBK1-IRF3 association in EBOV trVLPs-infected cells was assessed by an <italic>in situ</italic> Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA). Cytoplasmic complexes consisting of endogenous TBK1 with IRF3 (the red signal) were observed in HepG2 cells treated with poly(I:C), which induces the activation of the RIG-I signal cascade and IRF3 phosphorylation, and poly(I:C)-induced TBK1: IRF3 complexes were significantly reduced by EBOV trVLPs infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Decreased TBK1-IRF3 association was further demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Moreover, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, Sendai virus (SeV) infection-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were significantly inhibited by EBOV trVLPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, 4B). Importantly, IRF3 was also recruited into IBs-like compartments in the cytoplasm in the cells infected with live EBOV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These data collectively suggested that the EBOV-mediated sequestration of IRF3 in IBs blocks IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in the TBK1-IRF3 signaling cascade, which is critical for IFN induction.</p>

<p>Ectopic expression of NP alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Noda, Watanabe, Sagara, &amp; Kawaoka, 2007</xref>) or NP and the VP35 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Noda, Kolesnikova, Becker, &amp; Kawaoka, 2011</xref>) in cells was sufficient to form IBs-like structures. To investigate the viral protein(s) involved in the sequestration of IRF3 in IBs, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding NP/VP35, NP/VP35/L, NP/VP35/L/VP30, NP/VP35/L/VP30/VP24, or NP/VP35/L/VP30/vRNA-RLuc/T7 and stained with anti-IRF3 and anti-NP at 48 hpi. Coexpression of NP and VP35 resulted in substantial sequestration of IRF3 in the IBs-like structure, which in turn resulted in a significant reduction of IRF3 in the nucleus, as observed in the cells transfected with vectors only and treated with poly(I:C) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Little if any VP35 or NP was demonstrated to interact with IRF3 by immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 – figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Compared to NP/VP35 coexpression, the presence of protein L, VP30 and VP24 showed little, if any, effects on IBs-like structure formation, IRF3 sequestration and nuclear IRF3 levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 – figure supplement 2A-B</xref>).

<title>Viral IBs-induced IRF3 sequestration suppresses IFN-<bold>β</bold> production</title>
<p>EBOV trVLPs could hijack IRF3 and sequester IRF3 into IBs and thus block the nuclear translocation of IRF3, which suggested that EBOV trVLPs may suppress IRF3-driven IFN-β production. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Basler et al., 2000</xref>), expression of VP35 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), but not NP, resulted in a mild inhibition of SeV-induced IFN-β-Luc expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Coexpression of VP35 and NP, which led to the formation of IBs and the sequestration of IRF3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), suppressed IFN-β-Luc expression much more potently than VP35 expression alone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Coexpression of NP/VP35/L/VP30 was more potent in the inhibition of SeV-induced IFN-β-Luc expression than NP/VP35 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Moreover, coexpression of NP/VP35/VP30/L almost completely suppressed poly(I:C)-induced IFN-β transcription (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). <italic>IRF3</italic> depletion showed little, if any, effect on IFN-β transcription upon NP/VP35/L/VP30 coexpression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 – figure supplement 1A</xref>), which suggested that NP/VP35/L/VP30 coexpression was similarly powerful as <italic>IRF3</italic> depletion in antagonizing IFN-β expression. In wild-type cells but not <italic>IRF3</italic>-depleted cells, the coexpression of NP/VP35/L/VP30 had a significantly greater ability to inhibit SeV-induced transcription of IFN-β downstream genes, such as CXCL10, ISG15 and ISG56, than VP35 expression alone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-F</xref>). These results strongly suggested that the sequestration of IRF3 in viral IBs was substantially more powerful than that upon VP35 expression.</p>

Compared with wild-type cells, <italic>IRF3</italic> depletion showed little, if any, effect on EBOV replication, as indicated by luciferase activity, suggesting that trVLPs efficiently blocked IRF3 signaling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, the overexpression of IRF3/5D (a phospho-mimic of activated IRF3), but not IRF3, inhibited EBOV trVLPs replication in <italic>IRF3</italic>-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that EBOV has established multiple ways to antagonize host innate immune responses to maintain viral replication. Several EBOV proteins (VP35, VP24, GP, VP30 and VP40) are known to participate in host immune evasion to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Audet &amp; Kobinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhattacharyya, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cantoni &amp; Rossman, 2018</xref>). VP35 was demonstrated to suppress IFN-I production by inhibiting IRF3/7 phosphorylation, disrupting DC maturation, and facilitating the escape of immune sensation by dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Basler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cardenas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Messaoudi, Amarasinghe, &amp; Basler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Prins et al., 2009</xref>). VP30 and VP40 suppress RNA silencing by interacting with Dicer and modulating RNA interference components via exosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fabozzi, Nabel, Dolan, &amp; Sullivan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pleet, DeMarino, Lepene, Aman, &amp; Kashanchi, 2017</xref>). VP24 and GP are also known to block IFN-I signaling by hiding MHC-1 on the cell surface and counteracting tetherin or interfering with established immune responses by adsorbing antibodies against GP, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Audet &amp; Kobinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhattacharyya, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Viral IBs are a characteristic of cellular EBOV infection and are important sites for viral RNA replication, and NP and VP35 are extremely critical proteins for the formation of IBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hoenen et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether viral IBs are involved in antagonizing IFN-I production during EBOV trVLPs infection has not yet been reported. Here, we found that IRF3 is hijacked and sequestered into EBOV IBs by viral infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), which demonstrates that viral IBs are utilized for IRF3 compartmentalization. Meanwhile, this compartmentalization resulted in the spatial isolation of IRF3 from the kinases TBK1 and IKKε (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). This suggests that IRF3 deprivation by viral IBs may antagonize host antiviral signaling by inhibiting IFN-I production signaling.</p>
<p>As expected, the expression of NP/VP35/VP30/L, which is involved in the composition of IBs, was significantly more antagonistic to SeV-induced IFN-β production than the expression of VP35 alone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). In addition, the expression of NP/VP35/VP30/L can significantly antagonize the promoting effect of poly(I:C) on IFN-β transcription, and IRF3 knockout could not further inhibit the transcription of IFN-β (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), which may be because viral hijacking of IRF3 into IBs nearly completely antagonized its function of promoting IFN-β production. In this study, the effect of poly(I:C) is consistent with the results obtained with SeV, which indicates that poly(I:C) may mainly activate the RLR signaling pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-F</xref>, the expression of NP/VP35/VP30/L significantly inhibited the ability of SeV to promote the transcription of IFN-β downstream genes (CXCL10, ISG15 and ISG56) but did not completely suppress the effect of SeV, which may be due to the low transfection rate of HeLa cells. Furthermore, the knockout of IRF3 in cells could not further promote EBOV and EBOV trVLPs replication compared with that observed in wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>), which may have been because IRF3 was hijacked into viral IBs and could not be phosphorylated into the nucleus to regulate IFN-I production. These results suggest that viral IBs act as virus-built ‘jails’ to imprison transcription factors and present a novel and possible common mechanism of viral immune evasion in which the critical signaling molecule IRF3 is spatially segregated from the antiviral kinases TBK1 and IKKε.</p>
<p>Although almost all IRF3 could be sequestered to viral IBs formed by VP35 and NP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), we found that neither VP35 nor NP interacted with IRF3 (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 – figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, we found that VP35 interacts with STING and colocalizes in IBs and that knockdown of STING inhibits the sequestration of IRF3 in IBs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-G</xref>). These results suggest that VP35 may hijack IRF3 into IBs through STING. However, whether other host proteins are involved in this process and the role of NP in the recruitment of IRF3 by VP35 remain unclear. In addition, we found that VP35 may hijack IRF3 into IBs via STING association (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-C</xref>); however, whether VP35 activates the STING-IRF3 pathway in a cGAS-independent manner by interacting with STING and the molecular mechanism remain to be further investigated.</p>
<p>In summary, EBOV VP35 sequesters IRF3 into viral IBs and inhibits the association of IRF3 with TBK1 and IKKε, preventing IRF3 from entering the nucleus and thereby inhibiting IFN-I production (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Therefore, this study reveals a new strategy by which EBOV escapes the innate immune response and provides new ideas for Ebola virus disease treatment.</p>

<p>The IFN-I production assay was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, HEK293 cells (1×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in a 24-well plate) were cotransfected with the indicated amount of pCAGGS-NP (62.5 ng)/pCAGGS-VP35 (62.5 ng)/pCAGGS-VP30 (37.5 ng)/pCAGGS-L (500 ng), 200 ng of the IFN-β reporter plasmid (Promega, USA) and 4 ng of <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase plasmid. An empty vector was used to ensure that each well contained the same plasmid concentration. After 24 h, the cells were treated with SeV (MOI=2) or 5 μg/ml poly(I:C) for 12 h, and the luciferase activity of the cell lysates was analyzed with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, E1960) using a GloMax 20/20 luminometer (Promega, USA). Values were obtained by normalizing the luciferase values to the Renilla values. Fold induction was determined by setting the results from the group transfected with vector without Flag-VP35 to a value of 1.</p>

<title>EBOV trVLPs assay</title>
<p>The replication of EBOV in the cells was evaluated with the minigenome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hoenen et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, producer cells (p0) were cotransfected with p4cis-vRNA-RLuc (250 ng) and pCAGGS-T7 (250 ng) for T7 RNA polymerase expression and 4 plasmids for EBOV protein expression (pCAGGS-NP (125 ng), pCAGGS-VP35 (125 ng), pCAGGS-VP30 (75 ng), and pCAGGS-L (1,000 ng)), as well as the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Promoter (Youbio, 25 ng). One day after transfection, the medium was replaced with medium containing 5% FBS, and the cells were then incubated for another 3 days. Viral replication was determined by intracellular luciferase activities using a dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, E1960) after cell lysis with passive lysis buffer (PLB, Promega). For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection.</p>

<title>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</title>
<p>HepG2 cells transfected with EBOV minigenome p0-related plasmids were washed with PBS, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and then prestained with osmium tetroxide. Eighty-nanometer-thick serial sections were then cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were acquired with a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, H-7650) operating at 80 kV.</p>

<title>EBOV infection assay</title>
<p>HepG2, HeLa or <italic>IRF3</italic>-depleted HeLa cells grown to ∼70% confluency in 12-well plates (for viral proliferation) or 12-well plates with a 18-mm coverslip (for immunofluorescence microscopy) were incubated with the EBOV Mayinga strain, which was tittered in Vero E6 cells, at 37°C for 1 h at the indicated MOI. Then, the cells were washed 3 times with PBS, and fresh medium was added to the cells, which were incubated at 37°C for 72 h (for microscopy) or the indicated times (0 days, 2 days, 4 days and 6 days; for the viral proliferation assay). Subsequently, the cells on the coverslip were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for immunofluorescent straining, and the supernatants were collected at the indicated times for viral titration following the requirements of the BSL-4 laboratory. The viral titers were determined by plaque formation assay. Briefly, 10-fold serially diluted samples (100 μl) were added to 96-well plates containing 1×10<sup>4</sup> Vero E6 cells per well and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Then, 100 μl of medium containing 2% FBS was added to each well. After incubation for 5–7 days at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator, the cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed, and the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>)/ml was calculated. All work with live EBOV was performed with BSL-4 containment.</p>

<p>This study explores how Ebola virus evades human immune responses. The study reports a potential new mechanism wherein Ebola virus traps human IRF3, a key transcription factor involved in immune signaling, into virus-produced &quot;inclusion bodies&quot;. The topic is <bold>important</bold>, the paper has many merits, and the biochemical assays are <bold>solid</bold>. However, the current data do not clearly explain the relationship between the VP35 protein and IRF3.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript &quot;Ebola Virus Sequesters IRF3 in Viral Inclusion bodies to Evade Host Antiviral Immunity &quot; by Lin Zhu et al, the authors elucidated an evasion mechanism by which EBOV evades host innate immunity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Using data from immunofluorescence analysis, TEM and Western Blot, the authors conclude that Ebola virus VP35 protein evades host antiviral immunity by interacting with STING to sequester IRF3 into IBs and inhibit type-I interferon production.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Similar mechanisms have already been found in other viruses, such as SFTSV, RSV and so on. In addition, the presented results are also relatively rough, and the mechanism explained is not deep enough, so this story is not innovative</p>

<p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Ebola Virus Sequesters IRF3 in Viral Inclusion Bodies to Evade Host Antiviral Immunity&quot; mainly describes that the function of IBs formed by the viral proteins VP35 and NP in evading host antiviral immunity. They proved that Ebola virus VP35 protein can interact with STING, but not IRF3, to sequester IRF3 into inclusion bodies and thereby inhibit type-I interferon production. This work will be of some interest to readers in the Ebola Virus field, however, the current data do not clearly explain the relationship of VP35 protein and IRF3.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors were trying to investigate whether viral IBs are involved in antagonizing IFN-I production during EBOV trVLPs infection. They found that IRF3 is hijacked and sequestered into EBOV IBs after viral infection, thereby leading to the spatial isolation of IRF3 with TBK1 and IKKε. In such a progress, the activity of IRF3 is suppressed and downstream IFN-I induction is inhibited. The authors designed many experiments, such as the PLA that examined the colocalization, to support their conclusions. However, necessary negative controls were missed in several assays. More key index is needed to be examined in several assays.</p>
<p>The paper is well organized and most data in this paper could support the conclusions, while there are several issues that need to be further solved.</p>
<p>1. In Figure 2-4, authors should examine the expression of downstream IFNs as well as the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of IRF3 to further prove the suppression of IRF3 activity by infecting with trVLPs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The inhibitory effect of trVLPs infection on the phosphorylation of IRF3 S396 and SeV-induced IRF3 nuclear localization was determined by immunoprecipitation (Figure 3D) and immunofluorescence (Figure 4A and 4B), respectively. In addition, we demonstrated that IFN-β transcription was inhibited more potently by EBOV viral inclusion bodies compared with VP35 alone (Figure 7B and 7C).</p>
<p>Moreover, EBOV viral inclusion bodies were demonstrated to inhibit the transcription of IFN downstream genes (e.g., CXCL10, ISG15 and ISG56) more potently than VP35 alone (new Figure 7D-F).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Figure 5, to better prove the conclusion that EBOV NP and VP35 play an important role in sequestering IRF3 in IBS, authors should add the &quot;NP+VP35+VP30&quot; and &quot;NP+VP35+VP24&quot; groups to reperform the assay.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, VP24 or VP30 was added to the “VP35+NP” group, and the results showed that the “NP+VP35+VP24” and “NP+VP35+VP30” groups exhibited little, if any, effect on the distribution of IRF3 compared with the “NP+VP35” group (new Figure 5 - figure supplement 2A-B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Figure 6f, the expression of STING should be examined by immunostaining to show the knockdown efficiency in trVLPs-infected cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: As suggested by the reviewer, immunostaining was performed to visually detect the effect of STING knockdown on the IRF3 distribution during trVLPs infection (new Figure 6F).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Zhu et al explored molecular mechanisms by which Ebola virus (EBOV) evades host innate immune response. EBOV has a number of means to shut down the type I interferon induction (by viral VP35 protein) and block type I interferon action (by viral VP24 protein). This study reported a new mechanism that inclusion body (IB) used for viral replication sequesters IRF3, a key transcription factor involved in the interferon signaling, resulting in blockade of downstream type I interferon gene transcription. This finding is potentially interesting and may provide a new insight into EBOV's evasion of innate immunity. However, there are some flaws in the experimentations and analyses that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>1. Most of experiments were performed by transfection of trVLP plasmids, which is very different from virus infection. The conclusions should be examined and verified in the context of virus infection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: As suggested by the reviewer, the effects of IRF3 depletion on live Ebola virus replication were examined as described in the revised manuscript. Consistent with the results obtained after trVLPs infection, IRF3 depletion exerted little, if any, effect on viral replication (new Figure 7H), which supports the notion that, upon EBOV infection and the formation of inclusion bodies, IRF3 has little, if any, transcription activation activity after sequestration by inclusion bodies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Fig 1 - VP35 displayed a classical IB staining only in Panel A, while much less so in Panel C and not in panel B. It seemed that the VP35 staining images were chosen in a way towards the authors' favor. The statistical analysis of co-localization of VP35 and IRF3, TBK1 or IKKe should be performed to draw the conclusion. Another concern is that IKKe is normally lowly expressed under a rest condition and becomes induced only when the interferon signaling is activated. It seemed to be expressed at a high level even when the interferon signaling is blocked in Panel C. The authors should comment on this discrepancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Ebola virus inclusion bodies show variations in both shape and size. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the colocalization of TBK1 or IKKε and VP35 is shown in new figures (new Figure 1C and 1E), and quantitatively analyzed by the fluorescence intensity using ImageJ software (new Figure 1B, 1D and 1F).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Fig 2 - Was this experiment done by transfection or infection? The description of result is not consistent with the figure legend. The labeling was also not consistent between panel A and B. I would suggest performing Western blot to analyze the expression level of IRF3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We apologize for the incorrect description of the data. Ebola virus trVLPs were initially produced based on transfection but also involved the viral infection process. The use of “transfection” in the figure and figure legends has been changed to “infection” in the revised manuscript.
As suggested by the reviewer, Western blotting was performed to analyze the IRF3 expression levels at different time points after trVLPs infection (new Figure 2D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Fig 3 and 4 - As VP35 is well known for its highly efficient blockade of type I interferon activation, how would the authors differentiate the effect of VP35 alone from the sequestration of IRF3 in IBs in these experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Previous studies have found that VP35, rather than NP, inhibits the expression of interferon, and the “VP35+NP” treatment, which induces IRF3 sequestration, showed inhibited IFN-β luciferase activity much more potently than VP35 expression alone (Figure 7B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Fig 3 - PolyIC can activate both RLR and TLR signaling pathways. Can the author comment on which pathway it activates in this experiment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: In this study, the effect of poly(I:C) was consistent with the results observed with SeV, which indicated that poly(I:C) may mainly activate the RLR signaling pathway. A discussion was added to the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors demonstrated that VP35 interacts with STING and recruit the latter to IBs. How would this affect the function of STING given that STING plays essential roles in cGAS/cGAMP pathway?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: This study unexpectedly showed that VP35 can recruit IRF3 into viral inclusion bodies through STING, but whether it regulates the cGAS-STING pathway remains to be further investigated. Related discussion was added to the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. It is difficult to follow the logics of Fig 7. The expression level of each viral protein should be determined. Ideally, a mutation in VP35 that disrupts its ability to antagonize the interferon signaling but still allows for the IB formation can be used to assess the relative contribution of IB sequestering IRF3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: As suggested by the reviewer, a series of VP35 mutants were constructed, but we failed to obtain a VP35 mutant that contains a mutation that disrupts the ability of the protein to antagonize interferon signaling but still allows IB formation. Instead, coexpression of “NP+VP35+VP30+L”, which induces IBs formation, inhibited IFN-I more potently than the expression of VP35 alone (Figure 7B). IRF3 knockout inhibited poly(I:C)-induced IFN-I production but had little, if any, effect on poly(I:C)-induced IFN-I production in the “NP+VP35+VP30+L” group (Figure 7C). IRF3 knockout in the cells did not significantly affect viral replication, but overexpression of activated IRF3 (IRF3/5D), instead of wild-type IRF3, inhibited viral replication (new Figure 7G-H). These results collectively suggested that almost all IRF3 in cells was hijacked and sequestered into IBs in the Ebola virus-infected cells.</p>
