<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The incidence of post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction (PAMD) is high, and there is currently no effective treatment available. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of exogenous mitochondrial transplantation. Exogenous mitochondrial transplantation can enhance myocardial function and improve the survival rate. Mechanistic studies suggest that mitochondrial transplantation can limit impairment in mitochondrial morphology, augment the activity of mitochondrial complexes II and IV, and raise ATP levels. As well, mitochondrial therapy ameliorated oxidative stress imbalance, reduced myocardial injury, and thus improved PAMD after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiac arrest (CA) is a life-threatening event that is followed by post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction (PAMD) after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). PAMD exhibits degrees of systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The heart requires up to 30 kg of ATP daily to maintain systolic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Hall, et al., 2014</xref>). Due to the high energy requirements of the myocardium, mitochondria make up approximately one-third of the volume of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Cao, et al., 2023</xref>). The occurrence of PAMD is associated with mitochondrial damage with increased mitochondrial volume, accumulation of calcium ions, a diminution in complex activity, and a decrease in phosphate synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Huang, et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McCully, et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Su, et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Tsai, et al., 2021</xref>). Myocardium, as a high energy-consuming tissue, is very susceptible to energy depletion due to mitochondrial dysfunction. After mitochondrial injury, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium overload prevents full relaxation of cardiomyocytes and can release cytochrome C to activate mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. This process contributes to the development of PAMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Gazmuri and Radhakrishnan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Su, et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, maintaining cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) could be useful for cell survival and tissue homeostasis.</p>
<p>Transplantation of mitochondria isolated from non-ischemic or allogeneic tissues promoted myocardial recovery after regional ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">McCully, et al., 2009</xref>). Although the safety and efficacy of this approach have been verified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ali, et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Jia, et al., 2022</xref>), effectiveness of mitochondrial transplantation in treating myocardial injury following cardiac arrest remains to be demonstrated. Herein, we performed mitochondrial transplantation in rats following CPR to observe its effects on cardiac function and prognosis and explored its potential mechanism of action.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PRMD is a common complication following resuscitated. It is characterized by systolic and diastolic insufficiency, arrhythmias, and recurrent cardiac arrest. Circulatory dysfunction occurs in approximately two-thirds of cardiac arrest subjects is associated with a poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Han and Lee, 2022</xref>). Unlike myocardial depression caused by regional ischemia characterized by localized ventricular wall-motion abnormalities, myocardial depression caused by PAMD after CA manifest as global left ventricular systolic dysfunction accompanied by reduced ejection fraction, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and right ventricular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Lazzarin, et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Xu, et al., 2008</xref>). Of these, global left ventricular systolic dysfunction is the most significant manifestation.</p>
<p>In the present study, we test the hypothesis that administration of exogenous mitochondrial is cardioprotective effects after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The rationale was to enhance the energy-dependent contractility of the myocardium. Mitochondria from non-ischemic gastrocnemius muscle of health donor animals were isolated and a manner that maximized their healing potential. Of import, uptake of the delivered mitochondria occurred in the heart and myocytes, perhaps via micropinocytosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kami and Gojo, 2020</xref>). AS well, mitochondrial internalization occurred through actin-dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Pacak, et al., 2015</xref>). Internalized mitochondria promote degradation of resident via lysosomes to maintain an energy mitochondrial balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Jia, et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Liu, et al., 2022</xref>). Internalized mitochondria facilitated respiratory restoration in recipient cells with depleted mtDNA, and improved cellular function by increasing ATP levels and oxygen-consumption rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Pacak, et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<p>Contrary to expectations, increased numbers of mitochondria were not found in the hearts of treated animals. Possibly CPR caused ischemia/reperfusion injury to organs throughout the body, with non-specific distribution and uptake of the delivered mitochondria. The results of our study are consistent with other date that the energy metabolism of myocardial mitochondria improved after mitochondrial transplantation along with increased complex activity and ATP content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Jia, et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Pacak, et al., 2015</xref>). Not surprisingly, mitochondrial transplantation is being pursued as a therapeutic strategy in part to effects coronary patency, autoimmunity, and arrhythmia attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Masuzawa, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Shin, et al., 2019</xref>). The clinical application of mitochondrial transplantation can enhance the prognosis of pediatric patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following cardiac surgery, the improvement of cardiac function in patients helps them successfully wean off ECMO support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Emani and McCully, 2018</xref>). It is worth noting that the method of mitochondrial isolation may better meet the needs of clinical settings where an interventional time below 60 min is desired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ali, et al., 2021</xref>). After the isolation, mitochondria can be immediately used for transfer and internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ali, et al., 2021</xref>). Still concerns regarding mitochondrial hemocompatibility and stability in serum have been raised. In this line, serum calcium did not adversely impact isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Maleki, et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>ROS is generated with ischemia and then targets the normal physiologic functions of cells by damaging the structures of proteins, lipids, and even DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Zhu, et al., 2024</xref>). As well, oxidative stress promotes cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury and was implicated in pro-inflammatory responses and apoptosis, both of which worsen myocardial cell injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Patel and Karch, 2020</xref>). In a regional ischemia-reperfusion model, mitochondrial transplantation reduced oxidative stress in cells following reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Zhang, et al., 2019</xref>). Similaerly, in the present study, mitochondrial transplantation decreased the levels of myocardial oxidative markers and increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes after four hours of ROSC.</p>
<p>Ischemia/reperfusion injury of myocardial tissue releases CK-MB and cTn-I, commonly used indicators of early myocardial injury in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Zhang, et al., 2021</xref>). Although the concentrations of CK-MB and cTn-I rose significantly four hours after resuscitation in the CA-CPR model, mitochondrial transplantation significantly reduced this effect. During ischemia, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential leads to mitochondrial swelling and the release of cytochrome C followed by caspase-mediated cell death during reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lu, et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Milliken, et al., 2022</xref>). Apoptosis is the process by which cardiomyocytes die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kunapuli, et al., 2006</xref>). Increase apoptosis was found in rats after CA-CPR along with increased caspase-3 expression after resuscitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Wu, et al., 2021</xref>). Similar results were reported in pigs that underwent CA-CPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Wang, et al., 2023</xref>). We found that the level of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes increased significantly after CPR whereas administration of healthy mitochondria significantly reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Exogenous mitochondrial transplantation significantly reduced the disordering of myocardial fiber arrangement and inflammatory cell infiltration.</p>
<p>In conclusion, exogenous mitochondrial transplantation improved cardiac function after CPR. The specific mechanism involved may be related to the improvement in mitochondrial function, thus reducing the oxidative-stress response and apoptosis of myocardial cells. These dates suggest possible advantage in mitochondrial transplantation following cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Hemodynamic observation was carried out only for four hours after cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Thus, the impact of mitochondrial transplantation on long-term cardiac function following cardiopulmonary resuscitation could not be assessed. In this study, the animal model consisted of healthy rats. However, in clinical practice, CA is primarily caused by cardiac issues. Healthy rats tend to exhibit higher recovery ability after CA, which may lead to an overestimation of the therapeutic effects of mitochondrial transplantation. In our next phase, we plan to utilize various cardiac arrest models in conducting comprehensive studies to validate the effectiveness of mitochondrial transplantation in different pathological models.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>The experimental protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>) was approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of the General Hospital of Central Theater Command (No.2023017) and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals published by the National Institutes of Health, USA (NIH Publication No. 5377-3, 1996). Adult male SD (7 to 8 weeks old) rats weighing 250 to 350g were purchased from Hunan Silaidajing Experimental Animal Co., Ltd. (No. 430727231102711675, Changsha, China). Male rats were selected to avoid estrous cycle interference. Animals were housed in standard cages with a 12-hour light-dark cycle at a room temperature 22°C.</p>
<p>Animals were randomly assigned to four groups using the random number table method: a sham group, NS group, Vehicle group, and Mito group (n=17 per group). Each group was further divided into two survival-analysis subgroups: a four-hour group (n=7) and a 72-hour group (n=10). Rats in the NS, Vehicle and Mito groups underwent cardiac arrest induced by asphyxia and CPR, while rats in the sham group underwent tracheal intubation and arteriovenous puncture only, without CA and CPR.</p>

<title>Experimental protocol</title>
<sec id="s4b1">
<title>CA-CPR model</title>
<p>Establishment of the CA-CPR model was as published previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Huang, et al., 2020</xref>). Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (45 mg/kg) i.p. A 16-G intravenous catheter was used for endotracheal intubation. The left femoral artery and the right femoral vein were subsequently connected using a 24-G venous indwelling needle for dynamic blood pressure detection and venous-access establishment. Blood pressure, heart rate, and rectal temperature were monitored using the ALC-MPA monitoring system (Alcott Biotech, Shanghai, China). After 10 minutes of mechanical ventilation, asphyxia-mediated cardiac arrest was induced by blocking the tracheal tube. CA was defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure to 25 mmHg. Five minutes after CA, external chest compression (200 bpm) and mechanical ventilation (tidal volume, 0.60 ml/100 g, respiratory rate, 80 bpm) were initiated, and epinephrine (40 mcg/kg) was administered intravenously. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was defined as the spontaneous restoration of sinus rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of &gt;60 mmHg that was maintained for 10 minutes. Subsequently, corresponding treatments were administered. Animals that did not regain autonomic circulation within five minutes were excluded from the study. After ROSC, hemodynamics and echocardiograms were recorded for 4 hours. Basal body temperature was maintained at 37°C throughout the intervention. Pentobarbital sodium (10 mg/kg) was given if animals urinated or showed increased limb-muscle tension. Twenty-eight animals of four-hour group completed the full protocol and were humanely euthanized with excess pentobarbital sodium 4 hours after ROSC. Myocardial tissue and blood samples were collected for detection. The remaining 40 animals of 72-hour group were monitored for 72-hour to track survival.</p>

<sec id="s4b2">
<title>Intervention measures</title>
<p>Ten minutes after ROSC, 0.5 ml of saline, 0.5 ml of respiration buffer, and 0.5 ml of 1×10<sup>9</sup>/mL mitochondrial suspension were injected through the femoral vein in the NS, Vehicle, and Mito groups, The Sham group received 0.5 ml of saline at 30 minutes postoperatively.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Echocardiography</title>
<p>To assess myocardial function, an ultra-high resolution, small-animal ultrasound imaging system (SigmaVET, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) was used to capture M-mode echocardiographic images at the parasternal long axis and/or parasternal short axis near the papillary muscle at 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-hours post-ROSC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Survival analysis</title>
<p>In the 72-hour survival study cohort, the catheters were extracted four hours post-ROSC, and the surgical incisions were closed. Animals were placed back in their cages and administered subcutaneous injections of 0.5ml of 1% lidocaine for analgesia. Animals were monitored every 2 hours during the initial 24 hours following ROSC, and then at 48 and 72 hours. Animals that exhibited signs such as wheezing or a respiratory rate below five breaths per minute were deemed moribund and humanely euthanized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Su, et al., 2021</xref>). At the end of the time rats were euthanized.</p>

<title>Statistics and data analysis</title>
<p>IBM SPSS Statistics software (V26.0, IBM Corp, New York, USA) was used for data analysis. All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (Mean ± SD). Sample size for the four-hour group was calculated as published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Dell, et al., 2002</xref>). The ejection fraction of the first three surviving rats among the groups was measured. The population standard deviation of the variable is 11.34. With a magnitude of difference set at 15, an error rate of 0.1, and a power of 80%, the smallest acceptable sample size was determined to be five animals. Considering an animal loss of approximately 20% after four hours of CPR, seven animals were selected for each group. The sample size for the 72-hour group was calculated using StatBox (StatBox-Open 0.1.0; Cloud Powered Clinical Trial, Hebei, China). Set the survival rate at 20% for survival rate 1 and 80% for survival rate 2 (with power = 0.8 and α = 0.05). Accordingly, 10 was the smallest acceptable animal sample size. The comparison of time-based measurements was evaluated using repeated-measures tow-way ANOVA, with groups as the between-subjects factor and time as the within-subjects factor. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple-comparison test were employed to compare multiple groups. Survival was characterized using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis test.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors investigate the effect of mitochondrial transplantation on post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction (PAMD), which is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The authors demonstrate that mitochondrial transplantation enhances cardiac function and increases survival rates after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Mechanistically, they found that myocardial tissues with transplanted mitochondria exhibit increased mitochondrial complex activity, higher ATP levels, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and lower myocardial oxidative stress post-ROSC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that mitochondrial transplantation can improve myocardial recovery after regional ischemia, but its potential for treating myocardial injury following cardiac arrest has not been tested yet. Therefore, the findings are somewhat novel. Remarkably, the increased survival in mitochondria treated group post-ROSC is very promising and highlights its translational potential.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The organization of the paper, along with the analysis and interpretation of the results, requires significant revision.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors address an important question in cardiovascular science that is very topical. The use of exogenous mitochondrial transplantation is assessed after cardiac arrest to determine if these exogenous mitochondria can enhance cardiac function. Given the role of mitochondria in the energy expenditure of the heart, this is an important question to study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength lies mainly in the hypothesis being addressed as it is highly relevant in the quest for more strategies to enhance cardiac function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is further refinement needed in experimental details and transparency. Also, additional experiments need to be performed such as the seahorse experiment for oxygen consumption. Improvements in the text and in figures are needed and these comments are directed to the authors in our recommendations to the authors.</p>

<p>In this manuscript titled &quot;Transplantation of exogenous mitochondria mitigates myocardial dysfunction after cardiac arrest&quot;, Zhen Wang et al. report that exogenous mitochondrial transplantation can enhance myocardial function and survival rates. It limits mitochondrial morphology impairment, boosts complexes II and IV activity, and increases ATP levels. Additionally, mitochondrial therapy reduces oxidative stress, lessens myocardial injury, and improves PAMD after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The results of this manuscript clearly demonstrate that mitochondrial transplantation can effectively improve PAMD after cardiopulmonary resuscitation, highlighting its significant scientific and clinical value. The findings shown in this manuscript are interesting to the readers. However, further experiments are needed to confirm this conclusion. In addition, the results should be rewritten to describe and discuss the relevant data in detail.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) Can isolated mitochondria be transported to cultured cardiomyocytes, such as H9C2 cells, in vitro?</p>
<p>(2) The description of results in the manuscript is too simple. It lacks detail on the rationale behind the experiments and the significance of the data.</p>
<p>(3) The authors demonstrate that mitochondrial transplantation reduces cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Therefore, Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related caspases could be provided for further confirmation.</p>
<p>(4) Do donor mitochondria fuse with recipient mitochondria? Relevant experiments and data should be provided to address this question.</p>
<p>(5) In Figure 5A, the histograms are not labeled with the specific experimental groups.</p>
