<title>Abstract</title><p>Sensory information is represented by small varying neuronal ensembles in sensory cortices. In the auditory cortex (AC) repeated presentations of the same sound activate differing ensembles indicating high trial-by trial variability in activity even though the sounds activate the same percept. Efficient processing of complex acoustic signals requires that these sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles actively interact in order to provide a constant percept. Thus, the differing ensembles might interact to process the incoming sound inputs. Here, we probe interactions within and across ensembles by combining <italic>in vivo</italic> 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and holographic optogenetic stimulation to study how increased activity of single cells level affects the cortical network. We stimulated a small number of neurons sharing the same frequency preference alongside the presentation of a target pure tone, further increasing their tone-evoked activity. We found that other non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity when the frequency of the presented pure tone matched to their tuning property, while non co-tuned neurons were unaffected. Activity decrease was greater for non-stimulated co-tuned neurons with higher frequency selectivity. Co-tuned and non co-tuned neurons were spatially intermingled. Our results shows that co-tuned ensembles communicated and balanced their total activity across the larger network. The rebalanced network activity due to external stimulation remained constant. These effects suggest that co-tuned ensembles in AC interact and rapidly rebalance their activity to maintain encoding network dynamics, and that the rebalanced network is persistent.</p>

We speculate the sustained changes observed in the post-stimulation condition are the result of homeostatic mechanisms.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sensory perception requires fast encoding of relevant stimuli from a mixture of complex signals. Sensory cortices play a vital role in such sensory processing. In the auditory domain, for example, small neuronal ensembles in the auditory cortex (AC) are actively engaged to efficiently perceive relevant acoustic information <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The AC contains multiple ensembles of neurons that can be functionally identified, e.g., those formed by subsets of neurons preferring the same frequency also referred to as co-tuned neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Repeated presentation of the same acoustic stimulus, e.g., a tone of the same frequency leads to a stable percept, but in the AC different ensembles of neurons are activated together at each repeat indicating a high trial-by-trial variability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Activation of these different subsets of co-tuned neurons at each presentation of a stimulus reflects a sparse encoding of sound stimuli. Such sparse representation of co-activated neurons enables efficient coding with reduced metabolic energy to process complex information <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The sparse neuronal representation raises key questions of how activation of different ensembles leads to the same percept and how the overall activity within the cortical network is balanced across ensembles of co-tuned neurons. In particular, when a specific sound is present, a subset of co-tuned neurons will be activated, but not all co-tuned neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Given that the percept of a repeating stimulus is constant, we speculated that neural activity is balanced across co-tuned as well as non co-tuned ensembles. While neuronal ensembles constantly update their activities based on incoming information, how the activation of a particular sparse neuronal ensemble affects other neurons within the network to maintain the overall network balance for processing specific sensory information <italic>in vivo</italic> is largely unknown. <italic>In vivo</italic> optogenetic stimulation studies in the visual cortex (VC) suggested that inhibitory processes play a role in balancing network activity. In particular, <italic>in vivo</italic> single-cell holographic stimulation on a group of target cells, which induced increased response amplitude, resulted in changes in the response amplitudes of neighboring non-target neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, with similarly tuned neurons’ activity being suppressed. Moreover, <italic>in vivo</italic> holographic optogenetic stimulation showed that visually-suppressed neurons had attenuated response amplitudes when holographic stimulation was given along with the visual stimulus presentation, which was not observed in visually activated neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This suggested that neurons exhibit supralinear-to-linear input-output (IO) functions <italic>in vivo</italic>, rather than threshold-linear IO functions observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. These studies suggest that inhibitory influence from additional neuronal activation in the VC seems to play a major role during <italic>in vivo</italic> sensory processing, likely to maintain the activity balance of the network by modulating activities of neighboring neurons that share a similar tuning property.</p>
<p>One major difference between VC and AC is that the frequency tuning of neurons in the AC is less spatially localized, especially in a superficial layer (Layer 2/3) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The local frequency preferences in the AC are diverse, thus neighboring neurons can show widely differing tuning properties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. To test how activity in specific AC cells among an intermingled and spatially distributed co-tuned and non co-tuned cell population is balanced during auditory processing, we stimulated a small group of AC cells using <italic>in vivo</italic> holographic optogenetic stimulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> while imaging AC population activity using 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in awake mice. We further tested whether any activity changes induced by holographic stimulation persist, as recurrent cortical networks engage homeostatic plasticity to stabilize overall network activity levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Stimulating small ensembles of co-tuned neurons together with the presentation of a pure tone in their preferred frequency increased their tone-evoked activity. Furthermore, we observed that non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity. Non co-tuned ensembles did not exhibit such changes in tone-evoked responses, regardless of the pure tone frequency. Thus, the increased activity in the stimulation-targeted ensemble had caused a decrease in activity in the non-stimulated co-tuned ensembles, specifically when the stimulation-paired pure tone was their preferred frequency. Non-target co-tuned neurons exhibiting such effects were not necessarily neighboring the targeted cells, suggesting specific interactions between co-tuned but not co-located neurons. Lastly, the decreased activity in the non-stimulated co-tuned ensembles persisted in the subsequent imaging session, even in the absence of holographic stimulation. These results suggest that co-tuned ensembles form interacting overall networks that balance their activity.</p>

<title>Optogenetic holographic stimulation increases activity in small ensembles <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To sparsely manipulate neuronal ensembles, we used <italic>in vivo</italic> holographic stimulation. To achieve reliable and selective <italic>in vivo</italic> holographic optogenetic stimulation of small ensembles of neurons with single cell precision, we generated an AAV co-expressing the red-shifted opsin rsChRmine and GCaMP8s (AAV9-hSyn-GCaMP8s-T2A-rsChRmine), as rsChRmine minimizes the optical cross talk reducing a possible activation from the imaging laser (940 nm excitation wavelength) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Injecting AAV9-hSyn-GCaMP8s-T2A-rsChRmine into AC yielded cells expressing both GCaMP and opsin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We first tested the efficiency and reliability holographic stimulation, by targeting either a single cell or a small ensemble of five cells. For single cell stimulation, we varied the stimulation point from the target cell position by 10, 20, and 30 μm along either the x-axis or y-axis of the fields of view (FOV; n = 15 cells, 3 animals). This results in a rapid decay of response amplitudes to stimulation by the distance shift from the original cell position, confirming reliable holographic stimulation at the single-cell level (∼15 μm diameter) (mixed-effect model, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the stimulation effect of target cells was specific to the targeted z-plane, showing no stimulation effect when the stimulation z-plane was off by 20 μm (Fig. S2). For 5-cell stimulation, a majority of cells reliably responded to photo-stimulated <italic>in vivo</italic> (5 mW/cell, 15 μm spiral, 30 revolutions, 6 s inter-stimulus interval (ISI), 5 trials) and exhibited robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1CD</xref>; permutation test, all <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), comparable with responses to other opsins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>in vivo</italic> holographic stimulation enables precise targeting and activation of groups of single neurons in AC.</p>

<title>Optogenetic holographic stimulation increases sound evoked activity in A1 ensembles</title>
<p>Since repeated sound stimulation activates different ensembles while resulting in the same percept, we reasoned that ensembles interacted and speculated that increased activity in one ensemble would prevent or reduce activity in co-tuned ensembles. We thus next sought to investigate how increased neural activity in small co-tuned ensembles during sound presentation affected sound-evoked responses in targeted and non-target co-tuned and non co-tuned ensembles. To achieve this, we first needed to identify the tuning properties of single neurons and then target a subset of co-tuned neurons for stimulation. To study how the increased activity of a small number of neurons influences the activity of other neurons according to their frequency tuning properties, we designed an experimental paradigm comprising four sequential imaging sessions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>):</p>
<p><underline>First</underline>, in the cell selection session (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), we identified tuned ensembles in primary auditory cortex (A1) layer 2/3 (L2/3) by assessing frequency tuning properties of neurons within the FOVs covering 550 μm<sup>2</sup> (total cells = 7344, sound responsive cells = 1331, FOVs = 23; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We presented pure tones of three different frequencies spanning the hearing range of the mouse (4 kHz, 16 kHz, and 54 kHz, 100 ms duration, 2 sec. ISIs, 10 repeats for each frequency). We chose 16 kHz and 54 kHz as the representative target ensemble tone frequencies, as 16 kHz is within the most sensitive frequency range of mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and 54 kHz is within the range of mouse ultrasonic vocalization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. By selecting target ensembles in two different frequencies, we ensured that effects of stimulation were not specific to one particular population. For each condition (16 kHz or 54 kHz target ensemble for stimulation), we selected 5 target cells to stimulate. To ensure that all cells in the ensemble were selective for the target tone, we chose the most responsive cells in each condition. Thus, for the 16 kHz target ensemble condition, we selected five cells (<italic>target cells</italic>) among the top 30% most responsive cells to the 16 kHz tone. Similarly, for the 54 kHz target ensemble condition, we selected five of the top 30% most 54 kHz tone responsive cells. By selecting target cells sharing the same frequency preference, we aimed at investigating how activity changes from co-tuned neuronal ensembles alter the processing of the target frequency in other co-tuned and non co-tuned cells.</p>
<p><underline>Second</underline>, in the baseline session (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), we determined the sound-evoked responses of all imaged cells by presenting a series of 16 kHz and 54 kHz pure tones in a random order (100 ms duration, 5.8-6.5 sec. ISI; baseline session, 30 repeats for each frequency). Exemplar responses of cells from a 16 kHz and a 54 kHz ensemble are shown as black traces in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p><underline>Third</underline>, in the stimulation session (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), we examined how all sound-responsive cells change their responses when a small group of cells in the network increases their activity. We presented the same tones (16 kHz and 54 kHz in a random order), in tandem with the optogenetic stimulation of five target cells (stimulation session, 100 ms stimulation duration). We performed different sessions for the 16 kHz and 54 kHz target ensembles, varying FOVs for each session (18 FOVs for 16 kHz target ensemble condition and 12 FOVs for 54 kHz target ensemble condition). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A and C</xref> show two example FOV with targeted neurons for a 16 kHz and 54 kHz ensemble.</p>
<p>Since both imaging and optogenetic stimulation involve optomechanical components, we wanted to ensure that effects were not due to artifacts caused by our stimulation or imaging setup. Moreover, cells can adapt their responses to repeated sound presentation. Thus, to confirm any response changes observed from the stimulation session is due to the optogenetic stimulation rather than simple response change due to acoustic sound presentation, we added an additional control condition. For this control condition, we performed the “stimulation” session with five target cells but with 0 mW laser power (i.e., no stimulation) to verify that any response changes occurring in the stimulation session compared to the baseline session were not simply due to the eventual response adaptation of neurons to the tuned frequency (control condition; 13 FOVs). By selecting cells and presenting 0 mW laser power, instead of no target cell selection or selecting any other no-cell area within the FOV, we ensured that the laser power given to selected cells was the only difference between the actual stimulation and control conditions, keeping any noise caused by the imaging and stimulation setup the same.</p>
<p><underline>Fourth</underline>, after the stimulation session (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), we performed an additional imaging session (post-stimulation session), presenting another series of 16 kHz and 54 kHz pure tones in a random order to examine whether changes in the sound-evoked responses persisted or reverted back after the stimulation session.</p>

<title>Optogenetic holographic stimulation increases activity in targeted ensembles</title>

To quantify the effect of the optogenetic stimulation, we compared the tone-evoked fluorescence responses of the targeted cells with and without stimulation (Stimulation effect = ΔF/F<sub>(<italic>stimulation session</italic>)</sub> - ΔF/F<sub>(<italic>baseline session</italic>)</sub>). Around 72% of target cells (66 out of 90 cells over 18 FOVs for 16 kHz target stimulation and 42 out of 60 cells 12 FOVs for 54 kHz target stimulation) showed increased response amplitude during the stimulation session compared to the baseline session, regardless of the tone presented (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2BD</xref>; permutation tests, all <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). These results indicate that holographic stimulation was able to reliably increase activity in small populations of neurons. Moreover, given that the target cells we selected were most responsive to their preferred tone frequency, this increase in fluorescence indicates that the cells’ responses to their preferred tone were not saturated.</p>

<title>Optogenetic holographic stimulation decreases activity in non-target co-tuned ensembles</title>
<p>We next investigated whether the optogenetically enhanced sound-evoked activity of a small group of cells would cause activity changes in other non-stimulated cells. During holographic optogenetic stimulation of the targeted cells, the non-target, but sound-responsive cells (n = 995 cells for 16 kHz target ensemble condition and n = 675 cells for 54 kHz target ensemble condition), also changed their activity, showing either increased or decreased response amplitudes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2AC</xref>).</p>
<p>If cortical networks rebalance their activity, we speculated that the increased tone-evoked activity in the targeted ensemble would lead to a decrease in tone-evoked activity in coupled ensembles. Such rebalancing would keep the activity within the cortical network stable. Moreover, given that we increased the activity to the preferred sound frequency, if this rebalancing happens, it should occur only for the distinct sound frequency related to the cell’s tuning property. For example, stimulation of a 16 kHz ensemble should cause a greater reduction in the 16 kHz tone response of non-targeted 16 kHz cells compared to their response to the 54 kHz tone.</p>
<p>To address these questions, we investigated whether increased activity in the targeted cells influenced the activity of non-target cells and how these changes were related to the tuning properties of the cells. We first defined each sound-responsive cell’s frequency selectivity by computing a difference between response amplitude to 16 kHz and 54 kHz from the baseline session (frequency preference = (ΔF/F<sub>(16<italic>kHz</italic>)</sub>)-(ΔF/F<sub>(54<italic>kHz</italic>)</sub>)). We then divided these cells into either 16 kHz preferring or 54 kHz preferring groups, taking 0 (i.e., no preference) as a criterion (Fig. S2). Both subgroups exhibited stronger tone-evoked responses to their preferred frequency, independent of the condition (<italic>t</italic>(5700) = 4.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; Fig. S2). This confirms that the criterion for cell group threshold is valid.</p>
<p>We then focused on our main question by comparing the stimulation effect of the two target ensemble groups to the control condition to identify whether stimulation decreased the response of non-target co-tuned neurons. Neural activity in AC rapidly shows stimulus-specific adaptation to the repeated presentation of the stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, which can obscure stimulation related changes. We thus used the response amplitude change between the baseline and the “stimulation” control session as a representative threshold to test the effect of the stimulation. We once again used the difference in response amplitude between the baseline and stimulation sessions as the measure of the stimulation effect (ΔF/F<sub>(<italic>stimulation session</italic>)</sub> - ΔF/F<sub>(<italic>baseline session</italic>)</sub>). Neighboring cells within 20 μm from the target stimulation point were removed from the analysis since they could have been directly affected by the stimulation.</p>
<p>We compared the stimulation effect between non-target co-tuned and non co-tuned cells across conditions (16 kHz and 54 kHz target ensembles as well as control conditions) for different pure tone presentations. Since our primary interest was how non-target cells respond to increased activity in target ensembles, we focused on conditions where the pure tone frequency matched or did not match the tuning properties of the non-target cells. Since we stimulated during tone presentation the effects of the holographic stimulation and stimulus-specific adaptation co-occurred. To isolate these components, we used a linear mixed-effect model with cell group, condition, and pure tone frequency as fixed factors, and FOVs as a random factor. We then performed ANOVA on the model to assess the main effects and interactions.</p>
<p>A marginal significant main effect of the condition (<italic>F</italic>(2,37.1) = 2.983, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0628) on the response change in the stimulation session relative to the baseline session (i.e., stimulation effect) was observed, indicating that these changes may depend on the stimulation condition. We further analyzed the data to better understand how the different factors interacted in the response amplitude changes. A significant interaction between the pure tone frequency and cell group (<italic>F</italic>(1,4397.6) = 186.967, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) suggests that each cell group responded differently to the two pure tone frequencies. Specifically, the response amplitude decreases in the stimulation session relative to the baseline session were more pronounced for each cell group when the played pure tone matched to their tuning property. This interaction between pure tone frequency and cell group highlights the importance of frequency tuning in modulating response amplitudes. Such response amplitude decreases of non-target cells to their preferred pure tone presentation further aligns with the stimulus specific adaptation due to repeatedly presented pure tones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Additionally, a significant three-way interaction across condition, cell groups, and pure tone frequency (<italic>F</italic>(2,4397.6) = 3.517, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0298) suggests the combined effects of the stimulation condition and the cell group on response amplitude depend on the pure tone frequency. The stimulation effect is not uniform across cell groups and depends heavily on the frequency, highlighting a complex interplay between the tuning property of cells, stimulation condition, and presented pure tone frequency.</p>
<p>Consequently, we analyzed post-hoc comparisons estimated marginal means with contrasts, as our focus was how co-tuned cells change their responses due to the increased activity in the target cells along with the frequency of the presented pure tone.</p>
<p>For 16 kHz preferring cell group (n = 537), we observed a greater stimulation effect (i.e., decrease in response amplitude) for 16 kHz tone presentation when 16 kHz target ensemble was stimulated compared to the control condition (<italic>t</italic>(124) = 3.114, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0064). For all other pairs, no significant stimulation effect was observed. This suggests that non-target 16 kHz co-tuned cells reduce their response amplitudes when target ensembles share the same tuning property. Furthermore, such response change occurs only when they process their preferred frequency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, left).</p>

<p>We repeated the experiments and the analysis with 54kHz cells as the target group. In general, we observed similar results. The stimulation effect was significantly more pronounced for 54 kHz tone presentation when 54 kHz target ensemble (n = 359) was stimulated compared to the control condition (<italic>t</italic>(168) = 3.074, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0069; all <italic>p</italic>-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method). All other pairs did not show any stimulation effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, right).</p>
<p>To further explore whether the stimulation effect could be explained by activity rebalancing within the co-tuned network, we implemented a simple model in which a suppression term was applied either to all neurons or specifically to non-target co-tuned cells. By comparing two different model outcomes and the real data, we observed a significant effect of the model type (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2535) = 34.943, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, an interaction between the model type and cell groups was observed (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2535) = 36.348, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Applying suppression to only non-target co-tuned cells during the stimulation session yielded a significant response amplitude decrease for co-tuned cells compared to non co-tuned cells (<italic>F</italic>(1, 2535) = 45.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), which resembles the real data. In contrast, applying suppression to all non-target cells led to similar amplitude changes in both co-tuned and non co-tuned neurons (<italic>F</italic>(1, 2535) = 0.87, <italic>p</italic> = 0.35), which was not observed in either the real data or the simulated data restricted to co-tuned cell suppression. These results suggest that the target cell stimulation induces a selective activity suppression within the co-tuned network for processing their preferred frequency.</p>
<p>Together, these results indicate that the effect of holographic optogenetic stimulation depends not on the specific tuning of cells, but on the co-tuning between stimulated and non-stimulated neurons. Also, this effect is not driven solely by a few non-target cells with large response changes. Rather, the overall population of cells shows relative response changes due to the stimulation when synchronized with their preferred frequency.</p>
<p>Overall, these results further suggest that when neural activity is increased in a subset of target cells due to photostimulation in addition to the target sound presentation, other co-tuned cells selectively reduce their tone-evoked responses to their preferred tone presentation, indicating that the network rebalances to maintain network activity within a certain range.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Rebalanced network responses are stable</title>
<p>We then questioned whether such response amplitude changes due to stimulation within the local network are persistent. To test whether the rebalanced status of the neuronal ensemble is persistent, we examined the tone-evoked response amplitude changes between the post-stimulation and the stimulation sessions (post-stimulation effect: ΔF/F<sub>(<italic>post-stimulation session</italic>)</sub> - ΔF/F<sub>(<italic>stimulation session</italic>)</sub>). Response amplitudes were similar across conditions and tone presentation frequencies for both groups of cells (<italic>F</italic>(2, 4056) = 1.83, <italic>p</italic> = 0.16; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). These results indicate that pairing exogenous stimulation on a subset of neurons along with sounds can instantaneously change the network responses to sounds, and this change can persist at least for many minutes during the experimental session.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Neurons with higher frequency selectivity show greater response changes</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that response changes on non-target cells are significantly influenced by the frequency tuning of stimulation-target cells as well as the frequency of the presented pure tone along with the stimulation. However, we also observed a marginal stimulation effect in the 54 kHz non-target cell group during 54 kHz pure tone presentation, even when 16 kHz target cells were stimulated. We reasoned that this effect might be due to some weak sound activation of 54 kHz cells by 16 kHz tones potentially due to the asymmetric shapes of many auditory tuning curves in AC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Indeed, many cells exhibited broad tuning properties, responding to both 16 kHz and 54 kHz (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, this marginal stimulation effect could be attributed to cells grouped as 54 kHz preferring cells, yet still showing sound evoked responses to 16 kHz, particularly given that 16 kHz is within the sensitive frequency range in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Building on our findings of a rebalanced cortical network, we next aimed to identify whether frequency tuning selectivity influences response amplitude changes in the non-targeted co-tuned neurons. For each cell, we calculated the frequency preference index (ΔF/F<sub>(16<italic>kHz</italic>)</sub>)-(ΔF/F<sub>(54<italic>kHz)</italic></sub>) and divided the cells into three categories of frequency selectivity: low, mid, and high. We removed cells with extreme frequency preference values, where the index values exceed ± 4 standard deviations from the median, prior to dividing them into three categories. This removed about 1% of cells from the dataset for further analyses. This grouping was based on the 33% quartile ranges, with each category representing one-third of the data distribution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Values closer to 0 indicate more broadly tuned cells across frequencies while extreme positive and negative values to indicate sharply tuned cells to either frequency.</p>
<p>We then tested whether cells with higher frequency selectivity to one frequency exhibited greater response amplitude changes. We performed a three-way ANOVA to examine the effect of frequency selectivity (low, mid, high selectivity), stimulation condition (control, 16 kHz target stim, 54 kHz target stim), and cell groups (16 kHz vs. 54 kHz preferring cells) on the response amplitude change. There were significant main effects of frequency selectivity (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2183) = 23.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and stimulation condition (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2183) = 11.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). No significant main effect of cell group was observed (<italic>F</italic>(1, 2183) = 0.77, <italic>p</italic> = 0.379). Thus, neither the interaction between frequency selectivity and cell group (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2183) = 0.69, <italic>p</italic> = 0.503), nor the interaction between condition and cell group (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2183) = 2.64, <italic>p</italic> = 0.072) was significant. The three-way interaction between frequency selectivity, stimulation condition, and cell group was also not significant (<italic>F</italic>(4, 2183) = 0.86, <italic>p</italic> = 0.487).</p>
<p>However, the interaction between frequency selectivity and stimulation condition was significant (<italic>F</italic>(4, 2183) = 2.82, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0238), indicating that the effect of frequency selectivity depended on the condition. These results suggests that the response amplitude changes across conditions were more prominent for cells with higher frequency selectivity.</p>
<p>To identify where the significant response difference occurred across conditions, we further performed post-hoc pairwise comparisons between conditions within each frequency selectivity category for each cell groups. For 16 kHz preferring cells, we observed a significant difference in the response change between control and 16 kHz stim conditions only from the high frequency selectivity category (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.027, Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). In parallel, for 54 kHz preferring cells, the significant effect was observed between control and 54 kHz stim conditions (<italic>p</italic> = 0.033, Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). These results indicate that non-targeted cells with higher frequency selectivity exhibit the greatest response amplitude changes, only when the target stimulated cells were co-tuned with them. These results also suggest that frequency selective neurons form co-tuned networks.</p>

<title>Sparsely distributed non-target co-tuned ensembles immediately rebalance their activities to maintain the network balance</title>
<p>Network balance can be achieved by multiple mechanisms operating on different timescales. To get insight into the potential mechanisms underlying the observed rebalancing, we next investigated how rapidly cells start adjusting their responses during the stimulation condition. We thus examined the stimulation effect (changes in response amplitude due to stimulation of target cells) for non-target co-tuned ensembles at the single-trial level. We observed decreased response amplitudes from the first trial, with no significant decay across trials (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), regardless of cell groups, frequency presentation, and conditions (sum-of-squares <italic>F</italic>-test, all <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).

<title>Non-target co-tuned ensembles that show rebalancing are spatially distributed</title>
<p>Activity rebalancing could be driven by local, e.g. changes in excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, or distributed changes. To identify whether co-tuned ensembles that changed their activities are locally or widely distributed, we computed the center of mass distance between each non-target cell to any of the target cells. For the stimulation condition, we excluded non-target cells that were within 20 μm distance of the target cells to ensure that any effects from those neighboring cells with their increased response amplitudes could have been not, even partially, due to photostimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Trial-by-trial variability in neuronal activity is ubiquitous in the brain, with sensory stimuli evoking activity in different sparse co-tuned ensembles at different times. How sensory-evoked activity is distributed and coordinated across sparsely distributed co-tuned networks has been unknown. Here, we leveraged the capability for selective <italic>in vivo</italic> stimulation via holographic optogenetics to investigate how functionally related neuronal ensembles in AC coordinate activity. Our results show that manipulating a small subset of target co-tuned neurons alters the auditory-evoked responses of other non-target co-tuned neurons. Increased activity in one subset of neurons is balanced by decreased activity in the rest of the co-tuned population of neurons.</p>
<p>Importantly, such network rebalancing occurs only for processing acoustic features specific to their tuning. Our analysis shows that the most selective non-targeted neurons show the strongest effect after stimulation, suggesting that selective neurons form functionally interacting sub-networks consistent with in vivo correlation analyses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and in vitro studies in visual cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Functionally related cells might form these subnetworks during development likely due to lineage relationships and Hebbian processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Together, our findings suggest that neuronal ensembles with strengthened connectivity across neuronal ensembles sharing similar functional tuning properties actively interact and update their status to maintain the overall network, enabling energy-efficient sensory processing.</p>
<p>The present work applied holographic optogenetic stimulation to manipulate neuronal activity at a single-cell resolution in the AC for the first time. Similar to previous findings in VC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, our study further supports the idea that extra activation within the network exerts an inhibitory influence on a subset of neurons. In the VC, single cell stimulation resulted in suppression of neighboring co-tuned neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Our results here show that feature-specific suppression occurs in spatially dispersed ensembles of non-target co-tuned neurons. The widely distributed response amplitude decreases in those neurons suggest that this phenomenon is not limited to local neighboring cells but involved widespread networks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, the effect is not solely due to inhibition caused by neighboring interneurons from the optogenetic stimulation. Instead, neurons with similar functional characteristics, sparsely distributed throughout the AC, actively interact, with more sharply tuned neurons to modulate their activity the most.</p>
<p>Cortical networks are shaped by dynamic changes in neural activity driven by various factors. Neurons rapidly modulate their responses based on their functional roles in sensory processing. Recurrent cortical networks are thought to update their activity based on incoming information to maintain homeostatic balance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Concurrently, co-activated neurons processing similar acoustic properties strengthen their connectivity by Hebbian learning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Thus, cortical networks are shaped by an active interplay of synaptic plasticity, homeostasis and Hebbian learning, rather than by a single dominant mechanism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Rebalancing of network activity is often attributed to homeostatic rebalancing of individual cell’s activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> or an E/I balance: increased activity of inhibitory neurons resulting in reduced activity of excitatory neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that rebalancing is tuning-specific.</p>
<p>Given that inhibitory neurons in A1 are generally less frequency selective than excitatory neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, changes in inhibition are unlikely to be the only contributor to the observed effect. While our AAV was not cell-type specific, it is also unlikely that many selected target neurons would be inhibitory interneurons as a greater proportion of neurons in sensory cortices are excitatory (about 80% compared to 20% inhibitory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>; AAV-hSyn is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in similar proportions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>). Furthermore, our primary cell selection criterion for stimulation yielded a subgroup of a strong specific frequency-responsive cells (top 30% of cells that show the biggest evoked responses to the target tone after excluding cells that show responses to multiple tones). This criterion likely selected more excitatory neurons, as they generally show greater stimulus-selective responses than inhibitory neurons in sensory cortices <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that not all target neurons showed clear activation in response to holographic stimulation. Although we attempted to pre-select cells responsive to stimulation, some of them seemed to exhibit reduced activation during the experiment, potentially due to motion artifacts, response adaptation, network suppression, or trial-by-trial variability. Nevertheless, the frequency-specific suppression on co-tuned neurons observed in this study suggests that this effect can be driven by activation of a very small number of neurons. One caveat is that, while we presume most target cells were likely excitatory, inhibitory neurons may have been included in the target cell group. Inhibitory neurons could show a reliable, strong responses to the optogenetics compared to more variable responses that excitatory neurons could show <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, thus may have been included in the target cell group. However, if more inhibitory cells were included, this would have reduced trial-by-trial variability from the stimulation yielding higher probability of target cell activation, which is different from what we observed. Additionally, re-occurring sounds evoke activity changes in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the same direction, leaving the E/I balance unchanged <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Moreover, the fraction of inhibitory cells is 10 ∼ 20% of all cortical neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, thus the chance of stimulating them is small. Together, these considerations suggest that our results are unlikely the effect of the activation of inhibitory neurons. Rather, other balancing mechanisms such as short-term depression at thalamocortical synapses may play a role <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In contrast to slow changes of homeostatic plasticity related to the E/I balance, plasticity in cortical cellular responses can occur quickly and are cell-specific, thereby tuned to their functional response properties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Based on this, we speculate that the decrease in response amplitudes of non-target neurons likely reflects rapid activity-dependent synaptic changes in excitatory cells. Future work using Cre-dependent virus expression or a cell type specific labeling approach will be required to confirm cell-type-specific roles in this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>Lastly, no additional response changes were observed in the post-stimulation session indicating that the rebalanced network status remained constant. Indeed, constant amplitudes were observed regardless of conditions, subgroups, and frequencies, suggesting that the network persistence was achieved through repeated acoustic stimuli presentation and photostimulation. The persistence after the stimulation condition further suggests that once the newly learned rebalanced network status is achieved, the network response stabilizes and remains persistent. The mechanisms behind this stabilization are unclear but may involve an active interplay of homeostasis and Hebbian learning to form co-active networks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Taken together, the present study reveals how neuronal ensembles in the AC rebalance to maintain a homeostatic processing equilibrium for a given sensory input, and that rebalanced networks remain persistent. Moreover, our results show that network activity can be controlled by even a small subset of neurons, and the network changes are closely tied to the functional tuning properties of neurons.</p>

<p>A total of 14 mice over 8 weeks old (8 – 30 weeks, 6 males and 8 females) were used in the experiments. To retain high-frequency hearing at experimental ages, offspring from C57BL6/J and B6.CAST-<italic>Cdh23<sup>Ahl+</sup></italic>/Kjn (Jax 002756) were used for all experiments. Animals were housed on 12-hr reversed light/dark cycle. All experimental procedures were approved by Johns Hopkins Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

<title>Surgery and virus injection</title>
<p>Surgery was performed as described in previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. We injected dexamethasone (1mg/kg, VetOne) subcutaneously (s.c.) to minimize brain swelling prior to surgery. 4% isoflurane (Fluriso, VetOne) with a calibrated vaporizer (Matrix VIP 3000) was used to induce anesthesia, which was then reduced down to 1.5 – 2% for maintenance. Body temperature was monitored and maintained at around 36L throughout the surgery (Harvard Apparatus Homeothermic monitor). We first removed the hair on the head using a hair removal product (Nair) to expose the skin. Betadine and 70% ethanol were applied three times to the exposed skin. Skin and tissues were then removed, and muscles were scraped to expose the left temporal side where the craniotomy was conducted. Unilateral craniotomy was performed to expose about 3.5 mm diameter region over the left AC. Virus (AAV9-hSyn-GCaMP8s-TSA-rsChRmine titer of 1:2) injection was performed at 2-3 sites near tentative A1 area at about 300 μm depth from the surface, using a glass pipette controlled by a micromanipulator (Sutter Instrument MPC-200 and ROE-200 controller). We injected 300 nL on each site at the rate of 180 nL/min (Nanoject3). Once virus injection was completed, two circular glass coverslips (one of 3 mm and one of 4 mm in diameter) were affixed with a clear silicone elastomer (Kwik-Sil, World Precision Instruments). An extra layer of dental acrylic (C&amp;B Metabond) was applied around the edge of the cranial window to further secure it, cover the exposed skull, and adhere a custom 3D-printed stainless steel headpost. Carprofen (5 mg/kg) and cefazolin (300mg/kg) were injected (s.c.) post-operatively. Animals were given at least 3-4 weeks of recovery and viral expression time before any imaging was performed.</p>

<title>Experimental procedures</title>
<p>Animals were head-fixed on a custom-made stage, where a free field speaker (TDT ED1) was faced towards the right ear at 45 degrees. All sound stimuli were driven by TDT RX6 multiprocessor and we imaged GCaMP8s responses with a resonant scanning two-photon microscope (Bruker Ultima 2Pplus; 940 nm excitation wavelength) at A1 L2/3 (160 – 200 μm). A1 was identified by its tonotopy gradient using widefield imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. During 2-photon imaging sessions, we first conducted a short imaging session (about 1 min.) presenting 100-ms pure tones at 3 different frequencies (4, 16, 54 kHz) at 70 dB SPL, covering the mouse hearing range, for 10 times each in a randomized order (ISI: 2 sec). This was to identify initial tuning properties of sound-responsive cells (cell selection session; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The acquired imaging data was immediately processed using ‘suite2p’ and a custom-written Matlab script to identify tone-responsive cells for each frequency. We continued only when at least 50% of cells within the FOV showed sound-evoked responses. We took 16 kHz or 54 kHz as our target functional properties. Target frequency was randomly assigned. We manually tested the response changes to stimulation of the top 30% of target frequency responsive cells (∼ 20 cells) selected from the cell selection session by using a stimulation laser (Light Conversion Carbide; 1040 nm excitation wavelength). Stimulation laser power was set around 5 mW per cell. We selected 5 representative cells (target cells) that showed visible fluorescence changes to the stimulation.</p>
<p>Prior to the main experimental session, we ran a short (∼ 1 min.) stimulation session without any sound presentation that comprised 5 trials of 100-ms stimulation with 6-second ISIs for a rapid check of the stimulation effect. This session was restricted to 5 trials of stimulation given the limited time of the imaging session, leading to larger variability of the observed stimulation effect. We further verified the stimulation effect from the experimental stimulation session where 30 trials were given.</p>
<p>For the main experiment, three consecutive imaging sessions were followed by the presentation of either 16 kHz or 54 kHz 100 ms pure tones with random ISIs between 5.8 – 6.5 sec. for 30 trials each, as baseline session, stimulation session, and post-stimulation session (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Only the second imaging session (i.e., stimulation session) received holographic stimulation on the pre-selected 5 target cells for 30 revolutions of 15 um spiral for about 100 ms at 5 mW laser power per cell (16 kHz target cell or 54 kHz target cell stimulation conditions) or 0 mW laser power per cell (control condition). The default mechanical setup (Bruker PrairieView version 5.7) of the microscope opens and closes the uncaging shutter to enable the stimulation laser path for every single stimulation time point, which causes an external mechanic sound that can trigger neural activation of the AC. To minimize any effect of external mechanic sounds to cells in the AC, we kept the uncaging shutter open during the imaging session. Number of imaging sessions per animal varied depending on the virus expression. Regardless, all animals were used for control and at least one stimulation condition with minimum 2 days apart by varying FOVs to avoid imaging the same cells multiple times. The order of conditions and the imaging depth presented to the same animal were randomized.</p>
<p>An additional single-cell stimulation only session was conducted on a subset of animals, to further test a reliable holographic stimulation at a single-cell level (n = 3 animals). We varied a stimulation position from the original target stimulation point to 10, 20, or 30 μm shifted along x-axis or y-axis, generating 7 different stimulation point (original cell position, 10, 20, or 30 μm shifted along the x-axis, 10, 20, or 30 μm shifted along the y-axis). We stimulated each stimulation point for 10 times in a randomized order across stimulation points with 8-sec. ISIs.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Imaging data were processed with ‘suite2p’ for motion correction, cell detection, and cell fluorescence trace extraction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. We applied neuropil correction to the fluorescence traces using the following equation: F<sub>(cell_corrected)</sub> = F<sub>(cell)</sub> – (0.8 * F<sub>(neuropil)</sub>). We then computed ΔF/F normalized to the baseline, by following the equation: ΔF/F = (F<sub>(trace)</sub> – F<sub>(baseline)</sub>) / F<sub>(baseline)</sub>, where baseline is about 300 ms before the sound onset. For the single-cell level stimulation session, we computed peak ΔF/F per each stimulation point and applied a mixed-effect model by taking peak ΔF/F as dependent variables, stimulation point as independent variables, and cells as random factor. For the 5-cell stimulation validation session, we computed a proportion of activated cells (any cell with peak ΔF/F &gt; 0) among stimulated cells per each FOV as well as peak ΔF/F and ran a random permutation with 100 iterations.</p>
<p>For experimental sessions, to select sound responsive cells, we compared sound-evoked activity (160 ms – 660 ms after sound onset capturing the sound-evoked response due to slow calcium transient) and the baseline activity (300 ms – 0 ms before the sound onset). We considered cells sound responsive when the amplitude of the average sound-evoked activity exceeded two standard deviations of the amplitude of the average baseline activity. Sound responsive cells were selected based on fluorescence traces only from the baseline session to minimize any potential effect of stimulation on cell selection. We then computed the ratio of the evoked activity between two frequencies as an index of the frequency preference (ΔF/F<sub>(16<italic>kHz</italic>)</sub> - ΔF/F<sub>(54<italic>kHz</italic>)</sub>). We subgrouped sound-responsive cells into either 16 kHz preferring cells or 54 kHz preferring cells based on the frequency preference, taking 0 as a subgroup criterion. As our main interest was changes to non-target cells, we excluded target cells for further analyses. To compare response changes due to stimulation for each group of cells, average sound-evoked activity of sound-responsive cells from the baseline session was subtracted from the stimulation session (stimulation effect: ΔF/F<sub>(<italic>stimulation session</italic>)</sub> - ΔF/F<sub>(<italic>baseline session</italic>)</sub>) for each condition. We further compared response changes between post-stimulation session and stimulation session, again by subtracting the response amplitudes between two sessions for each group and condition (post-stimulation effect: ΔF/F<sub>(<italic>post-stimulation session</italic>)</sub> - ΔF/F<sub>(<italic>stimulation session</italic>)</sub>). To quantify the stimulation effect based on functional properties for conditions and groups, we applied a mixed-effect model by taking amplitude changes as dependent variables, frequency, conditions, and cell groups as independent variables, and FOVs as random factor. We then computed Type III analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine whether the effect of functional property (frequency) to the amplitude changes was specific to the target frequency presentation synchronized with the stimulation (i.e., 16 kHz for 16 kHz target cell stimulation or 54 kHz for 54 kHz target cell stimulation). To quantify whether the response amplitude changes due to stimulation differ across trials, we fitted a dataset of average stimulation effect across each trial per each condition (stimulation or control), each cell group (16 kHz preferring or 54 kHz preferring cells), and each tone presentation (16 kHz or 54 kHz) to the three-parameter model and computed the extra sum-of-squares <italic>F</italic>-test to compare whether response amplitude changes across trials were different from a constant line <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. To quantify a relationship between response amplitude changes of non-target cells and their distances to target cells, we computed a center of mass distance of each cell position relative to target cells, and fitted the dataset of the response amplitude changes across distance to the three-parameter model to compute the extra sum-of-squares <italic>F</italic>-test, per each condition (16 kHz target stimulation, 54 kHz target stimulation, or control), each cell group (16 kHz preferring or 54 kHz preferring cells), and each tone presentation (16 kHz or 54 kHz). For the control condition, as there were no stimulated target cells, we chose top five most tone-responsive cells from the baseline session as “target” cells.</p>
<p>We then generated a simple model in which a suppression term was applied either to all neurons or specifically to non-target co-tuned cells to test our results from the data. We took a similar range of number of neurons and FOVs to closely simulate the model to the real dataset structure. On 50 simulated calcium traces of neurons (n),
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="599418v3_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Where R<sub>n(t)</sub> is a response amplitude from either baseline or stimulation session, theta<sub>n</sub> is a suppression term applied either to all neurons or only to non-target co-tuned neurons, only during the stimulation session, and epsilon<sub>n(t)</sub> is additive noise. Theta was defined as proportional to the average stimulation strength from target neurons, derived from the real dataset, and scaled by a factor α = 0.3 in the current simulation. To introduce neuron-level variability, an additional jitter (epsilon<sub>n</sub>) was applied as follow:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="599418v3_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Similar to the real data analyses, we compared the response change between the stimulation and baseline sessions’ trace amplitudes.</p>

<p>Animals were deeply anesthetized with 4% isoflurane to perform transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The extracted brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA for additional 12-24 hours. Coronal brain sections at 50 μm containing the AC were stained with primary antibodies of HA-Tag (1:500) and chicken Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP, 1:500) for GCaMP8s, and secondary antibodies of 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) and 488-conjugated anti-chicken IgG (1:1000) for red-shifted opsins.</p>

<p>This study uses all-optical electrophysiology methods to provide a <bold>valuable</bold> insight into the organization of cortical networks and their ability to balance the activity of groups of neurons with similar functional tuning. The all-optical approach used in this study is impressive and the claim that the effects of optical stimulation correspond to a specific homeostatic mechanism is <bold>solid</bold>. The work will be of interest to neurobiologists and to developers of optical approaches for interrogating brain function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kang et al. provide the first experimental insights from holographic stimulation of auditory cortex. Using stimulation of functionally-defined ensembles, they test whether overactivation of a specific subpopulation biases simultaneous and subsequent sensory-evoked network activations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The investigators use a novel technique to investigate the sensory response properties in functionally defined cell assemblies in auditory cortex. These data provide the first evidence of how acutely perturbing specific frequency-tuned neurons impacts the tuning across a broader population. Their revised manuscript appropriately tempers any claims about specific plasticity mechanisms involved.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the single cell analyses in this manuscript are comprehensive, questions about how holographic stimulation impacts population coding are left to future manuscripts, or perhaps re-analyses of this unique dataset.</p>

<p>The goal of HiJee Kang et al. in this study is to explore the interaction between assemblies of neurons with similar pure-tone selectivity in mouse auditory cortex. Using holographic optogenetic stimulation in a small subset of target cells selective for a given pure tone (PTsel), while optically monitoring calcium activity in surrounding non-target cells, they discovered a subtle rebalancing process: co-tuned neurons that are not optogenetically stimulated tend to reduce their activity. The cortical network reacts as if an increased response to PTsel in some tuned assemblies is immediately offset by a reduction in activity in the rest of the PTsel-tuned assemblies, leaving the overall response to PTsel unchanged. The authors show that this rebalancing process affects only the responses of neurons to PTsel, not to other pure tones. They also show that assemblies of neurons that are not selective for PTsel don't participate in the rebalancing process. They conclude that assemblies of neurons with similar pure-tone selectivity must interact in some way to organize this rebalancing process, and they suggest that mechanisms based on homeostatic signaling may play a role.</p>
<p>The authors have successfully controlled for potential artefacts resulting from their optogenetic stimulation. This study is therefore pioneering in the field of the auditory cortex (AC), as it is the first to use single-cell optogenetic stimulation to explore the functional organization of AC circuits in vivo. The conclusions of this paper are very interesting. They raise new questions about the mechanisms that could underlie such a rebalancing process.</p>
<p>(1) This study uses an all-optical approach to excite a restricted group of neurons chosen for their functional characteristics (their frequency tuning), and simultaneously record from the entire network observable in the FOV. As stated by the authors, this approach is applied for the first time to the auditory cortex, which is a tour de force. However, such approach is complex and requires precise controls to be convincing. The authors provide important controls to demonstrate the precise ability of their optogenetic methods. In particular, holographic patterns used to excite 5 cells simultaneously may be associated with out-of-focus laser hot spots. Cells located outside of the FOV could be activated, therefore engaging other cells than the targeted ones in the stimulation. This would be problematic in this study as their tuning may be unrelated to the tuning of the targeted cells. To control for such effect, the authors have decoupled the imaging and the excitation planes, and checked for the absence of out-of-focus unwanted excitation (Suppl Fig1).</p>
<p>(2) In the auditory cortex, assemblies of cells with similar pure-tone selectivity are linked together not only by their ability to respond to the same sound, but also by other factors. This study clearly shows that such assemblies are structured in a way that maintains a stable global response through a rebalancing process. If a group of cells within an assembly increases its response, the rest of the assembly must be inhibited to maintain the total response.</p>
<p>
One surprising result is the clear boundary between assemblies: a rebalancing process occurring in one assembly does not affect the response in another assembly comprising cells tuned to a different frequency. However, this is slightly challenged by the data shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p>Figure 3B-left, for example, shows that, compared to controls, non-target 16 kHz-preferring neurons only decrease their response to a 16 kHz pure tone when the cells targeted by the opto stimulation also prefer 16 kHz, but not when the targeted cells prefer 54 kHz. However, the inverse is not entirely true. Again compared to controls, Figure 3B (right) shows that non-target 54 kHz-preferring neurons decrease their response to a 54 kHz pure tone when the targeted cells also prefer 54 kHz; however, they also tend to be inhibited when the targeted cells prefer 16 kHz.</p>
<p>The authors suggest this may be due to the partial activation of 54 kHz-preferring cells by 16 kHz tones and propose examining the response of highly selective neurons. The results are shown in Figure 3F. It would have been more logical to show the same results as in Figure 3B, but with the left part restricted to highly 16 kHz-selective cells and the right part to highly 54 kHz-selective cells. However, the authors chose to pool all responses to 16 kHz and 54 kHz tones in every triplet of conditions (control, opto stimulation on 16 kHz-preferring cells and opto stimulation on 54 kHz-preferring cells), which blurs the result of the analysis.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<p>We would like to thank you and the reviewers for valuable feedback on the first version of the manuscript. We now addressed all of the issues raised by reviewers, mostly by implementing the suggested changes and clarifying important details in the revised version of the manuscript. A detailed response to each comment is provided in the rebuttal letter. Briefly, the main changes were as follow:</p>
<p>- We changed homeostatic balance to network balance especially when describing the main finding as the response changes induced by the stimulation occurred on a fast timescale. We speculate the sustained changes observed in the post-stimulation condition are the result of homeostatic mechanisms.</p>
<p>- We added additional verification on the target stimulation effect by adding a supplementary result showing its effect between the target and off-target z-planes, as well as demonstrating the minimal impact of the imaging laser to rsChRmine.</p>
<p>- We added a simple toy model illustrating suppression specifically applied to co-tuned cells that yields the response amplitude decrease, to further support our findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kang et al. provide the first experimental insights from holographic stimulation of auditory cortex. Using stimulation of functionally-defined ensembles, they test whether overactivation of a specific subpopulation biases simultaneous and subsequent sensory-evoked network activations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The investigators use a novel technique to investigate the sensory response properties in functionally defined cell assemblies in auditory cortex. These data provide the first evidence of how acutely perturbing specific frequency-tuned neurons impacts the tuning across a broader population.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have several main concerns about the interpretation of these data:</p>
<p>
(1) The premise of the paper suggests that sensory responses are noisy at the level of neurons, but that population activity is reliable and that different neurons may participate in sensory coding on different trials. However, no analysis related to single trial variance or overall stability of population coding is provided. Specifically, showing that population activity is stable across trials in terms of total activity level or in some latent low dimensional representation would be required to support the concept of &quot;homeostatic balancing&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising an important point. We agree that the term ‘homeostatic balancing’ may be not the best term to be applied to explain the main results. We now have toned down on the homeostatic plasticity aspect to explain the main result. We have changed the term to a simple ‘network balance’, potentially due to various factors including rapid synaptic plasticity. We speculate the persistent activity of co-tuned cells in the post-stimulation session as a result of homeostatic balance, instead of rapidly changing back their responses to the baseline. Relevant changes are implemented throughout the manuscript including Introduction (e.g., lines 76-78) and Discussion sections (e.g., lines 453-456).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Rebalancing would predict either that the responses of stimulated neurons would remain A) elevated after stimulation due to a hebbian mechanism or B) suppressed due to high activity levels on previous trials, a homeostatic mechanism. The authors report suppression in targeted neurons after stimulation blocks, but this appears similar to all other non-stimulated neurons. How do the authors interpret the post-stimulation effect in stimulated neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is true that the post stimulation effect of no response change both from co-tuned and non co-tuned neurons, and both from stimulation and control sessions. This could be due to neuronal activity being adapted and decreased enough from the consecutive presentation of acoustic stimuli themselves. However, we still think that if the stimulation driven co-tuned non stimulated neurons’ response decrease is highly driven by stimulation without homeostasis, at least their responses should bounce back during the post-stimulation. We agree that further investigation would be required to further confirm such effect. We elaborated this as another discussion point in the discussion section (lines 457-464).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors suggest that ACtx is different from visual cortex in that neurons with different tuning properties are intermingled. While that is true at the level of individual neurons, there is global order, as demonstrated by the authors own widefield imaging data and others at the single cell level (e.g. Tischbirek et al. 2019). Generally, distance is dismissed as a variable in the paper, but this is not convincing. Work across multiple sensory systems, including the authors own work, has demonstrated that cortical neuron connectivity is not random but varies as a function of distance (e.g. Watkins et al. 2014). Better justification is needed for the spatial pattern of neurons that were chosen for stimulation. Further, analyses that account for center of mass of stimulation, rather than just the distance from any stimulated neuron would be important to any negative result related to distance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the further suggestion regarding the distance matter. While Watkins et al., 2014 and Levy and Reyes (2012) showed stronger connectivity for nearby cells as well as for more distant patches, on a functional level, Winkowski &amp; Kanold 2013 showed high frequency heterogeneity especially in L2/3, where we targeted to image in this study. Thus, connected cells can have varied tuning consistent with spine imaging (Konnerth paper). We now also calculated the distance based on the center of mass of target cells to calculate the distance effect for an additional verification and still observed no distance related stimulation effect. We now replaced the Figure 4B with the result from the center of mass calculation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Data curation and presentation: Broadly, the way the data were curated and plotted makes it difficult to determine how well-supported the authors claims are. In terms of curation, the removal of outliers 3 standard deviations above the mean in the analysis of stimulation effects is questionable. Given the single-cell stimulation data presented in Figure 1, the reader is led to believe that holographic stimulation is quite specific. However, the justification for removing these outliers is that there may be direct stimulation 20-30 um from the target. Without plotting and considering the outliers as well, it is difficult to understand if these outsized responses are due to strong synaptic connections with neighboring neurons or rather just direct off-target stimulation. Relatedly, data presentation is limited to the mean + SEM for almost all main effects and pre-post stimulation effects are only compared indirectly. Whether stimulation effects are driven by just a few neurons that are particularly suppressed or distinct populations which are suppressed or enhanced remains unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. Now we specifically removed neighboring cells that are &lt; 20 um from the target point and we observed similar. We replaced all the relevant figures, texts, and statistical results to ensure that the exclusion was specific to overlapping neighboring cells.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The goal of HiJee Kang et al. in this study is to explore the interaction between assemblies of neurons with similar pure-tone selectivity in mouse auditory cortex. Using holographic optogenetic stimulation in a small subset of target cells selective for a given pure tone (PTsel), while optically monitoring calcium activity in surrounding non-target cells, they discovered a subtle rebalancing process: co-tuned neurons that are not optogenetically stimulated tend to reduce their activity. The cortical network reacts as if an increased response to PTsel in some tuned assemblies is immediately offset by a reduction in activity in the rest of the PTsel-tuned assemblies, leaving the overall response to PTsel unchanged. The authors show that this rebalancing process affects only the responses of neurons to PTsel, not to other pure tones. They also show that assemblies of neurons that are not selective for PTsel don't participate in the rebalancing process. They conclude that assemblies of neurons with similar pure-tone selectivity must interact in some way to organize this rebalancing process, and they suggest that mechanisms based on homeostatic signaling may play a role.</p>
<p>he conclusions of this paper are very interesting but some aspects of the study including methods for optogenetic stimulation, statistical analysis of the results and interpretation of the underlying mechanisms need to be clarified and extended.</p>
<p>(1) This study uses an all-optical approach to excite a restricted group of neurons chosen for their functional characteristics (their frequency tuning), and simultaneously record from the entire network observable in the FOV. As stated by the authors, this approach is applied for the first time to the auditory cortex, which is a tour de force. However, such an approach is complex and requires precise controls to be convincing. In the manuscript, several methodological aspects are not sufficiently described to allow a proper understanding.</p>
<p>(i) The use of CRmine together with GCaMP8s has been reported as problematic as the 2Ph excitation of GCaMP8s also excites the opsin. Here, the authors use a red-shifted version of CRmine to prevent such cross excitation by the imaging laser. To be convincing, they should explain how they controlled for the absence of rsCRmine activation by the 940nm light. Showing the fluorescence traces immediately after the onset of the imaging session would ensure that neurons are not excited as they are imaged.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We realized that the important reference was omitted. Kishi et al. 2022 validated the efficacy of the rsChRmine compared to ChRmine. In this paper, they compared regular ChRmine and rsChRmine activity to different wavelengths and setting and showed the efficiency of rsChRmine with reduced optical cross talk. This reference is now included in the manuscript (line 98). We also checked the spontaneous baseline activity that lasted about 10 sec. before any of the sound presentation and observed a relatively stable activity throughout, rather than any imaging session onset related activation, which is also similar to what we see from another group of GCaMP6s transgenic animals.</p>

<p>(ii) Holographic patterns used to excite 5 cells simultaneously may be associated with out-of-focus laser hot spots. Cells located outside of the FOV could be activated, therefore engaging other cells than the targeted ones in the stimulation. This would be problematic in this study as their tuning may be unrelated to the tuning of the targeted cells.

</disp-quote>
<p>We further verified whether the laser power at the targeted z-plane influences cells’ activity at nearby z-planes. As the Reviewer pointed out, the previous x- and y-axis shifts were tested by single-cell stimulation. This time, we stimulated five cells simultaneously, to match the actual experiment setup and assess potential artifacts in other planes. We observed no stimulation-driven activity increase in cells at a z-planed shifted by 20 µm (Supplementary Figure 1). This confirms the holographic stimulation accurately manipulates the pre-selected target cells and the effects we observe is not likely due to out-of-focus stimulation artifacts. It is true that not all pre-selected cells showing significant response changes prior to the main experiment are effectively activated t every trial during the experiments. We varied the target cell distances across FOVs, from nearby cells to those farther apart within the FOV. We have not observed a significant relationship between the target cell distances and stimulation effect. Lastly, cells within &lt; 20 µm of the target were excluded to prevent potential excitation due to the holographic stimulation power. Given the spontaneous movements of the FOV during imaging sessions due to animal’s movement, despite our efforts to minimize them, we believe that any excitation from these neighboring neurons would be directly from the stimulation rather than the light pattern artifact itself.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(iii) The control shown in Figure 1B is intended to demonstrate the precision of the optogenetic stimulation: when the stimulation spiral is played at a distance larger or equal to 20 µm from a cell, it does not activate it. However, in the rest of the study, the stimulation is applied with a holographic approach, targeting 5 cells simultaneously instead of just one. As the holographic pattern of light could produce out-of-focus hot spots (absent in the single cell control), we don't know what is the extent of the contamination from non-targeted cells in this case. This is important because it would determine an objective criterion to exclude non-targeted but excited cells (last paragraph of the Result section: &quot;For the stimulation condition, we excluded non-target cells that were within 15 µm distance of the target cells...&quot;)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Highly sensitive neurons to certain frequency also shows the greatest adaptation effect, which can be observed the control condition. Therefore, the high sensitive neurons showing greater amplitude change is first related to the neuronal adaptation to its sensitive information. However, by stimulating the co-tuned target neurons, other co-tuned non-target neurons shows significantly greater amplitude decrease, compared to either non co-tuned target neurons stimulation or control (the latter did not meet the significance level).</p>
<p>We also tried putting more rigorous criterion as 20 um instead of 15 um as you pointed out since the spiral size was 20 um. The result yielded further significant response amplitude decrease due to the stimulation effect only from co-tuned non-target neurons for processing their preferred frequency information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) A strength of this study comes from the design of the experimental protocol used to compare the activity in non-target co-tuned cells when the optogenetic stimulation is paired with their preferred tone versus a non-preferred pure tone. The difficulty lies in the co-occurrence of the rebalancing process and the adaptation to repeated auditory stimuli, especially when these auditory stimuli correspond to a cell's preferred pure tones. To distinguish between the two effects, the authors use a comparison with a control condition similar to the optogenetic stimulation conditions, except that the laser power is kept at 0 mW. The observed effect is shown as an extra reduction of activity in the condition with the optogenetic paired with the preferred tone, compared to the control condition. The specificity of this extra reduction when stimulation is synchronized with the preferred tone, but not with a non-preferred tone, is a potentially powerful result, as it points to an underlying mechanism that links the assemblies of cells that share the same preferred pure tones.</p>
<p>The evidence for this specificity is shown in Figure 3A and 3D. However, the universality of this specificity is challenged by the fact that it is observed for 16kHz preferring cells, but not so clearly for 54kHz preferring cells: these 54kHz preferring cells also significantly (p = 0.044) reduce their response to 54kHz in the optogenetic stimulation condition applied to 16kHz preferring target cells compared to the control condition. The proposed explanation for this is the presence of many cells with a broad frequency tuning, meaning that these cells could have been categorized as 54kHz preferring cells, while they also responded significantly to a 16kHz pure tone. To account for this, the authors divide each category of pure tone cells into three subgroups with low, medium and high frequency preferences. Following the previous reasoning, one would expect at least the &quot;high&quot; subgroups to show a strong and significant specificity for an additional reduction only if the optogenetic stimulation is targeted to a group of cells with the same preferred frequency. Figure 3D fails to show this. The extra reduction for the &quot;high&quot; subgroups is significant only when the condition of opto-stimulation synchronized with the preferred frequency is compared to the control condition, but not when it is compared to the condition of opto-stimulation synchronized with the non-preferred frequency.</p>
<p>Therefore, the claim that &quot;these results indicate that the effect of holographic optogenetic stimulation depends not on the specific tuning of cells, but on the co-tuning between stimulated and non-stimulated neurons&quot; (end of paragraph &quot;Optogenetic holographic stimulation decreases activity in non-target co-tuned ensembles&quot;) seems somewhat exaggerated. Perhaps increasing the number of sessions in the 54kHz target cell optogenetic stimulation condition (12 FOV) to the number of sessions in the 16kHz target cell optogenetic stimulation condition (18 FOV) could help to reach significance levels consistent with this claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We previously also tested by randomly subselecting 12 FOVs from 16kHz stimulation condition to match the same number of FOV between two groups and did not really see any result difference. However, to further ensure the results, we now added three more dataset for 54 kHz target cell stimulation condition (now 15 FOV) which yielded similar outcome. We have now updated the statistical values from added datasets.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) To interpret the results of this study, the authors suggest that mechanisms based on homeostatic signaling could be important to allow the rebalancing of the activity of assemblies of co-tuned neurons. In particular, the authors try to rule out the possibility that inhibition plays a central role. Both mechanisms could produce effects on short timescales, making them potential candidates. The authors quantify the spatial distribution of the balanced non-targeted cells and show that they are not localized in the vicinity of the targeted cells. They conclude that local inhibition is unlikely to be responsible for the observed effect. This argument raises some questions. The method used to quantify spatial distribution calculates the minimum distance of a non-target cell to any target cell. If local inhibition is activated by the closest target cell, one would expect the decrease in activity to be stronger for non-target cells with a small minimum distance and to fade away for larger minimum distances. This is not what the authors observe (Figure 4B), so they reject inhibition as a plausible explanation. However, their quantification doesn't exclude the possibility that non-target cells in the minimum distance range could also be close and connected to the other 4 target cells, thus masking any inhibitory effect mediated by the closest target cell. In addition, the authors should provide a quantitative estimate of the range of local inhibition in layers 2/3 of the mouse auditory cortex to compare with the range of distances examined in this study (&lt; 300 µm). Finally, the possibility that some target cells could be inhibitory cells themselves is considered unlikely by the authors, given the proportions of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the upper cortical layers. On the other hand, it should be acknowledged that inhibitory cells are more electrically compact, making them easier to be activated optogenetically with low laser power.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Minimum distance is defined as the smallest distance non-target cell to any of the target cells. Thus, if this is local inhibition, it is likely that the closest target cell would have affected the non-target cells’ response changes. We also calculated the distance based on the center of mass of target cells to calculate the distance effect for an additional verification, based on both Reviewers’ comments, and still observed no distance related stimulation effect. The result is now updated in Figure 4B.</p>
<p>Based on previous literature, such as Levy &amp; Reyes 2012, the excitatory and inhibitory connectivity is known to range around 100 um distance. Our results do not necessarily show any further effect observed for cells with distance below 100 um. This suggests that such effect is not limited to local inhibition. We also added further speculation on why our results are less likely due to increased inhibition, albeit the biological characteristics of inhibitory neurons to optogenetics.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors optogenetically stimulate 5 neurons all preferring the same pure tone frequency (16 or 54 kHz) in the mouse auditory cortex using a holography-based single cell resolution optogenetics during sound presentation. They demonstrate that the response boosting of target neurons leads to a broad suppression of surrounding neurons, which is significantly more pronounced in neurons that have the same pure tone tuning as the target neurons. This effect is immediate and spans several hundred micrometers. This suggests that the auditory cortical network balances its activity in response to excess spikes, a phenomenon already seen in visual cortex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is based on a technologically very solid approach based on single-cell resolution two-photon optogenetics. The authors demonstrate the potency and resolution of this approach. The inhibitory effects observed upon targeted stimulation are clear and the relative specificity to co-tuned neurons is statistically clear although the effect size is moderate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The evaluation of the results is brief and some aspects of the observed homeostatic are not quantified. For example, it is unclear whether stimulation produces a net increase or decrease of population activity, or if the homeostatic phenomenon fully balances activity. A comparison of population activity for all imaged neurons with and without stimulation would be instructive. The selectivity for co-tuned neurons is significant but weak. Although it is difficult to evaluate this issue, this result may be trivial, as co-tuned neurons fire more strongly. Therefore, the net activity decrease is expected to be larger, in particular, for the number of non-co-tuned neurons which actually do not fire to the target sound. The net effect for the latter neurons will be zero just because they do not respond. The authors do not make a very strong case for a specific inhibition model in comparison to a broad and non-specific inhibitory effect. Complementary modeling work would be needed to fully establish this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising important points. We agree that the term homeostatic balancing may have been an overstatement. We toned down regarding the homeostatic plasticity and conclude the result from the rapid plasticity at a single trial level now. Regardless, the average activity level did not differ among stimulation conditions (control, 16kHz stim, and 54kHz stim), which seems to suggest that overall activity level has been maintained regardless of the stimulation. We added a new figure of the global activity change as Fig. 4A.</p>
<p>We also added a simple model work in which a suppression term was applied either to all neurons or specifically to non-target co-tuned cells to test our results from the data.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) For the first holography paper in A1, more information is needed about how holographic stimulation was performed and how stimulation artifacts were avoided or removed from the data set, especially as the text states that the PMTs were left open for the duration of the experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We further clarified the rationale of leaving the shutter open to avoid any mechanic sounds to activate neurons in the AC. We further clarified that we keep the uncaging shutter open since the Bruker default setting (Software version: 5.7) opens and closes the shutter for the every iteration of the stimulation which generates extra heavy mechanical sounds which then hinders whether the activation is due to the sound or stimulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The choice of the dF/F as the primary tool for quantifying data should be better justified. Presumably, cells have very different variances in baseline activity levels and baseline fluorescence levels that create a highly skewed distribution of responses across the population. Further, a</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To take the baseline activity variances into account, we first calculate dF/F normalising to the baseline period (about 330 ms before the sound onset) right before each trial, per cell level. By doing so, we minimize any effect that could have been driven by variable baseline activity levels across neurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) More analysis should be performed to determine why 33% of stimulated cells are not activated, and instead are suppressed during stimulation. Is this related to a cells baseline fluorescence?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Great point. Although we tried our best to pre-select stimulation-responsive neurons before we start the actual experiments and head fix the animals as much as possible, these neurons do not stay as the “best stimulation-responsive neurons” throughout the entire imaging session. There can be various caveats on this. First, they seem to change their activity levels due to the optogenetic stimulation after they are exposed to acoustic stimulation. Second, since the AC is in the temporal side, it is likely to be more affected from the animals’ and their brain movements throughout the imaging session, which could be bigger than visual cortex or motor cortex. However, 33% of 5 cells is about 1.5 cells so it is usually missed about one cell on average, although some sessions have all 5 cells being stimulated while some other sessions have clearly less effective holographic stimulation effect.</p>
<p>We even manually visualised the fluorescence change due to the holographic stimulation before we start any imaging sessions. Regardless, they don’t stay as the ‘best stimulation responsive cells’ throughout which we cannot control the natural biological aspect of neuronal activities. Regardless, based on the significant stimulation effects observed by presenting different pure tone frequencies as well as delivering different target stimulation and no-stimulation control, we believe that the effect itself is valid. We added these caveats into the manuscript as a further discussion point and things to consider.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The linear mixed-effects model should include time as a variable as A) the authors hypothesize that responses should be reduced over time due to sensory adaptation and that B) stimulation induced suppression might be dynamic (though they find it is not).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since the stimulation effect seems to be independent from trial-by-trial changes among stimulation conditions (Fig. 4) and we now have toned down on the aspect of homeostasis, we kept the current mixed-effect model variables.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) More speculation is needed on why stimulation suppresses responses from the first trial onwards.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We further speculate such rapid response changes due to activity-dependent synaptic changes due to overall network energy shift from optogenetic stimulation to maintain the cortical circuit balance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) What does each dot represent in Figure 4a vs. Figure 4B? They are very different in number.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In 4A, each dot is average amplitude change values per each trial level. They are exactly same number of dots between frequency, cell groups and conditions as each dot represents each trial (20 each). The reason why it may look differ could be only due to some overlaps between frequencies.</p>
<p>In 4B, each dot is each cell. The reason why it’s denser in Stimulation conditions’ 16kHz preferring cells panel is that it naturally had more FOVs thus more cells to be plotted. We further clarified these details in the figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) How sensory responsive neurons were selected should be shown in the figures. Specifically, which fraction of the 30% of most responsive neurons were stimulated should be stated. Depending on the exact yield in the field of view, all or only a minority of strongly sensory responsive neurons are being stimulated, which in either case would color the interpretation of the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We tried varying the FOV as much as possible across sessions to ensure that FOVs are directly in the A1 covering a range of frequencies. If we cannot observe more than 80 neurons as sound responsive neurons from processed suite2p data, we searched for another FOV.</p>
<p>We now included an example FOV of the widefield imaging we first conducted to identify A1, and another example FOV of the 2-photon imaging where we conducted a short sound presentation session to identify the sensory responsive neurons, as an inset of the ‘Cell selection’ part in Figure 1.</p>

<p>- p.12, analysis: it is not clearly explained why the sound evoked activity is computed based on the 160ms to 660ms after sound onset instead of 0ms to 660 ms. It is likely related to some potential contamination but it should be explicitly explained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Due to the relatively slow calcium transient to more correctly capture the sound related evoked responses. Added this detail.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Methods, analysis: the authors should better explain how they conducted the random permutation described in the Figures 1D, 2B and 2E. Which signals were permutated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Random permutation to shuffle the target cell ID.</p>

<p>- References 55 and 56 don't explicitly state that excitatory neurons generally have stronger responses to sound than inhibitory neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this error. We replaced those references with Maor et al. 2016 and Kerlin et al. 2010, showing excitatory neurons show more selective tuning, and also changed the wording more appropriately.</p>

<p>- It is not explained whether the imaging sessions are performed on awake or anaesthetized animals. It is probably done on awake animals, but then it is not clear what procedure is used to get the animals used to the head restraint. It usually takes a few days for the mice to get used to it, and the stress level is often different at the beginning and end of an experiment. Given the experimental protocol used in the study, in which sessions are performed sequentially and compared to each other, this aspect could play a role. However, the main comparison made is probably safe as it compares a control condition (laser at 0mW) and conditions with optogenetic stimulation, all done with similar sequences of sessions.</p>

<p>The experiment was conducted on awake animals. Although we did not have any control on comparing their status in the beginning and the end of the experiment, they all had a widefield imaging session imaging session to identify the A1 region which uses the same head-fixation setup, thus they are more used to the setup when we conduct 2-photon imaging and stimulation. Regardless of the session, if animals show any sign of extra discomfort due to the unfamiliar setup, we keep them there for 10-15 minutes until they are accustomed to the setup with no movement. If they still show a sign of discomfort, we take them out and try for another day. We now included this detail on the manuscript.</p>

<p>- Evaluate the global effect of stimulation on the population activity averaged across all neurons (activated and non-activated).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions. We now included a new Figure 3A that present the population activity across all responsive cells. The average activity level did not differ among stimulation conditions (control, 16kHz stim, and 54kHz stim).</p>

<p>- Evaluate with a simple model if a population of neurons with different sound tuning receiving non-specific inhibition would not produce the observed effect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We generated a simple model in which a suppression term was applied either to all neurons or specifically to non-target co-tuned cells to test our results from the data. We took a similar range of number of neurons and FOVs to closely simulate the model to the real dataset structure. On 50 simulated calcium traces of neurons (n),</p>
<p>Trace<sub>n(t)</sub> = R<sub>n(t)</sub> – theta<sub>n</sub> + epsilon<sub>n(t)</sub></p>
<p>Where R<sub>n(t)</sub> is a response amplitude from either baseline or stimulation session, theta<sub>n</sub> is a suppression term applied either to all neurons or only to non-target co-tuned neurons, only during the stimulation session, and epsilon<sub>n(t)</sub> is additive noise. Theta was defined based on the average amount of increased activity amplitudes generated from target neurons due to the stimulation, implemented from the real dataset with extra neuron-level jitter. Similar to the real data analyses, we compared the response change between the stimulation and baseline sessions’ trace amplitudes. By comparing two different model outcomes and the real data, we observed a significant effect of the model type (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2535) = 34.943, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and interaction between the model type and cell groups was observed (<italic>F</italic>(2, 2535) = 36.348, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Applying suppression to only non-target co-tuned cells during the stimulation session yielded a significant response amplitude decrease for co-tuned cells compared to non co-tuned cells (<italic>F</italic>(1, 2535) = 45.62, p &lt; 0.0001), which resembles the real data In contrast, applying suppression to all non-target cells led to similar amplitude changes in both co-tuned and non co-tuned neurons (<italic>F</italic>(1, 2535) = 0.87, p = 0.35), which was not observed in either the real data or the simulated data restricted to co-tuned cell suppression. Therefore, the model predicts correctly that the specific suppression given to only co-tuned neurons drove the real data outcome. All of this information is now added into Methods and Results sections and the figure is added as Figure 3C.</p>
