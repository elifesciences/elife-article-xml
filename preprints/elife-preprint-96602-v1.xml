<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Establishing transepithelial ion disparities is crucial for sensory functions in animals. In insect sensory organs called sensilla, a transepithelial potential, known as the sensillum potential (SP), arises through active ion transport across accessory cells, sensitizing receptor neurons such as mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. Because multiple receptor neurons are often co-housed in a sensillum and share SP, niche-prevalent overstimulation of single sensory neurons can compromise neighboring receptors by depleting SP. However, how such potential depletion is prevented to maintain sensory homeostasis remains unknown. Here, we find that the <italic>Ih</italic>-encoded hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) channel bolsters the activity of bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons (bGRNs), albeit acting in sweet-sensing GRNs (sGRNs). For this task, HCN maintains SP despite prolonged sGRN stimulation induced by the diet mimicking their sweet feeding niche, such as overripe fruit. We present evidence that <italic>Ih</italic>-dependent demarcation of sGRN excitability is implemented to throttle SP consumption, which may have facilitated adaptation to a sweetness-dominated environment. Thus, HCN expressed in sGRNs serves as a key component of a simple yet versatile peripheral coding that regulates bitterness for optimal food intake in two contrasting ways: sweet-resilient preservation of bitter aversion and the previously reported sweet-dependent suppression of bitter taste.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glia-like support cells exhibit close physical association with sensory receptor neurons, and conduct active transcellular ion transport, which is important for the operation of sensory systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In mammals, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells have a polarized distribution of ion channels and transporters. They provide an ionic environment in the extracellular space apposing photoreceptors to aid their light sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Likewise, knockdown of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes encoding the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump or a K<sup>+</sup> channel in the supporting glial cells attenuates photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In addition to creating an optimal micro-environment, transepithelial potential differences (TEPs) are often generated to promote the functions of sensory organs. For example, the active K<sup>+</sup> transport from the perilymph to the endolymph across support cells in the mammalian auditory system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> generates high driving forces that enhance the sensitivity of hair cells by increasing K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through force-gated channels. Similar designs have been found in insect mechanosensory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and chemosensory organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, providing models to study physiological principles and components of TEP function and regulation. Many of insect sensory receptor neurons are housed in a cuticular sensory organ called the sensillum. Tight junctions between support cells separate the externally facing sensillar lymph from the internal body fluid known as hemolymph<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The active concentration of K<sup>+</sup> in the dendritic sensillar lymph produces positive sensillum potentials (SP, +30∼40 mV) as TEPs, which are known to sensitize sensory reception in mechanosensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and chemosensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Excitation of sensory neurons drains SP, accompanied by slow adaptation of the excited receptor neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This suggests that immoderate activation of a single sensory neuron can deplete SP, which decreases the activities of neurons that utilize the potential for excitation. Each sensillum for mechanosensation and chemosensation houses multiple receptor neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, overconsumption of SP by a single cell could affect the rest of the receptor neurons in the same sensillum, because the receptor neurons share the sensillum lymph. Indeed, the reduction of SP was proposed to have a negative effect on receptor neurons that are immersed in the same sensillar lymph; a dynamic lateral inhibition between olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) occurs through “ephaptic interaction”, where SP consumption by activation of one neuron was proposed to result in hyperpolarization of an adjacent neuron, reducing its response to odorants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. As expected with this SP-centered model, ephaptic inhibition was reported to be mutual between <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, again because the ORNs are under the influence of a common extracellular fluid, the sensillar lymph. Such reciprocal cancellation between concomitantly excited ORNs may encode olfactory valence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> rather than lead to signal attenuation of two olfactory inputs. Furthermore, depending on neuron size, the lateral inhibition between ORNs can be asymmetric, albeit yet to be bilateral; larger ORNs are more inhibitory than smaller ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The size dependence was suggested to be due to the differential ability of ORNs to sink SP (referred to as local field potential in the study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>), probably because larger cells have more membrane surface area and cell volume to move ions to or from the sensillar lymph.</p>
<p>Interestingly, gustatory ephaptic inhibition was recently found to be under a genetic, but not size-aided, regulation to promote sweetness-dependent suppression of bitterness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. This is accomplished by blocking one direction of ephaptic inhibition. The hyperpolarization-activated cation current in sGRNs through the <italic>Ih</italic>-encoded HCN is necessary to resist the inhibition of sGRNs laterally induced by bGRN activation. Furthermore, such unilateral ephaptic inhibition is achieved against cell size gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Larger bGRNs are readily suppressed by the activation of smaller sGRNs, but not vice versa. Thus, HCN is implemented to inhibit bGRNs in terms of unilateral ephaptic inhibition when a bitter chemical is concomitantly presented with strong sweetness. Here, in addition to the ephaptic interaction, we find that the same HCN expressed in sGRNs promotes the activity of bGRNs as a means of homeostatic sensory adaptation, for which HCN prevents sGRNs from depleting SP even with the long-term exposure to the sweet-rich environment.</p>

<title>HCN expressed in sweet-sensing GRNs is required for normal bitter GRN responses</title>
<p>The hair-like gustatory sensilla in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> labellum are categorized into L-, i-, and s-type based on their relative bristle lengths. Each sensillum contains 2 (i-type) or 4 (s- and L-type) GRNs along with a mechanosensory neuron. The i- and s-type bristle sensilla contain both an sGRN and a bGRN, while the L-type bristle sensilla do an sGRN but no bGRN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. As a model of gustatory homeostasis, we mainly examined the i-type bristles using single sensillum extracellular recording<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> because of their simple neuronal composition. Compared to WT (<italic>w</italic><sup>1118</sup> in a Canton S background), we observed reduced the spiking responses to 2 mM caffeine in two strong loss-of-function alleles of the HCN gene, <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and <italic>Ih<sup>MI03196-TG4.0/+</sup></italic> (<italic>Ih-TG4.0/+</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>). Note that <italic>Ih-TG4.0</italic> is homozygous lethal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. A copy of the <italic>Ih</italic>-containing genomic fragment {<italic>Ih</italic>} rescued the spiking defect in <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic>. The GRN responses to 50 mM sucrose were not altered in <italic>Ih</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>). Although we observe here that <italic>Ih</italic> pertains to bGRN excitability, <italic>Ih</italic> was previously found to be expressed in sGRNs but not bGRNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. To test whether HCN expression in sGRNs is required for bGRN activity, GRN-specific RNAi knockdown of <italic>Ih</italic> was performed with either <italic>Gr64f</italic>-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> <italic>or Gr89a-Gal4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. <italic>Ih</italic> knockdown in sGRNs (<italic>Gr64f-Gal4</italic>), but not bGRNs (<italic>Gr89a-Gal4</italic>), led to reduced bGRN responses to caffeine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>), indicating that HCN acts in sGRNs for a normal bGRN response. Unlike the results in <italic>Ih</italic> mutant alleles, the spiking response of <italic>Ih</italic>-knockdowned sGRNs (<italic>Gr64f</italic> cells) to 50 mM sucrose was increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>). Such differential effects of gene disruptions and RNAi on sGRN activity will be discussed with additional results below. Introduction of <italic>Ih-RF</italic> cDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> to sGRNs but not bGRNs restored the decreased spiking response to 2 mM caffeine in <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic>, corroborating that sGRNs are required to express <italic>Ih</italic> for bGRN regulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>). Interestingly, ectopic cDNA expression in bGRNs of <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> but not in sGRNs increased the spiking response to 50-mM sucrose compared to its controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1F</xref>), although the same misexpression failed to raise the spiking to 2-mM caffeine. These results suggest not only that <italic>Ih</italic> innately expressed in sGRNs is necessary for the activity of bGRNs, but also that <italic>Ih</italic> expression in one GRN may promote the activity of the other adjacent GRN in <italic>Ih</italic>-deficient animals.</p>

<title>Loss of Ih in sGRNs reduced the sensillum potential in the gustatory bristle sensilla</title>
<p>We speculated that the <italic>Ih</italic>-dependent lateral boosting across GRNs might involve a functional link between GRNs. Such a physiological component could be sensillum potential (SP), since the sensillar lymph is shared by all GRNs in the sensillum and SP sets the spiking sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. To measure SP, we repurposed the Tasteprobe pre-amplifier to record potential changes in a direct current (DC) mode (see Methods for details), which was originally devised to register action potentials from sensory neurons. With the new setting, the contact of the recording electrode with a labellar bristle induced a rise in potential (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). The recording was stabilized within 20 sec, and a raw potential value was acquired as an average of the data between the time points, 20 and 60 sec after the initial contact (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). After the examination of all the bristle sensilla of interest, the fly was impaled at the head to obtain the DC bias (DC offset), which insects are known to exhibit in the body independent of SP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A,B</xref>). To examine whether the DC bias varies at different body sites, we surveyed the DC bias at four different locations of individual animals, the abdomen, thorax, eye, and head. This effort resulted in largely invariable DC bias readings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B,C</xref>). Next, the sensillum potential was obtained by subtracting the DC bias from the raw potential value (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). We also found that we could reduce the apparent SP by deflecting the bristle sensillum by ∼45° (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D-F</xref>), activating the sensillum’s mechanosensory neuron. When we performed the same experiment with <italic>nompC<sup>f00642</sup></italic>, a loss-of-function allele of <italic>nompC</italic> that encodes a mechanosensory TRPN channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, this reduction in SP disappeared (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D-F</xref>).</p>

<p>Suggesting the role of <italic>Ih</italic> in SP regulation, <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> (∼19 and ∼10 mV for i-type and s-type sensilla, respectively) and <italic>Ih-TG4.0/+</italic> (∼15 and ∼16 mV for i-type and s-type sensilla, respectively) exhibited reduced mean SPs compared to WT in the i-type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2G</xref>) and s-type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2H</xref>) bristle sensilla (∼28 mV and ∼36 mV, respectively). We also examined whether the SP reduction could be attributed to the lack of <italic>Ih</italic> in sGRNs through GRN-specific <italic>Ih</italic> RNAi knockdown. This revealed that <italic>Ih</italic> is necessary in sGRNs for the sensilla to exhibit normal SP levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2I,J</xref>). The SP reduction observed in both bristle types of <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> could be fully restored by expressing the <italic>Ih-RF</italic> cDNA in sGRNs (<italic>Gr64f-Gal4</italic> cells). Mean SPs were measured to be ∼42 and ∼54 mV in i-type and s-type bristles, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2K,L</xref>). Interestingly, ectopic expression of the cDNA in bGRNs by <italic>Gr89a-Gal4</italic> also significantly rescued the SP defect of <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> to the level of mean SPs (∼27 and ∼33 mV in i-type and s-type bristles, respectively) comparable to those in WT. The greater extent of SP defect restoration in <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> by <italic>Ih-RF</italic> expressed in sGRNs than bGRNs indicates that <italic>Ih-RF</italic> is more effective at upholding SP in sGRNs than in bGRNs under our experimental conditions. Furthermore, the successful rescue by <italic>Ih-RF</italic> in bGRNs also shows that <italic>Ih</italic> can regulate SP in any GRN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2K,L</xref>).</p>

<title>Inactivation of sGRNs raised both bGRN activity and SP, which was reversed by Ih deficiency</title>
<p>Since it is in sGRNs that HCN regulates the bGRN responsiveness to caffeine, we suspected that the activity of sGRNs may be closely associated with the maintenance of bGRN excitability. In line with this possibility, the <italic>Gr64af</italic> deletion mutant, which lacks the entire <italic>Gr64</italic> gene locus and cannot detect sugars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, showed increased bGRN responses to various bitters in labellar gustatory bristle sensilla compared to WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>). Furthermore, silencing sGRNs (<italic>Gr5a-Gal4</italic> cells) by expressing the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, phenocopied <italic>Gr64af</italic> in response to 2-mM caffeine stimulating the i-type bristles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B</xref>). This increased responsiveness of bGRNs is unlikely due to positive feedback resulting from the sGRN inactivation through the neural circuitry in the brain, because the tetanus toxin light chain (TNT) expressed in sGRNs, which blocks chemical synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, failed to raise bGRN activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>). Strikingly, when we combined the sGRN-hindering genotypes (<italic>Gr5a&gt;Kir2.1</italic> and <italic>Gr64af</italic>) with the <italic>Ih</italic> alleles <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> or <italic>Ih-TG4.0,</italic> we found that the sGRN inhibition-induced increase in bGRN activity in response to caffeine could be commonly relieved by the disruptions in the <italic>Ih</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B,E</xref>). This result suggests that HCN suppresses sGRN activation, while HCN expressed in sGRNs is required for unimpaired bGRN activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C,E</xref>). Interestingly, Kir2.1-induced inactivation of sGRNs (<italic>Gr64f-Gal4</italic> cells) dramatically increased the mean SP of the i-type bristles to ∼53 mV, compared to ∼29 and ∼35 mV of <italic>Gal4</italic> and <italic>UAS</italic> controls, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D</xref>), and the impairment of sucrose-sensing in the <italic>Gr64af</italic> mutants also resulted in increases of mean SPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3F</xref>, ∼56 and ∼53 mV in the i- and s-bristles of <italic>Gr64af</italic>, compared to ∼30 and ∼36 mV of WT, respectively). Thus, inactivating sGRNs in two different ways increased SP in the i- and s-type gustatory bristles, similar to the effect on bGRN activity described earlier. Such repeated parallel shifts of bGRN activity and SP were again obtained in the combined genotypes between <italic>Gr64af</italic> and <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> or <italic>Ih-TG4.0/+</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3F</xref>); the SP increased in <italic>Gr64af</italic> descended to WT levels when combined with <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> and <italic>Ih-TG4.0/+</italic>, similar to what occurred with bGRN activity in <italic>Gr64af</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3E</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Ih</italic> gene expression suppresses sGRNs, upholding both bGRN activity and SP, similar to the genetic alterations that reduce sGRN activity.</p>

<title>HCN delimits excitability of HCN-expressing GRNs, and increases SP</title>
<p>By misexpressing <italic>Ih-RF</italic> in bGRNs of WT flies, we investigated how HCN physiologically controls HCN-expressing GRNs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A-C</xref>). The genetic controls, <italic>Gr89a-Gal4/+</italic> and <italic>UAS-Ih-RF/+</italic>, exhibited mutually similar dose dependencies saturated at 2- and 10-mM caffeine, revealing the maximal caffeine responses at these concentrations. Interestingly, the ectopic expression reduced bGRN activity at these high caffeine concentrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>). The flattened dose dependence suggests that ectopically expressed HCN suppresses strong excitation of bGRNs. In contrast, sGRNs were upregulated by the misexpression of <italic>Ih</italic> in bGRNs with increased spiking in response to 10- and 50-mM sucrose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Ih</italic> reduces the activity of <italic>Ih</italic>-expressing GRNs, and increases that of the neighboring GRN. The <italic>Ih-RF</italic>-overexpressing sGRNs in <italic>Gr64f-Gal4</italic> cells significantly decreased only the response 5 sec after contacting 50-mM sucrose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4C</xref>, the second 5-sec bin), probably because of native HCN preoccupying WT sGRNs. Although bGRNs were repressed by misexpressing <italic>Ih-RF</italic>, the mean SP increased to ∼40 and ∼37 mV in the i- and s-type bristles, respectively, compared to controls with mean SPs of 22-25 mV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4D</xref>). These results from misexpression experiments corroborate the postulation that sGRNs are suppressed by expressing HCN. To confirm that sGRNs are suppressed by native HCN, the impact of GRN-specific <italic>Ih</italic> RNAi knockdown on sGRNs was quantitatively evaluated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4E</xref>). <italic>Ih</italic> RNAi in sGRNs led to increased mean spiking frequencies by ∼10 Hz in response to 1-, 5-, and 10-mM as well as 50-mM sucrose, compared to <italic>Ih</italic> RNAi in bGRNs. In contrast, SP, necessary for GRN sensitization, was observed above to be reduced by <italic>Ih</italic> RNAi in sGRNs but not bGRNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2I,J</xref>), highlighting the extent to which HCN natively expressed in sGRNs suppresses sGRN excitability. Thus, the quantitative RNAi experiments suggest that HCN innately reduces the spiking frequencies of sGRNs even at a relatively low sucrose concentrations, 1, and 5 mM. This result is similar to the suppressive effect of <italic>Ih-RF</italic> misexpressed in bGRNs at relatively high caffeine concentrations, but differs in that the misexpression did not alter bGRN activity in response to low caffeine concentrations, 0.02 and 0.2 mM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref>), implying a complex cell-specific regulation of GRN excitability.</p>

<title>Sweetness in the food leads to reduction of SP, bGRN activity, and bitter avoidance in Ih-deficient animals</title>
<p>Typically, we performed extracellular recordings on flies 4-5 days after eclosion, during which they were kept in a vial with fresh regular cornmeal food containing ∼400 mM D-glucose. The presence of sweetness in the food would impose long-term stimulation of sGRNs, potentially requiring the delimitation of sGRN excitability for the homeostatic maintenance of gustatory functions. To investigate this possibility, we fed WT and <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> flies overnight with either non-sweet sorbitol alone (200 mM) or a sweet mixture of sorbitol (200 mM) + sucrose (100 mM). Although sorbitol is not sweet, it is a digestible sugar that provides <italic>Drosophila</italic> with calories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. We found that the sweet sucrose medium significantly reduced caffeine-induced bGRN responses in both genotypes compared to the sorbitol only medium, but <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> bGRN spike frequencies were decreased even more than WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5A</xref>), as seen above with the cornmeal food (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs.1A,C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). This suggests that the reduced bGRN activity in the mutants is correlated with prolonged sGRN excitation. Like the bGRN response, the SP reduction was induced by the sweet sucrose medium, nearly depleting SP in HCN-deficient animals compared to WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5B</xref>) like the observation with the cornmeal food (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs.2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Even on the sorbitol food, the SP in <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> was significantly decreased compared to WT.

<p>To assess the behavioral implications of HCN-assisted preservation of SP and bGRN activity, flies were exposed long-term to sweetness on a regular sweet cornmeal diet (sweet exposure-positive), and then subjected to a CAFE with an 8-hr choice between water and 4 mM caffeine solution. Note that sucrose was not used in CAFE, because the presence of sweet stimuli was shown to suppress bGRNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Indicative of reduced bitter sensitivity, <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> flies showed dramatically decreased caffeine avoidance, relative to WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5C</xref>). In contrast, when flies were removed from the cornmeal food for 20 hrs, both WT and <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> showed similarly robust bitter avoidance. The defect observed in the <italic>Ih</italic> mutant on the sweet cornmeal diet could be rescued by reintroducing a genomic fragment covering the <italic>Ih</italic> locus ({<italic>Ih</italic>}). To examine whether caffeine avoidance requires <italic>Ih</italic> expression in sGRNs, CAFE was performed with GRN-specific RNAi knockdown of <italic>Ih</italic>. For the RNAi experiments, flies were kept overnight on either the non-sweet diet with sorbitol (200 mM) or the sweet diet with additional sucrose (100 mM). <italic>Ih</italic> knockdown in sGRNs, but not bGRNs, led to a deficit in the avoidance only when the flies were on the sweet diet, indicating that HCN expression in sGRNs is necessary for robust caffeine avoidance in a sweet environment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5D</xref>). Therefore, the sweetness of the diet has the potential to compromise the function of bGRNs co-housed with sGRNs in the same sensilla, a gustatory dysfunction that is mitigated by HCN expression in sGRNs. Such a role of HCN is essential for bitter avoidance of flies, considering their likely prolonged exposure to sweetness in their natural habitat of overripe fruit.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results provide multiple lines of evidence that HCN suppresses HCN-expressing GRNs, thereby sustaining the activity of neighboring GRNs within the same sensilla. We propose that this modulation occurs by restricting SP consumption through HCN-dependent neuronal suppression rather than via chemical and electrical synaptic transmission. The lack of increased bGRN activity with TNT expression in sGRNs, coupled with the increase observed with Kir2.1 expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B,C</xref>), indicates minimal involvement of synaptic vesicle-dependent transmission. The possibility of a neuropeptide-dependent mechanism is unlikely, given our ectopic gain-of-function studies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). To explain the misexpression results with neuropeptide pathways, both s- and bGRNs must be equipped with the same set of a neuropeptide/receptor system, which is incompatible with the observed inverse relationship between the two GRNs in excitability. Furthermore, this inverse relationship argues against electrical synapses through gap junctions, which typically synchronize the excitability of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Therefore, our findings propose an unconventional mechanism of neuronal interaction.</p>
<p>HCNs are encoded by four different genes in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, and are known to be present in mammalian sensory receptor cells. In cochlear hair cells, HCN1 and HCN2 were reported to form a complex with a stereociliary tip-link protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, while in vestibular hair cells, HCN1 is essential for normal balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. HCN1 was also immunostained in cone and rod photoreceptors, as well as retinal bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion neurons, with deletion of the encoding gene resulting in prolonged light responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. A subset of mouse taste cells was labeled for HCN1 and HCN4 transcripts and proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, similar to our observation of selective HCN expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> GRNs. HCN2 is expressed in small nociceptive neurons that mediate diabetic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. However, the precise roles of HCNs in regulating these respective sensory physiologies remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>HCN is well-known for its ‘funny’ electrophysiological characteristics, stabilizing the membrane potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. As a population of HCN channels remains open at the resting membrane potential, HCN serves to restrain neuronal excitation in two ways. First, it increases the inward current required to depolarize the membrane and trigger action potentials, owing to the low membrane input resistance resulting from the HCN-dependent passive conductance. Second, the closing of HCN induced by membrane depolarization counteracts the depolarization, since the reduction of the standing cation influx through HCN is hyperpolarizing. Conversely, HCNs also allow neurons to resist membrane hyperpolarization because the hyperpolarization activates HCNs to conduct depolarizing inward currents. Consequently, HCN channels effectively dampen fluctuations in membrane potential, whether towards depolarization or hyperpolarization. Our findings in this study align with the former property of HCNs, as <italic>Drosophila</italic> HCN is essential for moderating sGRN excitation to preserve SP and bGRN activity when flies inhabit in sweet environments. On the other hand, our previous study showed that HCN-dependent resilience to hyperpolarizing inhibition of sGRNs lateralizes gustatory ephaptic inhibition to dynamically repress bGRNs, when exposed to strong sweetness together with bitterness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, depending on the given feeding contexts, the electrophysiological properties of HCN in sGRNs lead to playing dual roles with opposing effects in regulating bGRNs. The stabilization of membrane potential by HCNs was reported to decrease the spontaneous activity of neurons, as evidenced by miniature postsynaptic currents suppressed by presynaptic HCNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In this regard, the lower SP observed in the <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> labellar bristles than that of WT, even on the nonsweet sorbitol food (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5B</xref>), may be attributed to the more facile fluctuations in resting membrane potential which could regulate the consumption of SP (further discussion below).</p>
<p>Cell-specific knockdown of <italic>Ih</italic> in sGRNs led to increased sGRN responses to 50-mM sucrose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>), although disruptions of the <italic>Ih</italic> locus did not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>). This inconsistency may stem from differences between alleles and the RNAi knockdown in residual <italic>Ih</italic> expression or in <italic>Ih</italic>-deficient sites. The lack of <italic>Ih</italic> in sGRNs can induce two different effects in neuronal excitation: 1) easier depolarization of sGRNs due to the loss of standing HCN currents at rest (as suggested in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4E</xref>) and 2) a decrease of receptor-mediated inward currents, expected due to SP reductions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2G-L</xref>). Assuming that some level of HCN expression may persist in RNAi knockdowns compared to mutants, these opposing effects on sGRN excitability may largely offset each other in response to 50-mM sucrose in the <italic>Ih</italic> mutants, but not in the knockdowned flies. The ectopic introduction of <italic>Ih-RF</italic> into bGRNs of <italic>Ih<sup>f03355</sup></italic> significantly increased the mean SP compared to the control genotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2K,L</xref>), leaving sGRNs devoid of functional <italic>Ih</italic>. This genotype allows the examination of sGRNs lacking <italic>Ih</italic>, with SP unimpaired, which is supposed to reflect the net effect of <italic>Ih</italic> on sGRN excitability excluding the influence from reduced SP. Interestingly, the ectopic rescue resulted in elevated firing responses to 50-mM sucrose compared to the cDNA rescue in sGRNs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1F</xref>), a proper control with <italic>Ih</italic> expression and SP both unimpaired. On the other hand, the differing sites of <italic>Ih</italic> deficiency might create the inconsistency. The protein trap reporter <italic>Ih-TG4.0-Gal4</italic> previously showed widespread expression of HCN in the labellum, including non-neuronal cells, implying the possibility of unknown bGRN-regulating HCN-dependent mechanisms, potentially harbored in nonneuronal cells. Overall, our cell-specific loss-of-function and gain-of function studies advocate that HCN suppresses HCN-expressing GRNs, which thereby increases SP to promote the activity of the neighboring GRNs.</p>
<p>Only the dendrites of GRNs face the sensillar lymph, separated from the hemolymph by tight junctions between support cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The inward current through the ion channels that respond to sensory reception in the dendrites is thought to be a major sink for SP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, consistent with the incremented SP in the <italic>Gr64af</italic> mutant lacking the sucrose-sensing molecular receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Based on these points, it was somewhat unexpected that the membrane potential regulator HCN preserved SP, yet implying that the sensory signaling in the dendrite is likely under voltage-dependent control. In line with HCN, shifting the membrane potential toward the K<sup>+</sup> equilibrium by overexpressing Kir2.1 in sGRNs upregulated bGRN activity and SP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3</xref>), corroborating that the membrane potential in sGRNs is a regulator of the sensory signaling cascade in the dendrites. Note that the sensillum lymph contains high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, which would not allow strong inactivation of sGRNs and SP increases if Kir2.1 operates mostly in the dendrites. The increases in SP, coinciding with the apparent silencing of sGRNs by Kir2.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, propose that lowering the membrane potential in the soma and the axon suppresses the consumption of SP probably by inhibiting the gustatory signaling-associated inward currents in the dendrite. Para, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> voltage-gated sodium channel, was reported to be localized in the dendrites of mechanosensitive receptor neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> chordotonal organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Similarly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> voltage-gated calcium channels have been studied in dendrites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, implying that membrane potential may be an important contributor to the sensory signaling in dendrites.</p>
<p>There are ∼14,500 hair cells in the human cochlea at birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. These hair cells share the endolymph in the scala media (cochlear duct), representing a case of TEP shared by a large group of sensory receptor cells. Since HCNs were found to be unnecessary for mechanotransduction itself in the inner ear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, they may play a regulatory role in fine-tuning the balance between the endocochlear potential maintenance and mechanotransduction sensitivity for hearing, as in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gustatory system. Multiple mechanosensory neurons are found to be co-housed also in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mechanosensory organs such as hair plates and chordotonal organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Given that each mechanosensory neuron is specifically tuned to detect different mechanical stimuli such as the angle, velocity, and acceleration of joint movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, some elements of these movements may occur more frequently and persistently than others in a specific ecological niche. Such biased stimulation would require HCN-dependent moderation to preserve the sensitivity of other mechanoreceptors sharing the sensillar lymph. We showed that ectopic expression of <italic>Ih</italic> in bGRNs also upheld SP and the activity of the neighboring sGRNs, underscoring the independent capability of HCN in SP preservation. Despite such an option available, the preference for sGRNs over bGRNs in HCN-mediated taste homeostasis implies that <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> may have ecologically adapted to the high sweetness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> prevalent in their feeding niche, such as overripe or fermented fruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. It would be interesting to investigate whether and how respective niches of various insect species differentiate the HCN expression pattern in sensory receptor neurons for ecological adaptation.</p>
<p>In this report, we introduce a peripheral coding design for feeding decisions that relies on HCN. HCN operating in sGRNs allows uninterrupted bitter avoidance, even when flies reside in sweet environments. This is achieved in parallel with an ephaptic mechanism of taste interaction by the same HCN in sGRNs, whereby bitter aversion can be dynamically attenuated in the simultaneous presence of sweetness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Further studies are warranted to uncover similar principles of HCN-dependent adaptation in other sensory contexts. It would also be interesting to explore whether the role of HCN in the sensory adaptation consistently correlates with lateralized ephaptic inhibition between sensory receptors, given that sensory cells expressing HCN can resist both depolarization and hyperpolarization of the membrane.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study identifies new types of interactions between Drosophila gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) and shows that these interactions influence sensory responses and behavior. The authors find that HCN, a hyperpolarization-activated cation channel, suppresses the activity of GRNs in which it is expressed, preventing those GRNs from depleting the sensillum potential, and thereby promoting the activity of neighboring GRNs in the same sensilla. HCN is expressed in sugar GRNs, so HCN dampens the excitation of sugar GRNs and promotes the excitation of bitter GRNs. Impairing HCN expression in sugar GRNs depletes the sensillum potential and decreases bitter responses, especially when flies are fed on a sugar-rich diet, and this leads to decreased bitter aversion in a feeding assay. The authors' conclusions are supported by genetic manipulations, electrophysiological recordings, and behavioral assays.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Non-synaptic interactions between neurons that share an extracellular environment (sometimes called &quot;ephaptic&quot; interactions) have not been well-studied, and certainly not in the insect taste system. A major strength of this study is the new insight it provides into how these interactions can impact sensory coding and behavior.</p>
<p>(2) The authors use many different types of genetic manipulations to dissect the role of HCN in GRN function, including mutants, RNAi, overexpression, ectopic expression, and neuronal silencing. Their results convincingly show that HCN impacts the sensillum potential and has both cell-autonomous and nonautonomous effects that go in opposite directions. There are a couple of conflicting or counterintuitive results, but the authors discuss potential explanations.</p>
<p>(3) Experiments comparing flies raised on different food sources suggest an explanation for why the system may have evolved the way that it did: when flies live in a sugar-rich environment, their bitter sensitivity decreases, and HCN expression in sugar GRNs helps to counteract this decrease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses/Limitations:</p>
<p>(1) The genetic manipulations were constitutive (e.g. Ih mutations, RNAi, or misexpression), and depleting Ih from birth could lead to compensatory effects that change the function of the neurons or sensillum. Using tools to temporally control Ih expression could help to confirm the results of this study.</p>
<p>(2) The behavioral experiment shows a striking loss of bitter sensitivity, but it was only conducted for one bitter compound at one concentration. It is not clear how general this effect is. The same is true for some of the bitter GRN electrophysiological experiments that only tested one compound and concentration.</p>
<p>(3) Several experiments using the Gal4/UAS system only show the Gal4/+ control and not the UAS/+ control (or occasionally neither control). Since some of the measurements in control flies seem to vary (e.g., spiking rate), it is important to compare the experimental flies to both controls to ensure that any observed effects are in fact due to the transgene expression.</p>
<p>(4) I was surprised that manipulations of sugar GRNs (e.g. Ih knockdown, Gr64a-f deletion, or Kir silencing) can impact the sensillum potential and bitter GRN responses even in experiments where no sugar was presented. I believe the authors are suggesting that the effects of sugar GRN activity (e.g., from consuming sugar in the fly food prior to the experiment) can have long-lasting effects, but it wasn't entirely clear if this is their primary explanation or on what timescale those long-lasting effects would occur. How much / how long of a sugar exposure do the flies need for these effects to be triggered, and how long do those effects last once sugar is removed?</p>
<p>(5) The authors mention that HCN may impact the resting potential in addition to changing the excitability of the cell through various mechanisms. It would be informative to record the resting potential and other neuronal properties, but this is very difficult for GRNs, so the current study is not able to determine exactly how HCN affects GRN activity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors start by showing that HCN loss-of-function mutation causes a decrease in spiking in bitter GRNs (bGRN) while leaving sweet GRN (sGRN) response in the same sensillum intact. They show that a perturbation of HCN channels in sweet-sensing neurons causes a similar decrease while increasing the response of sugar neurons. They were also able to rescue the response by exogenous expression. Ectopic expression of HCN in bitter neurons had no effect. Next, they measure the sensillum potential and find that sensillum potential is also affected by HCN channel perturbation. These findings lead them to speculate that HCN in sGRN increases sGRN spiking which in turn affects bGRNs. To test this idea that carried out multiple perturbations aimed at decreasing sGRN activity. They found that decreasing sGRN activity by either using receptor mutant or by expressing Kir (a K+ channel) in sGRN increased bGRN responses. These responses also increase the sensillum potential. Finally, they show that these changes are behaviorally relevant as conditions that increase sGRN activity decrease avoidance of bitter substances.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>There is solid evidence that perturbation of sweet GRNs affects bitter GRN in the same sensillum. The measurement of transsynaptic potential and how it changes is also interesting and supports the authors' conclusion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The ionic basis of how perturbation in GRN affects the transepithelial potential which in turn affects the second neuron is not clear.</p>

<p>Ephaptic inhibition between neurons housed in the same sensilla has been long discovered in flies, but the molecular basis underlying this inhibition is underexplored. Specifically, it remains poorly understood which receptors or channels are important for maintaining the transepithelial potential between the sensillum lymph and the hemolymph (known as the sensillum potential), and how this affects the excitability of neurons housed in the same sensilla.</p>
<p>Lee et al. used single-sensillum recordings (SSR) of the labellar taste sensilla to demonstrate that the HCN channel, Ih, is critical for maintaining sensillum potential in flies. Ih is expressed in sugar-sensing GRNs (sGRNs) but affects the excitability of both the sGRNs and the bitter-sensing GRNs (bGRNs) in the same sensilla. Ih mutant flies have decreased sensillum potential, and bGRNs of Ih mutant flies have a decreased response to the bitter compound caffeine. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Ih in bGRNs also increases sGRN response to sucrose, suggesting that Ih-dependent increase in sensillum potential is not specific to Ih expressed in sGRNs. The authors further demonstrated, using both SSR and behavior assays, that exposure to sugars in the food substrate is important for the Ih-dependent sensitization of bGRNs. The experiments conducted in this paper are of interest to the chemosensory field. The observation that Ih is important for the activity in bGRNs albeit expressed in sGRNs is especially fascinating and highlights the importance of non-synaptic interactions in the taste system.</p>
<p>Despite the interesting results, this paper is not written in a clear and easily understandable manner. It uses poorly defined terms without much elaboration, contains sentences that are borderline unreadable even for those in the narrower chemosensory field, and many figures can clearly benefit from more labeling and explanation. It certainly needs a bit of work.</p>
<p>Below are the major points:</p>
<p>(1) Throughout the paper, it is assumed that Ih channels are expressed in sugar-sensing GRNs but not bitter-sensing GRNs. However, both this paper and citation #17, another paper from the same lab, contain only circumstantial evidence for the expression of Ih channels in sGRNs. A simple co-expression analysis, using the Ih-T2A-GAL4 line and Gr5a-LexA/Gr66a-LexA line, all of which are available, could easily demonstrate the co-expression. Including such a figure would significantly strengthen the conclusion of this paper.</p>
<p>(2) Throughout this paper, it is often unclear which class of labellar taste sensilla is being recorded. S-a, S-b, I-a, and I-b sensilla all have different sensitivities to bitters and sugars. Each figure should clearly indicate which sensilla is being recorded. Justification should be provided if recordings from different classes of sensilla are being pooled together for statistics.</p>
<p>(3) In many figures, there is a lack of critical control experiments. Examples include Figures 1C-F (lacking UAS control), Figure 2I-J (lacking UAS control), Figure 4E (lacking the UAS and GAL4 control, and it is also strange to compare Gr64f &gt; RNAi with Gr66a &gt; RNAi, instead of with parental GAL4 and UAS controls.), and Figure 5D (lacking UAS control). Without these critical control experiments, it is difficult to evaluate the quality of the work.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 2A could benefit from more clarification about what exactly is being recorded here. The text is confusing: a considerable amount of text is spent on explaining the technical details of how SP is recorded, but very little text about what SP represents, which is critical for the readers. The authors should clarify in the text that SP is measuring the potential between the sensillar lymph, where the dendrites of GRNs are immersed, and the hemolymph. Adding a schematic figure to show that SP represents the potential between the sensillar lymph and hemolymph would be beneficial.</p>
<p>(5) The sGRN spiking rate in Figure 4B deviates significantly from previous literature (Wang, Carlson, eLife 2022; Jiao, Montell PNAS 2007, as examples), and the response to sucrose in the control flies is not dosage-dependent, which raises questions about the quality of the data. Why are the responses to sucrose not dosage-dependent? The responses are clearly not saturated at these (10 mM to 100 mM) concentrations.</p>
<p>(6) In Figure 4C, instead of showing the average spike rate of the first five seconds and the next 5 seconds, why not show a peristimulus time histogram? It would help the readers tremendously, and it would also show how quickly the spike rate adapts to overexpression and control flies. Also, since taste responses adapt rather quickly, a 500 ms or 1 s bin would be more appropriate than a 5-second bin.</p>
<p>(7) Lines 215 - 220. The authors state that the presence of sugars in the culture media would expose the GRNs to sugar constantly, without providing much evidence. What is the evidence that the GRNs are being activated constantly in flies raised with culture media containing sugars? The sensilla are not always in contact with the food.</p>
<p>(8) Line 223. To show that bGRN spike rates in Ih mutant flies &quot;decreased even more than WT&quot;, you need to compare the difference in spike rates between the sorbitol group and the sorbitol + sucrose group, which is not what is currently shown.</p>
<p>(9) To help readers better understand the proposed mechanisms here, including a schematic figure would be helpful. This should show where Ih is expressed, how Ih in sGRNs impacts the sensillum potential, how elevated sensillum potential increases the electrical driving force for the receptor current, and affects the excitability of the bGRNs in the same sensilla, and how exposure to sugar is proposed to affect ion homeostasis in the sensillum lymph.</p>
