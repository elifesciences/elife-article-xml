<title>Abstract</title><p>Trypanosoma brucei is the causal agent of African trypanosomiasis in humans and animals, the latter resulting in significant negative economic impacts in afflicted areas of the world. Resistance has arisen to the trypanocidal drugs pentamidine and melarsoprol through mutations in the aquaglyceroporin TbAQP2 that prevent their uptake. Here we use cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of TbAQP2 from Trypanosoma brucei, bound to either the substrate glycerol or to the sleeping sickness drugs, pentamidine or melarsoprol. The drugs bind within the AQP2 channel at a site completely overlapping that of glycerol. Mutations leading to a drug-resistant phenotype were found in the channel lining. Molecular dynamics simulations showed the channel can be traversed by pentamidine, with a low energy binding site at the centre of the channel, flanked by regions of high energy association at the extracellular and intracellular ends. Drug-resistant TbAQP2 mutants still bind pentamidine, but the much weaker binding in the centre of the channel is insufficient to compensate for the high energy processes of ingress and egress, hence impairing transport at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. These structures of an aquaporin bound to a drug and represent a novel paradigm for drug-transporter interactions and could provide new mechanisms for targeting drugs into other pathogens or human cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) remains a neglected tropical disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. It is transmitted by tsetse flies and, once symptoms are apparent, treatment is necessary to avoid fatality. The infection starts with a haemolymphatic stage that progresses to a late stage infection of the central nervous system, at which point severe neurological symptoms occur with rapid progression to coma and death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Early-stage infections are commonly treated with pentamidine and the late stage with melarsoprol, although for most cases this is now being replaced with fexinidazole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) causes billions of dollars in damage to agriculture throughout the tropics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. For both HAT and AAT, chemotherapy remains the only control option and most of the medication is old, inadequate and threatened by resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For most trypanocidal drugs, resistance is associated with mutations in the membrane transporters through which the drugs enter the trypanosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The uptake of pentamidine and melarsoprol was initially attributed to a High Affinity Pentamidine Transporter (HAPT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, which was subsequently identified as the aquaglyceroporin TbAQP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Deletions and chimeric rearrangements between TbAQP2 and the adjacent gene TbAQP3 were found to be responsible for melarsoprol-pentamidine cross-resistance (MPXR; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. To understand the differences between TbAQP2 (water/glycerol/drug transporter) and TbAQP3 (classical aquaglyceroporin transporting water/glycerol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> but not pentamidine or melarsoprol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>), mutants were made exchanging amino acids between the proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Mutation of TbAQP2 to add any of the TbAQP3 selectivity filter residues Tyr250, Trp102 or Arg256 resulted in inhibition of melarsoprol and pentamidine uptake, whereas TbAQP3 containing all three of their TbAQP2 counterparts (Leu250, Ile102, Leu256) permitted the uptake of pentamidine. However, the molecular details of the interactions between TbAQP2 and drugs as well as the resistance mechanism remained unclear, with alternative models proposing that TbAQP2 acts as a channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> or receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> for the drugs. To resolve this quandary and to resolve the molecular interactions underlying drug uptake by aquaporins, we determined the structures of TbAQP2 bound to either melarsoprol, pentamidine or the native substrate, glycerol.</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Cryo-EM structures of TbAQP2 and drug binding</title>
<p>TbAQP2 was expressed using the baculovirus expression system in insect cells and purified in the presence of either a drug (melarsoprol or pentamidine) or the substrate glycerol (see Methods, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2a,b</xref>). Structures of TbAQP2 bound to either glycerol, melarsoprol, or pentamidine were determined by electron cryogenic microscopy (cryo-EM) to overall resolutions of 3.2 Å, 3.2 Å and 3.7 Å, respectively (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figs. S2c</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4a-c</xref>). The resolution was sufficient to see the majority of the side chains and the bound drug or glycerol. All of the cryo-EM structures were virtually identical (rmsd 0.2 Å) and represented the aquaporin tetramer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>) that is typical for this family of channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The tetramer contained four channels, each consisting of a single TbAQP2 polypeptide folded into a bundle of eight α-helices (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>), two of which (helices H3 and H7) penetrated the plasma membrane only partially, as is typical for aquaporins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, the others crossing the membrane fully.</p>

</fig>
<p>Melarsoprol and pentamidine are bound in a channel formed by the TbAQP2 protomer, completely overlapping the binding site for the substrate glycerol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). The densities of the substrates were distinct from one another and are consistent with the structures of the substrates (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figs. S5</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>). The position of drug binding is consistent with a hotspot analysis performed on the structures (see Methods and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2d,e</xref>). This analysis defines likely regions where molecules may bind based on <italic>in silico</italic> docking scores of small molecule fragments docking to a model of TbAQP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (see Methods). Binding of the two glycerol molecules is mediated by a total of six hydrogen bonds, four to backbone carbonyl groups (residues Gly126, Gly127, His128, Leu129) and two to the side chain of His128 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). These are on a polar strip of residues running down the channel, that also includes Val133, which makes van der Waals contacts with the glycerol molecule closest to the cytoplasm. The remainder of the contacts are van der Waals interactions (Val222, Phe226, Ile241, Val245) on the opposite side of the channel. It is striking that all eleven amino acid residues within 3.9 Å of the two glycerol molecules also make contacts to both pentamidine and melarsoprol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Whereas the TbAQP2-glycerol contacts are equally polar and non-polar, van der Waals interactions dominate contacts between the drugs and TbAQP2. The exceptions are a hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl of Ala259 and both drugs, and a backbone carbonyl hydrogen bond between Gly126 and melarsoprol that is also seen between glycerol and TbAQP2. It is also remarkable that an overlay between the three different structures shows a very close alignment between glycerol, pentamidine and melarsoprol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) which is consistent with the channel structure being virtually identical regardless of whether a drug or glycerol is bound. The size of the channel with pentamidine bound is very similar to the glycerol-bound <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> AQP structure (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2f</xref>). The close fit of the drugs within the channel is consistent with the extremely limited modification of the drugs that is possible whilst retaining the ability to pass through the pore, including modifications that reduce flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Diamidines with fixed-angle structures such as diminazene and furamidine are not substrates for TbAQP2 but are exclusively accumulated through aminopurine transporter TbAT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. A number of amino acid residues interact only with pentamidine and/or melarsoprol and not with glycerol (Leu84, Ile110, Val114, Leu122, Leu218, Ala259, Asn261, Met260, Leu264), which is a result of the drugs being longer and extending further along the channel towards the extracellular surface when compared with glycerol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Towards the intracellular surface, only Leu122 makes contacts to the drugs and not to glycerol. In all, 19 residues in TbAQP2 interact with pentamidine, compared with 18 residues interacting with melarsoprol and 11 to the two molecules of glycerol.</p>

<p>The structure of AQP2 from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (PfAQP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> with glycerol bound is the closest structural homologue to TbAQP2 available (rmsd 0.8 Å, PDB ID 3CO2, 33% amino acid sequence identity). The overall arrangement of α-helices in TbAQP2 is identical to that in PfAQP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-d</xref>) and other aquaglyceroporins whose structures have been determined (human AQP7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, human AQP10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> GlpF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>). Despite the low identity in amino acid sequence, there are striking similarities between the structures of TbAQP2 and PfAQP in the conserved NPA/NPA motif and the positions of bound glycerol molecules in the channel. The NPA/NPA motif is found at the ends of the half-helices H3 and H7, with TbAQP2 and PfAQP similarly differing from the canonical sequences (NPS/NSA in TbAQP2 and NPS/NLA in PfAQP; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a,b</xref>). Superposition of TbAQP2 and PfAQP shows the position and rotamer of Asn-Pro-Ser in the NPS motif and both Asn and Ala in the NSA/NLA motifs are identical (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Some of the network of hydrogen bonds that maintain the structure of this region are also conserved, such as the hydrogen bonds in TbAQP2 between Asn130 and the backbone carbonyl of 260 and the backbone amine of Ala132, the hydrogen bond between Ser263 and Gln155 and the hydrogen bond between Asn261 and the backbone amide of Ser263. However, both Asn residues in the NPS/NLA motif of PfAQP form hydrogen bonds with one of the glycerol molecules in the channel, whereas the Asn residues in the NPS/NSA motif in TbAQP2 form weak van der Waals interactions with the glycerol molecules, and Asn261 also makes a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Leu129. The position of the intracellular loop between H2 and H3 is also conserved between TbAQP2 and PfAQP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) with the backbone carbonyls of residues 126, 127 and 128 aligning and all forming hydrogen bonds in both channels to glycerol molecules. The conservation in structure is reflected in the conserved position of the glycerol molecules in the intracellular half of the channel in TbAQP2 and PfAQP, although the orientation of the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol molecules differs. A divergence in the position of the extracellular loop between H6 and H7 in TbAQP2 and PfAQP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) leads to a wider channel in TbAQP2 and no ordered glycerol molecules are observed in the channel at this point, unlike in other aquaglyceroporins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Another difference between the transport of glycerol by TbAQP2 and PfAQP is that there is a water molecule coordinated between each glycerol molecule in PfAQP, whereas in TbAQP2 the glycerol molecules interact directly. Any role of water molecules in the transport of glycerol by TbAQP2 remains to be elucidated as the resolution of the current cryo-EM structure is insufficient for resolving them.</p>

<title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title>
<p>To assess the dynamic properties of the structurally-resolved pentamidine binding pose, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on TbAQP2 in a tetrameric state (see Methods). In these simulations, both the protein and pentamidine are very stable (protein RMSD = 0.17 ± 0.01 nm and pentamidine RMSD = 0.16 ± 0.03 nm, see <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7a,e</xref>) and pentamidine binding prevents water flux through the channel (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). The stability of the pentamidine is enabled by a number of extremely high occupancy interactions with specific residues lining the TbAQP2 pore (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7b</xref>). Hydrogen bond analysis reveals around 23 hydrogen bonds may be made between pentamidine and the channel (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8a,b</xref>). In contrast, water shows a different pattern of high occupancy interactions in the pore, with MD snapshots highlighting several key positions of where waters interact with the channel as they flow through (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8c</xref>). The presence of pentamidine both severely reduces the number of waters in the channel and slightly impacts their orientation (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8d,e</xref>). It was not possible to perform MD simulations of TbAQP2 in the presence of melarsoprol, because the presence of an arsenic atom causes force field parameterization issues.</p>

<p>We then explored the translocation of pentamidine through the TbAQP2 channel. The positively charged state of pentamidine suggests that it might be translocated by the ΔΨ component of the membrane potential. To test this, we applied a z-dimension electric field to simulations containing monomeric TbAQP2 in a membrane, using either a positive field (the opposite direction to the physiological membrane) or a physiologically-correct negative field. In all simulations, the resulting potential causes the pentamidine to translocate through TbAQP2, and in some simulations (1 out of 3 repeats for each condition) the pentamidine fully leaves the channel (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). For the physiologically correct negative field, the pentamidine moves downwards (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), suggesting that the membrane potential is able to import pentamidine into the cell, consistent with experimental evidence that TbAQP2-mediated pentamidine uptake is sensitive to ionophores that depolarise the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Drug resistant mutations in TbAQP2</title>
<p><italic>T. brucei</italic> contains two related aquaglyceroporins, TbAQP2 and TbAQP3, with only TbAQP2 being able to transport pentamidine and melarsoprol into the trypanosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Drug resistance has arisen through recombination between the two genes and the expression of TbAQP2-AQP3 chimeras<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. There are 68 amino acid residues that differ between TbAQP2 and TbAQP3 and the drug-resistant chimeras can contain 20-43 differences to TbAQP2 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). A number of these residues have been mutated individually in attempts to identify key residues involved in drug translocation and thus potentially resistance. At the intramembrane ends of the two transmembrane half-helices H3 and H7 are the aforementioned NSA/NPS motifs, Asn130-Ser131-Ala132 and Asn261-Pro262-Ser263, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). In aquaporins such as TbAQP3 these conserved residues are the canonical NPA/NPA motifs, and mutations were made (S131P+S263A) to convert the NSA/NPS motif in TbAQP2 to NPA/NPA. This resulted in a 95% reduction in pentamidine transport by the mutant, although this was still measurably higher than that observed in a TbAQP2 knockout cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and a similar reduction in the transport of the melarsoprol analogue cymelarsan (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>). The cryo-EM structures show that both Ser131 and Ser263 are critical in stabilising this region of the transporter through specific hydrogen bonds with Gln155 and the backbone amine group of Ala132 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) and do not make any direct interactions either to the drugs or the glycerol molecules. Thus, the decrease in pentamidine uptake observed in the S131P+S263A TbAQP2 mutant is probably more complex than previously thought, as it seems unlikely to have arisen through simple changes in transporter-drug interactions or a narrowing of the channel.</p>
<p>Based on a previous modelling study, several other mutations were predicted to potentially affect drug uptake in the TbAQP2-TbAQP3 chimeras<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Based on the cryo-EM structures, the mutated residues fall into three distinct groups: those not in the channel (I190T, W192G), those lining the channel and within van der Waals distance of pentamidine (I110W, L258Y, L264R) and those lining the channel, &gt;3.9 Å from pentamidine and observed to make contacts to pentamidine during MD simulations (L84W/M, L118W/M, L218W/M). In all instances, there was a &gt;90% decrease in pentamidine uptake) and in many cases no residual pentamidine transport was detected (e.g. I110W, L264R, L84W) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. To understand the molecular basis for the dramatic decreases observed in pentamidine transport, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on a subset of the mutants.</p>
<p>Three mutations were chosen for molecular dynamics simulations (I110W, L258Y, L264R), all of which were defective in uptake of cymelarsan (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>) as well as pentamidine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. These three residues all make high occupancy contacts to pentamidine in the MD simulations (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7b</xref>) and residues Ile110 and Leu264 make van der Waals contacts with pentamidine in the cryo-EM structure (Leu258 is 5.5 Å away from pentamidine). The double mutant L258Y+L264R was used in the MD simulations as this is found in a number of drug-resistant <italic>T. brucei</italic> strains such as P1000 and Lister 427MR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The mutant I110W is found in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> drug resistant strain R25<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, but in the absence of the L258Y+L264R double mutation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Therefore, we performed atomistic MD simulations of monomeric TbAQP2 with either the I110W (hereafter IW) or L258Y+L264R (hereafter LY/LR) mutations present, as well as with wild-type monomeric TbAQP2. Each protein was simulated both with pentamidine bound and removed (apo). The mutations do not affect TbAQP2 stability (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7e</xref>), but do destabilise pentamidine binding, causing it to shift away from the initial binding pose along the z-axis (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7c</xref>), suggesting a lowered affinity for the structural pose. The pore radii are unchanged by the mutations (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7d</xref>), meaning that this effect is likely to be a loss of specific interactions rather than a more general effect on protein structure.</p>
<p>We next computed energy landscapes for pentamidine moving along the z-axis through the channel using potential of mean force (PMF) calculations with umbrella sampling. The data for WT TbAQP2 reveals a clear energy well for the structurally resolved pentamidine at -0.2 nm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10c</xref>). The depth of this well (-40 kJ/mol) suggests a very high affinity binding site, consistent with previous kinetic analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and is much higher than previously investigated docked poses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> of pentamidine in models of TbAQP2. Notably, this energy well is much shallower for both the IW (-20 kJ/mol) and LY/LR mutants (-25 kJ/mol), representing a relative reduction in binding likelihood of about 2,800-fold and 400-fold, respectively. In biochemical terms, these changes would result in a K<sub>m</sub> shift from ∼50 nM to 50 or 300 µM, respectively, all but abolishing uptake at pharmacologically relevant concentrations; the experimental K<sub>m</sub> for pentamidine on wild type TbAQP2 is 36 nM<sup>10</sup>. The reduction in pentamidine binding likelihood is consistent with the increased z-axis dynamics seen in <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7c</xref>. Flanking the central energy well are large energy barriers at about -0.7 nm and 1 nm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), similar to those seen for urea translocation in HsAQP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. These would presumably slow pentamidine entry into and through the channel, and previous studies did reveal a slow transport rate for pentamidine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The energy barriers are highest in the IW mutant, and interestingly the inner (-0.7 nm) barrier is lower in the LY/LR mutant (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10c</xref>). In all cases, especially WT, small energy minima are observed at about -1.35 nm and +2.7 nm; these represent the drug binding at the entrance and exit of the channel (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10d</xref>). The differences in landscape between the WT and mutants helps explain how these mutations confer a resistance to pentamidine, mostly through reduced binding affinity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has only recently become accepted that the aquaglyceroporin AQP2 in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is acting as a <italic>bona fide</italic> transporter of pentamidine and melarsoprol that is essential for translocation of the drugs into the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The cryo-EM structures of TbAQP2 identify the binding site for melarsoprol and pentamidine in a wide channel that has, at least for part of the trajectory, similar dimensions to channels in other aquaglyceroporins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The overall similarity between TbAQP2 and the structures of other aquaglyceroporins suggests a similarity in the mechanism of glycerol transport, despite differences in the amino acid residues lining the channel. It also suggests that there is scope for pharmacological targeting of other aquaglyceroporins, either for uptake of cytotoxic drugs or inhibition of glycerol uptake. Leishmaniasis, for instance, is another neglected tropical disease, caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus <italic>Leishmania</italic>; it is commonly treated by pentavalent antimonials meglumine antimoniate and sodium stibogluconate. The antimony that is released in the acidic parasitophorous vacuole enters the parasite through its AQP1 aquaporin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Widespread antimonial drug resistance in <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> in India has been linked to a frameshift mutation in LdAQP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In another example, <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic> contain a single aquaglyceroporin and studies in mouse models have shown that a knockout of the aquaglyceroporin leads to a significant loss of virulence and reduction in erythrocyte infectivity by merozoites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, suggesting that a specific AQP inhibitor could be part of antimalarial treatments. Interestingly, pentamidine is a known antimalarial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and although a substrate of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> choline transporter, does not act through inhibition of that carrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>; inhibition/permeation of PfAQP by pentamidine has not been investigated to date. The structure determination of TbAQP2 highlights new opportunities for drug development targeting the aquaporin family to treat a number of parasitic diseases whose current treatments often suffer from severe side effects and growing problems in drug resistance. A thorough understanding of the interaction of extended, flexible drugs like pentamidine and melarsoprol with AQP channel linings could contribute to the design of new substrates able to penetrate not just protozoan but also human AQPs.</p>
<p>After this work was completed, a paper was published describing the structures of TbAQP2 bound to pentamidine and melarsoprol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The structures of TbAQP2 are very similar to the ones described here (RMSD 0.6 Å), despite the environments of the purified channels being significantly different. In the work described here, TbAQP2 was purified in detergent and then incorporated into saposin A (SapA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> lipid nanoparticles (see Methods), whereas Chen <italic>et al.</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> incorporated TbAQP2 into lipid nanodiscs formed from a helical membrane scaffold protein (MSP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Lipid nanodiscs and nanoparticles are considered better mimetics of a lipid bilayer than detergent micelles, although biophysical studies indicate that there are significant differences between these lipidic structures and a biological membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Comparison of the pentamidine in the different structures indicates good agreement in its position within the channel, although the pose of the drug does differ slightly (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). In contrast, there is a significant difference in the position and pose of melarsoprol between the different structures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Melarsoprol in the TbAQP2 structure from Chen <italic>et al.</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> is shifted further towards the extracellular surface of the channel and is rotated approximately 180° about an axis in the membrane plane and centred on the arsenic atom (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>). This unexpected difference in orientation of melarsoprol in the two structures may perhaps not be so surprising as could be initially thought. The two structures represent the thermodynamically most stable states under the buffer conditions and detergent/lipid nanoparticles used for protein purification, which were different. In addition, the site of localisation of the drugs in the TbAQP2 channel is not a physiologically relevant ‘binding site’ as used to describe, for example, the orthosteric binding site in G protein coupled receptors where a hormone or neurotransmitter binds. Thus, evolution has not evolved a high-affinity binding site in the TbAQP2 channel and neither were the drugs designed to bind to TbAQP2. The channel merely facilitates the entry of the drugs into the cell through passive diffusion and it is not necessary for its mode of action to bind to TbAQP2 in a specific pose. Indeed, <italic>a priori</italic>, there is no reason to think that melarsoprol has to traverse the channel in any particular orientation, although under cellular conditions where a membrane potential is present it might be anticipated that the melamine moiety may enter the channel first given its net positive charge. Regrettably, in the absence of molecular dynamics simulations (due to the issues with parameterization of the arsenic atom) these ideas have to remain untested.</p>

<p>The model for MD simulations was based on the structure of TbAQP2 with pentamidine bound and was built into simulation boxes using CHARMM-GUI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> (see <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref> for a list of systems built). Protein atoms were described with the CHARMM36m force field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> TbAQP2 was built either as a tetramer or a monomer. Side chain pK<sub>a</sub>s were assessed using propKa3.1 and side chain side charge states were set to their default<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. The pentamidine molecule used existing parameters available in the CHARMM36 database under the name PNTM with a charge state of +2. For the ligand-free simulations, the pentamidine molecule was removed prior to simulation.</p>
<p>The proteins were built into membranes comprising 20% cholesterol and 80% POPC, solvated with explicit water molecules using the TIP3P model, and neutralised with K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> to 150 mM. Box sizes were initially set to 10 × 10 × 10 nm for the tetrameric systems and 6.5 × 6.5 × 10 nm for the monomeric systems. The use of an all-atom fixed charge force field with explicit solvent and membrane is optimal to understanding the protein-drug interactions central to this study. Each system was minimized and equilibrated according to the standard CHARMM-GUI protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Production simulations using random seeds were run in the NPT ensemble with 2 fs time steps, temperatures held at 303.5 K using a velocity-rescale thermostat and a coupling constant of 1 ps, and pressure maintained at 1 bar using a semi-isotropic Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling with a coupling constant of 5 ps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Short range van der Waals and electrostatics were cut off at 1.2 nm, and the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method was used for long-range Lennard-Jones interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Hydrogen bonds were constrained using the LINCS algorithm.</p>
<p>Membrane potential simulations were run using the computational electrophysiology protocol. An electric field of 0.1 V/nm was applied in the z-axis dimension only, to create a membrane potential of about 1 V (see <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10a</xref>). Note that this is higher than the physiological value, and was chosen to improve the sampling efficiency of the simulations. The protein and lipid molecules were visually confirmed to be unaffected by this voltage.</p>
<p>Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations were built from initial steered MD pulls using an umbrella potential along a coordinate of the COM of the pentamidine molecule and the COM of select residues in TbAQP2 which form the pentamidine binding site (Leu84, Ile110, Val114, Leu122, Gly127, Leu129, Leu218, Val222, Phe226, Leu244, Val245, Ala259, Met260, and Leu264). Pulls were run in the z-axis in either a positive or negative direction, at a rate of 1 nm per ns and with a force constant of 1000 kJ/mol/nm<sup>2</sup>. Snapshots were taken along the coordinates every 0.05 nm, using a script from Dr. Owen Vickery (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3592318">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3592318</ext-link>), with a total of 167 snapshots to construct the reaction coordinate. End points for the coordinate were determined based on the pentamidine no longer making any contacts (&lt;0.4 nm) with any atoms from the protein or membrane. Simulations were run for 40 ns per window with a 5,000 kJ/mol/nm<sup>2</sup> umbrella restraint imposed to keep the system in place with respect to the reaction coordinate. An atom in Leu218 was chose as a reference for the treatment of periodic boundary conditions. Forces were written every 1 ps. PMF profiles were constructed using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> implemented in <italic>gmx wham</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> between -3.5 nm to 4.5 nm of the coordinate and with cyclisation applied. The first 50 ns of each window was discarded as equilibration time and 200 Bayesian bootstraps were used to estimate the PMF error. Adequate coverage of the landscape was assessed based on histogram overlap (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10b</xref>), and convergence was determined based on re-running the WHAM calculations on longer windows until the landscapes converged (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10c</xref>).</p>

<title>Docking and hotspots experiments</title>
<p>Fragment Hotspot Maps (FHMs) is a powerful tool for predicting the binding hotspots of small molecules on protein surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. FHMs are based on the concept that certain chemical fragments are more likely to interact with specific regions of a protein’s surface, or ‘hotspots’, than others. By systematically mapping the interactions between a library of fragment molecules and a target protein, FHMs can identify key hotspots and help guide the design of new small molecules with improved binding affinity and specificity. The development of FHMs has been driven by advances in computational methods for predicting protein-ligand interactions, as well as by improvements in experimental techniques for mapping the 3D structure of protein-ligand complexes. FHMs have been used to guide drug discovery efforts in a variety of therapeutic areas, including oncology, infectious diseases, and neurology.</p>
<p>One key advantage of FHMs is that they can help to identify &quot;druggable&quot; regions of a protein’s surface that may be otherwise difficult to target with small molecules. For example, many protein-protein interaction interfaces are large and flat, making it challenging to design small molecules that can disrupt these interactions. FHMs can help to identify the specific regions of the interface that are most important for binding and guide the design of molecules that can effectively target these regions. Another advantage of FHMs is that they can be used to predict the binding modes of small molecules that have not yet been synthesized or tested experimentally. This can be particularly useful in early-stage drug discovery, where computational methods are often used to screen large databases of compounds for potential hits. Overall, FHMs represent a powerful approach for predicting and optimizing small molecule binding to protein surfaces.</p>
<p>We used FHMs program to generate hotspots for AQP2 monomer and probe protein’s potential ligand binding sites. The superposition of the final structures and the predicted hotspot maps show a clear overlap between the hotspots and the two drugs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

<p>M.C. and S.N.W conceived the project. T.S. and S.N.W. cloned, overexpressed, purified, and analysed protein samples. J.N.B., P.C.-H., D.Y.C. and S.N.W. prepared grids, screened and collected data. M.G. and R.M. processed the raw data. M.M. and P.A. built the models and performed refinements. A.G performed further structural analyses. K.Y. and R.W. identified and fitted the substrates and performed refinements. J.M.C. advised on the processing and G.M. advised on the refinement process. V.S.C. performed hot spot analysis and T.L.B. advised. H.P.d.K. and M.C. advised the mutational studies. R.A.C. performed the molecular dynamics simulations, and R.A.C., P.S. and M.S. did the analysis of the MD simulation trajectories. M.A.U. performed cymelarsan uptake experiments. C.G.T. carried out structure analysis and S.N.W. managed the overall project. The manuscript was written by S.N.W., H.P.d.K., R.A.C. and C.G.T., and included contributions from all the authors.</p>

<p>In this <bold>important</bold> study, the authors set out to determine the molecular interactions between the AQP2 from Trypanosoma brucei (TbAQP2) and the trypanocidal drugs pentamidine and melarsoprol in order to clarify the origins of clinically observed drug resistance and facilitate future drug design. Using cryo-EM, molecular dynamics simulations, and lysis assays, the authors present a <bold>solid</bold> theory for how drug resistance mutations in TbAQP2 prevent drug uptake. Overall, even though a few methodological issues still need minor clarification, this study will be of interest to those working on aquaporins and the development of drugs targeting aquaporins.</p>

<p>This study presents cryoEM-derived structures of the Trypanosome aquaporin AQP2, in complex with its natural ligand, glycerol, as well as two trypanocidal drugs, pentamidine and melarsoprol, which use AQP2 as an uptake route. The structures are high quality, and the density for the drug molecules is convincing, showing a binding site in the centre of the AQP2 pore.</p>
<p>The authors then continue to study this system using molecular dynamics simulations. Their simulations indicate that the drugs can pass through the pore and identify a weak binding site in the centre of the pore, which corresponds with that identified through cryoEM analysis. They also simulate the effect of drug resistance mutations, which suggests that the mutations reduce the affinity for drugs and therefore might reduce the likelihood that the drugs enter into the centre of the pore, reducing the likelihood that they progress through into the cell.</p>
<p>While the cryoEM and MD studies are well conducted, it is a shame that the drug transport hypothesis was not tested experimentally. For example, did they do cryoEM with AQP2 with drug resistance mutations and see if they could see the drugs in these maps? They might not bind, but another possibility is that the binding site shifts, as seen in Chen et al. Do they have an assay for measuring drug binding? I think that some experimental validation of the drug binding hypothesis would strengthen this paper. Without this, I would recommend the authors to soften the statement of their hypothesis (i.e, lines 65-68) as this has not been experimentally validated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present 3.2-3.7 Å cryo-EM structures of Trypanosoma brucei aquaglyceroporin-2 (TbAQP2) bound to glycerol, pentamidine, or melarsoprol and combine them with extensive all-atom MD simulations to explain drug recognition and resistance mutations. The work provides a persuasive structural rationale for (i) why positively selected pore substitutions enable diamidine uptake, and (ii) how clinical resistance mutations weaken the high-affinity energy minimum that drives permeation. These insights are valuable for chemotherapeutic re-engineering of diamidines and aquaglyceroporin-mediated drug delivery.</p>
<p>My comments are on the MD part.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study</p>
<p>(1) Integrates complementary cryo-EM, equilibrium, applied voltage MD simulations, and umbrella-sampling PMFs, yielding a coherent molecular-level picture of drug permeation.</p>
<p>(2) Offers direct structural rationalisation of long-standing resistance mutations in trypanosomes, addressing an important medical problem.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unphysiological membrane potential. A field of 0.1 V nm⁻¹ (~1 V across the bilayer) was applied to accelerate translocation. From the traces (Figure 1c), it can be seen that the translocation occurred really quickly through the channel, suggesting that the field might have introduced some large changes in the protein. The authors state that they checked visually for this, but some additional analysis, especially of the residues next to the drug, would be welcome.</p>
<p>Based on applied voltage simulations, the authors argue that the membrane potential would help get the drug into the cell, and that a high value of the potential was applied merely to speed up the simulation. At the same time, the barrier for translocation from PMF calculations is ~40 kJ/mol for WT. Is the physiological membrane voltage enough to overcome this barrier in a realistic time? In this context, I do not see how much value the applied voltage simulations have, as one can estimate the work needed to translocate the substrate on PMF profiles alone. The authors might want to tone down their conclusions about the role of membrane voltage in the drug translocation.</p>
<p>Pentamidine charge state and protonation. The ligand was modeled as +2, yet pKa values might change with the micro-environment. Some justification of this choice would be welcome.</p>
<p>I don't follow the RMSD calculations. The authors state that this RMSD is small for the substrate and show plots in Figure S7a, with the bottom plot being presumably done for the substrate (the legends are misleading, though), levelling off at ~0.15 nm RMSD. However, in Figure S7a, we see one trace (light blue) deviating from the initial position by more than 0.2 nm - that would surely result in an RMSD larger than 0.15, but this is somewhat not reflected in the RMSD plots.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Recent studies have established that trypanocidal drugs, including pentamidine and melarsoprol, enter the trypanosomes via the glyceroaquaporin AQP2 (TbAQP2). Interestingly, drug resistance in trypanosomes is, at least in part, caused by recombination with the neighbouring gene, AQP3, which is unable to permeate pentamidine or melarsoprol. The effect of the drugs on cells expressing chimeric proteins is significantly reduced. In addition, controversy exists regarding whether TbAQP2 permeates drugs like an ion channel, or whether it serves as a receptor that triggers downstream processes upon drug binding. In this study the authors set out to achieve three objectives:</p>
<p>
(1) to determine if TbAQP2 acts as a channel or a receptor,</p>
<p>
(2) to understand the molecular interactions between TbAQP2 and glycerol, pentamidine, and melarsoprol, and</p>
<p>
(3) to determine the mechanism by which mutations that arise from recombination with TbAQP3 result in reduced drug permeation.</p>
<p>Indeed, all three objectives are achieved in this paper. Using MD simulations and cryo-EM, the authors determine that TbAQP2 likely permeates drugs like an ion channel. The cryo-EM structures provide details of glycerol and drug binding, and show that glycerol and the drugs occupy the same space within the pore. Finally, MD simulations and lysis assays are employed to determine how mutations in TbAQP2 result in reduced permeation of drugs by making entry and exit of the drug relatively more energy-expensive. Overall, the strength of evidence used to support the author's claims is solid.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The cryo-EM portion of the study is strong, and while the overall resolution of the structures is in the 3.5Å range, the local resolution within the core of the protein and the drug binding sites is considerably higher (~2.5Å).</p>
<p>I also appreciated the MD simulations on the TbAQP2 mutants and the mechanistic insights that resulted from this data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors do not provide any empirical validation of the drug binding sites in TbAQP2. While the discussion mentions that the binding site should not be thought of as a classical fixed site, the MD simulations show that there's an energetically preferred slot (i.e., high occupancy interactions) within the pore for the drugs. For example, mutagenesis and a lysis assay could provide us with some idea of the contribution/importance of the various residues identified in the structures to drug permeation. This data would also likely be very valuable in learning about selectivity for drugs in different AQP proteins.</p>
<p>(2) Given the importance of AQP3 in the shaping of AQP2-mediated drug resistance, I think a figure showing a comparison between the two protein structures/AlphaFold structures would be beneficial and appropriate.</p>
<p>(3) A few additional figures showing cryo-EM density, from both full maps and half maps, would help validate the data.</p>
<p>(4) Finally, this paper might benefit from including more comparisons with and analysis of data published in Chen et al (doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48445-4), which focus on similar objectives. Looking at all the data in aggregate might reveal insights that are not obvious from either paper on their own. For example, melarsoprol binds differently in structures reported in the two respective papers, and this may tell us something about the energy of drug-protein interactions within the pore.</p>
