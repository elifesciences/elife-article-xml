<title>A<sc>bstract</sc></title><p>Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP are an invaluable tool in neuroscience to monitor neuronal activity using optical imaging. The viral transduction of GECIs is commonly used to target expression to specific brain regions, can be conveniently used with any mouse strain of interest without the need for prior crossing with a GECI mouse line and avoids potential hazards due to the chronic expression of GECIs during development. A key requirement for monitoring neuronal activity with an indicator is that the indicator itself minimally affects activity. Here, using common adenoviral transduction procedures, we describe spatially confined aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves slowly travelling through the hippocampus following expression of GCaMP6, GCaMP7 or R-CaMP1.07 driven by the synapsin promoter with AAV-dependent gene transfer. Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves developed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, but not dentate gyrus (DG) nor neocortex, were typically first observed at 4 weeks after viral transduction, and persisted up to at least 8 weeks. The phenomenon was robust, observed across laboratories with various experimenters and setups. Our results indicate that aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves depend on the viral titre of the GECI under the synapsin promoter. Further, neuronal subtype, and density of GECI expression may play a role. We used an alternative viral transduction method of GCaMP which avoids this artifact. The results show that commonly used syn-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator AAV transduction procedures can produce artefactual Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Our aim is to raise awareness in the field of these artefactual transduction-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves and we provide a potential solution for this problem.</p>

<title>I<sc>ntroduction</sc></title>
<p>There has been an explosion in the use of imaging techniques to record neuronal activity over the past 30 years, starting with the introduction of organic calcium indicators to measure neuronal population activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yuste &amp; Katz 1991</xref>) and accelerated by rapid advances in the development of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Miyawaki <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>). Specific advantages of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with GECIs lie in the ability of chronic cellular scale recordings of sizeable, densely labelled neuronal or glial populations with subtype specificity, without having to perturb the cell membrane or add synthetic chemical to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Grienberger &amp; Konnerth 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Rose <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Semyanov <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Commonly used GECIs such as the GCaMP family have been continually improved since their initial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Nakai <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>), offering high signal to noise ratio, sensitivity and response kinetics such that they can detect single action potentials in vivo. This allows the reporting of cellular activity as well as the activity of sub-compartments such as the dendritic arbour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dana <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>). Typically, GCaMP is expressed using transgenic animals or adenoviral (AAV) transduction techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tian <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). The use of transgenic animals has the advantage of not requiring AAV transduction, thus reducing surgery load for animals and likelihood of indicator overexpression. In contrast, adenoviral GECI transduction is straightforward (breeding/crossing not required), can be targeted to virtually any brain region, and typically offer enhanced fluorescence (due to higher expression levels). Further, AAV transduction avoids potential hazards due to chronic GECI expression during development.</p>
<p>While offering unprecedented new insights into cellular scale neuronal network dynamics, it has also been reported in recent years that GECI expression in neurons can result in unwanted side-effects. Depending on the expression approach, neurons have shown reduced dendritic branching and impairment in cell health leading to cytotoxicity and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gasterstädt <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Resendez <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Further, increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering due to addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators has been associated with alterations in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Grienberger &amp; Konnerth 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">McMahon &amp; Jackson 2018</xref>). In addition, chronic expression of GCaMP can lead to accumulation in the nucleus and changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yang <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>). Again, depending on the specific expression approach, GCaMP variant and experimental time course, such changes may alter cellular physiology and excitability. For example, increased firing rates have been observed in hippocampal neurons expressing GCaM5G from CaMKIIa-Cre; PC::G5-tdT mice, and epileptiform activity in neocortex in some GCaMP6 expressing transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gee <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Steinmetz <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we describe micro-scale Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves that are highly confined in space, and progress slowly through the hippocampus following local GCaMP or R-CaMP viral transduction. Such aberrant hippocampal waves were typically first observed 4 weeks following injection of commercially available AAVs expressing GCaMP6, GCaMP7 or R-CaMP1.07 under the synapsin promoter. The phenomenon occurred upon GECI transduction in CA1 and CA3, but not in dentate gyrus (DG) nor neocortex, was robustly observed across laboratories with various experimenters and set-ups, and highlights the necessity of careful use of transduction methods and control measures. Reducing the transduction titre diminished the likelihood of aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, and an alternative viral transduction method employing sparser and cre-dependent GCaMP6s expression in principal cells avoided the aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. Further, in three transgenic Thy1-GCaMP mouse lines (thy1-GCaMP6s or 6f; Vglut1-IRES2-Cre-D x Ai162(TIT2L-GC6s-ICL-tTA2), aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves were never observed. The aim of this article is to raise awareness in the field of artefactual transduction-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and encourage others to carefully evaluate their Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator expression approach before embarking on chronic in vivo calcium imaging of the hippocampus.</p>

<title>Aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-wave progression through hippocampus</title>
<p>We injected AAV1 particles (pAAV.Syn.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40, Addgene #100843, titre 1×10¹³ vg/ml) in the hippocampus (total injection vol.: 500nl undiluted [1:1] virus solution) of C57BL6 wild-type animals (6 weeks old), and performed in vivo two-photon imaging to record cellular activity at 2, 4 and 6-8 weeks (wks) post-injection (p.i.) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). Viral transduction resulted in GCaMP6s expression throughout the hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG areas under the imaging window (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). As expected, the expression was primarily restricted to the ipsilateral hippocampus, with some labelling of projection pathways also in the contralateral hippocampus. At 4 wks after injection, a time point commonly used for imaging cellular activity, we observed distinctive aberrant microscale Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves that travelled through CA1 recruiting neighbouring cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c-d</xref></bold>, <bold>Supplementary video 1</bold>, n=4 mice). Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves were maintained up to 6-8 wks after AAV injections (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>, n=4 mice). These Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves were not observed at an earlier timepoint (2 wks p.i).</p>

<p>The properties of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves depended on the hippocampal region and exact recording location. For instance, although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves were consistently observed in CA1, the spatial dimensions of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves were broader in the stratum oriens compared with stratum pyramidale of CA1 (<bold>Supplementary videos 4 [str. pyr.] and 5 [str. oriens]</bold>). We next examined, if the CA1 network is particularly prone to the generation of such waves and if they show regional specificity. Upon viral syn-GCaMP6s transduction, Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves were observed in both CA1 (<bold>Supplementary videos 1-5</bold>) and CA3 (n=1; <bold>Supplementary video 6</bold>), but interestingly, not in the dentate gyrus (n=3 mice, 4, 8 &amp; 10 wks p.i., 40 min total recording time per mouse). In contrast to hippocampus, syn-GCaMP6s expression restricted to the neocortex did not result in cortical Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in our hands (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>, n = &gt;20 mice).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves in disease models</title>
<p>The observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves were distinct from local seizure activity (no rhythmicity, no typical ictal evolution, no postictal depression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Masala <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Muldoon <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wenzel <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2019a</xref>) and spreading depolarization/depression phenomena (no concentric expansion, no post-wave neural depression). However, the occurrence of these artificial events may be confused as aberrant activity related to a pathology, especially when studying pathologies with known cellular and network hyperexcitability. For example, we initially found the aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves in the <italic>Scn2a</italic><sup>A263V</sup> model of genetic epilepsy; however, these Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in CA1 of heterozygous animals (5/5 mice) were in general similar to those detected in wildtype animals at 4 wks p.i.. Only in a rare case (1/5 animals) were Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves observed at 2 wks p.i. in the <italic>Scn2a</italic><sup>A263V</sup> model (<bold>Supplementary video 2</bold>). Furthermore, hippocampal transduction of syn-jGCaMP7f (Addgene #104488, AAV9 particles, original titre 2.5×10¹³ vg/ml, total inj. vol. 1000nl [1:2 dilution]) in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (PV-Cre::APPswe/PS1dE9) also resulted in Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves (n=3/6 mice). Together, these experiments show that common AAV injection procedures of GECIs under the synapsin promoter lead to artefactual hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves in wildtype mice and genetic mouse models of disease.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Properties &amp; robustness of aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the robustness of the aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves across institutes and conditions. We chose to compare the incidence of aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves in the CA1 region in four separate institutes in three different countries following transduction of GCaMP6s (Addgene #100843; IEECR/UoB, CU), GCaMP6m or jGCaMP7f (Addgene #100841 or #104488; DZNE) or RCaMP1.07 (Viral Vector Facility UZH #V224-9; UZH, <bold>Supplementary video 3</bold>)(<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The incidence of aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves was robust, observed at the 4 different institutes each using variations of commonly used viral transduction procedures and standard two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging protocols (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold> and see methods for more details). The viral titre, however, was important as halving the original syn-GCaMP6m viral titre decreased the number of animals that developed aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves from 80% of animals (4/5, original titre, 1×10¹³ vg/mL) to 43% of animals (3/7, 50% reduced titre, 0.5×10<sup>13</sup> vg/ml) (see <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To examine how robust the Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves properties were, we compared properties across the different laboratories following expression of GCaMP6m and GCaMP6s variants. The occurrence rate of the aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves was similar across the different institutes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves were spatially confined (diameter range of 200-300 µm), moved across the field of view with slow progression speeds (speed range of 5-25 µm/sec), (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>), and displayed no rhythmicity but rather plateau-like Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. In addition, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves were not restricted to a single GECI variant or version with Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves observed following expression of GCaMP6m (n=4), GCaMP6s (n=5), and GCaMP7f (n=3), as well as following expression of R-CaMP1.07 (n=1)(<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold> and <bold>Table1</bold>).</p>

<title>Alternative transduction method of GCaMP to avoid aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves</title>
<p>In light of these results, we tested an alternative expression approach to avoid aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves. To this end, we selected an approach to both limit the expression to principal cells and label a sparse population of the principal cells using a dual AAV injection approach. Here, cre-dependent expression of syn-GCaMP6s was achieved in a sparse population of principal cells under the CaMKII promoter (AAV1.syn.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40, Addgene #100845, and AAV1.CamKII0.4.Cre SV40, Addgene #105558; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sheffield &amp; Dombeck 2015</xref>), upon which no Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves were observed (0/2 animals, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). Further, hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves were neither observed in transgenic thy1-GCaMP6s nor 6f mice (JAX strain 025776 or 024276; up to 3 months of chronic imaging in n&gt;30 mature mice age &gt;p60, cumulative imaging time &gt;200hrs) nor in Vglut1-IRES2-Cre-D mice crossed with Ai162(TIT2L-GC6s-ICL-tTA2)-D mice (JAX strains: 037512, 031562; up to 3 months of chronic imaging in n=5 mature mice &gt;p60).</p>

<title>D<sc>iscussion</sc></title>
<p>Here we report titre-and expression-time-dependent aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves in CA1 and CA3 regions following viral expression of syn-GCaMP or syn-R-CaMP1.07. These aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves robustly occurred, were observed in 4 different institutes each using a common viral transduction approach and standard two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging protocols.</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves were typically first detected at ∼4wks, rarely also at 2 wks, after injection. Thus, there may be a time window when Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity could be recorded in the absence of this artefactual phenomenon. However, we would still hesitate to use this specific approach for imaging experiments, as more subtle alterations likely occur prior to visible onset of aberrant activity. Further, at sites more distal to the injection site with lower expression levels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves may not be observed; however, it may very well be that Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves in regions with higher expression will affect fine-scaled neuronal population dynamics in primarily unaffected neighbouring regions.</p>
<p>The presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves was not restricted to a single GCaMP variant or version, and was observed using either GCaMP6m, GCaMP6s, or GCaMP7f. The phenomenon was also observed upon transduction of R-CaMP1.07, indicating that these aberrant hippocampal waves are not restricted to GCaMP indicators, but rather present a general phenomenon following syn-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator transduction. However, the viral transduction titre was a key factor, as reducing the viral transduction titre from 1×10<sup>13</sup> vc/ml (500nl or 1000nl of a 1:1 undiluted virus solution) to 5×10<sup>12</sup> vc/ml (1000nl 1:2 solution, single injection) decreased, albeit did not yet prevent, the occurrence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves. In the literature, hippocampal syn-GCaMP transduction procedures in mice typically include one to several separate nearby injections, with a total volume of transduced undiluted virus ranging from 60nl to 500nl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Cai <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jimenez <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Keinath <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Pettit <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Radvansky <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Skocek <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Szabo <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Weisenburger <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wirtshafter &amp; Disterhoft 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zaremba <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). In other studies, syn-GCaMP virus was diluted prior to injection (up to 1:10)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jimenez <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zong <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>), resulting in varied transduction volumes up to 1500nl. In our hands, a reduced viral titre of 5×10<sup>12</sup> vc/ml in a 1000nl injection volume still resulted in aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves. Thus viral transduction titres per volume well below this number and diluted transduction solutions are advisable for syn-GCaMP expression in the hippocampus, if adenoviral syn-Ca<sup>2+</sup>- indicator transduction is desired for a planned in vivo hippocampal imaging experiment.</p>
<p>If possible, alternate viral GCaMP expression approaches should be chosen. As a possible alternative, similar to previous reports using dual AAV injections or AAV in Cre-driver mouse lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Farrell <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Grosmark <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Mineur <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rolotti <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Terada <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>), we find that cre-dependent adenoviral GCaMP expression (IEECR/UoB) in pyramidal neurons does not cause aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves. Moreover, we have not observed this aberrant phenomenon in transgenic thy1-GCaMP6s or 6f mice (JAX strain 025776 or 024276)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Masala <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rupprecht <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wenzel <italic>et al</italic>. 2019b</xref>), nor in Vglut1-IRES2-Cre-D x Ai162(TIT2L-GC6s-ICL-tTA2)-D mice (JAX strains: 037512, 031562). It goes beyond the scope and available resources in our laboratories to further identify, which viral GCaMP transduction approaches avoid the reported phenomenon. It seems likely that the underlying mechanisms for this artefact comprise not only transduction titre and time period of GCaMP or R-CaMP1.07 expression, but at least also density and cell type of expression. It remains unclear if the observed phenomenon is restricted to hippocampal syn-Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator viral expression in mice, or if it extends to different animal models as well. In this regard, a previous report did not observe Ca<sup>2+</sup>-waves in rats following syn-GCaMP6m expression, although imaging was performed under isoflurane anaesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sosulina <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). Importantly, expression of GCaMP under the synapsin promoter <italic>per se</italic> does not necessary triggers the phenomenon, as cre-dependent GCaMP expression under the synapsin promoter in pyramidal neurons failed to cause Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves is possibly related to the expression of exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer and the resulting effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">McMahon &amp; Jackson 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Rose <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yang <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>), which may be why our findings extended across genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators. Beyond clearly being abnormal, the exact nature of the observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves remains unclear, and identifying the precise mechanisms underlying these waves lies beyond the scope of this article, especially as it remains unknown if this phenomenon has any physiological or pathophysiological relevance. Certainly, none of the researchers who contributed to this article have observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves with the described spatiotemporal features under healthy or pathophysiological conditions, except when syn-GCaMP or syn-R-CaMP1.07 was expressed as described here.</p>
<p>In summary, this report shows that common AAV hippocampal injection procedures of syn-Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators may lead to aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves in wildtype mice and genetic mouse models of disease, particularly if high titre virus loads are used. The aim of this article is not to discredit syn-Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, a tool that we greatly appreciate ourselves, but to sensitize the field to artefactual transduction-induced aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves. This article seeks to inform and alert others to carefully evaluate their Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator expression approach for in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of the hippocampus, which is becoming increasingly popular. There is certainly a much greater number of safe alternate hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator viral expression approaches than has been reported here, and we encourage others to report on viral Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator transduction safety profiles. Indeed, others have also encountered these artefactual events as recent social media posts attest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Application Specialist Team 2023</xref>), and with more Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators becoming available, the open and timely reporting of transduction safety profiles will reduce unnecessary animal experiments, save laboratory resources and time in future investigations into hippocampal function in health and disease.</p>

<p>Mice (∼6 wks of age) received ketoprofen (Gabrilen, Mibe; 5 mg/kg body weight; injection vol. 0.1 ml/10 g b.w., s.c.) for analgesia and anti-inflammatory treatment 30 minutes prior to induction of anesthesia. Then, mice were anesthetized with 2-3% isoflurane in an oxygen/air mixture (25/75%) and then placed in a stereotactic frame. Eyes were covered with eye-ointment (Bepanthen, Bayer) to prevent drying and body temperature was maintained at 37°C using a regulated heating plate (TCAT-2LV, Physitemp) and a rectal thermal probe. After hair removal and superficial disinfection, a drop of 10% lidocaine was used to locally anesthetise the area. After 3-5 mins, a flap of skin was removed about 1 cm² around the middle of the skull. Residual soft tissue was then removed from the skull with a scraper and 3% H2O2/NaCl solution. After complete drying, cranial sutures served as landmarks for the determination of injection sites. For virus injection, a burr hole was carefully drilled through the skull using a dental drill, avoiding excessive heating and injury to the meninges by intermittent cooling with sterile PBS. Coordinates were: for CA1, anterioposterior [AP] measured from bregma 1.9 mm, lateral [L] specified from midline 1.6 mm, dorsoventral [DV] from surface of the skull 1.6 mm; for dentate gyrus, AP 2.4 mm; L 1.6 mm; x3 injections at DV 2.7, 2.5, 2.1 mm. Virus particles (see <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>) were slowly injected (20-100 nl/min).To prevent reflux of the injected fluid upon cannula retraction, it was left in place until 5 min post-injection, and then carefully lifted.</p>

<p>30 minutes prior to induction of anesthesia, buprenorphine was administered for analgesia (Buprenovet, Bayer; 0.05 mg/kg body weight; injection vol.0.1 ml/20 g b.w., i.p.). Further, dexamethasone (Dexa, Jenapharm; 0.1mg/20g b.w.; injection vol. 0.1 ml/20 g b.w., i.p.), and ketoprofen (Gabrilen, Mibe; 5 mg/kg b.w.; injection vol. 0.1 ml/10 g b.w., s.c.) were applied to counteract inflammation, swelling and pain. Mice were anesthetized with 2-3% isoflurane in an oxygen/air mixture (25/75%) and then placed in a stereotactic frame. Eyes were covered with eye-ointment (Bepanthen, Bayer), body temperature was maintained at 37°C by closed-loop regulation through a warming pad (TCAT-2LV, Physitemp) and a rectal thermal probe. Throughout the course of the surgical procedure, the isoflurane dose was successively reduced to about 1-1.5% at a gas flow of ∼0.5 ml/minute. A circular craniotomy (∼Ø 3 mm) was established above the right hemisphere/hippocampus within the central opening (Ø ∼7mm) of the head plate using a dental drill. Cortical tissue was carefully aspirated until the alveolar fibers above CA1 could be visually identified. A custom-made silicon cone (top Ø 3 mm, bottom Ø 2 mm, depth 1.5 mm, RTV 615, Moimentive) attached to a cover glass (Ø 5 mm, thickness 0.17 mm) was inserted and fixed with dental cement around the edges of the cover glass (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Masala <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>).

First, we applied a gentle smoothing, max-normalized each histogram, and max-aligned all histograms of a given imaging session. Then, after excluding the 10% lowest fluorescent values, the width of each calcium wave and a mean value was calculated for each time point/imaging session. Finally, the resulting pixel values were converted to micrometer based on the respective objective (@ 512×512p×l and 1x Zoom: Nikon 16x, NA 0.8, 3mm WD: 1.579 µm/pxl; Olympus 25x, NA 1.05 2mm WD: 0.92 µm/pxl). The speed of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves was calculated from the duration and path length of the events visually identified and manually tracked in the FOV.</p>

<p>To verify successful viral transduction and window position, animals were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (15 mg/kg body weight). After confirming a sufficient depth of anesthesia, mice were heart-perfused with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Animals were decapitated and the brain removed and stored in 4% PFA in PBS solution for 24 hours. Fifty to 100 µm thick coronal slices of the hippocampus were cut on a vibratome (Leica). For nuclear staining, brain slices were kept for 10 min in a 1:1000 DAPI solution at room temperature. Brain slices were mounted and the green and blue channel successively imaged under an epi fluorescence or spinning disc microscope (Visitron VisiScope).</p>

<p>Summary: This paper reported interesting aberrant calcium microwaves in the hippocampus when synapsin promoter driven GCaMPs were expressed for a long period of time. These aberrant hippocampal Ca2+ micro-waves depend on the viral titre of the GECI. The microwave of Ca2+ was not observed when GECI was expressed only in a sparse set of neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths: These findings are important to the wide neuroscience community, especially considering a great number of investigators are using similar approaches. Results look convincing and are consistent across several laboratories.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: One important question is needed to further clarify the mechanisms of aberrant Ca2+ microwaves as described below.</p>
<p>Synapsin promoter labels both excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory neurons. To avoid aberrant Ca2+ microwave, a combination of Flex virus and CaMKII-Cre or Thy-1-GCaMP6s and 6f mice were tested. However, all these approaches limit the number of infected pyramidal neurons. While the comprehensive display of these results is appreciated, a crucial question remains unanswered. To distinguish whether the microwave of Ca2+ is caused selectively via the abnormality of interneurons, or just a matter of pyramidal neuron density, testing Flex-GCaMP6 in interneuron specific mouse lines such as PV-Cre and SOM-Cre will be critical.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe and quantify a phenomenon in the CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus that they call aberrant Ca2+ micro-waves. Micro-waves are sometimes seen during 2-photon calcium imaging of populations of neurons under certain conditions. They are spatially confined slow calcium events that start in a few cells and slowly spread to neighboring groups of cells. This phenomenon has been uttered between researchers in the field at conferences, but no one has taken the time to carefully capture and quantify micro-waves and pin down the causes. The authors show that micro-waves are dependent on the viral titre of the genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), the genetic promoter (synapsin), the neuronal subtype (granule cells in the dentate gyrus do not produce micro-waves and they are not seen in the neocortex), and the density of GECI expression. The authors should be commended for their work and raising awareness to all labs doing any form of calcium imaging in populations of neurons. The authors also come up with alternative approaches to avoid artifactual micro-waves such as reducing the transduction titre (1:2 dilution of virus) and a transduction method employing sparser and cre-dependent GECI expression in principal cells using a CaMKII promoter.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The micro-waves reported in the paper were robustly observed across 4 laboratories and 3 different countries with various experimenters and calcium imaging set-ups. This adds significant strength to the work.</p>
<p>The age of mice used covered a broad range (from 6 to 43 weeks). This is a strength because is covers most ages that are used in labs that regularly do calcium imaging.</p>
<p>Another strength is they used different GCaMP variants (GCaMP6m, GCaMP6s, GCaMP7f), as well a red indicator: RCaMP. This shows the micro-waves are not an issue with any particular GECI, as the authors suggest.</p>
<p>The authors include many movies of micro-waves. This is extremely useful for researchers in the field to view them in real-time so they can identify them in their own data.</p>
<p>They provide a useful table with specific details of the virus injected, titre, dilution, and other information along with the incidence of micro-waves. A nice look-up table for researchers to see if their viral strategy is associated with a high or low incidence of micro-waves.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whether micro-waves are associated with the age of mice was not quantified. This would be good to know and the authors do have this data.</p>
<p>The effect of mico-waves on single cell function was not analyzed. It would be useful, for example, if we knew the influence of micro-waves on place fields. Can a place cell still express a place field in a hippocampus that produces micro-waves? What effect might a microwave passing over a cell have on its place field? Mice were not trained in these experiments, so the authors do not have the data.</p>
<p>The CaMKII-Cre approach for flexed-syn-GCaMP expression shows no micro-waves and is convincing, but it is only from 2 animals, even though both had no micro-waves.</p>
<p>The authors state in their Discussion that even without observable microwaves, a syn-Ca2+-indicator transduction strategy could still be problematic. This may be true, but they do not check this in their analysis, so it remains unknown.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The work by Masala and colleagues highlights a striking artifact that can result from a particular viral method for expressing genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) in neurons. In a cross-institutional collaboration, the authors find that viral transduction of GECIs in the hippocampus can result in aberrant slow-traveling calcium (Ca2+) micro-waves. These Ca2+ micro-waves are distinct from previously described ictal activity but nevertheless are likely a pathological consequence of overexpression of virally transduced proteins. Ca2+ micro-waves will most likely obscure the physiology that most researchers are interested in studying with GECIs, and their presence indicates that the neural circuit is in an unintended pathological state. Interestingly this pathology was not observed using the same viral transduction methods in the visual cortex. The authors recommend several approaches that may help other experimenters avoid this confound in their own data such as reducing the titer of viral injections or using recombinase-dependent expression. The intent of this manuscript is to raise awareness of the potential unintended consequences of viral overexpression, particularly for GECIs. A rigorous investigation into the exact causes of Ca2+ micro-waves or the mech</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors clearly demonstrate that Ca2+ micro-waves occur in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus following large volume, high titer injections of adeno-associated viruses (AAV1 and AAV9) encoding GECIs. The supplementary videos provide undeniable proof of their existence.</p>
<p>By forming an inter-institutional collaboration, the authors demonstrate that this phenomenon is robust to changes in surgical techniques or imaging conditions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I believe that the weaknesses of the manuscript are appropriately highlighted by the authors themselves in the discussion. I would, however, like to emphasize several additional points.</p>
<p>As the authors state, the exact conditions that lead to Ca2+ micro-waves are unclear from this manuscript. It is also unclear if Ca2+ micro-waves are specific to GECI expression or if high-titer viral transduction of other proteins such as genetically encoded voltage indicators, static fluorescent proteins, recombinases, etc could also cause Ca2+ micro-waves.</p>
<p>The authors almost exclusively tested high titer (&gt;5x10^12 vg/mL) large volume (500-1000 nL) injections using the synapsin promoter and AAV1 serotypes. It is possible that Ca2+ micro-waves are dramatically less frequent when titers are lowered further but still kept high enough to be useful for in vivo imaging (e.g. 1x10^12 vg/mL) or smaller injection volumes are used. It is also possible that Ca2+ micro-waves occur with high titer injections using other viral promoter sequences such as EF1α or CaMKIIα. There may additionally be effects of viral serotype on micro-wave occurrence.</p>
<p>The number of animals in any particular condition are fairly low (Table 1) with the exception of V1 imaging and thy1-GCaMP6 imaging. This prohibits rigorous comparison of the frequency of pathological calcium activity across conditions.</p>
