<abstract>
<p>Antibiotic-tolerant bacteria, due to their unique physiology, are refractory to antimicrobial killing and pose challenges for infection control. Incomplete knowledge of how bactericidal antibiotics work, limits our understanding of partial resistance due to phenotypic tolerance in mycobacteria, a driver for developing genetic resistance. Using proteomics, <sup>13</sup>C isotopomer analysis, genetic and biochemical assays, we investigated the physiological response of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> challenged with aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Two distinct classes of antibiotics elicited remarkably similar responses and increased flux through the TCA cycle, causing enhanced respiration, ROS generation, and ATP burst. We observed that excessive ATP levels and not ROS, dominantly contributes to cidality, which may in part be, conferred by sequestration of divalent metal ions by ATP. Consequently, <sup>13</sup>C isotope tracing indicated TCA cycle flux deviation from its oxidative arm as a bacterial adaptive mechanism, which also included activated intrinsic resistance and a higher propensity to develop antibiotic resistance. Our study provides a new understanding of the intricate mechanisms of antibiotic-induced cell death and expands the current paradigm for antibiotic action.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antibiotics have saved millions of lives from bacterial infections, however, the emergence of resistance against all classes of antibiotics renders clinically available antibiotics ineffective and undermines efforts to combat lethal bacterial infection. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is responsible for approximately 7,00,000 deaths per year and, if left unchecked, is projected to exceed 10 million by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The conventional approach for combating AMR through pathogen-specific antibiotics is no longer viable, as the drug discovery pipeline has shrunk over the past several decades. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop novel interventions for preserving and enhancing the efficacy of the existing drugs through synergy or adjuvant therapy. However, there are gaps in our understanding of how precisely the existing antibiotics mediate cell death and what are bacterial counter responses to these challenges at a system-wide scale.</p>
<p>Antibiotics are commonly believed to cause cell death either by inhibiting essential cellular processes facilitating cell division or compromising the integrity of the cell envelope, while antibiotic resistance involves more complex mechanisms and manifests as genotypic resistance, antibiotic tolerance, and persistence. A proposed hypothesis posited an unified mechanism underlying antibiotic lethality driven by the presence of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), rather than solely targeting their intended primary targets. This hypothesis suggests that antibiotic-induced cell death occurs through a series of interconnected events, including enhanced respiration, disruption of iron-sulfur clusters, increase in intracellular iron levels, and triggering of the Fenton reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). These processes culminate in the autocatalytic generation of ROS, ultimately leading to oxidation of biomolecules and cell death. However, this hypothesis has faced significant rebuttals. Some studies have shown a lack of ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) or no clear correlation between ROS levels and antibiotic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Additionally, research has demonstrated that increased respiration and intracellular iron pool enhance antibiotic lethality not because they produce ROS, but by promoting antibiotic uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Intriguingly, a recent study examining <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with aminoglycosides revealed that lethality stems directly from dysregulated membrane potential, which was independent of the voltage-dependent drug uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) as was widely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Likewise, the role of active growth rate and metabolic activity in antibiotic efficacy has been subject to contradictory findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Interestingly, respiration-decelerating antibiotics were found to inhibit the lethality of respiration-accelerating antibiotics(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), highlighting the need for a new understanding of the drug’s mode of action, particularly in a combination therapy. Despite the intuitive deleterious effects of ROS on bacterial physiology, sub-lethal concentrations were found to promote multidrug resistance by inducing superoxide radical-induced mutations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). These results demonstrate the intricate nature of the repercussions stemming from antibiotic action and the metabolic factors influencing cell death. They underscore the necessity of investigating antibiotic actions to dissect the specific metabolic factors governing cell death amidst the complex interplay with factors like respiration, ROS, membrane potential, and ATP. Bacterial responses to these mechanisms contribute to the emergence of phenotypic and eventually genetic resistance.</p>
<p>Antibiotic tolerance results from physiological adaptation that enables a bacterial population to withstand lethal doses of antibiotics for a longer duration and also provides the driving force to develop genetic resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Although the significance of antibiotic tolerance is recognized, the precise metabolic state and sequence of the adaptive events leading to the development of antibiotic tolerance remain poorly characterized. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the etiological agent for tuberculosis, a prominent cause of death from infectious disease, shows exceptional tolerance to antibiotics and partly explains the reason for a long treatment regimen requiring a combination of antibiotics(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Despite having low rates of mutation and recombination, the rapid increase in multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis infections compels us to re-examine our current understanding of the mechanisms of antibiotic action in mycobacteria and identify vulnerable targets for adjuvant therapy to shorten the treatment time in TB.</p>
<p>A systemic investigation of the physiological responses to antibiotic exposure prior to the emergence of resistance holds the key to deciphering the nature and quantum of antibiotic induced stresses. In this study, we employed temporal quantitative proteomics and <sup>13</sup>C isotopomer analysis to comprehensively understand the physiological responses of the model organism, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics from two distinct classes, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside. Through genetic and biochemical assays we show the involvement of ROS and ATP burst in antibiotic lethality. Here, we attempted to underscore the interplay between ROS and ATP burst in contributing to cell death. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms underpinning antibiotic-induced cell death in mycobacterium with implications for preventing the development of antibiotic tolerance and resistance.</p>

<title>Exposure to sub-lethal doses of aminoglycoside and fluroquinolone reveals physiological adaptation without genetic resistance</title>
<p>In order to understand the biology of antibiotic-stressed mycobacteria, we designed a growth assay to measure the responses of mycobacteria to sublethal antibiotic concentrations. <italic>M. smegmatis mc<sup>2</sup>155</italic> (OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 0.0025) was challenged with either 1x, ½x, or ¼x MBC<sub>99</sub> (minimum bactericidal concentration) of fluoroquinolone (norfloxacin) and aminoglycoside (streptomycin) antibiotics. While 1x MBC<sub>99</sub> and ½x MBC<sub>99</sub> concentrations were lethal and growth-inhibitory, respectively, growth at sub-lethal concentrations (i.e., ¼x MBC<sub>99</sub>) of both antibiotics exhibited a prolonged lag phase <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref><bold>)</bold>.</p>

</fig>
<p>To decipher the antibiotic-induced growth changes, we divided the growth curve into three phases: an early response phase (5 hours post treatment), which is a period shortly after the addition of antibiotics, and showing no visible differences in the growth rate; a stress phase (5-15 hours post treatment), characterized by reduced growth rate and prolonged lag time; and a recovery phase (15-22.5 hours post treatment), in which mycobacterial growth rate resumes following antibiotic adaptation. The experiments were terminated when the culture reached stationary phase (∼ OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 1) to prevent the stationary phase response from interfering with the antibiotic induced response. The prolonged lag time observed during the stress phase is of profound significance in deciphering the nature of antibiotic-induced stresses and has implications for the development of antibiotic tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Similarly, a thorough understanding of the recovery phase cells can reveal cellular determinants involved in adaptation to antibiotics. Towards this end, we first ruled out whether the resumption of growth on sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics was due to the emergence of an antibiotic-resistant population. For this, bacteria were harvested from the recovery phase (25-hour), and the MIC of the antibiotics on cells grown with and without ¼x MBC<sub>99</sub> of the same antibiotic were compared. No changes in MIC confirmed that the growth resumption during the recovery phase was physiological rather than a result of genetic resistance <bold>(S1A and S1B)</bold>.</p>

<title>Norfloxacin and streptomycin induce similar proteomic responses</title>
<p>We performed untargeted label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics on mycobacteria grown with and without ¼x MBC<sub>99</sub> of both antibiotics, during all three growth phases to observe the physiological alterations in mycobacterium exposed to antibiotics. Six data sets yielded a total of 2,982 distinct proteins (43% of the <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> proteome), with each sample identifying roughly 2000 proteins <bold>(S2A)</bold> thus demonstrating the robustness of our methodology. To ascertain the reproducibility across samples, the data for each condition were subjected to rigorous quality control analysis <bold>(S2B)</bold>. Differentially expressed proteins were defined as those crossing a fold change threshold of ±2 and a p-value of ≤ 0.05. A volcano plot analysis revealed the differential expression of several proteins in response to both antibiotics <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref><bold>)</bold>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Corresponding to the unaffected growth rate in the early response phase (7.5-hour), the proteomic profile of antibiotic-treated cells was indistinguishable from that of the control group at this time point. In contrast, cells from the stress phase (15-hour) and the recovery phase (25-hour) displayed several up- and down-regulated proteins in response to both antibiotics. We also noted a transition from a coordinated to an uncoordinated state of the proteome, and back to an unperturbed state depending on the time for growth recovery. Consistent with its mode of action, streptomycin (STR) treatment up-regulated proteases, peptidases, and proteasomal complex components implicated in the degradation of misfolded proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Likewise, norfloxacin (NOR) treatment induced the SOS response by down-regulating LexA, the repressor of SOS response, and up-regulating DNA repair proteins such as RecA/B/C and PafC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). These data indicate that the sub-lethal doses of antibiotics used in our study exert sufficient stress on their primary targets. Next, we sought to determine the secondary consequences of antibiotic-target interactions. Towards this end, proteins involved in central dogma (DNA replication, transcription, and translation), and cell cycle and cell division processes were found significantly down-regulated in response to both the antibiotics <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref><bold> to </bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref><bold>)</bold>, correlating with the observed decrease in growth rate during the stress phase. Our results suggest that the initial bacterial response to antibiotics may involve downregulation of essential cellular processes that are required for optimal growth and antibiotic lethality.</p>

<p>Next, to test whether NOR and STR share a secondary mechanisms of action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, we performed a Pearson correlation analysis between the NOR and STR induced alteration in proteome from the stress (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) and recovery phases <bold>(S3A)</bold>. The results revealed a highly correlated (Pearson coefficient (r) &gt; 0.90) proteomic profile of antibiotic-treated mycobacteria in the stress phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), indicating that structurally and functionally distinct antibiotics may produce a strikingly similar response. It remains uncertain whether the common response to antibiotics indicate a shared mechanism of action or a general stress response independent of specific modes of action of NOR and STR. To determine the cause of these similarities, we attempted to gain a deeper insight into the shared processes impacted by antibiotics. For this, we conducted pathway enrichment analysis on proteins that were up-regulated and exclusively expressed upon antibiotic treatments. As depicted in figure <bold>S3B</bold>, pathway enrichment analysis showed that central carbon metabolic pathways were enriched for both antibiotics. Notably, enzymes of the TCA cycle (CitA, Icd, Acn), glyoxylate shunt (Icl1 and GlcB), GABA shunt, the anaplerotic node (Pck, Pca), and PPP shunt (G6-PDH, 6-PGD) were significantly up-regulated for both antibiotics, suggesting metabolic alterations in response to antibiotic treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref><bold>)</bold>. Collectively, these data suggest for a common mechanism of antibiotic action that extends beyond their primary targets.</p>

<title>Norfloxacin and streptomycin generate reactive oxygen species to confer cidality</title>
<p>Studies have reported that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated as a secondary consequence of antibiotic-target interaction and facilitate cell death by oxidizing vital biomolecules(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). We sought to analyse the expression status of proteins involved in anti-oxidant response to check whether the antibiotics under study generate ROS. Antibiotic treated proteome revealed a significant upregulation of anti-oxidant enzymes such as catalases, superoxide dismutases, mycothione reductase, and methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig-4A)</xref>. The upregulation of enzyme MsrA, involved in the repair of the oxidized proteins, indicates ROS mediated protein oxidation. In addition, anti-oxidant proteins such as alkylhydroxyperoxidase, bromoperoxidase, and peroxiredoxin were exclusively expressed in response to antibiotics, suggesting that bacteria may have experienced oxidative stress upon antibiotic treatment. Pathway enrichment analysis (<bold>S3B)</bold> revealed upregulation of cysteine and methionine metabolic pathway for both the antibiotics, which forms a central component of the redox homeostasis in Mtb. Cysteine contributes in the synthesis of mycobacterial antioxidant, mycothiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), donates sulphur to generate Fe-S clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), and is required for respiration and antibiotic tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Together, the upregulation of cysteine and antioxidant pathways suggest that the treatment with NOR and STR induces ROS production and causes oxidative stress.</p>
<p>In order to directly measure oxidative stress (due to intracellular ROS production) in response to antibiotics, we used the Mrx1-roGFP2 redox biosensor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). It is a ratiometric fluorescence reporter that measures the intracellular redox potential of mycobacteria and has been extensively used to measure the redox state of cells <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>ex-vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). The sensor exhibits an increased fluorescence ratio at 405/488 nm excitation under oxidative stress, and a reduced ratio under reductive stress. The ability of the biosensor to measure oxidative and reductive stress was confirmed using an oxidizing and a reducing agent in comparison to the untreated control <bold>(S4A)</bold>, demonstrating its reliability in sensing oxidative stress in mycobacteria. Thereafter, to interrogate whether the antibiotics induce oxidative stress, we administered sub-lethal to lethal doses of both antibiotics to Mycobacteria containing the biosensor.

<p>Next, we sought to investigate whether ROS contributed to antibiotic lethality. Towards this end, we first established whether glutathione (GSH), an antioxidant can quench antibiotic- induced ROS. Indeed, co-treatment with GSH prevented an increase in the 405/488 nm ratio upon antibiotic treatment <bold>(S4C and S4D)</bold>. To check the impact of ROS on cell survival, an antibiotic time-kill curve was performed with a supra-lethal dose (10x-MBC<sub>99</sub>) of the antibiotics over a duration predetermined to result in the death of &gt; 99.9% of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), in the absence and presence of GSH. As observed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>, co-treatment with GSH at nonlethal concentration (S4E), substantially inhibited the lethality of antibiotics, demonstrating that antibiotic-induced ROS contributed to cell death.</p>
<p>ROS is known to damage nearly all macromolecules, including DNA, proteins, and lipids. Proteins of TCA cycle enzymes and the ETC chain incorporate Fe-S clusters for electron exchange that are very susceptible to ROS-induced damages, resulting in the release of iron (Fe<sup>+2</sup>) in the cytoplasm and induction of the Fenton cycle. Free hydroxyl radicals are generated via the Fenton cycle, which results in further ROS production and could also contribute to antibiotic-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Using the iron-chelator bipyridyl (BP), known to inhibit the Fenton cycle-mediated burst of ROS, we found that indeed, iron sequestration significantly reduced antibiotic induced-death <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4I</xref><bold>)</bold>. Collectively, the induction of the antioxidant response, the detection of ROS using the Mrx1-roGFP2 biosensor, and the mitigation of antibiotic lethality using glutathione and Fenton cycle inhibitor confirms that both NOR and STR treatment cause increased ROS production as a part of their lethality.</p>

<title>Norfloxacin and streptomycin treatment induces a burst in ATP levels</title>
<p>Despite knowing the significance of ROS generation in bacterial physiology, our understanding of its origin, precise cause, and the stimulus remains unclear. Since the electron transport chain (ETC) is the primary source of ROS production by electron leakage, we hypothesized that the increase in ROS levels resulted from enhanced respiration. To test this, we measured the levels of ATP, the end product of aerobic respiration, in response to antibiotics using the BacTiter- Glo kit. Expectedly, NOR and STR treatments induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in ATP production, suggesting an increase in respiration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref><bold> to </bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref><bold>)</bold>. We next used an orthogonal method to substantiate our results of elevated ATP levels observed upon antibiotic treatment. The PHR-mCherry is a ratiometric fluorescence biosensor that reports ATP/ADP ratio in real time in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Consistent with previous ATP measurement, data presented in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure <bold>5G</bold></xref>, demonstrate a dose-dependent increase in ATP/ADP ratio upon NOR and STR treatments, indicating increase in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production upon antibiotic treatments.</p>

<p>Of note, both of these methods have an inherent limitation. While in growth-based assays, luminescence can be normalized to OD<sub>600nm</sub> or total protein content, experiments involving bacterial death upon antibiotic treatment, employing a similar normalization could lead to incorrect measurement of ATP levels per bacterium. Hence, we opted to normalize the data using viable counts as reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). However, a recent study revealed that antibiotic-induced ROS production may persist even after drug removal, potentially preventing bacteria from forming colonies post treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), resulting in underestimating viability and reporting higher RLU/CFU values. Furthermore, the ratiometric biosensor has a limited dynamic range, and its effectiveness in measuring ATP may not be optimal during oxidative damage and cell death. Therefore, it was not feasible to determine the exact magnitude of the increase in ATP levels subsequent to antibiotic exposure. Notably, previous studies reporting a surge in ATP levels using OD<sub>600nm</sub> based normalisation, yielded only 4-5 fold increase upon antibiotic treatment that resulted in over 3-4 log<sub>10</sub> fold killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Since dead cells can be assumed to be metabolically incapable of contributing to active ATP synthesis, normalization with viable cells would have generated a similar increase in ATP levels (RLU/CFU) even in slow growing <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and Mtb.</p>
<p>To further test whether enhanced respiration caused elevated ATP levels, we employed the redox dye resazurin to measure bacterial respiratory or metabolic activity upon antibiotic treatments, as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Resazurin reduction assay showed enhanced fluorescence conversion rate in bacteria treated with antibiotics, thus confirming increased respiration rate <bold>(S5)</bold>. Despite over 3-4 log<sub>10</sub> fold killing observed with 1x MBC drugs at 6 hours, resazurin reduced faster in antibiotic treated cells than that in untreated cells. Intriguingly, the observed rise in ATP levels as well as in resazurin conversion rate upon antibiotic treatment were inversely proportional to cell survival <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-F</xref><bold>, S5)</bold>. Thus, our results suggest that antibiotic-treated cells exhibit a significant increase in respiration, resulting in excessive ATP production that is associated with bacterial death.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Elevated ATP levels contribute to antibiotic cidality</title>
<p>We next sought to decipher whether the elevated ATP production was a consequence or a cause of antibiotic lethality. To establish the contribution of increased ATP levels to mycobacterial death, it was necessary to specifically inhibit the antibiotic-induced ATP burst without reducing the overall metabolic rate. To achieve this, we co-treated cells with antibiotics and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a protonophore, at non-toxic levels to mitigate ATP burst (<bold>S6</bold>). CCCP carries protons (ions + charge) across the membrane, thereby collapsing the pH gradient (ΔpH) and the membrane potential (Δψ), resulting in disruption of ATP synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, CCCP uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from ETC, without directly affecting ATP synthase or the respiratory chain. Expectedly, co-treatment with CCCP dissipated the antibiotic-induced ATP burst in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-B</xref><bold>, 6D-E)</bold>, confirming that the increase in ATP levels mediated by NOR and STR treatment was the result of increased respiration followed by oxidative phosphorylation. Subsequently, we reasoned that if ATP burst contributes directly to antibiotic action, then dissipating antibiotic-induced ATP burst would increase bacterial survival on antibiotics. To test this hypothesis, we compared antibiotic kill curves with CCCP (mitigating ATP burst) and without CCCP (causing ATP burst). As observed in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C and F</xref>, co-treatment with CCCP significantly inhibited antibiotic-induced cell death, demonstrating the role of ATP burst in antibiotic lethality.</p>

<p>Debatably, the uptake of aminoglycosides is thought to be affected by the electrochemical gradient (ΔpH and Δψ)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Since CCCP disrupts both ΔpH and Δψ, it collapses the PMF across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) and may inhibit the uptake of streptomycin. Therefore, to rule out the possibility of reduced streptomycin uptake being responsible for the increased survival in the presence of CCCP, we measured ATP levels and cell survival in the presence of nigericin. Nigericin is K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter and carries out electroneutral exchange of H<sup>+</sup> only to collapse ΔpH, leaving the Δψ unaffected and the PMF compensated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Consistent with the results obtained with CCCP, nigericin co-treatment prevented antibiotic-induced increase in ATP levels (<bold>S7A &amp; S7B</bold>) and consequently rescued mycobacteria against lethal levels of STR or NOR (<bold>S7C)</bold>. The involvement of ATP in antibiotic action was further confirmed using bedaquiline (BDQ), an inhibitor of mycobacterial ATP synthase, to suppress antibiotic induced ATP burst. BDQ has been shown to act by collapsing ΔpH without affecting Δψ in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, making it ideal for our experiments involving STR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). BDQ is known to have a delayed effect on <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> ATP levels, with 100x MIC of BDQ reducing cellular ATP levels by only 10 fold after 2 days of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Therefore, we sought to give a pre-treatment of BDQ before challenging cells with NOR and STR. While 24 hours of pre-treatment with BDQ at 25x to 200x-MIC<sub>99</sub> had no effect on cell survival, they significantly reduced the killing rate of STR <bold>(S7D)</bold> and NOR <bold>(S7E)</bold>.</p>
<p>To ascertain our findings further, we made use of the genetic method to demonstrate the involvement of ATP in antibiotic action to rule out off-target activity of CCCP, nigericin, and BDQ. The <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> Δ<italic>atpD</italic> strain lacks one of the two copies of <italic>atpD</italic> gene encoding the β subunit of the ATP synthase, and has diminished levels of the β subunit, causing respiratory slowdown and lower ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Due to its inability to synthesise ATP equivalent to that of wild type cells, we hypothesised that Δ<italic>atpD M. smegmatis</italic> would be unable to generate an ATP burst at wild type scale, upon antibiotic treatment. Indeed, Δ<italic>atpD</italic> strain displayed lower ATP levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>) and enhanced survival <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref><bold> to </bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref><bold>)</bold> upon antibiotic treatment, confirming the significant contribution of ATP burst towards antibiotic lethality. Notably, the growth profile of the Δ<italic>atpD</italic> strain was indistinguishable from wild type <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (<bold>S8</bold>), indicating that Δ<italic>atpD</italic> strain had similar growth and metabolic rate to wild type cells and that the reduction of neither contributed to the enhanced survival observed upon antibiotic treatment. Together, these data show that mitigation of antibiotic induced ATP burst using chemical (CCCP, nigericin and BDQ) or genetic (Δ<italic>atpD M. smegmatis</italic>) methods diminishes antibiotic lethality, and therefore, elevated ATP levels are metabolic drivers of antibiotic lethality. The causal link between increased ATP levels and antibiotic action observed in our study aligns with previous findings that strongly link low ATP levels to antibiotic persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), and high metabolic activity with antibiotic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Furthermore, our study suggests ATP as one of the pivotal metabolic factors influencing the outcome of antibiotic action and persistence within the broader category of metabolic activity.</p>

<title>ATP burst and not ROS is the dominant driver of antibiotic lethality in mycobacteria</title>
<p>Antibiotic-induced ROS has been demonstrated to trigger rapid bacterial cell death, superseding the damage caused by the inhibition of vulnerable primary targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). After demonstrating that inhibiting either ROS generation or excess ATP production can inhibit antibiotic-induced cell death, we sought to determine which of these two mechanisms is the dominant driver of lethality. Distinguishing between the effects of ROS and ATP becomes challenging due to their common origin from aerobic respiration. For this, ROS levels were compared under the conditions of ATP burst formation (antibiotic treatment alone) and ATP burst mitigation (antibiotic plus CCCP/nigericin or in Δ<italic>atpD M. smegmatis</italic>). We reasoned that if damage by ROS is the dominant mechanism driving cell death, then antibiotic treatment in Δ<italic>atpD M. smegmatis</italic> or co-treatment with CCCP/nigericin would decrease ROS levels to impart enhanced survival in the presence of antibiotics. Interestingly, while the antibiotic treatment alone increased fluorescence ratio at 405/488 nm and caused cell death <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref><bold> to </bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref><bold>)</bold>, CCCP-protected cells also had elevated 405/488 nm ratio (oxidative stress), indicating that the ATP burst, and not ROS production, is the dominant mechanism driving antibiotic lethality. Similar to CCCP, increased ratio of fluorescence at 405/488 nm were obtained with antibiotic and nigericin co-treatment (<bold>S9A</bold>), as well in the Δ<italic>atpD M. smegmatis</italic> exposed to antibiotics (<bold>S9B</bold>). In all cases, antibiotic-induced ATP burst was minimised, however, the ROS levels remained higher in the surviving cells. To reciprocally test that ROS is not the dominant driver of antibiotic action, we examined the effects of co-treatment with 10 mM GSH on antibiotic-induced ATP bursts. The antioxidant GSH not only reduced oxidative stress but also prevented the ATP burst caused by antibiotic treatment (<bold>S9C</bold>). Thus, GSH-mediated rescue of cell survival upon antibiotic treatment could be attributed to both the reduction of oxidative stress as well as the inhibition of the ATP burst, and therefore, antibiotic-induced ATP burst is the dominant driver of antibiotic action.</p>

<p>Together, these results suggest that oxidative stress alone, a correlate of ROS levels is insufficient to cause cell death on its own and is not the sole mediator of antibiotic action. It points out that ROS is a by-product of antibiotic action (i.e., enhanced respiration) rather than the predominant secondary mediator of cell death, as originally understood. Notably, the CCCP-mediated increase in respiration was also evident from a dose-dependent increase in 405/488 nm ratios with CCCP treatment alone <bold>(S9D and S9E)</bold>. Importantly, our results do not rule out the generation and deleterious effects of ROS upon antibiotic exposure but rather suggests to emphasise that antibiotic lethality is dominantly mediated by excessive ATP levels, and in the absence of it, mycobacteria can survive antibiotic-induced ROS for longer periods of time. In summary, our results show that NOR and STR treatments increase respiration, resulting in a lethal ATP burst that drives mycobacterial death.</p>

<title>Antibiotic-induced ATP burst deprives cells of essential divalent metal ions</title>
<p>ATP synthesis is essential for optimal growth and survival against stresses in all living organisms. Therefore, the involvement of ATP in cell death is difficult to comprehend. However, ATP is known to bind and chelate various divalent metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) and intriguingly, a study reported growth inhibitory activity of exogenously supplied ATP on multiple bacterial species, which was rescued upon co-treatment with magnesium and iron salts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that the ATP surge observed upon antibiotic treatment may have sequestered and deprived the macromolecules and cellular processes of their essential divalent metal ions, resulting in cell death. Towards this end, we first established whether metal ion chelation alone is lethal to cell survival. Since the metal ion chelators, EDTA and EGTA are not taken up by Mycobacteria, as a proof-of-concept, we employed the cell permeable iron chelator, bipyridyl (BP), to test whether intracellular iron depletion causes bacteriostasis or cidality. The <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> strain challenged with increasing concentrations of bipyridyl displayed a dose-dependent killing (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>), demonstrating that iron removal causes cell death. Next, we reasoned that if ATP burst-mediated cell death was due to metal ions depletion, then exogenous supplementation of divalent metal ions should increase bacterial survival to antibiotics. To test this, we compared cell survival upon NOR or STR treatment with and without the co-supplementation of four different divalent metal ions: Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. We observed a concentration-dependent protection from antibiotics provided by all four metal ions, suggesting that elevated ATP levels contribute to cell death in part by sequestering divalent metal ions. <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref><bold> to </bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref><bold>)</bold>. A similar level of protection was not achieved from monovalent metal ions <bold>(S10)</bold>. Separately, we also tested whether divalent metal ion supplementation was toxic to cells and caused growth inhibition, leading to increased cell survival. Notably, the highest salt concentration of 5 mM used in our experiment, had no adverse effect on the bacterial growth rate (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>), and thus, the enhanced survival obtained with salt co-treatment was not due to any growth arrest or metabolic inhibition by metal ions. A decrease in cell survival observed with the co-treatment of 10 mM Fe<sup>2+</sup> could be attributed to the antibiotic-induced Fenton cycle mediated ROS generation resulting from excessive free iron in the cells. This observation further suggests that co-treatment with up to 10 mM salts did not hinder antibiotic uptake, and the enhanced survival observed with metal ions was unlikely to be due to reduced drug uptake. We should also note that the elevated ATP levels may affect multiple other physiological processes in bacteria; for instance the status of protein phosphorylation or allosteric activity of metabolic enzymes. However, studying the impact of ATP burst on different aspects of mycobacterial physiology upon antibiotic exposure is beyond of the scope of this study and demands a more focused investigation.</p>

<title>13C isotopomer analysis suggests increased metabolic flexibility and bifurcation of TCA cycle flux as a bacterial adaptive mechanism</title>
<p>After studying the nature of antibiotic-induced stresses, we sought to investigate bacterial counter responses that could promote adaptation to antibiotics and growth recovery. <sup>13</sup>C isotopologue profiling was performed to investigate the metabolic rewiring that promotes the resumption of growth during the recovery phase. Using <sup>13</sup>C glucose as a carbon tracer, intracellular metabolites from central carbon metabolism (at t = 25 hr, treated with ¼x MBC<sub>99</sub> of NOR or STR) were assessed. In agreement with the proteomics data, there was an increase in citrate flux (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>) that correlated with the upregulation of citrate synthase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Similarly, there was an increase in flux through the oxidative segment of the TCA cycle and towards alpha-ketoglutarate/glutamate production, which correlated with the observed increases in aconitase and isocitrate dehydrogenase levels.

<p>The decreased flux into pyruvate indicates that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PckA), that was upregulated in the proteomic analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), is operating in the anaplerotic direction to fix CO<sub>2</sub> to form oxaloacetate (OAA). It has been demonstrated that the redox state of the cells influences the reversal of PEPCK activity and has been associated with increased ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). This finding was further corroborated by the increase in the aspartate label (a surrogate for oxaloacetate) and the M+3 and M+5 ionic species of <sup>13</sup>C-citrate <bold>(S11B and S11C)</bold>. This increased flux into OAA can facilitate greater utilization of acetyl-CoA by the TCA cycle, as indicated by the increased label of citrate. Since antibiotic-mediated death was caused by increased respiration, ROS, and ATP levels, we expected that bacteria exposed to sub-lethal doses of antibiotics may remodel their central carbon metabolism (CCM) to minimize respiration and improve their chances of survival. In agreement with this hypothesis, the enhanced flux in the oxidative arm of the TCA cycle (alpha-ketoglutarate) was found to diverge towards glutamate, glutamine, and GABA shunt following streptomycin treatment (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). This deviation of the flux was facilitated by upregulation of glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamate synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate decarboxylase, as evident from the proteomics data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>). The amino acids glutamate and glutamine direct the carbon flux to amino acid biosynthesis and help regulate energy and nitrogen metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). In addition, increased flux in glutamate and GABA would help bypass two enzymatic reactions of the TCA cycle’s oxidative arm, restricting ROS production and regulating anaplerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Moreover, we observed an increased flexibility of the TCA cycle in switching carbon flux from aspartate/oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate/glutamate in response to antibiotics. This reaction is catalysed by aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) which keeps balance between the cataplerosis and anaplerosis of TCA cycle intermediates in mycobacteria(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). AspAT was also found upregulated in our proteomics analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that by enhancing expression and activity of TCA cycle enzymes and those of the anaplerotic node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), the antibiotic-adapted central carbon metabolism shows more plasticity and resilience in terms of minimizing the production of ROS and ATP, while still maintaining the overall metabolism and growth.</p>
<p>The glyoxylate shunt and PPP pathway were found to be involved in antibiotic tolerance mechanisms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). We observed a decrease in the incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C label into succinate, indicating a decreased flux through succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) or isocitrate lyase (ICL1). Antibiotic treatments decreased the expression of the SucA and SucB subunits of KGDH and the GabD1 and GabD2 subunits of SSADH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), explaining the lower flux in succinate. Furthermore, there were no changes in the <sup>13</sup>C label in histidine and sedoheptulose 7-P indicating that flux through the PPP remained unperturbed upon antibiotic treatment <bold>(S11D)</bold>. Since the enzymes of the oxidative stage (G6-PDH and 6-PGD) of the PPP were found upregulated in our proteomics analysis it may be speculated that the flux from ribose 5-phosphate got channelized towards purine biosynthesis, which is consistent with the enrichment of the purine metabolic pathway in response to STR (S3B). The NADPH/NADP+ ratio measurements also revealed no significant differences in antibiotic treated cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9E</xref><bold>)</bold>. Overall, no changes in flux into the PPP and glyoxylate shunt were observed during the antibiotic exposure.</p>

<title>Sub-lethal antibiotic exposure can potentiate development of tolerance and genetic resistance to antibiotics</title>
<p>Next, we questioned whether sublethal antibiotic concentrations have activated any intrinsic drug resistance mechanisms. Specifically, proteomics data analysis revealed a 50-fold upregulation of the protein Eis at 25 hours after STR treatment (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>). Eis is known to acetylate and inactivate aminoglycosides, thus conferring antibiotic tolerance and promoting enhanced intracellular survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>).

<p>To test whether sub-lethal antibiotic concentrations increase mutation frequency, we measured mutation frequency using rifampicin resistance as the phenotypic reporter. We harvested cells from the recovery phase (25th hour) and compared the number of rifampicin resistant mutants in NOR/STR-treated versus untreated conditions. Within 22.5 hours of antibiotic exposure, the mutation frequency of cells adapted to sub-lethal concentrations of STR increased by 4-fold, whereas NOR treatment did not significantly increase the mutational frequency (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>). These findings indicate that antibiotic-induced physiological adaptation may facilitate the acquisition of drug-specific qualitative mutations or non-specific quantitative mutations in metabolic enzymes, leading to antibiotic resistance and treatment failure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current understanding of antibiotic lethality is limited to target corruption as the primary cause and free radical induced cellular damage as a secondary consequence. This study while explores the mycobacterial responses to antibiotics, identifies ATP burst as the new and dominant driver of antibiotic-induced cell death in mycobacteria. Our differential proteomics analysis upon antibiotic exposure revealed a rewiring in the central carbon metabolism and generation of an anti-oxidant response due to the production of ROS. Damage by ROS has been proposed as an universal mechanism that many bactericidal antibiotics use to eliminate bacteria, irrespective of their primary targets(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Respiration inducing molecules such as Vitamin C, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and other thiols were found to use ROS to enhance antibiotic lethality, even against drug induced-persisters while ROS quenching by antioxidants rescued bacteria from cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Our measurements revealed upregulated central carbon metabolism enzymes, increased flux through the TCA cycle, high NADH/NAD+ ratios, and elevated ROS levels in response to antibiotic. Notably, the set of bacterial responses were shared by norfloxacin and streptomycin which belong to two distinct class of drugs, the fluroquinolones and aminoglycosides, respectively. Thus our observations further strengthen the evidence of increasing involvement of ROS in antibiotic action and also in inducing tolerance in bacterial pathogens, including mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>) What is the trigger for high respiration and ROS production? While electron leakage from the ETC is the primary source of ROS, it is unclear how antibiotics are sensed beyond their primary targets and how they modulate the ETC to generate ROS. Recent studies have demonstrated that antibiotic treatments deplete the purine nucleotide pool, resulting in an increase in purine biosynthesis and hence ATP demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). This increased energy demand becomes a significant reason for increased respiration, oxygen consumption, and ROS generation, thus contributing to enhanced antibiotic lethality(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Furthermore, the increased purine biosynthesis may increase levels of AMP, reducing the ATP/AMP ratio, which could stimulate the rate-limiting steps of glycolysis and TCA cycle to enhance aerobic respiration, ROS production and ATP synthesis. Similarly, a down-regulation of proteins involved in central dogma &amp; cell division processes in response to sub-lethal levels of NOR or STR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref>) could be interpreted as an indication of diminished availability of biosynthetic building blocks and energy, and may have triggered increased metabolic activity as a compensatory mechanism. Therefore, perturbing target function by antibiotics could lead to multiple stimulating impacts on bacterial metabolism and respiration, originally intended as a bacterial response, resulting in its fatality.</p>
<p>To confirm that increased respiration led to ROS production, we directly measured ATP levels, the end product of aerobic respiration. Both norfloxacin and streptomycin treatments resulted in a substantial dose- and time-dependent rise in ATP levels that was inversely proportional to cell survival. By inhibiting antibiotic-induced ATP burst using a protonophore uncoupler of ETC and oxidative phosphorylation (CCCP &amp; nigericin), an inhibitor of ATP synthesis (Bedaquiline), or the ATP deficient Δ<italic>atpD</italic> strain (genetic uncoupler), we showed that the observed increase in ATP concentration was due to enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, and significantly contributed to antibiotic action and cell death.</p>
<p>Growth rate and metabolism were shown to influence antibiotic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). A previous study concluded that the bacterial metabolic state, not the growth rate, is the primary driver of cidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>), however, the precise metabolic reactions or factors governing antibiotic lethality remains unclear. In addition to increased respiration, our proteomics analysis revealed that downregulation of ATP-consuming processes, such as the central dogma and cell division could be contributing to ATP accumulation. Thus energy metabolism and particularly ATP synthesis, becomes a central component of the connection between metabolic state and antibiotic susceptibility. Recent studies have observed a remarkable correlation between lower ATP levels and generation of persister population in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Interestingly, exogenous supplementation of alanine or glucose increased the susceptibility of drug-resistant <italic>E. tarda</italic> by boosting the flux through the TCA cycle and increasing the proton motive force, resulting in increased kanamycin uptake(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). Based on these observations, it may be logical to reason that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation would result in reduced antibiotic cidality and reveal a plausible direct role of ATP in determining antibiotic susceptibility. Supporting this hypothesis, cell wall acting antimycobacterials were shown to increase ATP levels in <italic>M. bovis BCG</italic>, which directly correlated with antibiotic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Furthermore, energy metabolism inhibitors, bedaquiline and telacebec were found to dampen the bactericidal activity of isoniazid and moxifloxacin against <italic>M. bovis BCG</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). These studies however fell short in establishing a time &amp; dose dependent relationship between antibiotics and ATP levels, and also in adequately distinguishing the specific impact and significance of ATP levels in antibiotic lethality compared to overall metabolic and respiratory activities, as well as levels of ROS.</p>
<p>Since inhibition of either ROS generation or ATP burst was sufficient to reduce the lethality of norfloxacin and streptomycin, we sought to determine which of the two is the dominant contributor. Intriguingly, measurements of ROS in CCCP-protected mycobacteria revealed that elevated ROS levels were insufficient to cause cell death upon antibiotic treatment in the absence of an ATP burst, indicating that ATP burst is the dominant mechanism driving cell death. Conditions such as hypoxia, stationary phase, nutrient starvation, biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>) or an artificial reduction of the NADH/NAD+ ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) renders mycobacteria less susceptible to antibiotics compared to actively growing cells, and this phenotype has been attributed to lower levels of ROS. Based on our findings, we speculate that these conditions would also generate lesser flux through the electron transport chain (respiration), which, in addition to decreasing ROS levels, would also produce lower levels of ATP. Since the metabolic rate, ROS, and ATP burst are interrelated, studying their individual contributions remains challenging but necessary. We show that in the absence of an ATP burst, mycobacteria can tolerate the consequences of primary target inhibition and the damage from ROS for a longer duration, making them insufficient to cause rapid cell death. Contrary to our observations, a genetic uncoupling of ATP synthesis potentiated lethality in <italic>E. coli</italic>, indicating that enhanced respiration and ROS production is the dominant driver of efficacy for bactericidal antibiotics in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). These findings suggest similarities in the bacterial metabolic tool kit exploited by cidal antibiotics while targeting across genera, yet identify the differences in the pivotal component that drives cell death in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Therefore the secondary mechanisms of lethality should be tested for a panel of bactericidal antibiotics, with distinct mode of action, across different bacterial pathogens including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, which is an intriguing lacunae of our study. Likewise, while we note the commonality in the involvement of ROS and ATP burst in fluoroquinolones and aminoglycoside action, we highlight that the extent of ROS and ATP’s contribution may differ between the two antibiotics. The levels of ROS produced were higher for norfloxacin, whereas the extent of ATP burst was greater for streptomycin, which demanded additional bedaquiline to suppress the streptomycin induced ATP burst and killing.</p>
<p>Metal ion binding by ATP is a well-known phenomenon, where ATP forms a stable coordination complex with the divalent metal ion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). We observed that co-supplementation with divalent metal ions rescued mycobacteria from the cidality of STR and NOR. Further, exogenous supplementation with ATP was found to cause bacteriostasis in various bacteria, including mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Based on this observation, we propose metal ion chelation and depletion by ATP burst as a novel bactericidal mechanism executed by antibiotics in mycobacteria. We have separately established that the depletion of Fe<sup>2+</sup> is lethal in mycobacteria, suggesting the essentiality of these cofactors for cell survival. Future studies should investigate the comprehensive mechanism of antimicrobial action of excessive ATP.</p>
<p>For instance, a recent study found increased ATP levels generated upon aminoglycoside treatment resulting in ATP hydrolysis through the reversal of F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase activity, causing hyperpolarisation of the membrane and cell death in <italic>E. coli</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study fills a gap and expands the current understanding of how antibiotics ultimately cause cell death in the context of mycobacteria. Whether other bactericidal antibiotics employ ATP burst to mediate their lethality in mycobacteria and other serious pathogens warrants further investigation. In conjunction, compounds that synthetically generate ATP burst should also be tested for antimycobacterial efficacy.</p>
<p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is an outlier among multi-drug resistant pathogens due to its low recombination rate, limited genetic diversity and absence of an accessory genome. Becoming a successful pathogen, despite its inability to rapidly evolve and withstand new antibiotics alludes to the presence of an effective innate mechanism of resistance. Low fitness-cost mutational events causing transient antibiotic tolerance in the absence of a strong selective pressure, precede and possibly boost successive qualitative mutations on antibiotic targets(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In our observations, Mycobacterial counter responses included downregulation of central dogma and cell division processes thereby reducing the vulnerability of the target and thus efficacy of the antibiotic. Reduction of the energy consuming processes could reduce the anabolic demand and help decreasing their energy metabolism, ROS production and ATP synthesis. <sup>13</sup>C isotopomer analysis revealed rerouting of flux from alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate-glutamine and GABA, bypassing the oxidative arm of the TCA cycle. We also measured an increased mutation frequency and the induction of Eis, demonstrating that the antibiotic-adapted population may facilitate the selection of drug-resistant mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). In summary, we observed that upon exposure to sub-inhibitory levels of antibiotics, Mycobacterium transiently switched to a quiescent state that could reduce its respiration thus denying the antimicrobial effect of ROS and metal ion chelation by ATP. These findings could be used to develop antibiotic adjuvants that enhance aerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>), and increase ROS mediated damage and ATP production. Our study also advocates for a thorough understanding of the proximate and ultimate causes of antibiotic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>), in order to avoid drug combination with overlapping (secondary) actions and mechanism of tolerance.</p>

<title>Measurement of ATP, NADH/NAD+, and NADPH/NADP+ ratio</title>
<p>Cells (0.8 OD<sub>600nm</sub> /ml) were challenged with various fold MBC concentrations (predetermined for 0.8 OD<sub>600nm</sub>/ml) of norfloxacin and streptomycin. The higher inoculum was taken to ensure sufficient viability of cells upon antibiotic treatment for the detection of ATP, NAD+ and NADP+.</p>
<p>Intracellular ATP levels were determined using the BacTiter-Glo Microbial Cell Viability Assay (Promega) as per manufacturer’s instructions. For ATP measurement, cells from various conditions and time points were harvested and heat inactivated at 90°C for 30 minutes, as performed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). 25 µl of each sample was mixed with the equal volume of a BacTiter-Glo reagent in a white flat-bottom 96 well plate (Corning). Samples were incubated in dark at room temperature for 5 minutes, and bioluminescence was measured in a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy H1). The emitted luminescence was divided with the number of viable cells determined just before the heat inactivation to express ATP levels per bacterium (RLU/CFU). The CFU normalised luminescence observed for drug free control was set as 1, and RLU/CFUs values obtained for various conditions were plotted relative to the control.</p>
<p>NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+ ratios were measured using the Bioluminescent NAD/NADH-Glo detection kit (Promega) and NADP/NADPH-Glo detection kit (Promega), respectively, as per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells at desired conditions were lysed using 2 cycles of bead beating (7 m/s for 45 sec). The supernatant of lysate was cleared using the centrifugation and processed for the measurement of NAD+ or NADP+ and NADH or NADPH separately, and the ratio of luminescence for NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+ were plotted. The ratios obtained for controls were set as 1, and the ratios obtained for various conditions were plotted with respect to control.</p>

<title>Measurement of respiratory activity using resazurin</title>
<p>Measurement of metabolic/respiratory activity was performed as reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Briefly, cells were grown till exponential phase in 7H9, and treated with desired drugs and supplements. At indicated time points, 100 µl aliquots of cells were removed and seeded in a black wall 96 well plate (Costar). Resazurin was added to all wells at a final concentration of 30 µg/ml and incubated in dark at 37°C for 30 minutes. The quick conversion of resazurin to resorufin was measured in a plate reader at the excitation of 530 nm and the fluorescence emission of 590 nm. Fluorescence intensities were divided with CFUs, measured just before the addition of the resazurin to express respiratory activity per bacterium. CFU normalised fluorescence intensities acquired for control were set as 1 and CFU normalised intensities obtained for various conditions were plotted relative to the control. The ability of resazurin to differentiate cells with distinct metabolic activity was separately confirmed by comparing normalised fluorescence acquired for cells from exponential phase, PBS starved cells and heat killed cells.</p>

<title>Measurement of mutation frequency</title>
<p>Mutation frequency was determined to check if the treatment with the sub-lethal (¼x-MBC<sub>99</sub> concentrations of norfloxacin and streptomycin, individually) antibiotics increase mutation frequency of cells. 10 ml of exponentially growing cultures of Msm were treated with and without ¼x-MBC<sub>99</sub> concentrations of norfloxacin and streptomycin for a total of 25 hours at shaking. At 25<sup>th</sup> hour, 50 µl of cells were serially diluted and plated on LB agar to count CFU/ml, and the rest of the cultures were harvested at 6000 g and resuspended in 300µl of 7H9 + 0.05% Tween-80. 300 µl of suspension was plated onto 2 LB agar supplemented with 100 µg/ml (5x-MIC of RIF on agar) of Rifampicin. Plates were incubated in dark for 4-5 days at 37°C, and colonies were counted. The colonies that appeared on LB-RIF plates were RIF resisters (Rif<sup>r</sup>). Mutation frequency was calculated by dividing the number of RIF resisters with the total number of CFUs plated on the LB-RIF plate, and compared between control and drug treatment.</p>

<p>The metabolites were extracted and analysed as described elsewhere(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). Briefly, Msm cells were grown till exponential phase (0.6 OD<sub>600nm</sub>/ml) and diluted to the inoculum of 0.0025 OD<sub>600nm</sub>/ml in 7h9 supplemented with 0.05% Tween-80, 1% w/v <sup>12</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Glucose and 1% w/v U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> Glucose (50% labelled glucose). Identical to the growth curve and proteomics experiments, antibiotics were added at 2.5 hours and cells were grown with and without ¼x-MBC<sub>99</sub> concentrations of norfloxacin and streptomycin for a total of 25 hours with shaking. At 25<sup>th</sup> hour, cells were harvested and washed twice using chilled PBS at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. Cells were subsequently resuspended in a pre-chilled methanol:acetonitrile:water (2:2:1), and metabolites were extracted by mechanical lysis with 0.1 mm zirconia beads using FastPrep system (MP Bio) set at 2 cycles of bead beating at 6.5 m/s for 20 seconds. Lysate was spun at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes in a refrigerated centrifuge. The supernatant was filtered using 0.2 µM cellulose acetate filters, and stored at −80 degrees until further use.</p>

<title>LC-MS analysis</title>
<p>The metabolites were separated using the Agilent InfinityLab Poroshell 120 HILIC-Z (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.7 μm (p/n 675775-924)) column, suitable for polar acidic metabolites. Chromatographic separation was performed using the mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium acetate in water at pH = 9) and mobile phase B (1.0 mM ammonium acetate at pH = 9) in 10:90 (v:v) water/acetonitrile. Both the solvents were supplemented with a 5μM Agilent InfinityLab deactivator additive (p/n 5191-4506). The gradient used for the separation is as follows; flow rate of 0.5 ml/min: 0 min, 100% B; 0 to 11.5 min, 70% B; 11.5 to 15 min, 100% B; 12 to 15 min, 100% B; and 5-min of re-equilibration at 100% B. Accurate mass measurements were performed by the Agilent Accurate Mass 6545 Q TOF apparatus, connected in line with an Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC. The mass measurement was performed in a negative-ion mode using the following parameters; capillary voltage, 3000 V; fragmentor voltage, 115 V, in centroid 4 GHz mode. The instrument offered mass measurement at less than 5 ppm error with a mass resolution ranging from 10,000 to 45,000 over the fixed m/z range of 121 to 955 atomic mass units. Metabolites were identified based on their accurate masses and their accompanying isotopes. The percent <sup>13</sup>C labelling of each metabolite was determined by dividing the summed peak height ion intensities of all <sup>13</sup>C-labeled species by the total ion intensity of both labelled and unlabelled ionic species using the Agilent Profinder version B.8.0.00 service pack 3.</p>

<p>In this <bold>important</bold> work, Lodhiya et al. provide evidence that excessive ATP underlies the killing of the model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis by two mechanistically-distinct antibiotics. The data are generally <bold>solid</bold> as the authors deploy multiple, orthogonal readouts and methods for manipulating reactive oxygen species and ATP. The work will be of interest to those studying antibiotic mechanisms of action.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lodhiya et al. demonstrate that antibiotics with distinct mechanisms of action, norfloxacin and streptomycin, cause similar metabolic dysfunction in the model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis. This includes enhanced flux through the TCA cycle and respiration as well as a build-up of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP. Genetic and/or pharmacologic depression of ROS or ATP levels protect M. smegmatis from norfloxacin and streptomycin killing. Because ATP depression is protective, but in some cases does not depress ROS, the authors surmise that excessive ATP is the primary mechanism by which norfloxacin and streptomycin kill M. smegmatis. In general, the experiments are carefully executed; alternative hypotheses are discussed and considered; the data are contextualized within the existing literature.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors tackle a problem that is both biologically interesting and medically impactful, namely, the mechanism of antibiotic-induced cell death.</p>
<p>Experiments are carefully executed, for example, numerous dose- and time-dependency studies; multiple, orthogonal readouts for ROS; and several methods for pharmacological and genetic depletion of ATP.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of excitement and controversy in the field, and the authors do a nice job of situating their work in this larger context.</p>
<p>Inherent limitations to some of their approaches are acknowledged and discussed e.g., normalizing ATP levels to viable counts of bacteria.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>All of the experiments performed here were in the model organism M. smegmatis. As the authors point out, the extent to which these findings apply to other organisms (most notably, slow-growing pathogens like M. tuberculosis) is to be determined.</p>
<p>At first glance, some of the results in the manuscript seem to conflict with what has been previously reported in the (referenced) literature. In their response to reviewers, the authors addressed these concerns. Ideally they would have addressed them in the main manuscript too.</p>
<p>Figs. 9 and 10A-B and associated text make the manuscript significantly longer and more descriptive. They are more appropriate to the beginning of a new story rather than the end of the current one.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors are trying to test the hypothesis that ATP bursts are the predominant driver of antibiotic lethality of Mycobacteria</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>No significant strengths in the current state as it is written.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major weakness is that M. smegmatis has a doubling time of three hours and the authors are trying to conclude that their data would reflect the physiology of M. tuberculossi which has a doubling time of 24 hours. Moreover, the authors try to compare OD measurements with CFU counts and thus observe great variabilities.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors confirm they are using CFU counts, but then Figure 1 has 0 as the first data point on the Y-axis. This should be somewhere between 10e5 or 10e6. CFU would not start at 0, your initial inoculum has to be more than 0 to have something to challenge.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lodhiya et al. demonstrate that antibiotics with distinct mechanisms of action, norfloxacin and streptomycin, cause similar metabolic dysfunction in the model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis. This includes enhanced flux through the TCA cycle and respiration as well as a build-up of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP. Genetic and/or pharmacologic depression of ROS or ATP levels protect M. smegmatis from norfloxacin and streptomycin killing. Because ATP depression is protective, but in some cases does not depress ROS, the authors surmise that excessive ATP is the primary mechanism by which norfloxacin and streptomycin kill M. smegmatis. In general, the experiments are carefully executed; alternative hypotheses are discussed and considered; the data are contextualized within the existing literature.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors tackle a problem that is both biologically interesting and medically impactful, namely, the mechanism of antibiotic-induced cell death.</p>
<p>Experiments are carefully executed, for example, numerous dose- and time-dependency studies; multiple, orthogonal readouts for ROS; and several methods for pharmacological and genetic depletion of ATP.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of excitement and controversy in the field, and the authors do a nice job of situating their work in this larger context.</p>
<p>Inherent limitations to some of their approaches are acknowledged and discussed e.g., normalizing ATP levels to viable counts of bacteria.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the encouraging comments.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>All of the experiments performed here were in the model organism M. smegmatis. As the authors point out, the extent to which these findings apply to other organisms (most notably, slow-growing pathogens like M. tuberculosis) is to be determined. To avoid the perception of overreach, I would recommend substituting &quot;M. smegmatis&quot; for Mycobacteria (especially in the title and abstract).</p>
<p>At first glance, a few of the results in the manuscript seem to conflict with what has been previously reported in the (referenced) literature. In their response to reviewers, the authors addressed my concerns. It would also be ideal to include a few lines in the manuscript briefly addressing these points. (Other readers may have similar concerns).</p>
<p>In the first round of review, I suggested that the authors consider removing Figs. 9 and 10A-B as I believe they distract from the main point of the paper and appear to be the beginning of a new story rather than the end of the current one. I still hold this opinion. However, one of the strengths of the eLife model is that we can agree to disagree.</p>

<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s concern and have changed title of the manuscript by including <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> instead of Mycobacteria. The abstract already mentioned the same.</p>
<p>In the discussion section of the revised manuscript, we have already addressed and analysed our results extensively within the context of the available literature, regardless of whether our findings aligned with or differed from previous studies. We still believe that the mentioned discussion will help suffice to explain our results to the readers.</p>
<p>In this manuscript we also sought to assess the bacteria's ability to counteract drug induced stresses, contributing to our understanding of how antibiotic tolerance develop in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>. Results presented in Figure 9 clearly demonstrate that <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> attempt to reduce respiration by decreasing flux through the complete TCA cycle, thereby mitigating ROS and ATP production in response to antibiotics.  Additionally, the bacterial response also included increased expression of the protein Eis, which is exemplar for intrinsic drug resistance, with a concomitant increase in mutation frequency, thereby hinting at the development of antibiotic tolerance followed by resistance. We still believe that these data should be included to support our observations and they make the study more comprehensive.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors are trying to test the hypothesis that ATP bursts are the predominant driver of antibiotic lethality of Mycobacteria</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>No significant strengths in the current state as it is written.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major weakness is that M. smegmatis has a doubling time of three hours and the authors are trying to conclude that their data would reflect the physiology of M. tuberculossi that has a doubling time of 24 hours. Moreover, the authors try to compare OD measurements with CFU counts and thus observe great variabilities.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I am surprised that the authors simply did not repeat the study in figure one with CFU counts and repeated in triplicate. Since this is M. smegmatis, it would take no longer than two weeks to repeat this experiment and replace the figure. I understand that obtaining CFU counts is much more laborious than OD measurements but it is necessary. Your graph still says that there is 0 bacteria at time 0, yet in your legend it says you started with 600,000 CFU/ml. I don't understand why this experiment was not repeated with CFU counts measured throughout. This is not a big ask since this is M. smegmatis but it appears that the authors do not want to repeat this experiment. Minimally, fix the graph to represent the CFU.</p>

<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s concern and have changed title of the manuscript by specifying <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> instead of Mycobacteria.</p>
<p>It is still not clear to the authors what the reviewer mean by OD measurements. All the data presented in the entire manuscript , including in Figure 1 are solely based on CFU measurements. So, as suggested by the reviewer, all experiments are already presented in terms of CFU.</p>
