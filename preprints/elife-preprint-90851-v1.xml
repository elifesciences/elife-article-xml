<title>Abstract</title><p>Aquaporin-0 (AQP0) tetramers form square arrays in lens membranes through a yet unknown mechanism, but lens membranes are enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Here, we determined electron crystallographic structures of AQP0 in sphingomyelin/ cholesterol membranes and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish that the observed cholesterol positions represent those seen around an isolated AQP0 tetramer and that the AQP0 tetramer largely defines the location and orientation of most of its associated cholesterol molecules. At a high concentration, cholesterol increases the hydrophobic thickness of the annular lipid shell around AQP0 tetramers, which may thus cluster to mitigate the resulting hydrophobic mismatch. Moreover, neighboring AQP0 tetramers sandwich a cholesterol deep in the center of the membrane. MD simulations show that the association of two AQP0 tetramers is necessary to maintain the deep cholesterol in its position and that the deep cholesterol increases the force required to laterally detach two AQP0 tetramers, not only due to protein–protein contacts but also due to increased lipid–protein complementarity. Since each tetramer interacts with four such ‘glue’ cholesterols, avidity effects may stabilize larger arrays. The principles proposed to drive AQP0 array formation could also underlie protein clustering in lipid rafts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The current view of biological membranes is that proteins are densely packed and often organized into functional modules that perform specific biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Engelman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Nicolson, 2014</xref>). Lipids play an important role in organizing membrane proteins, and the resulting specialized membrane domains are now commonly known as lipid microdomains or lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Karnovsky et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Simons and Toomre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Stier and Sackmann, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Vereb et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Lipid microdomains are enriched in cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Barenholz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Korade and Kenworthy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>) and characterized by a lipid phase that is distinct from the surrounding membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ahmed et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Schroeder et al., 1991</xref>). Cholesterol has a planar four-aromatic ring structure with a short isooctyl alkyl chain and a small 3-β-hydroxyl head group that can form a hydrogen bond with a polar group (Figure 1–figure supplement 1A). Because the aliphatic groups linked to the ring system are asymmetrically distributed, cholesterol features a smooth (or α) face and a rough (or β) face (Figure 1–figure supplement 1A). It makes up 40-90% of the lipids is eukaryotic cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Liscum and Munn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). Cholesterol can form non-covalent interactions with lipid acyl chains, preferentially with saturated ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Epand and Epand, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>). As a result, the membrane can transition from a liquid-disordered to a liquid-ordered phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">de Meyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ghysels et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Marsh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Seelig, 1977</xref>), which has been linked to the formation of lipid microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Quinn and Wolf, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Silvius, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Mammalian lens membranes contain a high percentage of sphingomyelin – a lipid consisting of a phosphocholine head group, a sphingosine amino alcohol and a fatty acid (Figure 1–figure supplement 1B) – and cholesterol, lipids that are characteristic for lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Zelenka, 1984</xref>). With a molar ratio of cholesterol to other phospholipids ranging from 2.02 to 2.52, the human lens core plasma membrane features the highest molar cholesterol content of all membranes found in human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Fleschner and Cenedella, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Zelenka, 1984</xref>). Aquaporin-0 (AQP0), a lens-specific water channel, is the most abundant membrane protein in lens membranes (over 60% of the total protein content) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alcalá et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bloemendal et al., 1972</xref>), where it forms large 2D arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Gorin et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Kistler and Bullivant, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Zampighi et al., 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>The propensity of AQP0 to form 2D crystals was used to determine its structure by electron crystallography of <italic>in vitro</italic> assembled 2D crystals grown with the lipid dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Gonen et al., 2005</xref>). Later, AQP0 2D crystals were grown with a variety of different lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Hite et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">2010</xref>). All these crystals had the same lattice constants, which were identical to those of AQP0 arrays in native lens membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Buzhynskyy et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, <italic>in vitro</italic> grown 2D crystals recapitulate the organization of AQP0 tetramers in 2D arrays in the native lens membrane. Interestingly, however, high-resolution electron crystallographic studies, which also resolved the annular lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Gonen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>), showed that AQP0 tetramers in the 2D crystals are separated by a layer of lipids and form essentially no direct protein–protein interactions. As the crystal contacts are almost exclusively mediated by lipids, it is surprising that AQP0 2D crystals could be obtained with almost every lipid tested.</p>
<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further advanced our understanding of how lipids interact with AQP0. Initial simulations probing the interactions of AQP0 with lipids were carried out with pure DMPC and mixed DMPC:cholesterol membrane patches, predicting the existence of a cholesterol hotspot at the extracellular side of the AQP0 surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">O’Connor and Klauda, 2011</xref>). Later, MD simulations demonstrated that the positions of lipids around AQP0 seen in electron crystallographic structures obtained from 2D crystals, in which the lipids are constrained by the protein crystal packing, are indeed representative of the localization of unconstrained lipids around individual AQP0 tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>). Molecular aspects, such as protein mobility and surface roughness, were identified to play key roles in defining the lipid positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Briones et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, a combination of coarse-grained and atomistic MD simulations revealed that annular lipids adopt similar positions around several members of the aquaporin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Stansfeld et al., 2013</xref>), while mass spectrometry demonstrated the weak nature of the interaction of lipids with AQPZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Laganowsky et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic>, AQP0 can be induced to form 2D crystals by choosing a very specific lipid-to-protein ratio (LPR) for reconstitution, but this <italic>in-vitro</italic> approach does not explain why AQP0 tetramers form 2D arrays in native lens membranes, which contain an excess of lipids as well as other membrane proteins. Since lipids mediate the interactions in AQP0 2D arrays, it is likely that specific lipids play a role in the assembly of AQP0 2D arrays in the native lens membrane. As AQP0-containing lens membrane junctions are greatly enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Fleschner and Cenedella, 1991</xref>), lipids that play a key role in raft formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Brown and London, 2000</xref>), these lipids were prime candidates to drive AQP0 array formation. To gain structural insights into how cholesterol and/or sphingomyelin may induce AQP0 to form 2D crystals <italic>in vivo</italic> and potentially to obtain a more general understanding of how these lipids can establish lipid microdomains, we determined structures of AQP0 in membranes formed by mixtures of sphingomyelin and cholesterol and performed extensive equilibrium and force-probe MD simulations.</p>

<title>AQP0 forms 2D crystals with all tested cholesterol/sphingomyelin mixtures</title>
<p>Purified AQP0 was reconstituted with mixtures of sphingomyelin and cholesterol at molar ratios of 1:0, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 0:1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A–E</xref>). Every lipid mixture yielded membranes, which had a sheet-like morphology at sphingomyelin:cholesterol ratios of up to 1:2 and formed vesicles at higher cholesterol percentages. In every case, power spectra of images taken of trehalose-embedded samples showed diffraction spots consistent with typical 2D arrays of AQP0 (data not shown).</p>

</fig>
<p>Notably, even reconstitution of AQP0 with pure cholesterol yielded vesicles, which displayed a tendency to stack (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Cholesterol on its own does not form bilayers under physiological conditions and requires a molecule of complementary shape to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Kumar, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Raguz et al., 2011</xref>). AQP0 appears to fulfill this requirement as it does form membranes with cholesterol. However, reconstitution of AQP0 with cholesterol only yielded membranes within a narrow LPR range, from 0.2 to 0.4. At higher or lower LPRs, only protein aggregates and no membranes were observed.</p>
<p>Fourier transforms of cryo-EM images of trehalose-embedded AQP0 2D crystals formed with cholesterol at an LPR of 0.4 showed clear reflections (Figure 1–figure supplement 2), establishing that the crystals have the same lattice constants as all other AQP0 2D crystals analyzed to date (<italic>a</italic> = 65.5 Å, <italic>b</italic> = 65.5 Å, and γ = 90°). Phase comparisons of the reflections showed that the crystals have <italic>p</italic>422 plane symmetry (Table 1) and thus have to be double-layered. Merging of 15 images yielded a projection map at 3.2-Å resolution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and Table 2). Although the crystals were not of sufficient quality to determine a high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) density map, the 2D projection map shows that AQP0 tetramers in a pure cholesterol membrane are organized in the same way as in membranes formed with all other lipids analyzed to date.</p>

<title>Structure determination of AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub></title>
<p>Fourier transforms of images of trehalose-embedded AQP0 crystals obtained with sphingomyelin/cholesterol mixtures showed reflections to a resolution of about 2 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chiu et al., 2015</xref>). We focused first on AQP0 2D crystals obtained with a sphingomyelin/cholesterol mixture at a molar ratio of 2:1, from here on referred to as AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub>. We collected electron diffraction patterns of these crystals at different tilt angles under low-dose conditions. While diffraction patterns recorded from untilted crystals showed reflections to a resolution of 2 Å (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), reflections in diffraction patterns from highly tilted crystals were not visible beyond a resolution of 2.5 Å (Figure 2–figure supplement 1A).</p>

<p>After merging 214 diffraction patterns from crystals tilted up to ∼72° and phasing the intensity dataset by molecular replacement, we were able to calculate a 3D density map at 2.5-Å resolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), which made it possible to model the AQP0 structure. To build the sphingomyelin molecules, we initially only modeled the head groups and 10 carbon atoms for each of the two acyl chains. If the 2<italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub>-<italic>F</italic><sub>c</sub> map after crystallographic refinement showed additional density, we extended the acyl chains, and this cycle was iterated. To avoid over-fitting, after each iteration, we assessed the values for <italic>R<sub>work</sub></italic>, <italic>R<sub>free</sub></italic> and their difference, as well as the consistency of the calculated 2<italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub>-<italic>F</italic><sub>c</sub> map with the composite omit map. The final model includes seven sphingomyelin molecules, SM1 to SM7, with acyl chains ranging from 11 to 16 carbon atoms in length (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The one density in the map that was consistent with the characteristic four-ring structure of cholesterol was modeled as Chol1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The density in the center of four adjacent AQP0 tetramers around the four-fold symmetry axis was poorly resolved and could not be modeled (Figure 3–figure supplement 1B). The statistics for electron crystallographic data collection, model building, refinement and validation of AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> are summarized in Table 3.</p>

<p>AQP0 in the 2:1 sphingomyelin/cholesterol membrane adopts the same conformation as it does in a DMPC bilayer, AQP0<sub>DMPC</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Gonen et al., 2005</xref>), and in an <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipid extract (EPL) bilayer, AQP0<sub>EPL</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>), with root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the Cα atoms of 0.271 Å and 0.264 Å, respectively (Figure 3–figure supplement 2A–B). The densities of the side chains along the water permeation pathway were clearly resolved as were the water molecules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The water pathway through the AQP0 subunits showed density for four water molecules, at positions similar to those seen in previous electron crystallographic AQP0 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Gonen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparison of the lipid bilayer in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) with those in the AQP0<sub>DMPC</sub> and AQP0<sub>EPL</sub> structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B–C</xref>) shows that the seven sphingomyelin molecules assume similar positions as the DMPC and EPL lipids, further strengthening the earlier conclusion that annular lipids are not randomly distributed around a membrane protein but assume preferred positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>). The density for sphingomyelin SM3 is well defined. The carbonyl oxygen of its head group is hydrogen-bonded with the tyrosyl side chain of Tyr105 and the amide oxygen of the guanidinium side chain of Arg196 (Figure 3–figure supplement 3A). However, the head groups of the remaining sphingomyelin lipids do not form specific interactions with AQP0, as reported for the DMPC and EPL head groups in the previous AQP0<sub>DMPC</sub> and AQP0<sub>EPL</sub> structures. Also, as observed in those structures, the sphingomyelin acyl chains follow grooves on the surface of AQP0.</p>
<p>The only cholesterol molecule, Chol1, resolved in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure is located in the extracellular leaflet (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The tetracyclic ring of Chol1 makes π-stacking interactions with AQP0 residues His201 and Trp205, and its alkyl tail makes van der Waals interactions with residues Ile87 and Val90 (Figure 3–figure supplement 3B). Chol1 also interacts extensively with the adjacent sphingolipid in the extracellular leaflet, SM2, the acyl chains of which assume an all <italic>anti</italic>-dihedral conformation, increasing their conformational order (Figure 3– figure supplement 3B).</p>
<p>While Chol1 may increase the conformational order of adjacent SM2, this effect is unlikely to induce AQP0 to form an array. Similarly, the location of Chol1 with respect to adjacent AQP0 tetramers (Figure 3–figure supplement 1B) does not provide any clues as to how it could affect array formation <italic>in situ</italic>. We therefore decided to analyze the structure of AQP0 in a membrane that has a higher cholesterol content.</p>

<title>Structure determination of AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub></title>
<p>Lens membranes contain more cholesterol than is represented by the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure. Therefore, we determined the structure of AQP0 2D crystals that were grown at a molar sphingomyelin:cholesterol ratio of 1:2, which is close to the lipid composition of human lens core membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Fleschner and Cenedella, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Zelenka, 1984</xref>). These crystals were even better ordered, and electron diffraction patterns of untilted specimens showed reflections to a resolution better than 1.6 Å (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Diffraction patterns of 2D crystals tilted to 60° showed reflections to a resolution of ∼2.5 Å (Figure 2–figure supplement 1B). We used the same data collection and processing scheme for AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> to obtain a density map for AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> at 2.5 Å resolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The density map allowed us to model AQP0, five sphingomyelin molecules, SM2, SM3, SM5, SM6 and SM7 (numbers corresponding to the sphingomyelin molecules in AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub>) as well as four cholesterols (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). As with the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure, it was not possible to model lipids in the area near the four-fold axis, where four AQP0 tetramers come together (Figure 3–figure supplement 1D). The statistics for the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure are summarized in Table 3.</p>

<title>The structure of AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> shows an AQP0 array with a high cholesterol content</title>
<p>Superimposition of the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure with the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub>, AQP0<sub>DMPC</sub> and AQP0<sub>EPL</sub> structures yielded RMSD values between the Cα atoms of 0.431 Å, 0.390 Å and 0.362 Å (Figure 3–figure supplement 2C–E), again showing that the lipid environment has no detectable effect on the conformation of AQP0. Also, the water pathway in AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> showed the same densities representing water molecules as observed in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure. Hence, the AQP0 structure is essentially identical in the two analyzed sphingomyelin/cholesterol bilayers.</p>
<p>In the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure, an AQP0 subunit is surrounded by seven sphingomyelin molecules, but in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure, due to the higher cholesterol content, two of the sphingomyelins in the extracellular leaflet, SM1 and SM4, have been replaced by cholesterols (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Of the two sphingomyelins remaining in the extracellular leaflet, the conformation of SM3 is virtually identical to that in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The other sphingomyelin in the extracellular leaflet, SM2, as well as the three sphingomyelins in the cytoplasmic leaflets, SM5 – SM7, all occupy similar positions as their counterparts in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure, but adopt different conformations. In particular, SM2 and SM6 adapt their conformation to accommodate the additional cholesterol molecules. With the exception of SM3, the head group of which is stabilized by identical interactions with AQP0 in AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> and AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub>, the head groups of all other corresponding sphingomyelins are different in the two structures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), corroborating the general lack of specific lipid–protein interactions in the head-group region.</p>
<p>The four cholesterol molecules in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure show an interesting distribution. Overlaying the two bilayers shows that Chol1 in AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> almost perfectly overlaps with Chol1 in AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), and Chol1 interacts with AQP0 in the same way in the two structures, strengthening the notion that this is the preferred location for cholesterol to interact with AQP0. In the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure, Chol1 also interacts extensively with the adjacent sphingolipids, but some of these interactions are absent in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure, due to the presence of the additional Chol2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The interaction with extracellular sphingomyelin SM1 in AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> is replaced by an interaction with an acyl chain from cytoplasmic sphingomyelin SM5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, however, despite their proximity, there do not seem to be any direct interactions between the two cholesterols (Figure 4–figure supplement 1A).</p>
<p>In addition to Chol1 and Chol2 in the extracellular leaflet, another cholesterol, Chol4, is located in the cytoplasmic leaflet (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Like Chol1 and Chol2, Chol4 interacts with AQP0 surface areas that feature aromatic residues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), in particular tryptophan and phenylalanine residues, which appear to make π-stacking interactions with the cholesterol ring system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Burley and Petsko, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">McGaughey et al., 1998</xref>) (Figure 4–figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>Chol3 is the most unusual cholesterol molecule seen in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure. While all other cholesterols are either within the extracellular or cytoplasmic leaflet, Chol3 is located almost in the middle of the bilayer, with its hydroxyl head group located in the middle of the extracellular leaflet (Figure 4A–figure supplement 3). The orientation of Chol3 is that of the other cholesterols in the extracellular leaflet, suggesting that it originated from that leaflet. There are three phenylalanine residues in the vicinity of Chol3, but these do not form π-stacking interactions with its ring system but are close to its acyl chain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>

<title>Cholesterol positions observed in the electron crystallographic structures are representative of those around single AQP0 tetramers</title>
<p>The electron crystallographic structures of AQP0 were obtained with 2D crystals, in which the lipids are constrained by the packing of the AQP0 tetramers. Therefore, we investigated if the cholesterol positions seen in these structures represent the positions unconstrained cholesterol would adopt around individual AQP0 tetramers, as has previously been shown to be the case for DMPC lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>). The electron crystallographic AQP0 structures obtained with SM:Chol ratios of 2:1, AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub>, and 1:2, AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub>, revealed distinct localization patterns for cholesterol around AQP0. In the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure, a single cholesterol molecule was observed, associated with AQP0 surface S1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, top). This cholesterol position was also identified in a previous MD simulation study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">O’Connor and Klauda, 2011</xref>). In the density map representing the average localization of cholesterol around AQP0 over time that we calculated from MD simulations of an individual AQP0 tetramer in a 2:1 SM:Chol membrane (Figure 5–figure supplement 1B), we also found a high cholesterol density in the same position (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, top). The simulations identified an additional hotspot, located on the extracellular side of surface S1 (see high density marked with an asterisk in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, top). No cholesterol was observed in this position in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure, suggesting that it may be preferentially occupied by cholesterol around single AQP0 tetramers but may be unfavorable in the context of AQP0 arrays. In contrast, the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure revealed four cholesterol molecules associated with the AQP0 surface (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, bottom), including the one seen at the SM:Chol ratio of 2:1. Our simulations at that high cholesterol concentration largely recapitulated these positions, as seen by the high cholesterol densities at positions for Chol1, Chol2, Chol3, and Chol4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, bottom).</p>

<p>A particularly interesting cholesterol in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure is Chol3, which is localized close to the center of the lipid bilayer and is therefore referred to as “deep cholesterol”. Our density map representing the average cholesterol localization over time calculated for the high cholesterol concentration shows high density close to the position of Chol3, on both surfaces S1 and S2, but this density is localized to the extracellular leaflet rather than the middle of the membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This finding suggests that the deep cholesterol is not stable when cholesterol associates with individual AQP0 tetramers.</p>
<p>Thus, our simulations demonstrate, as previously shown for DMPC lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>), that the crystalline packing of AQP0 tetramers in 2D crystals does, in general, not affect the positions where cholesterol preferentially interacts with AQP0. However, notably, deep-binding Chol3 seen in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure is not represented in the MD simulations using an isolated AQP0 tetramer. Therefore, we performed further simulations with pairs of AQP0 tetramers to assess whether the deep position of Chol3 represents a crystallographic artifact or may be the result of interface properties between two neighboring AQP0 tetramers.</p>

<title>Deep-binding cholesterol occurs at the interface between two AQP0 tetramers</title>
<p>To assess the behavior of the deep cholesterol associated with AQP0 in terms of orientation and membrane insertion depth (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), we analyzed several different situations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-E</xref>). For this analysis, we initially positioned a cholesterol molecule in the middle of the bilayer according to the relative observed position of the deep cholesterol (Chol3) in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure. For reference, we also simulated a cholesterol inserted at the equivalent position into a pure lipid membrane (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). The presence of cholesterol in the membrane did not significantly alter the insertion depth of the monitored cholesterol. Within a few ns, cholesterol moved away from the deeply inserted position and equilibrated to a stable position with an insertion level of −0.73±0.31 nm (avg. ± s.d.) in a pure SM bilayer and −0.58±0.16 nm (avg. ± s.d.) and −0.60±0.16 nm in the 2:1 and 1:2 SM:Chol membranes, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and Figure 6–figure supplement 1). In terms of orientation, an increasing cholesterol concentration in the membrane resulted in a decreasing tilt of the monitored cholesterol as well as in a narrower distribution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

The cholesterol orientation was defined as the angle between the membrane normal (simulation box z vector) and the vector along the rings of the cholesterol molecule (black dashed line).

<p>The behavior of the monitored deep cholesterol was very different when it was associated with AQP0. In this case, the protein becomes the main factor that defines its insertion depth and orientation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>). The absence or presence of cholesterol in the membrane has no effect on the behavior of the AQP0-associated deep cholesterol: this sterol moved very quickly away from the initial position (Figure 6–figure supplement 1) and stabilized at around −0.6 nm which is a similar value to that seen in SM membranes without AQP0 but less than that of the deep cholesterol seen in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure where it is close to −1.0 nm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>). In terms of orientation, the AQP0-associated deep cholesterol sampled tilt angles up to ∼70° with a distribution rather insensitive to the cholesterol concentration in the membrane (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C-D</xref>). Moreover, it appears that both surfaces of AQP0, S1 and S2, have a similar effect on the insertion depth and orientation of the associated deep cholesterol (compare <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>).</p>
<p>The behavior of the deep cholesterol changed again when it was sandwiched in between two neighboring AQP0 tetramers. While the tilt distribution of the cholesterol is comparable to when it interacts only with one AQP0 tetramer, although it may be able to adopt slightly larger tilts, the insertion depth is distinctly different (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Here the average insertion depth of - 1.16±0.50 nm is now similar to the position of Chol3 in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure of −1.0 nm.</p>
<p>Note that we observed a few spontaneous cholesterol flip-flop events, as previously observed in other microsecond-scale simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Gu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Jo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Marino et al., 2016</xref>), resulting in this particular case in the small peaks at ∼-3.25 nm insertion and ∼135° orientation in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> (see also the sudden drop in the insertion time trace in Figure 6–figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>In summary, our simulations show that the association of a cholesterol with an individual AQP0 tetramer defines the extent of its insertion depth and orientation, overriding any effect that the cholesterol concentration of the surrounding membrane may have. Furthermore, the association of a cholesterol with two adjacent AQP0 tetramers induces it to localize much deeper in the membrane than otherwise observed and supports the position of Chol3 seen in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure.</p>

<title>Sandwiched cholesterol increases the force needed to separate adjacent AQP0 tetramers</title>
<p>Considering the different behavior of cholesterol associated with one AQP0 tetramer <italic>versus</italic> being sandwiched in between two adjacent tetramers, we next asked whether the presence of cholesterol in between two AQP0 tetramers could have an effect on the stability of their association. We considered two lipid interfaces between the two neighboring tetramers: an “SM interface” that consisted of only SM lipids at the positions seen in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure, and a second identical one, except that two SM molecules were replaced by the deep-binding Chol3 molecules in the position observed in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure (Figure 5–figure supplement 1D). During a cumulative time of 10 μs of equilibrium MD simulations, the two AQP0 tetramers overall behaved very similarly for the two interfaces and stayed close together (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), exhibiting only minor variations (of less than 13.4°) in angular lateral, tilt and torsional intra-tetramer motions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). To explore the effect of the deep cholesterols on the stability of the paired tetramers in response to a lateral mechanical perturbation, we applied an external harmonic force to the tetramers, attaching virtual springs to their centers of mass and moving these springs in opposite directions at constant velocity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). The force exerted on the two tetramers was ramped up until the two tetramers detached from each other and the force leveled off (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D-E</xref>). The resulting force-distance profiles revealed that the tetramer pairs withstood a higher force before detachment when cholesterol was present at the interface (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E-F</xref>). More quantitatively, at our fastest pulling rate of 0.1 m/s, at which the integrity of the membrane was still maintained, the detachment forces were not significantly different whether the interface contained cholesterol or not (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). However, for the slower pulling rates of 0.02 m/s and 0.004 m/s, which are more relevant, because there should not be strong forces pulling on AQP0 tetramers in native membranes, the detachment force required to separate the tetramers was statistically significantly higher when their interface contained cholesterol (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Thus, because a higher force is required to separate neighboring AQP0 tetramers when cholesterol is present at their interface, deep cholesterols appear to mechanically stabilize AQP0 arrays.</p>

The schematic drawings illustrate the three main modes of motion: bending (depicted in the drawing as viewed from the side of the membrane), lateral rotation (depicted in the drawing as viewed from the top of the membrane), and torsion (depicted in the drawing as viewed from the side of the membrane with one tetramer in front of the other). Lipids at the interface between the two tetramers (first two panels) and lipids surrounding the two tetramers (last panel) are shown. PC1 plus PC2 capture the bending and rotation while PC3 corresponds to torsion. The histograms in the bottom panels show the projections of the MD trajectories onto the three main PC vectors, for the interfaces containing only sphingomyelin (SM, green) or containing the deep cholesterols (Chol, blue). The approximate angular extent for each of the modes, attributed to these projections, is indicated (in degrees). The distributions with and without cholesterol are very similar, except for PC1. Nevertheless, PC1 relates to a small angular variation (∼7.1° bending together with ∼6.5° rotation).

For this purpose, we calculated density maps representing what components the surface of an AQP0 tetramer interacts with over time. In the absence of cholesterol, the AQP0 surface is completely covered by sphingomyelin in the hydrophobic region of the membrane and by water outside this region (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, left column). As noted before, there are essentially no direct protein–protein interactions between the adjacent tetramers. When cholesterol was present at the interface, it interacted with AQP0 at the center of the membrane and remained mostly in place (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, right column). While the area below the cholesterols towards the cytoplasmic surface is occupied by sphingomyelin as in the interface lacking cholesterol, the area above the cholesterols towards the extracellular surface is now covered with water (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, left column), which is in close proximity to the cholesterol oxygen group (Figure 8–figure supplement 1), and now also forms direct protein–protein interactions with the adjacent tetramer (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, left column, and Figure 8–figure supplement 2). We further analyzed these interactions, by computing the overall fraction of time during which residue–residue contacts formed (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B-C</xref>) and their average lifetimes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). The overall fraction is a thermodynamic quantity that relates to the probability of formation of these contacts, while the lifetime is related to the kinetics of this process. The probability of formation increased mainly for residue pairs above the two cholesterol molecules (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B-C</xref>). The lifetime also slightly increased for the residue pairs above the cholesterol molecules, but these contacts occurred mainly among the highly flexible amino acid side-chains and were short-lived, i.e., smaller than 1 ns (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Interactions formed between adjacent AQP0 tetramers and lipid-AQP0 surface complementarity. (<bold>A</bold>) Equilibrium MD simulations were performed with pairs of AQP0 tetramers without cholesterol (top row) or with cholesterol (bottom row) at the interface. Density maps were calculated for different components next to the AQP0 surface over time and these maps were projected onto the surface of one of the AQP0 tetramers to represent their localization. For clarity, the second tetramer, which would be in front of the shown tetramer, is not shown. The density displayed at arbitrary density units is color-coded and shows the position of cholesterol (red), protein, i.e., the neighboring AQP0 tetramer (brown), sphingomyelin (green) and water (blue). (<bold>B</bold>) T<sub>ij</sub> is defined as the fraction of time during which residues (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) from opposite tetramers are in contact. This quantity was extracted from the equilibrium simulations for the pure sphingomyelin interface T<sub>ij</sub>(SM) and for the interface containing cholesterol T<sub>ij</sub>(Chol). T<sub>ij</sub> = 0 means that i and j were never in contact and T<sub>ij</sub> = 1 means that they were always in contact. (<bold>C</bold>) The pairwise difference ΔT<sub>ij</sub> = T<sub>ij</sub>(Chol) - T<sub>ij</sub>(SM) is shown, discarding insignificant changes (ΔT<sub>ij</sub> &lt; 1 percentage, %, points). Accordingly, a value of ΔT<sub>ij</sub> &gt; 0 (ΔT<sub>ij</sub> &lt; 0) corresponds to protein–protein contacts that were more often observed in the simulations with cholesterol (sphingomyelin). For instance, the residue pair Gln129–Ser106 was observed almost 20 percentage points more time in the simulations with cholesterol. The color of the bars indicates the location of the residues (grey: inner part of the extracellular leaflet, i.e., where deep cholesterol resides; white: the rest of the interfacial protein surface, see inset at lower right). Residues involved in a high ΔT<sub>ij</sub> &gt; 10 percentage points are highlighted in orange in the inset (yellow for the contact Leu217–Phe214 observed in the electron crystallographic structure). (<bold>D</bold>) The average duration for every established protein–protein contact, &lt;τ&gt;<sub>ij</sub>, is also displayed for the two different lipid interfaces. In (<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>D</bold>), the horizontal dashed lines indicate the highest value observed for all possible residue pairs. Contacts observed in the electron crystallographic structures are highlighted in bold letters. In B–D, the avg±s.e.m. is presented (<italic>n</italic> = 20, i.e., 10 independent simulation times with 2 symmetric monomeric interfaces). (<bold>E</bold>) The schematic drawing depicts a top view of the two associated AQP0 tetramers (squares, “Tet 1” and “Tet 2”) with the two central lipids sandwiched between them (black circles). The other lipids at the interface are not shown for clarity. The respective monomer surfaces S1 and S2 are indicated. The region of the surface of the two tetramers that is in total covered by a lipid, <italic>A<sub>Contact</sub></italic> (red line) was normalized by the surface area of the lipid, <italic>A<sub>Lipid</sub></italic> (here corresponding to the perimeter of the circles). This ratio gives a measure of the surface complementarity between the tetramers and the sandwiched lipids, i.e., the higher the value of <italic>A<sub>Contact</sub>/A<sub>Lipid</sub></italic> the more the two surfaces complement each other. (<bold>F</bold>) Normalized histograms of <italic>A<sub>Contact</sub>/A<sub>Lipid</sub></italic> obtained from the equilibrium MD simulations are shown for the central sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol (Chol).

<p>Only one inter-tetramer contact was observed in the electron crystallographic structure of AQP0 in a high cholesterol membrane, AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub>, namely Leu217<sub>Tet1</sub>-Phe14<sub>Tet12</sub>. This contact was also observed in our simulations (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B–D</xref>). However, the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure did not reveal protein–protein contacts above the cholesterol molecules (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B–D</xref>). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that although such contacts could be observed in our simulations for the cholesterol-containing interface, they had a rather low probability to occur (only up to 20% of the simulated time, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, the electron crystallographic structure would visualize other contacts with a higher probability, in particular protein–water interactions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, left column).</p>

<title>Lipid–protein surface complementarity may also enhance mechanical resistance of associated AQP0 tetramers</title>
<p>We found that the presence of cholesterol at the interface results in new protein–protein interactions between adjacent AQP0 tetramers that may increase the stability of their association, but we wondered whether the cholesterol itself could contribute to the increased force needed to separate associated tetramers. Surface complementarity has previously been suggested to play a key role in modulating lipid–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Niemelä et al., 2010</xref>) with particular relevance for cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Kurth et al., 2020</xref>), prompting us to analyze the surface complementarity between AQP0 and cholesterol. We quantified surface complementarity as the contact area between the sandwiched lipids (either cholesterol or sphingomyelin) and the two tetramers, <italic>A<sub>Contact</sub></italic>, and normalized it by the surface area of the lipid in question, <italic>A<sub>Lipid</sub></italic>, i.e., a larger <italic>A<sub>Contact</sub></italic>/<italic>A<sub>Lipid</sub></italic> ratio would indicate a higher surface complementarity between the lipid and the proteins (see Methods for details of this calculation and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref> for a schematic diagram). We calculated the <italic>A<sub>Contact</sub></italic>/<italic>A<sub>Lipid</sub></italic> ratio from the equilibrium simulations. Remarkably, the sandwiched cholesterol displayed a higher surface complementarity than the sandwiched sphingomyelin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>). This analysis thus suggests that cholesterol better accommodates to the roughness of the two AQP0 tetramer surfaces than sphingomyelin can, a feature that may contribute to the enhanced resistance of associated tetramers to detach when cholesterol is present at their interface.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we determined two electron crystallographic structures of AQP0 in membranes formed by sphingomyelin and cholesterol. As these so-called raft lipids are the main constituents of lens membranes, they represent the natural environment of AQP0. The AQP0 crystals formed in sphingomyelin/cholesterol membranes have the same lattice constants as previous 2D crystals obtained with other lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Gonen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>) as well as the 2D arrays found in lens membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Buzhynskyy et al., 2007</xref>). The 2D crystals thus reflect the arrangement of AQP0 tetramers in native 2D arrays.</p>
<p>Our structure of AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> reveals seven sphingomyelins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), the same number of lipids also seen in structures of AQP0 in bilayers formed by DMPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Gonen et al., 2005</xref>) and EPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>), and these are also located in almost identical positions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B–C</xref>). The interaction of sphingomyelins with AQP0 thus seem to be governed by the same principles that were found for phosphoglycerolipids, namely that the acyl chains locate to grooves in the protein surface and that the lipid head groups make few if any interactions with the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>). However, compared to the acyl chains in the EPL bilayer, those of the sphingomyelins appear to be straighter, which likely reflects the saturated nature of the sphingomyelin acyl chains. Despite this difference, the structure of the sphingomyelin bilayer is very similar to those of bilayers formed by phosphoglycerolipids, indicating that sphingomyelin by itself is unlikely the reason for AQP0 to form 2D arrays in lens membranes.</p>
<p>Cholesterol has a higher affinity for sphingomyelin than for phosphoglycerolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Niu and Litman, 2002</xref>), because the mostly saturated acyl chains of sphingomyelin can better accommodate the planar ring system of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Epand and Epand, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>) and because the sphingomyelin backbone has two hydrogen-bond donor groups, an amide and a hydroxyl group, that make hydrogen bonding to cholesterol more effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Róg and Pasenkiewicz-Gierula, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction of the sphingomyelin amide group with the hydroxyl group of cholesterol orients the smooth (α) face of the cholesterol towards sphingomyelin, leaving only the rough (β) face to interact with membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Fantini and Barrantes, 2013</xref>). In the context of AQP0 2D arrays, however, these interactions do not appear to occur. While Chol1 does interact with sphingomyelin acyl chains in both structures, the additional cholesterols in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure seem to have little interactions with sphingomyelin acyl chains and instead seem to substitute for some of the sphingomyelin acyl chains seen in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and C</xref>). We also do not observe interactions between the hydroxyl head group of any cholesterols with an amide group of the sphingomyelins. While we cannot rule out that specific sphingomyelin–cholesterol interactions occur in the membrane area enclosed by four AQP0 tetramers (where we were unable to build models for the lipids due to the four-fold symmetry axis), our structures suggest that specific sphingomyelin–cholesterol interactions do not play a critical role in AQP0 array formation in the lens membrane.</p>
<p>Cholesterol increases the order of lipid acyl chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">de Meyer and Smit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Lafleur et al., 1990</xref>), and the resulting phase transition is thought to contribute to the segregation of cholesterol-enriched membrane areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Pandit et al., 2007</xref>). A potential mechanism by which cholesterol could induce AQP0 array formation could thus be that cholesterol bound to AQP0 would order the surrounding lipids, leading to a phase transition that leads to an initial segregation and crystallization of the AQP0/cholesterol/sphingomyelin units in the membrane.</p>
<p>In an attempt to assess this possibility, we looked at the <italic>B</italic>-factors of the acyl chains, which are affected, among other factors, by the mobility of the atoms. Comparison of corresponding acyl chains showed that the <italic>B</italic>-factors of the acyl chains in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure tend to be slightly lower than those of the acyl chains in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure (Figure 4–figure supplement 2), suggesting that the cholesterols could have an ordering effect on the sphingomyelin acyl chains. However, the <italic>B</italic>-factors of the acyl chains in the AQP0<sub>EPL</sub> structure, which contain double bonds and are not constrained by cholesterol and should thus be much less ordered, are similar to those of the acyl chains in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure. A likely explanation is that acyl chains, including unsaturated ones, preferentially fill in grooves in the protein surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Hite et al., 2010</xref>), which should already substantially constrain their mobility. Therefore, cholesterol bound to the protein surface may not add much additional constraints to their already restricted mobility. Cholesterol-induced phase separation thus does not seem to be a likely cause for AQP0 array formation.</p>
<p>The hydrophobic thickness is an important characteristic of a lipid bilayer, which depends on the length and saturation of the acyl chains of the lipids forming the bilayer. Mismatch of the hydrophobic thickness between a membrane protein and the lipid bilayer is thought to be one mechanism by which membrane proteins can cluster in a membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Hanulová and Weiss, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>). One factor that affects the hydrophobic thickness of a membrane is its cholesterol content, which is related to the ordering effect of cholesterol on the lipid acyl chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">de Meyer and Smit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Lafleur et al., 1990</xref>). Change in cholesterol-induced hydrophobic thickness may thus be another potential force that drives the formation of AQP0 arrays in the lens membrane.</p>
<p>To assess the influence of cholesterol content on the hydrophobic thickness of the membrane, we measured the average distance between the phosphor atoms of the phosphodiester groups and the nitrogen atoms of the amide groups of the sphingomyelins in the two leaflets (Figure 1–figure supplement 1), which were 36.8 Å and 31.3 Å, respectively, for the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> bilayer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and 33.9 Å and 27.1 Å, respectively, for the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> bilayer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). As both distances are larger for the bilayer with the higher cholesterol content, by ∼3 Å for the phosphodiester groups and ∼4 Å for the amide groups, it appears that a higher cholesterol content indeed increases the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer formed by the annular sphingomyelins.</p>
<p>In cells, sphingomyelin is predominantly found in the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Devaux, 1991</xref>), so that sphingomyelins seen in the extracellular leaflet in our two structures likely represent true positions of sphingomyelin in native AQP0 2D arrays. The two sphingomyelins in the extracellular leaflet that are seen in both sphingomyelin/cholesterol membranes are in exactly the same position (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), establishing that the extracellular leaflet does not change its position relative to AQP0 upon thickening of the membrane with increasing cholesterol content. Sphingomyelin SM3 may be responsible for the fixed position of the extracellular leaflet. In all structures of AQP0 in different lipid bilayers, the lipid at the position equivalent to that of SM3 always has the best-defined density and the lowest <italic>B</italic>-factors (including for the acyl chains; Figure 4–figure supplement 2). The lipid at this position is always the only one whose head group makes interactions with AQP0. It is thus possible that the lipid at this position defines and locks in the position of the extracellular leaflet with respect to AQP0. As a result, the extracellular leaflet does not play a role in defining the thickness of the membrane.</p>
<p>The increase in hydrophobic thickness with higher cholesterol content is the result of the three sphingomyelins in the cytoplasmic leaflet moving further out from the bilayer center, which they do even though this leaflet contains only a single cholesterol (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The notion that an increase in hydrophobic thickness is predominantly due to movements of lipids in the cytoplasmic leaflet is consistent with the observation that these lipids are usually more mobile, i.e., have higher <italic>B</italic>-factors in crystal structure than lipids in the extracellular leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Belrhali et al., 1999</xref>). Comparison of the lipid arrangement in the cytoplasmic leaflet shows that Chol4 in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure assumes the position of SM6 in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A–C</xref>). The new position of the displaced SM6 in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure is further out from the bilayer center and potentially is the cause for similar outward movements of lipids SM5 and SM7, thus defining the new position of the cytoplasmic leaflet and increasing the hydrophobic thickness of the annular lipid bilayer. Hence, a higher cholesterol concentration of the membrane does increase the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer formed by the annular lipids surrounding AQP0 tetramers, thus creating a hydrophobic mismatch with the remaining lipid bilayer, which, in turn, would provide a driving force for AQP0 tetramers to cluster in the native lens membrane.</p>
<p>The cholesterols in our structures do not interact with AQP0 through consensus cholesterol-binding sites known as the <underline>C</underline>holesterol <underline>R</underline>ecognition/interaction <underline>A</underline>minoacid <underline>C</underline>onsensus sequence (CRAC domain; -L/V-(X)<sub>1-5</sub>-Y-(X)<sub>1-5</sub>-R/K-) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Li and Papadopoulos, 1998</xref>) or the inverted CRAC domain, CARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baier et al., 2011</xref>). Cholesterol can also bind to membrane proteins in a fashion that does not involve a CRAC or CARC domain, as seen for example for the influenza M2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Elkins et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">2017</xref>) and α-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Fantini et al., 2011</xref>). Emerging cryo-EM structures of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) also do not show a consensus motif for their interaction with cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Sarkar and Chattopadhyay, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Taghon et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the cholesterols interact with AQP0 through their smooth α face (Figure 4–figure supplement 1), which is not engaged in interactions with sphingomyelin as previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Fantini and Barrantes, 2013</xref>), thus differing from the predominant interaction of cholesterols with GPCRs, the G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium-2 (GIRK2) channel, and the Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which occur predominantly through the rough β face of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Gimpl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Mathiharan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Shinoda et al., 2009</xref>). However, there are other cases in which cholesterol interacts with membrane proteins through its α face, such as seen for the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Likely the residues on the protein surface determine whether a protein interacts with cholesterol through its α or β face. The smooth α face interacts with aromatic side chains through π-stacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Nishio et al., 1995</xref>), whereas the β face appears to interact with hydrophobic side chains, such as leucine, valine, or isoleucine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Fantini et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Chol3 is the most unusual lipid in our structures, because it is located in the middle of the lipid bilayer and because it is sandwiched between two neighboring AQP tetramers. Binding sites for cholesterol in the middle of the membrane have also been described for GPCRs, and these sites have been named “deep binding sites” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Genheden et al., 2017</xref>). A docking investigation with known membrane protein structures for cholesterol-binding sites revealed deep binding sites not only in GPCRs but also in ion channels and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Lee, 2018</xref>). Unlike any other cholesterol in our structures, Chol3 interacts directly with two AQP0 subunits that are part of different tetramers. This interaction is different from the cholesterol-induced dimerization of GPCRs as these are mediated by interactions between two or more cholesterol molecules rather than one cholesterol directly interacting with two GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Gimpl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>). The two adjacent AQP0 tetramers form a pocket that is ∼8.5 Å wide at the position of the ring system and ∼2.5 Å at the position of the acyl chain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The interaction surface on the AQP0 subunit interacting with the smooth face of Chol3 encompasses 373 Å<sup>2</sup> and is formed by residues Ser106, Val103, Ala102, Ala99, and Leu21, which line the ring system, and three phenylalanine residues, Phe17, Phe18 and Phe14, which surround the acyl chain. The interaction surface on the AQP0 subunit interacting with the rough face of Chol3 is 344 Å<sup>2</sup> and is predominantly formed by residues Ile132, Ile135, Phe136, Ile210, Leu214, and Leu217 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Leucine and isoleucine residues have also been found to mediate the interaction of many GPCRs with the rough β face of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Gimpl, 2016</xref>). The hydroxyl head group of Chol3 interacts with a water molecule that may be stabilized through an interaction with Ser126 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Because of its intricate interactions with two AQP0 subunits, Chol3 can likely function as a glue that can keep two tetramers together. This structural characteristic may be the reason why AQP0 can form 2D arrays in pure cholesterol membranes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain further insights into the role cholesterol plays in the stability of AQP0 arrays, we used MD simulations to investigate the interplay between cholesterol and AQP0. The first set of simulations investigated the localization of cholesterol around a single AQP0 tetramer. Cholesterol positioned at well-defined positions, i.e., hotspots, that were in notable agreement with both the predicted positions from a previous computational study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">O’Connor and Klauda, 2011</xref>) as well as the positions in the electron crystallographic structures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, as it has been previously demonstrated to be the case for phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>), the crystal packing in the crystallographic structures does not greatly affect the positioning of cholesterol around AQP0. In consequence, crystallographic cholesterol positions recapitulate the behavior of unconstrained cholesterol molecules around a single AQP0 tetramer. This is the case for all cholesterols except for one, the deep cholesterol, which will be discussed in detail below. Cholesterol localization around membrane proteins has been extensively studied, especially in the context of the regulation and activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), exchangers and ion channels, but also aquaporins (for a comprehensive review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Corradi et al., 2019</xref>)). Interestingly, in coarse-grained MD simulations, when AQP1 was embedded in a lipid bilayer resembling the plasma membrane, cholesterol was enriched at two positions that qualitatively correspond to the lateral projections of Chol3 and Chol4 positions observed here for AQP0 (compare <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> with <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Corradi et al., 2018</xref>)). This suggests that individual AQP0 and AQP1 tetramers share similarities in their cholesterol-binding fingerprints, as was already shown for phospholipids in this protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Stansfeld et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, cholesterol was rather depleted from the Chol1 position in AQP1. The shape of the protein surface has been shown to critically define the positions where lipids non-specifically associate with AQP0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aponte-Santamaría et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Briones et al., 2017</xref>) and also other proteins (e.g., ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Niemelä et al., 2010</xref>) and GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Kurth et al., 2020</xref>), among many others reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Corradi et al., 2019</xref>)). This principle presumably applies here, too, i.e., the different surface of AQP0 at the Chol1 position, compared to that of AQP1, may result in a greater association of cholesterol over sphingolipids in this position (Figure 8–figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>In a second set of simulations, we attempted to understand the molecular reasons for the unusual position of deep binding Chol3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). We demonstrate that neither a single AQP0 tetramer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C–D</xref>) nor a specific bulk cholesterol concentration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) is sufficient to maintain annular cholesterol molecules at such a deeply-inserted position. Instead, the constraint imposed by two adjacent AQP0 tetramers and the coordination of two water molecules were required (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E</xref>, 8A and Figure 8–figure supplement 1). Our data are thus consistent with the existence of deep cholesterol positions but only in a highly constrained setup that involves two AQP0 tetramers. The immediate questions raised by the existence of deep cholesterols are whether these affect the formation and/or stability of 2D AQP0 arrays.</p>
<p>Our simulations provide strong evidence for a direct influence of deep cholesterol molecules on the mechanical stability of the association between two adjacent AQP0 tetramers. We demonstrate that two adjacent tetramers can withstand larger lateral detachment forces when their interface contains deep cholesterol molecules (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C–F</xref>). Crystal structures of several membrane proteins already revealed that cholesterol can mediate crystal packing interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Crnjar and Molteni, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Khunweeraphong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the presence of cholesterol has been reported to influence membrane-protein oligomerization, a feature mainly explored for GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Corradi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Gahbauer and Böckmann, 2016</xref>). We expand on these data, by providing evidence of cholesterol—directly—engaging in the stronger attachment of two membrane proteins. We attribute this to cholesterol facilitating the formation of transient protein–protein contacts (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A–D</xref>) together with providing higher surface complementarity when sandwiched between two AQP0 tetramers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E–F</xref>). Cardiolipin is a phospholipid that has been implicated in stabilizing transient α-helical membrane protein oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>). More specifically, cardiolipin has been described to serve as a “glue” for the cytochrome components of the respiratory chain in mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Arnarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, cardiolipin also impacts the resistance of AQPZ, the bacterial homolog of AQP0, to unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Laganowsky et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, lipids have been recently shown to mediate protein assembly in the outer membrane of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Webby et al., 2022</xref>). Analogous to these systems and based on our electron crystallography structures and MD simulations, we propose that deep cholesterol increases the mechanical stability of associated AQP0 tetramers.</p>
<p>Our structures of AQP0 arrays in sphingomyelin bilayers with low and high cholesterol content and the results from the MD simulations allow us to propose a model for cholesterol-induced array formation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). In a lipid bilayer with a low cholesterol concentration, cholesterol may interact with AQP0 predominantly through the most specific cholesterol-binding site, the one occupied by Chol1, but this interaction would be transient and would not have a meaningful effect on the organization of the surrounding lipid molecules (sphingomyelin in our AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). An increase in cholesterol concentration will cause more cholesterols in the extracellular leaflet to bind to AQP0. In addition, cholesterol will also enrich in the cytoplasmic leaflet and associate with AQP0. This interaction will shift the annular lipids in this leaflet further away from the membrane center and create a hydrophobic mismatch between the shell of annular lipids and the surrounding lipid bilayer (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>). Driven by the force to minimize membrane tension induced by hydrophobic mismatch, AQP0 tetramers will cluster. Cholesterols in between the tetramers can diffuse deeper into the membrane and associate with deep binding sites on AQP0, thus stabilizing the interaction between adjacent tetramers (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). Alternatively, it may also be possible that cholesterol first interacts with a deep binding site on one AQP0 but is only stabilized as the second AQP0 traps it in position. As each AQP0 tetramer has four deep cholesterol-binding sites, the avidity effect would result in the formation and stabilization of large 2D arrays as those seen in native lens membranes (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Proposed model for how an increasing cholesterol concentration drives AQP0 2D array formation in the native lens membrane. (<bold>A</bold>) At a low cholesterol concentration, AQP0 tetramers are mostly surrounded by phospholipids and sphingomyelin. Free cholesterol in the membrane (green ovals) only associates with the highest affinity cholesterol-binding sites. Cholesterols occupying these peripheral binding sites are shown as red ovals and the black double-headed arrow indicates the transient nature of this interaction. The deep cholesterol-binding sites (orange squares) are not occupied. (<bold>B</bold>) With increasing cholesterol concentration, more cholesterols associate with the AQP0 surface. These cholesterols cause the interacting lipids in the cytoplasmic leaflet to move out from the bilayer center (blue arrow), resulting in the annular lipid shell that has a bigger hydrophobic thickness than the surrounding membrane, creating a hydrophobic mismatch that results in membrane deformation. (<bold>C</bold>) To minimize hydrophobic mismatch, AQP0 tetramers cluster. Cholesterol in between adjacent tetramers can move into the deep binding sites (yellow arrow) and cholesterol occupying deep binding sites (yellow ovals) act as glue that increases that association of the adjacent tetramers (indicated by the small double-headed black arrow) as compared to adjacent tetramers that do not sandwich a deep-binding cholesterol (indicated by the large double-headed black arrow). Clustering of proteins to minimize hydrophobic mismatch and stabilization by deep cholesterol-mediated protein–protein interactions may be the basis for the formation of transient lipid rafts. (<bold>D</bold>) Each AQP0 tetramer has four deep cholesterol-binding sites. As a result of the avidity effect, AQP0 can form large and stable 2D arrays.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>This model is specific for the formation of AQP0 arrays in lens membranes, but similar principles may underlie the organization of lipid rafts. AQP0 may be special in that it forms tetramers and thus has four deep cholesterol-binding sites, so that the avidity effect allows it to form much larger domains than seen for typical lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Zelenka, 1984</xref>). In addition, it is presumably not common that the same protein has surfaces that can interact with both the smooth α and the rough β face of cholesterol. However, cholesterol would have the potential to mediate the association of any protein with an α face-interacting surface with any other protein that features a β face-interacting surface. Thus, while hydrophobic mismatch and phase separation may be driving forces that bring proteins into close proximity, cholesterol may be the actual glue that increases the time they remain associated.</p>

<title>MD simulations under equilibrium conditions</title>
<p>The simulations performed under equilibrium conditions are summarized in Table 4. Initial positions were taken from the electron crystallographic structures of AQP0 with the surrounding annular lipids obtained in <italic>N</italic>-palmitoyl sphingomyelin (SM) membranes at low (∼33%) and high (∼66%) cholesterol (Chol) concentrations. For simulations of pure lipid bilayers, a single cholesterol molecule was inserted in the membrane at the same height, relative to the neighboring lipids, as the deep cholesterol seen in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure (Figure 5–figure supplement 1A). For simulations using a single AQP0 tetramer, the tetramer was either inserted into the membrane by itself (Figure 5–figure supplement 1B) or with the annular lipids observed in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure, in which case the missing atoms in the lipid acyl chains were added (Figure 5–figure supplement 1C). For simulations using a tetramer pair, only the lipids sandwiched between them in the EC structures were included and the acyl chains completed as above (Figure 5–figure supplement 1D). Here, two different arrangements of sandwiched lipids were considered: either the layer consisting of the SM lipids seen in the AQP0<sub>2SM:1Chol</sub> structure or a hybrid layer replacing the two central SM lipids with the electron crystallographic (EC) deep cholesterol molecules observed in the AQP0<sub>1SM:2Chol</sub> structure. AQP0 with or without the EC lipids was inserted into equilibrated SM:Chol membranes using g_membed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Wolf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Yesylevskyy, 2007</xref>). Membranes with three different cholesterol concentrations (see Table 4) were built and equilibrated using the standard protocol of CHARMM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Brooks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Jo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). The equilibration process started with a Steepest Descent energy minimization step, followed by five consecutive short equilibration simulations (first three with a timestep of 1 fs, the final two with a timestep of 2 fs) with a gradual decrease in position and dihedral restraints for the lipid headgroups and a final one without position restraints. Equilibration simulations were then performed until bulk membrane properties, such as thickness and deuterium order parameters, became stable and congruent with previous reports such as those by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Doktorova et al., 2020</xref>) and others (Figure 5–figure supplement 2 and Figure 5–figure supplement 3).</p>
<p>Five simulation replicas (ten for the tetramer pair) were run for each system with a simulation time per replica of 1 μs for the tetramer pair, and 500 ns for all others. For all simulations including EC lipids, the protein was inserted and then each replica was initialized with different velocity distributions. For simulations of a single AQP0 tetramer without EC lipids, in addition to using different random starting velocities, the protein was rotated at 18° intervals such that it faced different lipids. For simulations of a tetramer pair, the pair was rotated at 36° intervals for each replica. In the first five replicas, the tetramer pair was inserted at the center of the membrane, while in the other five replicas it was inserted at the corner of the pre-equilibrated lipid membrane. The first 100 ns of each simulation replica was considered as additional equilibration time and not included in further analysis, with the exception of the two tetramer simulations, for which 300 ns were discarded as equilibration.</p>

Periodic boundary conditions were applied. All systems were maintained at a temperature of 323 K (coupling constant of 1 ps) and a pressure of 1 bar (coupling constant of 5 ps) using the Nosé-Hoover thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Hoover, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Nosé, 1984</xref>) (Berendsen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>) in the position-restrained equilibration steps) and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Nosé and Klein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>) in a semi-isotropic scheme, respectively.

<p>The membrane-insertion depth was defined as the position of the cholesterol oxygen atom in reference to the average <italic>z</italic> position of the phosphorus atoms of the SM molecules in the extracellular leaflet within 0.8 nm of the protein for the systems containing AQP0 tetramers, or within 3.0 nm of the monitored lipid for the systems not containing AQP0 teramers (“no-AQP0”).

<p>Aquaporin-0 forms 2D crystals in the lens of the eye. This propensity to form 2D crystals was originally exploited to solve the structure of aquaporin-0 reconstituted in membranes. Existing structures do not explain why the proteins spontaneously form these arrays, however. In this work the authors investigate the hypothesis that the main lipids in the native membranes, sphingomyelin and cholesterol, contribute to lattice formation. By titrating the cholesterol: sphingomyelin ratio, the authors identify cholesterol binding sites of increasing stability. The authors identify a cholesterol that interacts with adjacent tetramers and is bound at an unusual membrane depth. Computational simulations suggest that this cholesterol is only stable in the context of adjacent tetramers (ie lattice formation) and that the presence of the cholesterol increases the stability of that interface. The exact mechanism is not clear, but the authors propose that the so-called &quot;deep cholesterol&quot; improves shape complementarity between adjacent tetramers and modulates the kinetics of protein-protein interactions. Finally, the authors provide a reasonable model for the role of cholesterol in</p>
<p>Strengths of this manuscript include the analysis of multiple structures determined with different lipid compositions and lipid:cholesterol ratios. For each these, multiple lipids can be modelled, giving a good sense of the lipid specificity at various favorable lipid binding positions. In addition, multiple hypotheses are tested in a very thorough computational analysis that provides the framework for interpreting the structural observations. The authors also provide a thorough scholarly discussion that connects their work with other studies of membrane protein-cholesterol interactions.</p>
<p>The model presented by the authors is consistent with the data described. Further testing of this model, for example by mutating the deep cholesterol binding site, would strengthen the model. However, such experiments might be challenging due to the relatively non-specific/hydrophobic nature of the deep cholesterol binding site.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the manuscript by Chiu et al., &quot;Structure and dynamics of cholesterol-mediated aquaporin-0 arrays and implications for lipid rafts,&quot; the authors address the effect of cholesterol on array formation by AQP0. Using a combination of electron crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations, the authors show binding of a &quot;deep&quot; cholesterol molecule between AQP0 tetramers. Each AQP0 tetramers binds four deep cholesterols to form a crystallographic array of AQP0.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The combined approaches of electron crystallography and MD simulations under different lipid conditions (different sphingomyelin and cholesterol concentrations) are a strength of the study. The authors provide a thorough and convincing assessment of cholesterol binding, protein-protein interactions, and array formation by AQP0. The MD simulations allow the authors to consider the propensity of cholesterol to occupy the observed binding sites in the absence of crystal contacts. The combined methods and the breadth of analyses set a high standard in the field of membrane protein structural biology.</p>
<p>The findings of the authors fit nicely into a growing body of literature on cholesterol binding sites that mediate membrane protein-protein interactions. Cholesterol interacts with a variety of membrane proteins via its smooth alpha face of rough beta face. AQP0 is somewhat unique in that it binds the rough face of cholesterol in a &quot;deep&quot; binding site that places cholesterol in the middle of the membrane bilayer. So-called &quot;deep&quot; cholesterol binding sites have been described for GPCRs and docking studies suggest they may exist on other ion channels and transporters. In the case of AQP0, the deep cholesterol acts as a glue that holds two tetramers together. Since each tetramer has four binding sites for deep cholesterol, the assembly and mechanical stability of an extended two-dimensional array of AQP0 tetramers is a natural consequence in lens membranes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors report that the findings generally apply to raft formation in membranes. However, this point is less clear as the lens membrane in which AQP0 resides is rather unique in lipid and protein content and density. Nonetheless, the authors achieve the overall goal of evaluating cholesterol binding to AQP0, and there are many valuable and informative figures in the main manuscript and supplement that provide convincing results and interpretations.</p>

<p>Summary: This manuscript aims to unravel the mechanisms behind Aquaporin-0 (AQP0) tetramer array formation within lens membranes. The authors utilized electron crystallography and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to shed light on the role of cholesterol in shaping the structural organization of AQP0. The evidence suggests that cholesterol not only defines the positions and orientations of associated molecules but also plays a crucial role in stabilizing AQP0 tetramer arrays. This study provides valuable insights into the potential principles driving protein clustering within lipid rafts, advancing our understanding of membrane biology.</p>
<p>In this review, I will focus on the MD simulations part, since this is my area of expertise. The authors conducted an impressive set of MD simulations aiming at understanding the role of cholesterol in structural organization of AQP0 arrays. These simulations clearly demonstrate the well-defined localization of cholesterol molecules around a single AQP0 tetramer, aligning with previous computational studies and the crystallographic structures presented in this manuscript. Interestingly, authors identified an unusual position for one cholesterol molecule, located near the center of the lipid bilayer, which was stabilized by the adjacent AQP0 tetramers. The authors showed that these adjacent tetramers can withstand a larger lateral detachment force when deep cholesterol molecules are present at the interface compared to scenarios with sphingomyelin (SM) molecules at the interface between two AQP0 tetramers. Authors interpret that result as evidence that deep cholesterol molecules mechanically stabilize the interface of the AQP0 tetramers. This conclusion has minor weaknesses, and the rigor of the lateral detachment simulations could be increased by establishing a reference point for the detachment force needed to separate AQP0 tetramers in a scenario without lipids at the interface between tetramers, and by increasing the number of repeats for the non-equilibrium steered MD simulations. Thermodynamic integration might be a better approach to compute the stabilization energy in the presence of cholesterol compared to the SM case.</p>
