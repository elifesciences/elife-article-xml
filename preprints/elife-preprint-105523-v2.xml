<title>Summary</title><p>Understanding the physical basis of cellular shape change in response to both internal and external mechanical stresses requires characterisation of cytoplasmic rheology. At subsecond time-scales and micron length-scales, cells behave as fluid-filled sponges in which shape changes necessitate intracellular fluid redistribution. However, whether these cytoplasmic poroelastic properties play an important role in cellular mechanical response over length- scales and time-scales relevant to cell physiology remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether and how a localised deformation of the cell surface gives rise to transient intracellular flows spanning several microns and lasting seconds. Next, we showed that pressure gradients induced in the cytoplasm can be sustained over several minutes. We found that stable pressure gradients can arise from the combination of cortical tension, cytoplasmic poroelasticity and water flows across the membrane. Overall our data indicate that intracellular cytosolic flows and pressure gradients may play a much greater role than currently appreciated, acting over time- and length-scales relevant to mechanotransduction and cell migration, signifying that poroelastic properties need to be accounted for in models of the cell.</p>

<title>Significance statement</title>
<p>Understanding how cells change shape dynamically under the influence of external and internal forces requires characterisation of the mechanical response of the cytoplasm, the viscous material that fills their interior. The cytoplasm consists of a porous solid phase bathed in a fluid, the cytosol. As the cytoplasm is incompressible, any cellular shape change necessitates redistribution of the cytosol within the cell and its flow rate sets the time-scale for deformation. How the cytoplasmic mechanical response affects cell physiology remains poorly understood. We show that the unique physical properties of the cytoplasm allow cells to sustain cellular-scale pressure gradients over minute time-scales. As a consequence, pressure-driven mechanisms may play a much greater role in cell physiology than currently appreciated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rheology of cells determines their response to internal and external mechanical stimuli encountered during normal physiological function. Since the cytoplasm forms the largest part of the cell by volume, its rheological properties are key to understanding cellular shape change in response to mechanical stress. The cytoplasm can be described as a biphasic material that consists of a porous solid phase bathed in an interstitial fluid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In such a material, stress relaxation arises from fluid flow through the pores of the solid phase as a result of spatial gradients in the applied stress field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. By studying stress relaxation in micro-indentation experiments combined with perturbations including volumetric deformations together with chemical and genetic treatments, previous work has shown that, at sub-second time-scales and micron length-scales, the cytoplasm behaves as a poroelastic material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. However, the contribution of cytoplasmic poroelastic properties to the mechanical response of cells has not been characterized on the tens of micron length-scale and second-to-minute time-scale relevant to cell physiology. Thus, it is unclear if poroelastic properties must be accounted for in models of cell mechanics.</p>
<p>During mechanotransduction, cells sense external mechanical stresses and translate them into biochemical signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The intracellular fluid flows and pressure gradients elicited in poroelastic materials in response to local application of stress may represent a stimulus for detection. While deformations are applied at the cellular scale, most mechanosensory processes act at the molecular scale through opening of ion channels and unfolding of proteins. Thus, the spatial extent of the stress and strain fields will determine what proportion of the cell is likely to respond to a stimulus and the temporal evolution of these stress and strain fields will determine the duration over which mechanosensory processes will be stimulated. Understanding how stresses equilibrate in the cytoplasm in response to local application of force is necessary to better understand the physical parameters detected by intracellular mechanotransductory pathways. However, direct characterisation of the spatiotemporal deformation induced by sudden local application of force is currently lacking.</p>
<p>Migrating cells often adopt a polarised morphology with a gradient of non-muscle myosin II (NMII) protein increasing towards the rear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> or the front<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, depending on cell type. Given the poroelastic nature of cytoplasm, theoretical considerations predict that such cortical myosin gradients should result in intracellular pressure gradients driving intracellular fluid flows in the direction opposite to the gradient of NMII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Intracellular flows have been proposed to participate in protrusion formation and migration but have only been indirectly observed in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. These flows may play a particularly important role during migration in confined environments with low adhesion, where most cell types adopt an amoeboid morphology and extend pressure-driven protrusions at their front<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Although significant evidence points towards a role for myosin-generated pressure gradients in migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, it is unclear if intracellular pressure gradients can be sustained over the minute-long time-scales involved in migration.</p>
<p>Here, we used a combination of cell physiology experiments, high-resolution nanoparticle tracking, and finite element (FE) simulations to study how the combination of membrane permeability and cytoplasmic poroelastic properties can lead to steady-state gradients in intracellular pressure. We investigate the dynamics of cellular stress relaxation in response to external and internal mechanical stresses to determine if the poroelastic nature of cytoplasm is relevant to cell physiology on tens of microns length-scales and minute time- scales. We observe a cell-scale mechanical response following application of a local deformation of the cell surface and show that it is due to transient intracellular fluid flows elicited in poroelastic materials. We then reveal experimentally that intracellular pressure gradients lasting several minutes can be sustained in the cytoplasm, signifying that pressure gradients may play a role in migration.</p>

<title>Whole-cell mechanical equilibration in response to localised deformation necessitates several seconds</title>
<p>Cells are often subjected to localised mechanical forces applied at high strain rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In poroelastic materials, rapid application of localised stress pressurises the interstitial fluid. Stress relaxes by flow of water out of the deformed region through the pores of the solid phase. As a consequence, the rate of mechanical equilibration is set by the poroelastic diffusion constant <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic> that depends on the elasticity ð¸ of the solid phase, the viscosity <italic>Î·</italic> of the fluid phase, and the size ð of the pores through which the interstitial fluid can permeate: <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic>â¼ð¸ð<sup>2</sup>/<italic>Î·</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The time-scale of water flow out of the deformed region is ð¡<sub>ð</sub>â¼ð¿<sup>2</sup>/<italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic>, where ð¿ is a length-scale associated with deformation. Previous work has shown that local force application to a cell can result in global changes in the height of the cell surface and revealed the presence of two regimes: one fast due to stress propagation in the cytoskeleton and the other slow, whose origin was unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. As previous work has shown that the cytoplasm behaves as a poroelastic material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that the slow response taking place of over tens of microns length-scale and seconds time-scale reflects the poroelastic nature of the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>To examine the role of poroelasticity in the mechanical response of cells, we locally deformed the cell surface with the tip of an AFM cantilever. In our experiments, the deformation had an estimated characteristic length ð¿â¼3 ðð (ð¿â¼âðð¿ with d<italic>â¼4Î¼m</italic> the diameter of the indentation and Î´â¼2 <italic>Î¼m</italic> the indentation depth) applied with a rise time ð¡<sub>ð</sub>â¼100(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A, B</xref>). In Hela cells, previous work has reported <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic>â¼40ðð<sup>2</sup>/ð  <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, leading to an estimate of the characteristic time of fluid efflux ð¡<sub>ð</sub>â¼200 ðð  . As ð¡<sub>ð</sub> is larger than the rise time ð¡<sub>ð</sub> , poroelasticity may contribute to mechanical relaxation.</p>

<p>To detect the global response of the cell surface to local force application with high spatial accuracy, we employed defocusing microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In this technique, collagen-coated fluorescent beads are tethered to the cell surface. The plane of focus is chosen such that the beads are deliberately out of focus and display multiple diffraction rings about their centre (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A</xref>). Bead vertical displacement is monitored with nanometre precision by measuring the temporal evolution of the diameter of the outer diffraction ring in response to the deformation of the cell surface induced by AFM (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A, B</xref>). At steady-state, beads closer than â¼6ðð to the AFM tip moved downwards while beads further away moved upwards, as expected for an elastic material subjected to indentation and as previously observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The amplitude of the steady-state displacement decreased with distance between the bead and the AFM tip (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3A</xref>). The temporal evolution of the bead movement displayed a biphasic response at all positions throughout the cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The first phase consisted in a fast movement of all the beads independent of their distance from the AFM tip over a time-scale shorter than â¼0.3 s, possibly due to cell surface tension (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref><bold> inset, </bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>). In the second phase, the beads relaxed to their final displacement over a characteristic time scale ð<sub>ð</sub> that increased with increasing distance between the AFM tip and the bead (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>, <bold>Methods</bold>). The overall relaxation of the second phase lasted up to â¼5s. Thus, local application of external force leads to a whole-cell mechanical equilibration lasting several seconds, consistent with previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>When stress is applied to a poroelastic material, relaxation takes place through flow of fluid out of the pressurised region at a rate that depends on the hydraulic permeability of the cytoplasm and hence its pore size. If the slow relaxation observed in cells is indeed due to poroelastic effects driving cellular-scale intracellular fluid flows, changes in the hydraulic pore size Î¾ should affect the duration of the second phase of bead movement but not the first phase. Pore size can be decreased by increasing the osmolarity of the medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Increasing osmolarity by 300mOsm led to a â¼3.5-fold increase in the median characteristic equilibration time ð<sub>ð</sub> of the slow phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). The amplitude of the first phase of bead movement was unaffected (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B</xref>) and we were unable to determine changes in the duration of the first phase because of its short duration. Conversely, when we treated cells with latrunculin, ð<sub>ð</sub> decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), consistent with previous reports showing that <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic> increases with latrunculin treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, the amplitude of bead movement was not affected (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3</xref>). Thus, the second-long global changes in cell surface height that occur in response to local application of stress are qualitatively consistent with a poroelastic cytoplasm.</p>

<title>Cytoplasmic flows induced by microinjection follow Darcyâs law</title>
<p>In porous media, pressure imbalances are dissipated by interstitial fluid flows. Though intracellular fluid flows have been inferred to be driven by internal stresses during cell motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> or external stresses during stress relaxation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, a direct evaluation of the relationship between the pressure gradient ðð<sub>ð</sub> and the velocity of intracellular fluid flow ð is lacking in cells. In classic porous media, the two are linked by Darcyâs law:</p>
<p>(1) ð = âð ðð<sub>ð</sub> with <italic>k</italic> the hydraulic permeability of the medium.</p>
<p>To characterise intracellular flows in response to pressure gradients, we created a fluidic link between a micropipette and an interphase cell using techniques developed for electrophysiology (whole-cell recording) and applied a step pressure increase to the micropipette (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4A</xref><bold>, SI methods</bold>). In this configuration, the applied pressure results in fluid injection into the cell, causing the solid phase of the cytoplasm to expand and the height of the cell surface to increase as the fluid progressively permeates through the solid phase of the cytoplasm. In our experiments, we recorded bead displacement using defocusing microscopy for beads at different distances away from the micropipette (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). After application of a pressure step, beads moved upwards with an amplitude that decreased with increasing distance from the micropipette for a given time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>) and with a time lag that increased linearly with the distance between the bead and the micropipette (see Methods and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), indicating an approximately constant velocity of the propagation front. When fluid injection was continued over longer time-scales (&gt;5s), cellular volume regulation mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> could not compensate for the volume increase and the membrane delaminated from the cortex forming large blebs before the cell eventually lysed.</p>

<p>In our experiments, the duration of microinjection (â¼2s) is short compared to the characteristic time-scale of water flows across the cell membrane (â¼20-100s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.

<p>Together, these experiments show that pressure gradients lead to intracellular flows whose propagation follows Darcyâs law with a hydraulic permeability consistent with those estimated by other experimental approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Counterintuitively, the hydraulic permeability in interphase cells was higher than in metaphase cells despite cell volume increasing in mitosis. This may be due to the profound remodelling of cytoplasmic organisation accompanying this stage of the cell cycle.</p>

<title>Global cellular response to microindendation is compatible with a poroelastic cytoplasm</title>
<p>Next, we sought to gain insight into how the global cellular response to local indentation might arise from interplay of cellular poroelastic properties with other cellular mechanical properties. Previous work has hypothesised that local application of mechanical stress leads to a localised outflow of interstitial fluid from the deformed region that can then propagate through the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. If vertical displacements in indentation experiments were just due to fluid propagation, we would expect that the onset of displacement would occur with a time lag that depends on distance as in the microinjection experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C-D</xref>). Yet, the first phase of displacement shows no time lag and vertical displacements of the cell surface are observed far from the point of indentation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref><bold>-inset</bold>). This indicates that poroelastic properties alone cannot explain the first phase of displacement.</p>
<p>One potential mechanical origin for the first phase may be the submembranous cortex whose mechanics differ markedly from the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and which generates a surface tension ð¾ through myosin contractility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The relative importance of surface tension in the cortex compared to elastic restoring forces in the cytoplasm can be grasped from the length scale <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="590593v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> with E the elasticity of the cytoplasm. For length-scales larger than ð, the effect of surface tension is negligible and elastic restoring forces are dominant. Using characteristic values of ð¾â¼1 ðð/ð <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and ð¸<sub>cytoplasm</sub>â¼100 Pa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we obtain a length scale of â¼10 Î¼m, consistent with our experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Furthermore, this scaling may explain why latrunculin treatment does not perturb the amplitude of bead movement in the first phase (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B</xref>). Indeed, latrunculin affects both the surface tension and the elastic modulus, potentially leading to compensation.</p>
<p>To determine if surface tension is important in setting the scale of the movement of the cell surface, we examined deformation of the membrane induced by indentation of the cell by a sharp AFM tip using mitotic cells to isolate the role of the cortex from cell shape and adhesion (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig S5</xref>). The surface profile was imaged before and during a 2 Âµm depth indentation and, after segmentation, we quantified the distance from the tip at which the membrane deformation reached half of the maximum indentation depth (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig S5C</xref>). In control conditions, the distance of the half maximum depth was 1.2Â±0.2Î¼m and this decreased significantly to 0.8Â±0.4Î¼m when surface tension was decreased with blebbistatin (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig S5D</xref>). Therefore, surface tension participates in setting the length scale of cell surface deformation in response to localised indentation.</p>
<p>The fast vertical displacement is followed by a second slow phase of displacement. With our experimental estimates of k, we can estimate the time-scale of relaxation of a vertical displacement arising from a local deformation of a tensed membrane tethered to a poroelastic cytoplasm. For each position within the region affected by the local deformation either directly or indirectly via surface tension, the time-scale for relaxation is ð<sub>ð§</sub>â¼ð¿<sup>2</sup>/<italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic>. <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic>â¼ðð¸ yielding a numerical estimate of <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic>â¼ 10<sup>-11</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s and ð¿<sup>2</sup>â¼ðð¿<sub>ð§</sub> with ðâ¼10 ðð the distance over which vertical displacements are observed and a displacement amplitude ð¿<sub>ð§</sub>â¼0.5 ðð . With these values, we find ð<sub>ð§</sub>â¼500 ms , qualitatively consistent with the experimentally observed times (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the instantaneous displacement of the cell surface far from the region of indentation may be due to cellular surface tension (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>) and these vertical displacements may drive intracellular fluid flows throughout the poroelastic cytoplasm.</p>

<title>Cytoplasmic poroelasticity combined with membrane permeability allows formation of stable intracellular pressure gradients</title>
<p>External stresses applied to the cell surface give rise to transient intracellular pressure gradients that are dissipated by molecular turnover and intracellular flows. However, spatial inhomogeneities in internal stresses generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton can be maintained for tens of minutes because they arise as a natural consequence of molecular turnover and contractility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. For example, during migration, the presence of gradients in myosin motors increasing from front to rear suggests the existence of a high cortical tension at the cell rear that can be sustained without relaxing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. One implication, given the poroelastic properties of the cytoplasm, is that this surface gradient should result in a sustained pressure gradient continuously driving intracellular fluid flows towards the cell front. Cytoplasmic pressure gradients have been observed in fibroblasts migrating on 2D substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and in 3D matrices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In addition, intracellular fluid flows have been inferred in cells migrating on 2D substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and suggested to play a motive role in cells migrating through confined environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Because this phenomenon involves a complex interplay between surface tension generated by the cortex, poroelastic behaviour of the cytoplasm, and fluid permeation through the membrane, deriving analytical solutions is challenging and we therefore turned to finite element modelling to gain a qualitative understanding of how long-lasting pressure gradients can be maintained in the cell. In our model, we modelled the cell as a pressurised poroelastic material surrounded by a less permeable surface region 250nm in thickness, representing the membrane and the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. For this, we parameterised a poroelastic finite element model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A-B</xref>, <bold>Methods</bold>), adjusting the values of <italic>E</italic> and <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic> such that our model could predict the cellâs response to a localised deformation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>) and the dynamics of displacement of the cell surface in response to microinjection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D-E</xref>).</p>

<p>After parameterising our model, we then introduced a sink in a region of the cell periphery (2 Âµm in diameter) to simulate a region of lower pressure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>). In this region, fluid can rapidly leave the cell, which leads to a reduction in cell volume. In turn, this volume reduction will increase intracellular osmolarity and drive water influx across the membrane in the rest of the cell surface. If the membrane permeability is large enough, efflux through the sink can be compensated by influx through the membrane to maintain a constant cell volume.</p>
<p>When we computationally applied a suction pressure to the sink region, our model predicted a spatial gradient of intracellular pressure with a low pressure close to the sink that increased towards the initial cell pressure far away from this region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G-I</xref>). To gain insights into the importance of the membrane-cortex layer for generation of this pressure gradient, we varied cortical thickness and diffusion constant in our model. While cortex thickness had little influence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, diffusion through the cortex strongly affected the length-scale of the gradient (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4J</xref>), with high diffusion constants leading to gradients that reached the initial cell pressure over short length-scales. This is consistent with previous work that showed that localised exposure of cells to high osmolarity medium leads to localised dehydration with a sharp transition in pore size (and hence <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic>) between the exposed and non-exposed region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. This work suggested that membrane permeability was on the order of 100 times lower than cytoplasmic permeability, within the lower range of the parameter values tested in our model (red curve, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4J</xref>). Thus, cytoplasmic poroelasticity combined with passage of water across the membrane can in principle allow maintenance of stable intracellular pressure gradients and pressure compartmentalisation in living cells.</p>

<title>Cells can accommodate intracellular pressure gradients over minute time-scales</title>
<p>To test our predictions experimentally, we introduced a local depressurisation on the cell surface by establishing a fluidic link using a micropipette and bringing its back-pressure to atmospheric pressure. We verified that, in these conditions, a small suction was generated at the tip of the micropipette (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig S6</xref>), signifying that the pressure applied at the pipette tip was lower than the intracellular pressure. Based on the cellular poroelastic properties, the pipette dimensions, and the cell dimensions, steady state is reached for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="590593v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> after pressure release, assuming that relaxation is entirely limited by cellular poroelastic properties.</p>
<p>We verified that, following establishment of a fluidic connection between the cell and the micropipette, no occlusion occurred over time and that actomyosin was not perturbed (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig S7</xref>-<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). To confirm fluid efflux from the cell into the micropipette, we labelled cells with a fluorescent dye that becomes cell-impermeant upon cleavage by cellular proteases. We compared the temporal evolution of fluorescence in pairs of cells, one subjected to depressurisation and a neighbour that was unperturbed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Fluorescence intensity remained constant in the control cells but decreased approximately linearly over the course of 10 minutes in the depressurised cells, indicating the presence of a constant pressure gradient and efflux from the cell. Finally, we asked if the cell volume remained constant during depressurisation by examining the change in radius of prometaphase cells subjected to depressurisation. In these cells, cell radius varied by less than 5% over ten minutes of pressure release with no systematic trend to increase or decrease (N=3 cells, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig S9</xref>). Overall, these experiments indicate that cells have a sufficiently large membrane permeability to allow rapid exchange of fluid across the membrane to maintain a constant volume and that we can experimentally apply a long-lasting localised depressurisation.</p>

<p>Our simulation results indicate that, for values of <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic> measured in the cytoplasm, the low pressure region can be confined to a small zone near the pipette if membrane permeability is sufficiently large (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). To experimentally test this, we used cell blebs as pressure gauges. Blebs are quasi-spherical protrusions of the cell membrane that arise due to pressurisation of the cytoplasm by cortical actomyosin contractility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. First, we examined naturally occurring blebs in M2 melanoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In control conditions, M2 cells bleb profusely with an intracellular pressure Pâ¼400Pa but, when actomyosin contractility is inhibited with a Rho- kinase inhibitor (Y27632), cells no longer bleb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and intracellular pressure drops to Pâ¼100Pa (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, see SI methods for pressure measurement). Therefore, if <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic> is large and pressure is poorly compartmentalised, local depressurisation should lead to fast global decrease in intracellular pressure and blebbing should cease. In contrast, if <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic> is low and pressure is strongly compartmentalised, blebbing should continue unperturbed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In our experiments, following local pressure release (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>), M2 cells blebbed for several minutes, far longer than necessary for intracellular pressure to reach steady state or for significant exchange of fluid to take place (for t&gt;6min, 19/19 cells still blebbed, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Furthermore, no spatially localised inhibition of blebbing could be noticed close to the pipette (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig S10</xref>). These results suggest that pressure is highly compartmentalised in melanoma blebbing cells and that pressure gradients can be maintained over several minutes. Our pressure measurements indicate that blebs cease to emerge if the intracellular pressure drops below â¼100Pa (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Based on this and assuming a diffusion constant of <italic>D<sub>p</sub></italic> â¼0.01Âµm<sup>2</sup>/s in the membrane-cortex, our model predicts that pressure-release would only induce a sufficiently large depressurisation to stop blebbing in a region â¼1.5Âµm away from the pipette tip (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>), consistent with the lack of spatial inhibition of blebbing we observe.</p>

<p>We then verified if HeLa cells could also compartmentalise pressure. In these cells, blebs can be induced within â¼2 minutes by partial depolymerisation of the F-actin cytoskeleton induced by treatment with low doses of latrunculin. In these conditions, blebs emerge because HeLa cells have an intracellular pressure ranging from â¼400Pa in interphase to â¼600Pa in metaphase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>) and because, minutes after latrunculin treatment, cortical actomyosin structures still remain well-defined (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig S11</xref>). When contractility is blocked through inhibition of rho-kinase prior to treatment with latrunculin, blebs no longer emerge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig S11</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">S12A</xref>). Thus, the growth of latrunculin-induced blebs depends on pressure generated by myosin contractility and they can be used as pressure gauges. When we locally depressurised HeLa cells by establishing a fluidic connection with a micropipette, we found that latrunculin treatment could still induce blebs in both interphase and metaphase cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>, <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">S11B</xref>). This effect was independent of the duration over which depressurisation was maintained.

In control conditions, a short pulse of UV laser focused on the cell cortex of a prometaphase cell led to the emergence of a bleb (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">S12C</xref>). When myosin contractility was inhibited, ablation did not induce blebs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">S12C</xref>), consistent with <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. When a pressure gradient was established, laser ablation could still induce blebs after several minutes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">S12C</xref>), indicating that pressure remained sufficiently large for bleb growth. Collectively, these experiments show that intracellular pressure is strongly compartmentalised in cells and that stable pressure gradients can be sustained over durations of several minutes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our experiments revealed that cells could sustain pressure gradients across their cytoplasm over durations of ten minutes, relevant to cell polarisation and migration. In our experiments, we artificially generated an intracellular pressure gradient with a constant high pressure generated by the cell cortex and a low pressure at the tip of a micropipette. Using blebs as reporters of local intracellular pressure, we showed that, despite the presence of an intracellular pressure gradient, pressure over most of the cell periphery remained sufficiently high to continuously generate blebs over several minutes. This result was independent of cell type or cell cycle stage. Computational simulations indicate that the poroelastic properties of the cytoplasm combined with membrane permeability allow the maintenance of stable intracellular pressure gradients.</p>

<title>Global intracellular flows arise from the combination of cortical tension and a poroelastic cytoplasm</title>
<p>Here we show that local application of stress to the cell surface induces intracellular water flows spatially distributed over tens of microns and lasting seconds. When we locally deformed the cell surface with an AFM cantilever, we observed a global change in cell height with two different temporal regimes: one quasi-instantaneous and another that equilibrated more slowly, consistent with previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Previous work has shown that the second phase cannot be explained by a linear viscoelastic behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, we investigated the role of poroelastic behaviour of the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In line with this idea, when we decreased the</p>
<p>cytoplasmic hydraulic pore size <italic><monospace>Î¾</monospace></italic> , the second phase equilibrated slower taking several seconds. Although we cannot exclude a role for complex mechanotransductory processes, our experiments and simulations suggested that the initial fast relaxation is due to simultaneous motion of the solid and fluid phases over a length-scale controlled by surface tension generated by the cortex and the second slower relaxation arise from relative flows between the two phases equilibrating gradients of fluid pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. However, simple scaling arguments for the poroelastic efflux time based on a hydraulic pore size controlled by homogenous deformation of the solid phase in response to volume change underestimated the magnitude of change in ð¡<sub>ð</sub>, (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="590593v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> see <bold>Methods</bold>). Indeed, these arguments predicted changes of 1.7-1.9 fold in ð¡<sub>ð</sub>, much smaller than the â¼3.5 fold changes observed in the characteristic equilibration time ð<sub>ð</sub> of the slow phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). This is likely because the hydraulic pore size is governed in a complex manner by interplay between multiple solid structures (cytoskeleton, mitochondria, membrane bounded organelles) and macromolecular crowding.</p>
<p>The existence of spatially distributed intracellular flows induced by local deformation of the cell surface may have important consequences for our understanding of mechanotransduction, which detects mechanical changes and converts them into biochemical signals. Mechanosensory processes act at the molecular scale through opening of ion channels or unfolding of proteins. Thus, the spatial extent of the stress and strain fields will determine what proportion of the cell receives a stimulus sufficiently large and long- lasting to trigger these molecular processes. A challenge for future studies will be to link cellular-scale fluid flows induced by deformation and mechanical stresses to molecular-scale activation of mechanosensory processes to determine the strength of the mechanical stimulus necessary to elicit a whole-cell mechanosensory response. Interestingly, intracellular flows and pressure gradients might participate in triggering signalling through mechanotransductory pathways located away from the cell membrane. For example, Phospholipase A2 activation at the nuclear membrane of epithelial cells is central to the response of tissues to wounding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Thus, the intracellular fluid flows revealed by our study might stimulate intracellular mechanosensory mechanisms, representing an indirect mechanotransductory mechanism.</p>

<title>Cortical contractility, cytoplasmic poroelastic properties and membrane permeability combine to enable sustained intracellular pressure gradients</title>
<p>Our findings have consequences for our understanding of cell movement in confined environments and low adhesive conditions when cells migrate using blebs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. At steady state, migrating cells form a stable gradient in myosin that increases from front to rear and that powers migration.

Disruption of cortical tension at the cell rear by laser ablation leads to cessation of movement as well as localised blebbing in the region of ablation, indicating that myosin accumulation generates a high tension and high pressure at the rear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Our work indicates the cell can sustain long-lasting gradients of pressure and raises the possibility that these may participate in migration. In this picture, the observed gradient in actomyosin distribution might generate an intracellular pressure gradient driving a forward- directed intracellular flow, consistent with some experimental observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In support of this, recent work has shown that new cell protrusions emerge in regions of the leading edge where membrane-cortex attachment is the weakest, suggesting a role for pressure as a driving force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, pressure gradients may play a direct role in the generation of forward protrusion.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, our work shows that steady-state gradients in intracellular pressure can arise through the combination of cytoplasmic poroelastic properties and membrane permeability. Thus, intracellular pressure gradients and intracellular fluid flows may play far more important roles than generally appreciated in cell physiology and poroelastic properties must be considered to gain a quantitative understanding of cellular phenomena such as mechanotransduction, cell shape change, and cell migration.</p>

<p>HeLa cells were grown at 37C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM (Life Technologies, UK) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. Melanoma (M2) cells were grown in MEM with Earleâs salts (Life Technologies, UK) supplemented with 10% of an 80:20 mix of newborn calf serum: FBS, and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.

<p>Drug treatments were carried out by adding the appropriate concentration to the medium. Drugs were present at all times during imaging and patch clamping experiments.

<title>Data recording and synchronisation</title>
<p>In patch clamp experiments, the pressure transmitter, pinch valves, patch clamp equipment, and the microscope were all connected to the digitizer. This enabled us to control all devices through one platform. The electrophysiology software (pClamp10, Molecular Devices) and the imaging software (Micromanager) were set to communicate to each other. All of the steps to obtain whole cell configuration were performed manually and a macro was created in pClamp 10 to automatically acquire data once whole cell configuration was achieved. At this point by starting the macro in pClamp10, data acquisition, the timing of acquisition of each image, the timing of opening and closing of pinch valves as well as pressure measurement were recorded automatically through one software. This enabled us to synchronize all devices and determine the exact image at which pressure was applied to the micropipette and injection started.</p>
<p>In AFM experiments, for imaging, the camera (Hamamatsu OrcaER, Hamamatsu, Japan) was triggered every 100 ms using one of the output channels of the digitizer. The cantilever displacement and force were also acquired by connecting the corresponding output channels of the AFM to the digitizer using BNC cables. Therefore, similar to patch clamp experiments, we were able to synchronize all equipment by integrating them into one acquisition platform.</p>

<title>Microinjection and pressure release setup</title>
<p>A pressure sensor (IMPRESS sensors and systems, IMP-LR-C0238-7A4-BAV-00-000) was used to measure the magnitude and temporal evolution of applied pressure. A glass Erlenmeyer was used as a pressure reservoir and was connected to a plastic tube which could be opened by a computer-controlled pinch valve. The tube was then connected to the pressure sensor and the micropipette holder. Two digital manometers were used to monitor the pressure in the reservoir and just before the pipette holder. The length of all tubing was approximately 1 meter and the time for pressure to propagate through the tubes, plus the response time of switches was around 30 ms (data not shown), which is less than our frame interval (66.7 or 100 ms). The pressure transmitter, pinch valves, patch clamp equipment, and the microscope were all connected to the digitizer. Before the start of the experiments, pressure in the reservoir was set. Once the whole-cell patch clamping configuration was achieved, a pulse of pressure was applied by opening the valve, resulting in injection of fluid into the cell. In pressure release experiments, after forming a whole-cell configuration, opening the valve resulted in connecting the pipette to the open atmosphere with pressure of zero (P<sub>atm</sub> = 0).</p>

<title>Finite element modelling</title>
<p>We conducted finite element simulations to model the mechanical response at the cell scale, specifically focusing on the local deformations of the living cell surface and pressure gradients driving intracellular cytosolic flows. These simulations aimed to capture the deformation behaviour of a poroelastic cell when subjected to changes in effective pressure, mimicking scenarios such as fluid injection or pressure release in one region of the cell surface. Finite element models were developed using ABAQUS (version 2018). We used nonlinear geometry and unstructured mesh in our FE simulations, and also took into consideration a neo-Hookean isotropic porohyperelastic model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. This was due to the large mechanical deformation range observed during our AFM, microinjection, and pressure release experiments.

<p>We ran simulations on two-dimensional rectangular sections to computationally investigate the influence of poroelasticity in the temporal mechanical response of cells to indentation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). To minimize edge effects, the cell was represented as a cylindrical disk (20Î¼m radius, 20Î¼m thickness) indented by 2Î¼m with an infinitely rigid indenter representing the AFM cantilever tip. Frictionless and impermeable contact between the indenter and the cell was assumed, and a no-slip condition was imposed on the bottom surface of the cylindre. Pore pressure was set to zero except at the indenter contact surface to simulate fluid drainage. The simulation domain was discretized using quadratic quadrilateral CAX8P elements. Mesh sensitivity checks were performed to ensure independence of results on element size. The simulation consisted of a ramp step followed by a hold step. The ramp step entails indenting the material surface instantaneously (â¼0.01s) with specific indentation displacement (â¼2um). The phase in which the force reaction is released is known as the hold step. The main parameter of interest was displacement of thr cell surface in response to localized indentation. The force-relaxation curve and final displacement of the cell surface as a function of distance from the AFM tip were analyzed to extract the elastic modulus and poroelastic diffusion coefficient by fitting to the experimental data (For a thorough approach and curve fitting techniques, see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>).</p>

<caption><title>Experimental setup.</title>
<p><bold>A.</bold> Principle of defocusing microscopy. Left: Collagen coated fluorescent beads are bound to the cell surface and are imaged by optical microscopy using a high magnification objective. The plane of focus is purposely set above the cell such that beads appear to have multiple concentric rings around them. The diameter of the outer ring reports on the distance between the bead and the plane of focus. The diameter of the outer ring changes linearly with changes in bead height. The top halo illustrates the rings visualised at t=t<sub>0</sub> and the bottom halo illustrates them at t=t<sub>1</sub> once a change in surface height has taken place. Calibration of the outer ring diameter as a function of bead distance from the plane of focus allows the detection of small movements in z<sup>3</sup>. Middle: representative intensity profile of an out-of-focus bead. The central peak denotes the position of the bead centre. Right: detection of outer peak positions. The outer peaks are detected by fitting Gaussian functions (red) to the fluorescence intensity profile of the halo. Blue data points represent the intensity of the outer halo. <bold>B.</bold> Experimental data acquisition setup. An AFM cantilever is positioned above the cell of interest just above the cell membrane. Recording is started and the AFM is brought into contact with the cell to generate an indentation with a depth of 2-4 um. During this time, the position of beads at the surface is monitored using defocusing microscopy. The digitiser simultaneously records the cantilever deflection, the height of the piezoelectric ceramic, and pulses sent by the camera each time an image is acquired. These data allow synchronisation of AFM data and imaging data. Images are recorded separately and are acquired using micromanager.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Fluid injection experiments and experimental setup.</title>
<p><bold>A.</bold> Principle of the fluid injection experiments. An electrophysiology setup was used with a whole-cell recording configuration. In patch-clamp electrophysiology, the tip of a micropipette (â¼2Î¼m diameter) is first approached towards the cell surface (left) and a high resistance (GÎ©) seal is generated by suction of the membrane into the pipette (a configuration known as cell-attached patch clamp, middle). A short pulse of suction can then rupture the membrane patch and create a fluidic and electrical connection between the cell and the micropipette (a configuration known as whole-cell clamp, right). The response to a voltage step can be used to determine the resistance between the two electrodes and reports on the configuration at any given time (indicated as inset in the top right of each panel). <bold>B.</bold> Experimental setup. A cell is brought into fluidic communication with a glass micropipette containing medium with an ionic concentration mimicking intracellular composition. An electrode within the micropipette and within the Petri dish enables measurement of the electrical resistance of the cell-pipette assembly. Pressure can be applied to the fluid within the micropipette using a pressure reservoir and a manifold of computer controlled pinch-valves. Within the micropipette, an electrode is used to monitor the combined resistance of the glass micropipette and cell. Currents recorded by the electrode are amplified before being digitised. The digitiser simultaneously records electrical currents from the electrode in the micropipette, pressure from the pressure transducer, and pulses sent by the camera each time an image is acquired. These data allow synchronisation of electrophysiological data, pressure data, and imaging data. Images are recorded separately and are acquired using micromanager.</p></caption>

<caption><title>The pipette access resistance stays constant during whole-cell patch clamp configuration.</title><p>Representative data showing the temporal evolution of the pipette access resistance as a function of time during an experiment in which a suction was applied through the pipette. The vertical axes show the measured access resistance and the horizontal axis shows time in seconds. Two different scales are used in the top and bottom graphs to allow monitoring of gigaseal formation (necessitating GÎ© scale, top) and access resistance in whole cell configuration (necessitating tens of MÎ© scale, bottom).</p><p>In the top graph, the micropipette internal fluid is initially just in contact with the cell, a gigaseal is formed by aspiration of a patch of cell membrane into the pipette (see <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4A</xref>), leading to a tight seal between the cell membrane and micropipette interior demonstrated by a large increase of the resistance observed at â¼150s (red arrow, top row). The membrane patch is then ruptured to create a fluidic connection between the cell and the micropipette (while gigaseal is maintained), leading to formation of whole cell configuration with access resistance in the order of Mega Ohms at â¼180s (red arrow, bottom row). In this configuration, a tight seal is maintained between the cell membrane and the micropipette interior.</p><p>In the bottom graph, the temporal evolution of the access resistance is monitored after formation of the fluidic connection between the cell and the micropipette and during the rest of the experiment. The timing of creation of the fluidic connection is indicated by the red arrow (â¼180s). When the fluidic connection is generated, the access resistance (Raâ¼13MÎ©) is large compared to the pipette resistance (â¼6MÎ©). This access resistance reports on how easily current can flow between the cell and the micropipette and is extremely sensitive to any clogging or obstacles in the vicinity of the micropipette tip. After generation of the fluidic connection, the access resistance stays constant over the whole duration of the experiment, indicating that a tight seal is maintained between the pipette and the cell and that the fluidic connection does not get progressively clogged by cellular material or active cellular processes. Similar results were obtained for all whole-cell clamp experiments, indicating that no obstruction occurred due to cellular debris.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study combines imaginative and innovative experiments with a finite element modelling to demonstrate the relevance of poroelasticity in the mechanical properties of cells across physiologically relevant time and length scales. The authors present <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that cytosolic flows and pressure gradients can persist in cells with permeable membranes, generating spatially segregated influx and outflux zones. These findings are of interest to the cell biology and biophysics communities.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work investigated whether cytoplasmic poroelastic properties play an important role in cellular mechanical response over length scales and time scales relevant to cell physiology. Overall, the manuscript concludes that intracellular cytosolic flows and pressure gradients are important for cell physiology and that they act of time- and length-scales relevant to mechanotransduction and cell migration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Their approach integrates both computational and experimental methods. The AFM deformation experiments combined with measuring z-position of beads is a challenging yet compelling method to determine poroelastic contributions to mechanical realization.</p>
<p>The work is quite interesting and will be of high value to the field of cell mechanics and mechanotransduction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses I noted earlier were adequately addressed in the revised version.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Malboubi et al. present an experimental framework to investigate the rheological properties of the cell cytoplasm. Their findings support a model where the cytoplasm behaves as a poroelastic material governed by Darcy's law. They demonstrate that this poroelastic behavior delays the equilibration of hydrostatic pressure gradients within the cytoplasm over timescales of 1 to 10 seconds following a perturbation, likely due to fluid-solid friction within the cytoplasmic matrix. Furthermore, under sustained perturbations such as depressurization, they reveal that pressure gradients can persist for minutes, which they propose might potentially influence physiological processes like mechanotransduction or cell migration typically happening on these timescales.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This article holds significant value within the ongoing efforts of the cell biology and biophysics communities to quantitatively characterize the mechanical properties of cells. The experiments are innovative and thoughtfully contextualized with quantitative estimates and a finite element model that supports the authors' hypotheses.</p>
<p>Comments &amp; Questions:</p>
<p>The authors have successfully addressed the questions and comments raised in my previous review, significantly improving the manuscript's depth. Regarding my last question on the predicted saturation of the time lag, the authors propose the interesting hypothesis that the cell cortex becomes dominant at distances beyond 30 microns and plan to test this hypothesis at a later stage.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this delightful study, the authors use local indentation of the cell surface combined with out-of-focus microscopy to measure the rates of pressure spread in the cell and to argue that the results can be explained with the poroelastic model. Osmotic shock that decreases cytoskeletal mesh size supports this notion. Experiments with water injection and water suction further support it, and also, together with a mechanical model and elegant measurements of decreasing fluorescence in the cell 'flashed' by external flow, demonstrate that the membrane is permeable, and that steady flow and pressure gradient can exist in a cell with water source/sink in different locations. Use of blebs as indicators of the internal pressure further supports the notion of differential cytoplasmic pressure.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is very imaginative, interesting, novel and important.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: I have two broad critical comments:</p>
<p>(1) I sense that the authors are correct that the best explanation of their results is the passive poroelastic model. Yet, to be thorough, they have to try to explain the experiments with other models and show why their explanation is parsimonious. For example, one potential explanation could be some mechanosensitive mechanism that does not involve cytoplasmic flow; another could be viscoelastic cytoskeletal mesh, again not involving poroelasticity.

<p>(2) The study is rich in biophysics but a bit light on chemical/genetic perturbations. It could be good to use low levels of chemical inhibitors for, for example, Arp2/3, PI3K, myosin etc, and see the effect and try to interpret it. Another interesting question - how adhesive strength affects the results. A different interesting avenue - one can perturb aquaporins. Etc. At least one perturbation experiment would be good.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Some details are not described for experimental procedures. For example, what were the pharmacological drugs dissolved in, and what vehicle control was used in experiments? How long were pharmacological drugs added to cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for the oversight. These details have now been added to the methods section of the manuscript as well as to the relevant figure legends.</p>
<p>Briefly, latrunculin was used at a final concentration of 250 nM and Y27632 at a final concentration of 50 Î¼M. Both drugs were dissolved in DMSO. The vehicle controls were effected with the highest final concentration of DMSO of the two drugs.</p>
<p>The details of the drug treatments and their duration was added to the methods and to figures 6, S10, and S12.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Details are missing from the Methods section and Figure captions about the number of biological and technical replicates performed for experiments. Figure 1C states the data are from 12 beads on 7 cells. Are those same 12 beads used in Figure 2C? If so, that information is missing from the Figure 2C caption. Similarly, this information should be provided in every figure caption so the reader can assess the rigor of the experiments. Furthermore, how heterogenous would the bead displacements be across different cells? The low number of beads and cells assessed makes this information difficult to determine.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for the oversight. We have now added this data to the relevant figure panels.</p>
<p>To gain a further understanding of the heterogeneity of bead displacements across cells, we have replotted the relevant graphs using different colours to indicate different cells. This reveals that different cells appear to behave similarly and that the behaviour appears controlled by distance to the indentation or the pipette tip rather than cell identity.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the number of cells examined is low. This is due to the challenging nature of the experiments that signifies that many attempts are necessary to obtain a successful measurement.</p>
<p>The experiments in Fig 1C are a verification of a behaviour documented in a previous publication [1]. Here, we just confirm the same behaviour and therefore we decided that only a small number of cells was needed.</p>
<p>The experiments in Fig 2C (that allow for a direct estimation of the cytoplasmâs hydraulic permeability) require formation of a tight seal between the glass micropipette and the cell, something known as a gigaseal in electrophysiology. The success rate of this first step is 10-30% of attempts for an experienced experimenter. The second step is forming a whole cell configuration, in which a hydraulic link is formed between the cell and the micropipette. This step has a success rate of ~ 50%. Whole cell links are very sensitive to any disturbance. After reaching the whole cell configuration, we applied relatively high pressures that occasionally resulted in loss of link between the cell and the micropipette. In summary, for the 12 successful measurements, hundreds of unsuccessful attempts were carried out.</p>

<p>(3) The full equation for displacement vs. time for a poroelastic material is not provided. Scaling laws are shown, but the full equation derived from the stress response of an elastic solid and viscous fluid is not shown or described.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Based on our experiments, we found that the cytoplasm behaves as a poroelastic material. However, to understand the displacements of the cell surface in response to localised indentation, we show that we also need to take the tension of the submembranous cortex into account. In summary, the interplay between cell surface tension generated by the cortex and the poroelastic cytoplasm controls the cell behaviour. To our knowledge, no simple analytical solutions to this type problem exist.</p>
<p>In Fig 1, we show that the response of the cell to local indentation is biphasic with a short time-scale displacement followed by a longer time-scale one. In Figs 2 and 3, we directly characterise the kinetics of cell surface displacement in response to microinjection of fluid. These kinetics are consistent with the long time-scale displacement but not the short time-scale one. Scaling considerations led us to propose that tension in the cortex may play a role in mediating the short time-scale displacement. To verify this hypothesis, we have now added new data showing that the length-scale of an indentation created by an AFM probe depends on tension in the cortex (Fig S5).</p>
<p>In a previous publication [2], we derived the temporal dynamics of cell surface displacement for a homogenous poroelastic material in response to a change in osmolarity. In the current manuscript, the composite nature of the cell (membrane, cortex, cytoplasm) needs to be taken into account as well as a realistic cell shape. Therefore, we did not attempt to provide an analytical solution for the displacement of the cell surface versus time in the current work. Instead, we turned to finite element modelling to show that our observations are qualitatively consistent with a cell that comprises a tensed submembranous actin cortex and a poroelastic cytoplasm (Fig 4). We have now added text to make this clearer for the reader.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Comments &amp; Questions:</p>
<p>The authors state, &quot;Next, we sought to quantitatively understand how the global cellular response to local indentation might arise from cellular poroelasticity.&quot; However, the evidence presented in the following paragraph appears more qualitative than strictly quantitative. For instance, the length scale estimate of ~7 Î¼m is only qualitatively consistent with the observed ~10 Î¼m, and the timescale ðð§ â 500 ms is similarly described as &quot;qualitatively consistent&quot; with experimental observations. Strengthening this point would benefit from more direct evidence linking the short timescale to cell surface tension. Have you tried perturbing surface tension and examining its impact on this short-timescale relaxation by modulating acto-myosin contractility with Y-27632, depolymerizing actin with Latrunculin, or applying hypo/hyperosmotic shocks?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Upon rereading our manuscript, we agree with the reviewer that some of our statements are too strong. We have now moderated these and clarified the goal of that section of the text.</p>
<p>The reviewer asks if we have examined the effect of various perturbations on the short time-scale displacements. In our experimental conditions, we cannot precisely measure the time-scale of the fast relaxation because its duration is comparable to the frame rate of our image acquisition. However, we examined the amplitude of the displacement of the first phase in response to sucrose treatment and we have carried out new experiments in which we treat cells with 250nM Latrunculin to partially depolymerise cellular F-actin. Neither of these treatments had an impact on the amplitude of vertical displacements (Fig. S3).</p>
<p>The absence of change in response to Latrunculin may be because the treatment decreases both the elasticity of the cytoplasm  and the cortical tension . As the length-scale  of the deformation of the surface scales as <inline-formula id="sa4equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-105523-sa4-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, the two effects of latrunculin treatment may therefore compensate one another and result in only small changes in . We have now added this data to supplementary information and comment on this in the text.</p>
<p>The reviewerâs comment also made us want to determine how cortical tension affects the length-scale of the cell surface deformation created by localised microindentation. To isolate the role of the cortex from that of cell shape, we decided to examine rounded mitotic cells. In our experiments, we indented a mitotic cell expressing a membrane targeted GFP with a sharp AFM tip (Fig. S5).</p>
<p>In our experiments, we adjusted force to generate a 2Î¼m depth indentation and we imaged the cell profile with confocal microscopy before and during indentation. Segmentation of this data allowed us to determine the cell surface displacement resulting from indentation and measure a length scale of deformation. In control conditions, the length scale created by deformation is on the order of 1.2Î¼m. When we inhibited myosin contractility with blebbistatin, the length-scale of deformation decreased significantly to 0.8 Î¼m, as expected if we decrease the surface tension Î³ without affecting the cytoplasmic elasticity. We have now added this data to our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors demonstrate that the second relaxation timescale increases (Figure 1, Panel D) following a hyperosmotic shock, consistent with cytoplasmic matrix shrinkage, increased friction, and consequently a longer relaxation timescale. While this result aligns with expectations, is a seven-fold increase in the relaxation timescale realistic based on quantitative estimates given the extent of volume loss?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting question. Upon re-examining our data, we realised that the numerical values in the text related to the average rather than the median of our measurements. The median of the poroelastic time constant increases from ~0.4s in control conditions to 1.4s in sucrose, representing approximately a 3.5 fold increase.</p>
<p>Previous work showed that HeLa cell volume decreases by ~40% in response to hyperosmotic shock [3]. The fluid volume fraction <inline-formula id="sa4equ2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-105523-sa4-equ2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> in cells is ~65-75%. If we assume that the water is contained in N pores of volume <inline-formula id="sa4equ3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-105523-sa4-equ3.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, we can express the cell volume as <inline-formula id="sa4equ4"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-105523-sa4-equ4.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> with <inline-formula id="sa4equ5"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-105523-sa4-equ5.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> the volume of the solid fraction. We can rewrite <inline-formula id="sa4equ6"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-105523-sa4-equ6.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>With â = 0.42  -0.6.  As  does not change in response to osmotic shock, we can rewrite the volume change <inline-formula id="sa4equ7"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-105523-sa4-equ7.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> to obtain the change in pore size <inline-formula id="sa4equ8"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-105523-sa4-equ8.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The poroelastic diffusion constant scales as <inline-formula id="sa4equ9"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-105523-sa4-equ9.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> and the poroelastic timescale scales as <inline-formula id="sa4equ10"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-105523-sa4-equ10.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, the measured change in volume leads to a predicted increase in poroelastic diffusion time of 1.7-1.9 fold, smaller than observed in our experiments. This suggests that some intuition can be gained in a straightforward manner assuming that the cytoplasm is a homogenous porous material.</p>
<p>However, the reality is more complex and the hydraulic pore size is distinct from the entanglement length of the cytoskeleton mesh, as we discussed in a previous publication [4]. When the fluid fraction becomes sufficiently small, macromolecular crowding will impact diffusion further and non-linearities will arise. We have now added some of these considerations to the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If the authors' hypothesis is correct, an essential physiological parameter for the cytoplasm could be the permeability k and how it is modulated by perturbations, such as volume loss or gain. Have you explored whether the data supports the expected square dependency of permeability on hydraulic pore size, as predicted by simple homogeneity assumptions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As discussed above, we have explored such considerations in a previous publication (see discussion in [4]). Briefly, we find that the entanglement length of the F-actin cytoskeleton does play a role in controlling the hydraulic pore size but is distinct from it. Membrane bounded organelles could also contribute to setting the pore size. In our previous publication, we derived a scaling relationship that indicates that four different length-scales contribute to setting cellular rheology: the average filament bundle length, the size distribution of particles in the cytosol, the entanglement length of the cytoskeleton, and the hydraulic pore size. Many of these length-scales can be dynamically controlled by the cell, which gives rise to complex rheology. We have now added these considerations to our discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, do you think that the observed decrease in k in mitotic cells compared to interphase cells is significant? I would have expected the opposite naively as mitotic cells tend to swell by 10-20 percent due to the mitotic overshoot at mitotic entry (see Son Journal of Cell Biology 2015 or Zlotek Journal of Cell Biology 2015).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting question. Based on the same scaling arguments as above, we would expect that a 10-20% increase in cell volume would give rise to 10-20% increase in diffusion constant. However, we also note that metaphase leads to a dramatic reorganisation of the cell interior and in particular membrane-bounded organelles. In summary, we do not know why such a decrease could take place. We now highlight this as an interesting question for further research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Based on your results, can you estimate the pore size of the poroelastic cytoplasmic matrix? Is this estimate realistic? I wonder whether this pore size might define a threshold above which the diffusion of freely diffusing species is significantly reduced. Is your estimate consistent with nanobead diffusion experiments reported in the literature? Do you have any insights into the polymer structures that define this pore size? For example, have you investigated whether depolymerizing actin or other cytoskeletal components significantly alters the relaxation timescale?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We cannot directly estimate the hydraulic pore size from the measurements performed in the manuscript. Indeed, while we understand the general scaling laws, the prefactors of such relationships are unknown.</p>
<p>We carried out experiments aiming at estimating the hydraulic pore size in previous publications [3,4] and others have shown spatial heterogeneity of the cytoplasmic pore size [5]. In our previous experiments, we examined the diffusion of PEGylated quantum dots (14nm in hydrodynamic radius). In isosmotic conditions, these diffused freely through the cell but when the cell volume was decreased by a hyperosmotic shock, they no longer moved [3,4]. This gave an estimate of the pore radius of ~15nm.</p>
<p>Previous work has suggested that F-actin plays a role in dictating this pore size but microtubules and intermediate filaments do not [4].</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There are no quantifications in Figure 6, nor is there a direct comparison with the model. Based on your model, would you expect the velocity of bleb growth to vary depending on the distance of the bleb from the pipette due to the local depressurization? Specifically, do blebs closer to the pipette grow more slowly?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for the oversight. The quantifications are presented in Fig S10 and Fig S12. We have now modified the figure legends accordingly.</p>
<p>Blebs are very heterogenous in size and growth velocity within a cell and across cells in the population in normal conditions [6]. Other work has shown that bleb size is controlled by a competition between pressure driving growth and actin polymerisation arresting it[7]. Therefore, we did not attempt to determine the impact of depressurisation on bleb growth velocity or size.</p>
<p>In experiments in which we suddenly increased pressure in blebbing cells, we did notice a change in the rate of growth of blebs that occurred after we increased pressure (Author response image 1). However, the experiments are technically challenging and we decided not to perform more.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I find it interesting that during depressurization of the interphase cells, there is no observed volume change, whereas in pressurization of metaphase cells, there is a volume increase. I assume this might be a matter of timescale, as the microinjection experiments occur on short timescales, not allowing sufficient time for water to escape the cell. Do you observe the radius of the metaphase cells decreasing later on? This relaxation could potentially be used to characterize the permeability of the cell surface.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.</p>
<p>First, we would like to clarify that both metaphase and interphase cells increase their volume in response to microinjection. The effect is easier to quantify in metaphase cells because we assume spherical symmetry and just monitor the evolution of the radius (Fig 3). However, the displacement of the beads in interphase cells (Fig 2) clearly shows that the cell volume increases in response to microinjection. For both interphase and metaphase cells, when the injection is prolonged, the membrane eventually detaches from the cortex and large blebs form until cell lysis. In contrast to the reviewerâs intuition, we never observe a relaxation in cell volume, probably because we inject fluid faster than the cell can compensate volume change through regulatory mechanisms involving ion channels.</p>
<p>When we depressurise metaphase cells, we do not observe any change in volume (Fig S10). This contrasts with the increase that we observe upon pressurisation. The main difference between these two experiments is the pressure differential. During depressurisation experiments, this is the hydraulic pressure within the cell ~500Pa (Fig 6A); whereas during pressurisation experiments, this is the pressure in the micropipette, ranging from 1.4-10 kPa (Fig 3). We note in particular that, when we used the lowest pressures in our experiments, the increase in volume was very slow (see Fig 3C). Therefore, we agree with the reviewer that it is likely the magnitude of the pressure differential that explains these differences.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I am curious about the saturation of the time lag at 30 microns from the pipette in Figure 4, Panel E for the model's prediction. A saturation which is not clearly observed in the experimental data. Could you comment on the origin of this saturation and the observed discrepancy with the experiments (Figure E panel 2)? Naively, I would have expected the time lag to scale quadratically with the distance from the pipette, as predicted by a poroelastic model and the diffusion of displacement. It seems weird to me that the beads start to move together at some distance from the pipette or else I would expect that they just stop moving. What model parameters influence this saturation? Does membrane permeability contribute to this saturation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In our opinion, the saturation occurring at 30 microns arises from the geometry of the model. At the largest distance away from the micropipette, the cortex becomes dominant in the mechanical response of the cell because it represents an increasing proportion of the cellular material.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we will rerun our finite element models with a range of cell sizes. This will be added to the manuscript at a later date.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses: I have two broad critical comments:</p>
<p>(1) I sense that the authors are correct that the best explanation of their results is the passive poroelastic model. Yet, to be thorough, they have to try to explain the experiments with other models and show why their explanation is parsimonious.

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and we agree with their general premise.</p>
<p>Some observations could qualitatively be explained in other ways. For example, if we considered the cell as a viscoelastic material, we could define a time constant <inline-formula id="sa4equ11"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-105523-sa4-equ11.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> with Î· the viscosity and E the elasticity of the material. The increase in relaxation time with sucrose treatment could then be explained by an increase in viscosity. However, work by others has  previously shown that, in the exact same conditions as our experiment, viscoelasticity cannot account for the observations[1]. In its discussion, this study proposed poroelasticity as an alternative mechanism but did not investigate that possibility. This was consistent with our work that showed that the cytoplasm behaves as a poroelastic material and not as a viscoelastic material [4]. Therefore, we decided not to consider viscoelasticity as possibility. We now explain this reasoning better and have added a sentence about a potential role for mechanotransductory processes in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The study is rich in biophysics but a bit light on chemical/genetic perturbations. It could be good to use low levels of chemical inhibitors for, for example, Arp2/3, PI3K, myosin etc, and see the effect and try to interpret it. Another interesting question - how adhesive strength affects the results. A different interesting avenue - one can perturb aquaporins. Etc. At least one perturbation experiment would be good.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. In our previous studies, we already examined what biological structures affect the poroelastic properties of cells [2,4]. Therefore, the most interesting aspect to examine in our current work would be perturbations to the phenomenon described in Fig 6G and, in particular, to investigate what volume regulation mechanisms enable sustained intracellular pressure gradients. However, these experiments are particularly challenging and with very low throughput. Therefore, we feel that these are out of the scope of the present report and we mention these as promising future directions.</p>
