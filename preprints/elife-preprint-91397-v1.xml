<abstract>
<p>Life as we know it relies on the interplay between catalytic activity and information processing carried out by biological polymers. Here we present a plausible pathway by which a pool of prebiotic information-coding oligomers could acquire an early catalytic function, namely sequencespecific cleavage activity. Starting with a system capable of non-enzymatic templated replication, we demonstrate that even non-catalyzed spontaneous cleavage would promote proliferation by generating short fragments that act as primers. Furthermore, we show that catalytic cleavage function can naturally emerge and proliferate in this system. Specifically, a cooperative catalytic network with four subpopulations of oligomers is selected by the evolution in competition with chains lacking catalytic activity. The cooperative system emerges through the functional differentiation of oligomers into catalysts and their substrates. The model is inspired by the structure of the hammerhead RNA enzyme as well as other DNAand RNA-based enzymes with cleavage activity that readily emerge through natural or artificial selection. We identify the conditions necessary for the emergence of the cooperative catalytic network. In particular, we show that it requires the catalytic rate enhancement over the spontaneous cleavage rate to be at least 10<sup>2</sup> <italic>−</italic>10<sup>3</sup>, a factor consistent with the existing experiments. The evolutionary pressure leads to a further increase in catalytic efficiency. The presented mechanism provides an escape route from a relatively simple pairwise replication of oligomers towards a more complex behavior involving catalytic function. This provides a bridge between the information-first origin of life scenarios and the paradigm of autocatalytic sets and hypercycles, albeit based on cleavage rather than synthesis of reactants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the most intriguing mysteries in science is the origin of life. Despite extensive research in this area, we are still far from understanding how life has emerged on Earth. One promising hypothesis is the RNA world theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], inspired by the discovery of ribozymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], i.e. RNA molecules capable of enzymatic activity. According to this hypothesis, all processes in early life were carried out by the RNA, which was used both to store information and to catalyze biochemical reactions. In particular, specific ribozymes could have catalyzed the selfreplication of arbitrary RNA sequences, a function currently performed by specialized protein-based enzymes. However, based on the results of the existing experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], such a catalytic function requires rather long and carefully designed RNA sequences, which are highly unlikely to arise spontaneously. In contrast, one of the simplest catalytic activities of ribozymes is their ability to cleave an RNA sequence at a specific site. Indeed, such ribozymes independently evolved in multiple branches of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and have been shown to emerge rapidly and repeatedly from artificial selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. DNA molecules have also been shown to be capable of site-specific cleavage targeting either RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] or DNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>In this paper, we consider a population of informationcarrying polymers capable of templated non-enzymatic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. This may have been the state of the proto-RNA world before the emergence of ribozymes.</p>
<p>This could involve heteropolymers chemically distinct from present-day RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and/or inorganic catalysts such as, e.g. mineral surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. We demonstrate that (i) even spontaneous cleavage promotes replication by generating short fragments used as primers for templated growth; (ii) catalytic cleavage activity naturally emerges in these populations and gets selected by the evolution; (iii) this mechanism is robust with respect to replication errors.</p>
<p>In a series of previous studies, we have shown that non-enzymatic templated replication can lead to the formation of longer chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] as well as to a reduction in sequence entropy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Such a reduction in entropy has subsequently been observed experimentally for templated ligation of DNA oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. This selection in sequence space can be seen as a first step towards Darwinian evolution. However, this does not necessarily imply the emergence of a catalytic function. In this paper, we build on these findings and further investigate the potential for the evolution of catalytic activity in the proto-RNA world.</p>

<title>Model and results</title>
<p>In our model, we consider the population dynamics of a pool of heteropolymers analogous to the familiar nucleic acids (RNA or DNA) but capable of enzyme-free templated polymerization. The basic processes in this scenario are similar to those in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), where the system is driven out of equilibrium by cyclic changes in the environment (e.g. temperature), which we refer to as “night” and “day” phases. During the night phase, heteropolymers hybridize with each other following Watson-Crick-like complementarity rules. If the terminus of one chain hybridizes with the middle section of another chain the former can be gradually elongated by the virtue of non-enzymatic templated polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. We will refer to this type of hybridization as “end-to-middle”, the former chain as the “primer” and the latter chain as the “template”. During the day phase, the hybridized structures melt and all the heteropolymers separate from each other. During the next night, they hybridize with new partners, providing them with the opportunity to elongate further. Unlike the classical PCR process, we assume that the polymerization in our system occurs without any assistance from enzymes and may proceed in either direction along the chain. Equivalently, instead or polymerization, the elongation could rely on ligation with very short chain segments which is naturally bi-directional. The elongation of primers naturally leads to the copying of information from the template’s sequence. The obvious limiting factor for this process is the availability of primers and the likelihood of end-to-middle hybridization resulting in elongation. The key observation behind our model is that the breakup (cleavage) of a chain creates a new pair of potential primers. Each of them could be elongated during subsequent nights. Thus, somewhat counter-intuitively, breakup of chains results in their proliferation.</p>
<p>Our previous theoretical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] results demonstrated that templated-assisted replication of heteropolymers has a generic tendency to substantially reduce their sequence entropy. Such reduction has important consequences in the context of the current work: it significantly increases the likelihood of end-to-middle hybridization of chains during the night phase. That in turn creates an evolutionary pressure to further decrease sequence entropy. A detailed study of this fascinating mechanism falls beyond the scope of the current study. However, below we will assume the logical end of this dynamics where the pool of sequences is composed of fragments of one or several nearly non-overlapping master sequences and their complementaries. Note that for any two overlapping chains, such that the sequence of the first one is a fragment of the master sequence while the other is a fragment of the complementary master sequence, the end-to-middle binding is essentially guaranteed. The exception to this rule is when both chains terminate at the same points so that they are exact complements of each other.</p>

<title>Random cleavage model</title>
<p>Based on the argument presented above, we focus on the case of a system populated with chains that are fragments of a single master sequence or its complement. We denote the total concentration of fragments of the master sequence as <italic>c</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), while the concentration of all fragments of the complementary sequence as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> Our system operates in a chemostat, i.e. a reservoir constantly supplied with fresh monomers at the concentration <italic>m</italic><sub>0</sub> and diluted at the rate <italic>δ</italic>. Let <italic>M</italic> (<italic>t</italic>) (respectively <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>be the concentration of all monomers incorporated into chains of the subpopulation <italic>c</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (respectively <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> The concentration of free monomers not incorporated into any chains is given by:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="536473v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
It is convenient to introduce a minimal length <italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub> of a chain that would hybridize with its complementary partner during the night phase, and use it as the unit of chain length, instead of a single monomer. In effect, this leads to the renormalization of all monomer concentrations as <italic>m</italic> = [<italic>m</italic>]<italic>/l</italic><sub>0</sub>, where [<italic>m</italic>] is the conventional molarity. <italic>M</italic>, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <italic>m</italic><sub>0</sub> are similarly renormalized, while the polymer concentration remains unmodified: <italic>c</italic> = [<italic>c</italic>]. In what follows, we renormalize all lengths and concentrations so that <italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1.</p>
<p>We assume that nights are sufficiently long and that the hybridization rate is sufficiently fast so that early on during each night phase, most chains find partners with a complementary overlap. That assumes that the total concentration of all master sequence fragments, <italic>c</italic> is lower than the total concentration of all fragments in the complementary subpopulation, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> If this is not the case, i.e. if <italic>c &gt;</italic> <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, only a fraction <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> of all fragments of the master sequence find a partner, while the rest of the <italic>c</italic>-subpopulation remains unpaired and thus does not elongate. For simplicity, our model neglects the possibility of the formation of hybridized complexes involving more than two chains.</p>
<p>It is well recognized that self-replication based on templated polymerization or ligation is vulnerable to product inhibition, i.e. to the re-hybridization of the products that are meant to act as templates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Indeed, since full-length templates and their complements would bind each other stronger than any shorter fragment, the primers would typically be displaced from the templates by longer chains. In Appendix A we analyze the binding kinetics during the night phase and come to a rather surprising conclusion that despite the strand displacement, a finite and substantial fraction of all the primers will stay hybridized with their respective templates throughout the long enough night phase.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier, two hybridized chains whose sequences are fragments of the master sequence and its complementary would typically have two ends that undergo templated growth at a certain rate proportional to monomer concentration <italic>m</italic> (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The exception to this rule is when these two hybridized chains terminate at exactly the same point. In our model, the average primer elongation rate is <italic>r ·m</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). The rate parameter <italic>r</italic> accounts for the finite probability of primer binding to a template during the night phase as well as for a finite night-to-day ratio. Note that the value of <italic>r</italic> does not change after our renormalization <italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub> <italic>→</italic>1). The <italic>M</italic> (<italic>t</italic>) dynamics is thus given by</p>

<title>Model with catalyzed cleavage</title>
<p>In the model considered above, the random breakage of chains led to their proliferation. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the ability of a heteropolymer to catalyze cleavage would be selected by the evolution. Incidentally, some of the simplest known RNA-based enzymes (ribozymes) have exactly this function [7, 10–12, 28–31]. Here we consider a simple model in which a heteropolymer capable of catalyzing cleavage spontaneously emerges from a pool of mutually-templating chains. Our model is inspired by the real-world examples of naturally occurring hammerhead ribozyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] as well as artificially selected DNA-cleaving DNA enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The minimal structure of the hammerhead ribozyme [30– 32] consists of a core region of 15 (mostly) invariant nucleotides flanked by three helical stems formed by mutually complementary RNA sequences. The cleavage happens at a specific site of this structure, located immediately adjacent to one of these stems. While a classical hammerhead ribozyme consists of a single RNA chain capable of self-cleavage, the same structure could be assembled from two chains, one (labeled <italic>b</italic> in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) containing a hairpin and capable of hybridizing with and subsequently cleaving the other chain (labeled <italic>a</italic> in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, such two-chain structures are realized in certain DNA-cleaving DNA enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>We consider a scenario in which a master sequence spontaneously emerges from a random pool and subsequently diverges into two closely related subpopulations <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> and their respective complementarities <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> The sequences of <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are mostly identical except for a short insert in the chains <italic>b</italic> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, rendering them catalytically active. That is to say, when <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is bound to a chain from the subpopulation <italic>a</italic>, it induces a cleavage at a specific site of that chain. Inspired by the hammerhead ribozyme we assume that the cleavage site in <italic>a</italic> is immediately adjacent to the start of the catalytic insert in <italic>b</italic> (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We further assume that <italic>b</italic>-chains are capable of cleaving <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>-chains at the same site. This symmetry most likely does not apply to highly-optimized hammerhead ribozymes, but it is reasonable in enzymes with only a modest level of catalytic efficiency. Let the cleavage within -<italic>a</italic> or <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> duplexes occur at rates <italic>β</italic> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline20.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> respectively.</p>
<p>The cleavage of a chain of type <italic>a</italic> by<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> produces two pieces, right and left. The concentrations of these fragments are referred to as <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> and <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> respectively. Inspired by the example of the hammerhead ribozyme (illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) we assume that one of them (<italic>a</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>) can serve as a primer only for <italic>a</italic>. Conversely, the other fragment (<italic>a</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub>) can serve as a primer for either <italic>a</italic> or <italic>b</italic> depending on the first templating chain with which it will hybridize (respectively <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline22.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline23.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> Assuming a random first encounter, the probability for <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> to serve as a primer to <italic>b</italic> is thus given by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline24.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> while the probability of it to grow into <italic>a</italic> is <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline25.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> Similarly, conversion probabilities in the complementary subpopulation <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline26.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> are determined by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline27.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula></p>
<p>As in the random cleavage model, the concentration of hybridized duplexes is given by the smaller of two concentrations <italic>a</italic> + <italic>b</italic> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline28.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> This is captured by the factor <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline29.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> in the elongation rate of a primer: <italic>rmχ</italic>. Here, as before, this rate is measured in <italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub> bases per unit time, and <italic>m</italic> is the free monomer concentration.</p>
<p>We observe that in order for a cleavage fragment to work as a primer, it needs to exceed the minimal primer length <italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub>. Therefore, a newly formed cleavage product <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> needs to grow by at least <italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub> bases before it can be considered a part of the <italic>a</italic> subpopulation. Indeed, if it has not grown by that length, another catalyzed cleavage at the same site would not increase the number of primers in the system. Therefore, the rate at which chains in the subpopulation <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> are converted to <italic>a</italic> is given by <italic>rm</italic> χ The rate of conversion of <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> to <italic>a</italic> is similar, up to the factor 1 <italic>−ϕ</italic> discussed above: <italic>rm</italic> χ (1 <italic>−ϕ</italic>). If a segment <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> was first hybridized to<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline30.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> it will eventually grow to be a part of the subpopulation <italic>b</italic>. However, in order to become functional, this chain has to grow at least by the length of the catalytic insert, which is distinct from <italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub>. Furthermore, the rate of elongation of <italic>b</italic> is slowed down by the presence of a hairpin in the catalytic domain of the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline31.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> structure. Both effects can be captured by a factor <italic>λ</italic> in the conversion rate from <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> to <italic>b</italic> given by <italic>rm</italic>χ<italic>ϕ/λ</italic>, relative to that of <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> to <italic>a</italic> given by <italic>rm</italic>χ (1 <italic>−ϕ</italic>).</p>

<title>Evolutionary dynamics</title>
<p>The competition for monomers is the main mechanism of natural selection operating in our system. The steady state with the lowest level of monomer concentration is favored by evolution since the competing states would not be able to proliferate at that level of monomers. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn13">Eq. (13)</xref> implies that the monomer concentration <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline47.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> in the cooperative solution is always less than a half of its value <italic>m</italic><sup><italic>∗</italic></sup> in the absence of the catalytic cleavage. Thus, once the cooperative state emerges, it drives out all chain sequences that still rely on non-catalytic cleavage for replication. The continuously increasing “fitness” of the system can be quantified, e.g., by the ratio <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline48.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> Note that the non-cooperative solution has a fitness of 1, while the cooperative solution has a fitness higher than 2.</p>
<p>The fitness landscape of our system shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> depends on two parameters of the catalytic cleavage: <italic>β</italic> and <italic>λ</italic>. Its preeminent feature is a relatively narrow fitness ridge (orange and red color in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). For a fixed value of <italic>λ</italic> this ridge corresponds to a sharp fitness maximum located at the lowest possible catalytic cleavage rate <italic>β</italic> for which the cooperative state still exists (see the red region in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In other words, for a given <italic>λ</italic>, the selective pressure would drive <italic>β</italic> down to the lower boundary separating cooperative and non-cooperative regions.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, <italic>λ</italic> and <italic>β</italic> are expected to co-evolve together.</p>
<p>Indeed, <italic>λ &gt;</italic> 1 quantifies the ratio by which the structural properties of the type-<italic>b</italic> chain (its excess length, the hairpin unzipping free energy, etc.) slow down its replication compared to that of the type-<italic>a</italic> chain. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that <italic>λ</italic> could be easily modified in the course of the evolution. As a consequence of the selective pressure, both <italic>λ</italic> and <italic>β</italic> are expected to increase in the course of the evolution driving the system up the ridge in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. This intuition is confirmed by a direct numerical simulation in which we model the evolution as a Monte Carlo process with fitness playing the role of negative energy Parameters <italic>λ</italic> and <italic>β</italic> were allowed to vary randomly and independently of each other. A sample evolutionary trajectory is shown as a dashed line in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>.</p>
<p>One can imagine several possible pathways leading to this self-sustaining cooperative system. (i) A pair of mutually complementary non-catalytic chains (<italic>a</italic> and ā in our notation) gains function due to a copying error, giving rise to a small subpopulation of “sister” chains (<italic>b</italic> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline49.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> in our notation) with nascent cleavage activity directed toward āand <italic>a</italic> respectively. (ii) A pair of catalytically active chains <italic>b</italic> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline50.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> emerges first, subsequently losing the catalytic inserts due to a copying error, thus giving rise to a small subpopulation of substrate chains <italic>a</italic> and ā. According to the dynamic phase portrait of our system illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> the second pathway is more plausible than the first one. Indeed, at least for the parameters used in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, the conversion of only a few percent of <italic>b</italic> chains to <italic>a</italic> brings the systems into the basin of attraction of the cooperative fixed point marked green in the figure. The other scenario is less likely since it requires a much higher ratio of emergent over ancestral population sizes.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that the cooperative steady state emerges when the catalytic rate enhancement over the spontaneous cleavage rate is at least 10<sup>2</sup> <italic>−</italic>10<sup>3</sup>. This is a relatively modest gain compared to the 10<sup>9</sup> enhancement reported for a highly-optimized hammerhead ribozyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. However, it is comparable to the rate enhancement observed after only five rounds of in vitro selection from an unbiased sample of random RNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In the course of subsequent evolution, two main parameters of our model <italic>β</italic> and <italic>λ</italic> are expected to increase in tandem. The first parameter, <italic>β</italic>, is the catalytic cleavage rate, which, as we know, can increase over multiple orders of magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. The second parameter, <italic>λ</italic>, quantifies the relative delay in the elongation of <italic>b</italic>-types chains compared to <italic>a</italic>-type chains. It may be caused at least in part by the difficulty of unzipping the hairpin, thus <italic>λ</italic> can be dramatically increased by making the hairpin stem longer. One should note that our model requires the catalytic activity of both <italic>b</italic> chains and their complementary partner, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline51.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> chains. Thus, sequences are expected to evolve to simultaneously optimize these two catalytic rates. The need for this compromise would likely prevent the catalysts from reaching the maximum efficiency observed, e.g. in fully optimized ribozymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. The drive to further optimize cleavage activity might trigger a transition to more complex catalytic networks, e.g. to an increase in the number of chains involved.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The proposed scenario is certainly not the only plausible pathway that could lead to the emergence of functional heteropolymers in the prebiotic world. To illustrate some of the unique features of the presented model, it is useful to place it in the context of other recent proposals. One of the most intriguing possibilities is the virtual circular genome (VCG) model recently proposed in ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. It is based on the observation that a relatively long ancestral genome can be stored as a collection of short overlapping RNA fragments of a circular master sequence or its complement. The model assumes unidirectional non-enzymatic replication of these fragments. On the one hand, it explains how a collection of relatively short RNA fragments (10-12 nucleotides each) could store a large amount of genetic information. On the other hand, computer simulations indicate that the VCG is susceptible to so-called sequence scrambling, where the appearance of repeats in the master sequence results in the loss of integrity of an entire circular genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. In fact, this can be seen as a special case of the classical error catastrophe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]: a single self-replicating master sequence of a virtual circular genome (and its complement), is replaced by a pool of scrambled sequences. The proliferation of the VCG is quite sensitive to these errors, since the model assumes unidirectional polymerization, so that in order to return to copying a particular segment, one must copy the entire virtual circle.</p>
<p>Our model, while sharing some elements with the VCG model, differs in two important aspects: (i) it assumes that the non-enzymatic templated polymerization is bidirectional, and (ii) the functional activity of the heteropolymer is localized in a relatively short sequence region that is catalytically cleaved and thus replicated first. This implies that the errors accumulated outside the narrow functional region do not affect the viability of our autocatalytic system. In fact, our approach can be combined with the VCG model to generate a linear rather than a circular virtual genome. The sequence scrambling would still be present in this model in the form of branching of a sufficiently long master sequence, but it would not affect the ability of the functional region of the sequence to self-replicate. An alternative proposal that avoids sequence scrambling is the rolling cycle model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], which relies on strand displacement rather than the cyclic melting of complementary strands. It generally requires a more sophisticated setup, including a preselected sequence pool and the availability of cleavage enzymes. Our model provides a plausible pathway for how this catalytic function might emerge.</p>
<p>Our model aims to describe the early stages of the evolution of life on Earth based on non-enzymatic polymerization. While it may seem challenging to test it for conditions relevant to the origin of life, our main conclusions can still be verified experimentally. RNA or DNA can be used as model polymers in such experiments, as both have demonstrated catalytic abilities in cleavage reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. To simulate primordial polymerization driven by day/night cycling, the experiment would have to rely on enzymatic polymerization or ligation as used e.g. in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] or Ligase Chain Reaction (LCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. However, it’s important to note that our model assumes polymerization in both the 5’-to-3’ and 3’-to-5’ directions, unlike traditional PCR, which only adds new nucleotides in the 5’-to-3’ direction. This problem of bidirectional polymerization was solved by evolution using Okazaki fragments[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Inspired by this discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand of DNA, we propose a possible experimental implementation of our system based on ligation rather than polymerization enzymes. In this scenario, the system would be supplied with ultrashort random DNA segments. These segments, which are much shorter than the minimal primer length (<italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub>), would play the role of “monomers” and bidirectional primer extension would occur through a sequence of ligation steps connecting adjacent ultrashort segments to each other. Another important consideration for experimental implementation is the need to activate the nucleotides to provide free energy for polymerization. Thus, both the short fragments supplied to the system and the new primers formed by cleavage must be chemically activated.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our results suggest a plausible pathway by which a pool of information-carrying polymers could acquire the catalytic function, thereby bringing this system closer to the onset of the RNA world. We start with a pool of polymers capable of non-enzymatic templated polymerization and subjected to cyclic change of conditions (day/night cycles). The replication in our system is carried out during the night phase of the cycle via the elongation of primers hybridized with their complementary templates. We first observe that any cleavage of chains generates new primers and thus promotes their replication. The mutual replication of complementary chains is sustainable, as long as cleavage and elongation rates are large compared to the dilution rate: <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>m</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>r &gt; δ</italic><sup>2</sup>. This suggests that a faster, catalyzed cleavage would be selected by the evolution. Furthermore, DNA or RNA sequences capable of catalyzing site-specific cleavage are known to be relatively simple and readily arise via either natural or artificial selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The oligomer replication based on catalyzed cleavage is not trivial, as it requires cooperativity between multiple chain types. Our study shows that a stable cooperative solution can be achieved with as few as four subpopulations of chains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is a wide range of conditions under which this catalytic network proliferates and significantly outcompetes non-catalytic ancestors of the constituent chains.</p>

<title>Effect of template rehybridization</title>
<p>Consider a simple model in which two mutually complementary sequences act as templates for each other’s polymerization. Let <italic>C</italic> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline52.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> be the concentrations of these unhybridized template chains. Let <italic>c</italic> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline53.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> be the concentrations of unhybridized fragments of these two sequences, respectively. They may act as primers once bound to their complementary template. At the beginning of the “night” phase, we assume all the chains to be in an unhybridized state, i.e. <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline54.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> We will describe the system’s kinetics during the “night” phase by assuming that hybridization is essentially irreversible, except for the possibility of a primer strain displacement by a full chain. We only focus on the regime when the total concentration of primers, <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline55.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>is much smaller than that of free templates, <italic>C</italic> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline56.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> Note that the concentrations of bound primers are <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> <italic>−</italic>, and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline57.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, respectively.</p>
<p>The kinetics of this simple model is described by the following rate equations:
<disp-formula id="eqnS1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="536473v2_eqnS1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqnS2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="536473v2_eqnS2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
The first equation accounts for the hybridization of mutually complementary template chains (assuming <italic>c ≪ C</italic>, and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline58.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is the corresponding association rate). The second equation accounts for the hybridization of primers with their complementary substrates and for the primer strand displacement due to the hybridization of the template with its full-length complementary. The respective association rates for these two processes, <italic>κ</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>κ</italic><sub>2</sub>, are dependent on the length and sequences of the chains involved, but generally comparable. The other two equations, for <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline59.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline60.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, are obtained by replacing all the concentrations with their complementaries.</p>
<p>We first consider the asymmetric case, when, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline61.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (without loss of generality). This implies that for a long enough duration of the night, the number of hybridized chains is limited by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline62.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> Thus, only one type of the template chain will remain in the solution, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline63.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> while the other will be completely hybridized, i.e. <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline64.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> In turn, this implies that the situation will be even more drastic for the primers: <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline65.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (completely hybridized), while <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline66.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (completely free). As a result, the minority fraction, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline67.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> would replicate faster and the balance would be restored, so that <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline68.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula></p>
<p>Now, we will analyze the above set of differential equations for a symmetric case, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="536473v2_inline69.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>The fraction of free template chains vanishes with time, as a power law (rather than exponentially):

Since the association rates <italic>κ</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>κ</italic><sub>2</sub> are comparable, we come to a surprising conclusion that a finite fraction of fragments, of the order of 1, will stay hybridized in the course of a long enough night, despite the effect of strand displacement by longer chains:

As <italic>a</italic> + <italic>b, a</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>, and <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> are now expressed in terms of <italic>c</italic>, we use its definition, <italic>c</italic> = <italic>a</italic> + <italic>b</italic> + <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> + <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub>, to get

In practice, it is the monomer concentration that gets adjusted to its steady state value <italic>m</italic><sup><italic>∗</italic></sup>, thus <italic>µ</italic> is the variable that has to satisfy the above equation, for given values of other parameters.</p>
<p>The stable fixed points only appear on the decreasing segment of the function <italic>β</italic>(<italic>µ</italic>). Thus, the limits of stability correspond to zero derivatives of the r.h.s. of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnS19">Eq. (S19)</xref>. This leads to the following condition:

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The emergence of catalytic self-replication of polymers is an important question in the context of the origin of life. Tkachenko and Maslov present a model in which such a catalytic polymer sequence emerges from a random pool of replicating polymers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The model is part of a theme from many previous papers from the same authors and their colleagues. The model is interesting, technically correct, and demonstrates qualitatively new phenomena. It is good that the paper also makes a connection with possible experimental scenarios -- specifically, concrete proposals are made for testing the core ideas of the model. It would indeed be an exciting demonstration when such an experiment does indeed materialize.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Unlike the rest of the paper which is very tight in its arguments, I find that the discussion section is not so. Specifically, sentences such as &quot; In fact, this can be seen as a special case of the classical error catastrophe&quot; are a bit loose and not well substantiated -- although these are in the discussion section, I find this to be a weakness of an otherwise good paper. Tightening some of the arguments here will make it an excellent paper in my opinion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The replication of information-coding polymers and the emergence of catalytic ribozymes pose significant challenges, both experimentally and theoretically, in the study of the RNA world hypothesis. In this context, Tkachenko et al. put forth a novel hypothesis regarding a replication oligomer system based on a cleavage ribozyme. They initially highlighted that the breakage of oligomers could contribute to self-replication, provided that these fragments function as primers for subsequent replications. Next, they proposed a self-replicating system of oligomers founded on a hammerhead structure that catalyzes cleavage. By a simple dynamical model, they demonstrated that such a system is self-sustainable in certain parameter regimes. Furthermore, they delved into discussions regarding the potential emergence of such a system and the evolution toward further optimized ribozymes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Although the cleavage (hammerhead) ribozyme has been discussed in the context of the origins of life, the authors are the first to discuss how they could be selected using a mathematical model as far as I know. The idea is simple: ribozyme activity creates fragments by breakage of an oligomer, which works as a primer for the ribozyme itself, resulting in a positive feedback system (i.e., autocatalytic sets in a broader sense). This potentially enables us to resolve at the same time problems on the (i) supply of new primers (but note that there is a major concern on this as described in the 'weakness'), and (ii) the sustaining of the cleavage ribozyme.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The major weakness of their theory is that the ends of the new primers, formed through the breakage/cleavage of polymers, must be chemically active (as the authors have already emphasized in the last paragraph of their discussion) to enable further elongation. Reactivating the ends of preexisting oligomers without enzymes, to the best of our current knowledge, could be a challenging task. Although their model heavily relies on this aspect, the authors do not elaborate on it.</p>
<p>Another weakness is in the setup of their discussion on evolutionary dynamics. While they claim that their model is robust against replication errors, their approach to evolutionary dynamics appears unconventional, and it remains unclear under what conditions their assumptions are founded. They treat a whole set of oligos as a subject of evolution, rather than each individual oligo. This may necessitate more complex assumptions, such as the encapsulation of sets of oligos inside a protocell, to be adequately rationalized. Thus, it remains uncertain whether the system is indeed robust against replication errors in a more natural context. For example, if a mutant oligo, denoted as b', arises due to an error in the replication of oligo b, and if b' has lower catalytic activity but replicates more rapidly than b, it may ultimately come to dominate the system.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Non-enzymatic replication of RNA or a similar polymer is likely to be important for the origin of life. The authors present a model of how a functional catalytic sequence could emerge from a mixture of sequences undergoing non-enzymatic replication.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Interesting model describing details of the proposed replication mechanism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
A discussion of the virtual circular genome idea proposed in [33] is included in the discussion section together with the problem of sequence scrambling faced by this mechanism that was raised in [34]. However, the authors state that sequence scrambling is a special case of the classical error catastrophe. This should be reworded, because these phenomena are completely different. The error catastrophe occurs due to single-point mutational errors in a model that assumes that a complete template is being copied in one cycle. Sequence scrambling arises in models that assume cycles of melting and reannealing, in which case only part of a template is copied in one cycle. Scrambling is due to the many alternative ways in which pairs of sequences can reanneal. Many of these alternatives are incorrect and this leads to the disappearance of the original sequence. This problem exists even in the limit where there is zero mutational error rate. Therefore, it cannot be called a special case of the error catastrophe problem.</p>
<p>The authors seem to believe that their model avoids the scrambling problem. If this is the case, a clear explanation should be added about why this problem is avoided. Two possible points are mentioned.</p>
<p>
(i) Replication is bidirectional in this model. This seems like a small detail to me. I don't think it makes any difference to whether scrambling occurs.</p>
<p>
(ii) The functional activity is located in a short sequence region. I can imagine that if the length of a strand that is synthesized in a single cycle is long enough to cover the complete functional region, then sometimes the complete functional sequence can be copied in one cycle. Is this what is being argued? If so, it depends a lot on rates of primer extension and lengths of melting cycles etc, and some comment on this should be made.</p>
