<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Movement flexibility and automaticity are necessary to successfully navigate different environments. When encountering difficult terrains such as a muddy trail, we can change how we step almost immediately so that we can continue walking. This flexibility comes at a cost since we initially must pay deliberate attention to how we are moving. Gradually, after a few minutes on the trail, stepping becomes automatic so that we do not need to think about our movements. Canonical theory indicates that different adaptive motor learning mechanisms confer these essential properties to movement: explicit control confers rapid flexibility, while forward model recalibration confers automaticity. Here we uncover a distinct mechanism of treadmill walking adaptation – an automatic stimulus-response mapping – that confers both properties to movement. The mechanism is flexible as it learns stepping patterns that can be rapidly changed to suit a range of treadmill configurations. It is also automatic as it can operate without deliberate control or explicit awareness by the participants. Our findings reveal a tandem architecture of forward model recalibration and automatic stimulus-response mapping mechanisms for walking, reconciling different findings of motor adaptation and perceptual realignment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Flexibility and automaticity are essential features of human movement, so much so that we rarely think about the details of how we move. While walking, we do not think about the bend of the ankle or how quickly to swing the leg forward to step. Yet, we easily adjust walking to accommodate many situations – a muddy trail, a grassy slope, or a snowy path. These abilities are often taken for granted until something goes awry – a sprained ankle quickly brings the details of movement execution to awareness, and deliberate control is often used to avoid pain or further injury. It is only then that we truly appreciate how much the sensorimotor system is doing without our conscious awareness.</p>
<p>We currently do not understand how different motor learning mechanisms confer both flexibility and automaticity to human movement. One well-studied process of motor learning is sensorimotor adaptation, which occurs in response to errors between the expected and actual sensory consequences of our movements. Accordingly, this motor learning mechanism helps adjust motor commands to correct for perturbations to our movements caused by altered environmental demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bastian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Adaptation is traditionally thought to rely on the cerebellum-dependent recalibration of a forward model that associates motor commands with expected sensory consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ito, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>). For example, to walk on an icy sidewalk, we may need to recalibrate our prediction of how firmly our feet will grip the ground. The process of forward model recalibration is automatic and implicit, as it has been shown to operate without intention or awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>). However, forward model recalibration does not confer rapid flexibility because it cannot make immediate changes in movement – it can only adjust movement gradually trial-by-trial or step-by-step, a process that can take several minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bastian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>). The newly acquired sensorimotor recalibration must be unlearned over time to restore a normal movement when the environment returns to its original state after adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bastian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Martin et al., 1996a</xref>). For this reason, forward model recalibration leads to lasting movement errors (called “aftereffects”).</p>
<p>Sensorimotor adaptation can rely on more than forward model recalibration. We know that adaptation of goal-directed reaching movements can involve rapid flexible learning mechanisms sometimes called “stimulus-response mapping mechanisms”. Different types of stimulus-response mapping mechanisms have been characterized in previous studies: First, explicit strategies – where people deliberately change where they are aiming to reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>). Second, memory-based caching – where people learn motor responses in association with the respective environmental sensory stimuli, and cache them in memory for future retrieval (like a lookup-table) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huberdeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">McDougle and Taylor, 2019</xref>). Third, structural learning – where people learn general relationships between environmental sensory stimuli and motor responses and use them to produce novel responses (like when we learn to map the movement of a computer mouse to that of the cursor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Braun et al., 2009</xref>). Stimulus-response mapping mechanisms differ from forward model recalibration in that they confer rapid flexibility – novel responses can be promptly abandoned or changed for different environmental stimuli – and therefore do not lead to aftereffects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It is unclear if stimulus-response mapping mechanisms are involved in adapting movement types that are continuous like walking versus discrete movements like reaching. The goal of this study was to understand whether walking adaptation involves any stimulus-response mapping mechanism and, if so, how it operates and how it can be dissected from forward model recalibration. We focused on adaptation of walking movements on a split-belt treadmill: it is well established that when people walk with one foot faster than the other, they adapt the timing and location of their step to restore symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig1">Box 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In Experiment 1A we tested the presence of stimulus-response mapping during gait adaptation by evaluating whether people develop the ability to modify their walking pattern immediately for different split-belt magnitudes. Preliminary evidence suggests that people may be able to switch between at least two different walking patterns more rapidly than we would expect from forward model recalibration alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig2">Box 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>). Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that walking adaptation involves stimulus-response mapping in addition to forward model recalibration.</p>
<p>As our findings corroborated this hypothesis, in Experiment 1B we aimed to develop a measure to dissect individual contributions of the two mechanisms to adaptation. We based this on the well-known phenomenon of “perceptual realignment”, where perception of the belt speed difference diminishes over time during adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig2">Box 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies show that perceptual realignment is only partial – the belt speeds feel similar but not completely equal at the end of adaptation, despite complete motor adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>). Studies also suggest that perceptual realignment may stem from forward model recalibration processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">’t Hart and Henriques, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rossi et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Synofzik et al., 2008</xref>). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that the extent of perceptual realignment corresponds to the contribution of forward model recalibration to motor adaptation, with the remainder attributed to stimulus-response mapping.</p>
<p>Finally, in Experiment 2 we began to explore characteristics of stimulus-response mapping. We asked whether the stimulus-response mapping mechanism is automatic, or instead under deliberate or explicit control. Stimulus-response mapping mechanisms for reaching require explicit control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huberdeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>), but explicit control is poorly suited for automatic, continuous movements like walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Clark, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Paul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Uiga et al., 2020</xref>), and can even lead to falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wong et al., 2008</xref>). Unlike reaching, adaptation of walking is unaffected by explicit goals or instructions given to the participants on where to aim their feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, we hypothesized that participants would not be able to describe how they changed walking, in contrast to what has been previously reported in reaching. We also asked if participants could use the mapping mechanism to produce novel motor outputs akin to what has been interpreted as structural learning in reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Braun et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Motor paradigm and hypotheses</title>
<p>We asked whether walking adaptation involves both forward model recalibration and stimulus-response mapping mechanisms learned in tandem (“recalibration + mapping hypothesis”). We contrasted this with the alternative hypothesis that walking adaptation may involve only forward model recalibration mechanisms (“recalibration only hypothesis”).</p>
<p>To test this, we devised the “Ramp Down” paradigm depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. After adaptation, we gradually decreased the speed of the right belt every 3 strides (see Methods). This enabled us to obtain reliable measurements of aftereffects across 21 predetermined speed configurations, spanning from the full split-belt perturbation to tied-belts. We measure aftereffects as the magnitude of step length asymmetry.</p>

<caption><title>Experiment 1, Hypotheses and Predictions.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Conceptual schematic of our paradigm with the Ramp Down task: after adaptation, the right belt speed is gradually ramped down to match the left. <bold>(B-C)</bold> Predictions for the Ramp Down motor measures made by two competing hypotheses. <bold>(B) Recalibration only:</bold> recalibration can only change movement gradually. The Δ motor output (dotted blue line) changes slowly and does not track the rapidly decreasing perturbation (dashed red line), so that step length asymmetry aftereffects emerge immediately (solid purple line, magnitude is positive). <bold>(C) Recalibration + mapping:</bold> mapping can change movement immediately. In the first part of the task (highlighted in green), the mapping contribution to Δ motor output (dark blue shade) is scaled down immediately as the perturbation decreases. Hence, the Δ motor output (dotted blue line) changes rapidly and tracks the perturbation (dashed red line), so that there are no step length asymmetry aftereffects (solid purple line, magnitude is ∼zero). In the second part of the task, the mapping contribution to Δ motor output is zero, and the recalibration contribution to Δ motor output (light blue shade) does not change significantly. Hence, the Δ motor output (dotted blue line) does not track the perturbation (red dashed line), and step length asymmetry aftereffects emerge (solid purple line, magnitude is positive). <bold>Right column inset:</bold> conceptual explanation of how both hypotheses may account for the speed match results from Leech at al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>). In the first post-adaptation speed match task, participants increase the speed of the right belt from zero to a value that is smaller than adaptation but larger than the left belt (top panel). The perturbation increases until a value that is positive but smaller than adaptation (dashed red line, middle and bottom panels). Leech et al. observed symmetric step lengths at the end of the task, indicating that the Δ motor output (dotted blue line) is smaller than it was in adaptation and matches the perturbation. The decrease in Δ motor output can be explained by the recalibration only hypothesis as forgetting/unlearning (middle panel), or by the recalibration + mapping hypothesis as flexible scaling of the mapping contribution (bottom panel).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>As depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, the recalibration only hypothesis predicts that aftereffects will be present for all speed configurations in the Ramp Down. This is because the Δ motor output (blue) can only change gradually, through unlearning or forgetting of the forward model recalibration (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). This change is too slow to track the perturbation (red), which is ramped down to zero rapidly over ∼80 seconds. Therefore, step length asymmetry (purple) becomes positive immediately in the Ramp Down.</p>
<p>In contrast, as depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, the recalibration + mapping hypothesis predicts that aftereffects will be present for some, but not all speed configurations in the Ramp Down. Specifically, there would be no aftereffects (∼zero step length asymmetry) in the first portion of the Ramp Down, because the Δ motor output (blue) changes rapidly and matches the perturbation (red). This reflects the flexibility of the stimulus-response mapping (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Aftereffects would emerge in the second portion of the task (positive step length asymmetry), reflecting forward model recalibration.</p>
<p>We include forgetting effects for the recalibration only hypothesis to account for previous findings from Leech et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig2">Box 2</xref>). The inset of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> (right column) illustrates how both hypotheses may account for near-zero step length asymmetry at the end of the speed match task. The Δ motor output decreases to match the perturbation either because the mapping mechanism flexibly scales down (recalibration + mapping hypothesis) or, alternatively, because of forgetting/unlearning (recalibration only hypothesis).</p>

<title>Motor results – step length asymmetry</title>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> shows the paradigm used for Experiment 1, and the time course of step length asymmetry (group mean ± SE). The Ramp Down task corresponds to the manipulation illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and is the focus of our analysis for Experiment 1. A similar ramp task was performed prior to adaptation as a control to see how participants responded to a gradually ramped perturbation at baseline (see Methods, “Ramp tasks”). Participants performed perceptual tests during the ramp tasks, which will be discussed in a later section (see “Perceptual results<italic>”</italic>). Patterns of step length asymmetry during other portions of the paradigm were consistent with a large body of previous work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>, 2018b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Reisman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>) and will not be discussed further.</p>

<p>Step length asymmetry during the baseline ramp and post-adaptation Ramp Down tasks are displayed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. For each speed configuration in the Ramp Down task, we statistically compared step length asymmetry to zero. We evaluated the emergence of aftereffects by examining when step length asymmetry became significantly positive. We found that step length asymmetry was <italic>not</italic> statistically different from zero during the first half of the Ramp Down task, for right belt speeds ranging from 1m/s to 0.5m/s faster than the left speed (these speed configurations are highlighted in green in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> right; all CI<sub>LB</sub> [confidence intervals lower bounds] ≤ −0.001 and CI<sub>UB</sub> [upper bounds] ≥ 0.009, SI Appendix, Fig. S2 and Table S1). This result indicates that aftereffects do not emerge immediately in the Ramp Down task, a finding at odds with the recalibration only prediction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> ‘predictions’ inset, top). Step length asymmetry was instead significantly positive for the second half of the task, for right belt speeds ranging from 0.45m/s to 0m/s faster than the left speed (all CI<sub>LB</sub> &gt; 0.01). These results indicate that aftereffects emerge at a mid-point during the Ramp Down task and align with behavioral predictions from the recalibration + mapping hypothesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> ‘predictions’ inset, bottom).</p>
<p>As a control, we repeated the same analysis for the baseline ramp task (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, left). We found that there was only one speed configuration for which step length asymmetry was not statistically different from zero (right speed 0.05m/s slower than left; SL asym. = 0.006 [−0.017, 0.028], mean [CI]). For all other configurations, step length asymmetry was significantly positive (CI<sub>LB</sub> ≥ 0.048 for right speed 0.1 to 0.35m/s slower than left) or negative (CI<sub>UB</sub> ≤ −0.019 for right speed 0 to 0.35m/s faster than left). This is in stark contrast to the wide range of speed configurations with near-zero step length asymmetry observed in the Ramp Down period. Hence, the ability to walk symmetrically at different speed configurations is not innate but dependent on the adaptation process, corroborating the hypothesis that the “no aftereffects” region of the Ramp Down reflects the operation of a mapping mechanism.</p>

<title>Motor results – perturbation and Δ motor output</title>
<p>To further test the competing hypotheses, we examined the perturbation and Δ motor output during the Ramp Down (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). As the belt speed difference decreased, so did the perturbation component (red). In the first half of the task, the Δ motor output (blue) appeared to match the perturbation – consistent with the lack of step length asymmetry aftereffects (green shaded portion, matching <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Additionally, in the second half of the task, the Δ motor output appeared larger than the perturbation – consistent with the positive step length asymmetry aftereffects observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>.</p>

<p>We formally contrasted predictions made by the competing hypotheses by developing mathematical models of the Δ motor output as a function of perturbation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). In the simplest framework, the Δ motor output behavior for the recalibration and mapping mechanisms can be formalized as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v2_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<disp-formula id="eqn2">

</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="559267v2_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>Where <italic>u</italic> is the modelled Δ motor output, <italic>p</italic> is the perturbation, and <italic>r</italic> is a free parameter representing the portion of the Δ motor output related to recalibration. We used <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (3)</xref> as our model for the recalibration + mapping hypothesis. This describes the scenario where participants modulate the Δ motor output to match the perturbation (<italic>u</italic>(<italic>p</italic>) = <italic>p</italic>) for the first portion of the Ramp Down task. The Δ motor output remains constant during the second portion of the task (<italic>u</italic>(<italic>p</italic>) = <italic>r</italic>) because participants are unable to reduce the Δ motor output to values smaller than “<italic>r</italic>” (the amount achieved by recalibration). Parameters were estimated by fitting the model to individual participants’ Δ motor output data from the Ramp Down (see Methods).</p>
<p>The fitted Δ motor output is displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> (mean ± SE of fits across participants; individual fits are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S3). As expected, the recalibration + mapping fit captured the matching-then-divergent behavior of Δ motor output in response to the changing perturbation.</p>
<p>We used the dual state model of motor adaptation from Smith et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Smith et al., 2006</xref>) as our model for the recalibration only hypothesis (see Methods). The model has four parameters and can account for potential forgetting or unlearning of the Δ motor output that may occur during the Ramp Down. It can also account for the possibility that adaptation involves two recalibration mechanisms – i.e., two distinct ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ mechanisms that both learn via a process of forward model recalibration, and both contribute to aftereffects, but that learn and forget at different rates. We chose this model because it is a well-established model that is widely used to capture the Δ motor output time-course for traditional motor adaptation paradigms (i.e., those consisting of adaptation and post-adaptation phases). Yet, performance of this model for a manipulation like the Ramp Down task performed here has not yet been tested. As such, if the recalibration + mapping model fit the Ramp Down data better than the dual state model, this would provide robust evidence for the presence of a stimulus-response mapping mechanism.</p>
<p>We show the Δ motor output fit by the recalibration only (dual state) model in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> (group mean ± SE; individual fits are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S4). In contrast to the recalibration + mapping model, the dual state model was not able to capture the matching-then-divergent behavior of Δ motor output. The BIC statistic confirmed that the recalibration + mapping model fitted the data significantly better than the dual state (BIC difference = 8.422 [3.532, 13.573], mean [CI]).</p>
<p>In a supplementary analysis, we considered two additional prominent models for motor adaptation: optimal feedback control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Todorov, 2004</xref>) and memory of errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to the dual state, these models could not capture the matching-then-divergent behavior of Δ motor output and fitted the Ramp Down data significantly worse than the recalibration + mapping (see SI Appendix, “Experiment 1 additional models” and Fig. S5; memory of errors minus recalibration+mapping BIC difference = 11.610 [6.220, 17.558], optimal feedback control minus recalibration+mapping BIC difference = 19.272 [14.378, 24.399], mean [CI]). In sum, the modeling analysis of the Δ motor output further supports the recalibration + mapping hypothesis.</p>

<title>Perceptual test and results</title>
<p>The second goal of Experiment 1 was to evaluate the hypothesis that “perceptual realignment” (a phenomenon leading to altered perception following adaptation) results from the operation of the same forward model recalibration mechanism involved in adaptation of the Δ motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rossi et al., 2021a</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous work shows that perception realigns following gait adaptation: after adapting to a perturbation where the right treadmill belt is faster than the left, return to tied belts results in perception of the opposite asymmetry (i.e., right speed feels slower than left) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore expected that people would perceive the belt speeds as equal at some point in the Ramp Down and eventually perceive the opposite asymmetry on tied belts. We measured this by asking participants to press a keyboard button at two separate occasions during the Ramp Down task: (1) when the belts first felt equal, and (2) when they no longer felt equal (see Methods).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> depicts the button presses for the Ramp Down perceptual test (top panel, group mean) overlayed onto the Ramp Down motor data (recalibration + mapping fit). Note that the task captures a <italic>range</italic> of belt speed configurations that participants perceive as “equal speeds”, with button presses (1) and (2) corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of this range. This is expected because perception is known to be noisy and may not be sensitive enough to discriminate between belt speed configurations that are too similar.</p>

<p>We quantified perceptual realignment using the established measure of <italic>point of subjective equality</italic> (PSE), defined as the belt speed difference perceived as “equal speeds”. A PSE of zero would indicate no perceptual realignment (accurate perception) and a PSE of 1m/s (i.e., a magnitude equivalent to the difference between the belt speeds during adaptation) would indicate complete perceptual realignment such that the belt speeds feel equal during the adaptation phase.</p>
<p>We measured belt speed difference at the time of each button press. We computed PSE as the range of belt speed difference values between these two measurements:

<p>We found that <italic>PSE</italic><sub>upper bound</sub> was 0.64±0.03m/s and <italic>PSE</italic><sub>lower bound</sub> was 0.39±0.05m/s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom panel, group mean ± SE). This was consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>).This perceptual realignment was not present during baseline testing, as illustrated in SI Appendix, Fig. S6.</p>
<p>We aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that perceptual realignment arises from the forward model mechanism of motor adaptation and is unaffected by the stimulus-response mapping mechanism. This hypothesis predicts that the extent of perceptual realignment should be: 1) approximately equal to the extent of motor adaptation achieved by recalibration, and 2) less than the total extent of motor adaptation (which also includes mapping). We quantified 1) motor adaptation by recalibration as the fitted parameter “<italic>r</italic>” from the recalibration + mapping model, and 2) total motor adaptation as the Δ motor output at adaptation plateau (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, right panel, see previous section “<italic>Motor results – perturbation and Δ motor output</italic>). We expressed these motor measures and perceptual realignment as “percent compensation for the perturbation” (i.e., normalized to the perturbation magnitude in the respective units) so that they could be compared:

<p>Where <italic>r</italic> is the fitted parameter from the recalibration + mapping model, <italic>p</italic><sub>plateau</sub> is the mean perturbation over the last 30 strides of adaptation, and <italic>u</italic><sub>plateau</sub> is the mean Δ motor output over the last 30 strides of adaptation (for <xref rid="eqn6" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 6</xref>, note that 1m/s is the belt speed difference in adaptation).</p>
<p>We show group level compensation measures in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>. We found that <italic>compensation<sub>motor recalibration</sub></italic> (56±4%, group mean ± SE) fell within the <italic>compensation<sub>perceptual</sub></italic> range (39±5% to 64±3%): it was significantly smaller than the upper bound (difference = −8 [−14, −2]%) and significantly larger than the lower bound (difference = 18 [8, 28]%, mean [CI]). This supports our first prediction that perceptual realignment is comparable to the extent of motor adaptation achieved by recalibration. Furthermore, <italic>compensation<sub>perceptual</sub></italic> was significantly smaller than <italic>compensation<sub>motor total</sub></italic> (95±2%, mean ± SE; difference = 31 [25, 38]% or 57 [48, 66]%, upper or lower perceptual bounds, mean [CI]).

<p>We show individual <italic>compensation<sub>motor recalibration</sub></italic> and <italic>compensation<sub>perceptual</sub></italic> measures for each participant in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>. We evaluated Pearson’s correlation coefficients between these measures to test whether there is a direct relationship between perceptual realignment and the motor adaptation achieved by recalibration. We found that <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor recalibration</sub> was significantly correlated with the upper bound of <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> – the value computed using the “speeds feel equal” button press (r=0.64, p=0.002). This supports the hypothesized relationship between motor recalibration and changes to leg speed perception. Instead, <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor recalibration</sub> was not correlated with the lower bound of <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> (r=0.30, p=0.195) – this value is computed using the “right feels slower than left” button press, suggesting the true PSE may lay closer to the first button press. Together, our results support the hypothesis that perceptual realignment can be used as a proxy measure for the extent of motor adaptation achieved by forward model recalibration.</p>

<title>Control experiments</title>
<p>We performed six control experiments and reanalyzed previously-published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>) to replicate the findings of Experiment 1 across different paradigm conditions (SI Appendix, “Control experiments”, Fig. S7-9, and Table S2-6). This provided additional support for the recalibration + mapping hypothesis. We first checked that the motor and perceptual behaviors observed in the Ramp Down could be replicated using a different method of assessment. A “speed match” task was given where participants use a joystick to increase the speed of the right belt (initially stationary) until they feel it matches the left belt (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B, “Ascend”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Statton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>). This approximates the second half of the Ramp Down (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, right leg feels equal or slower than left). Consistent with this, we observed step length asymmetry aftereffects early in the speed match task (initial SL asym. = 0.433 [0.271, 0.612], mean [CI]). Asymmetry decreased and was eventually near-zero when the belt speeds felt equal (final SL asym. = 0.002 [−0.040, 0.045]; SI Appendix, Fig. S8B).</p>
<p>We also used a “descend” speed match task where participants <italic>decreased</italic> the speed of the right belt (initially fast as in adaptation) until they felt it matched the left (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B). This approximated the first half of the Ramp Down. As expected, step length asymmetry was close to zero for entire task (initial: −0.017 [−0.069, 0.039], final: 0.043 [−0.0004, 0.090], mean [CI]; SI Appendix, Fig. S8B). The PSE for both speed match groups was comparable to that of Experiment 1 (<italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> difference between Ramp Down lower bound and ascend or descend Control = −3 [−16, 10]% or 4 [−12, 18]%, mean [CI]), and smaller than motor adaptation (<italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor total</sub> – <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> = 48 [39, 57]% or 56 [42, 70]% for ascend or descend, mean [CI]; SI Appendix, Fig. S8A).</p>
<p>We replicated our findings in additional speed match experiments that varied in adaptation duration (3, 15, or 30 minutes), perturbation magnitude (1m/s or 0.4m/s speed difference) and schedule (abrupt or gradual) (SI Appendix, “Control experiments” and Fig. S7). Regardless of the paradigm, the step length asymmetry and PSE were consistent with the recalibration + mapping hypothesis (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 and Table S2-3).</p>

<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Experiment 1 demonstrated the presence of a stimulus-response mapping mechanism that can produce Δ motor outputs that match a range of perturbations <italic>smaller</italic> than the adaptation perturbation (in the Ramp Down task). In Experiment 2, we asked whether it can also produce Δ motor outputs that match perturbations <italic>larger</italic> than the adaptation perturbation.</p>
<p>This sheds light on whether the stimulus-response mapping of walking adaptation operates akin to memory-based or structure-based mechanisms observed in reaching adaptation. Failure to account for larger perturbations would suggest that it is memory-based. That is, the Δ motor outputs produced in adaptation may be cached in memory and later retrieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huberdeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">McDougle and Taylor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poggio and Bizzi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>). These Δ motor outputs span a range of magnitudes that are smaller than the adaptation perturbation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig1">Box 1</xref>), so that they could match smaller but not larger perturbations.</p>
<p>Conversely, success in accounting for larger perturbations would suggest that the stimulus-response mapping may be structure-based. That is, it may learn the general relationship between perturbation and appropriate Δ motor output in adaptation and later use it to generate Δ motor outputs anew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Braun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">McDougle and Taylor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>). Hence, it would be able to generate Δ motor outputs to match either smaller or larger perturbations.</p>
<p>Thus, we tested a “Ramp Up &amp; Down” condition where the speed of the right belt was both gradually increased and then decreased after adaptation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The memory-based hypothesis predicts that step length asymmetry will become negative for perturbations <italic>larger</italic> than adaptation, while the structure-based hypothesis predicts it will remain close to zero (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> inset, “predictions”). The rest of the paradigm was analogous to that of Experiment 1 except there was no perceptual assessment. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> shows step length asymmetry throughout the paradigm, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> shows a close-up of the Ramp Up &amp; Down task performance (group mean ± SE). The magenta portion of the task corresponds to the Ramp Down of Experiment 1, but the step length asymmetry differs because of the exposure to larger speed differences in the teal portion (a supplementary analysis confirmed that this is consistent with the recalibration + mapping hypothesis; see SI Appendix, “Ramp Down comparison between Experiments 1 and 2”, Fig. S10-11 and Table S7).</p>

</fig>
<p>On average, participants’ step length asymmetry patterns did not remain zero for speed differences larger than adaptation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, teal). However, we observed that individual participants exhibited markedly different patterns of step length asymmetry during this phase (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). We quantified this observation by evaluating, for each participant, the number of strides in this phase with step length asymmetry below their own baseline CI (SI Appendix, Table S8). We used a density-based analysis to formally assess whether there were separate clusters in our data (see Methods). Indeed, the algorithm detected two separate clusters of participants: for 12 participants, between 38 to 60 strides were asymmetric (out of 60 total strides); for the other 8 participants, only 3 to 21 strides were asymmetric (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-E</xref> insets, and SI Appendix, Fig. S13; difference in strides between subgroups = 36.083 [29.917, 42.250], mean [CI]). As a control, we performed the same clustering analysis for Experiment 1, and did not find separate clusters for any of our measures of interest (SI Appendix, “Experiment 1 clustering analysis”, Fig. S13-14, and Table S9-10).</p>
<p>This result indicates that 12 of 20 participants could not account for belt speed differences larger than that of adaptation, suggesting that they used a memory-based mapping mechanism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In contrast, 8 of 20 participants could account for these speeds, suggesting that they engaged a structure-based mapping mechanism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>We next aimed to exclude the possibility that participants in the structure-based subgroup may simply be faster at adapting to new perturbations than those in the memory-based subgroup and may be adapting to the new perturbations of the Ramp Up &amp; Down rather than generating Δ motor output using a previously learnt structure. To this end, we evaluated learning rates during adaptation. We found that participants in the two subgroups adapted at similar rates (strides to plateau difference, structure – memory: 135.875 [−53.208, 329.708], mean [CI]; SI Appendix, Fig. S15-16), confirming that the different pattern of step length asymmetry in the Ramp Up &amp; Down task reflects different types of mapping in the subgroups.</p>
<p>We considered that the mapping adjustments described here may or may not be <italic>deliberate</italic> (i.e., participants are trying to correct for the perturbation) or done with an <italic>explicit strategy</italic> (i.e., participants can accurately report a relevant strategy that would counter the perturbation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>). An example of an explicit strategy in visuomotor reaching adaptation is when participants report that they aimed to offset a visual rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>); conceivable examples in split-belt treadmill adaptation may be reports of “taking steps of similar length”, “stepping further ahead with the right foot” or “standing on the left foot for longer”. We tested whether participants could explicitly report changes to the gait pattern that specifically correct for the split-belt perturbation.</p>
<p>At the end of the experiment, participants were asked to report (in writing) if/how they had changed the way they walked during adaptation (note that this was a later addition to the protocol and was only collected in 16 of the 20 participants). We assessed reports by categorizing them in three steps: 1) did the report mention <italic>any</italic> deliberate changes? 2) were the changes <italic>relevant</italic> to adaptation? (i.e., did the report mention any gait metric contributing to the overall Δ motor output or step length asymmetry adaptation in any amount?) 3) was the response <italic>accurate?,</italic> as participants often reported strategies that they did not actually execute.</p>
<p>We summarize results from the questionnaire in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> (original responses are reported in SI Appendix, Table S11). We found that, while 13 participants reported <italic>deliberate</italic> changes, only 6 people mentioned <italic>relevant</italic> aspects of the walking pattern (in particular, participants mentioned “limping” or temporal coordination). Furthermore, only one of these participants reported an <italic>accurate</italic> gait parameter (“I tried to spend as much time leaning on my left leg as possible”), while the remainder of the relevant responses were inaccurate (e.g., “matched duration of standing on each foot”) or vague (e.g., “I adjusted as if I was limping”). The aspect of gait most frequently reported across participants was stability (also reported as balance, not falling, or controlling sway). This suggests that, while participants may deliberately adjust their body to feel more stable, they do not seem to explicitly strategize how to offset the perturbation. Thus, mapping tends to adjust aspects of the walking pattern that participants are not explicitly aware of controlling, suggesting that this differs from explicit strategies often observed in reaching.</p>

</fig>
<p>In sum, in Experiment 2 we found that 1) participants are largely unable to explicitly describe adaptations to their walking pattern, and 2) some but not all participants can extrapolate their walking pattern to account for larger perturbations. This sheds light on how the stimulus-response mapping mechanism of walking adaptation may align with established mechanisms: it may differ from explicit strategies and resemble memory-based caching in some people and structural learning in others.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we showed that locomotor adaptation involves two learning mechanisms: forward model recalibration and a stimulus-response mapping mechanism. The recalibration mechanism changes movement gradually and relates to the perceptual changes observed in locomotor adaptation. The mapping mechanism is flexible and, once learned, can change movement immediately to account for a range of belt speed configurations. Our data suggest that this mapping operates independently of explicit strategies, and that it can be memory-based or structure-based.</p>

<title>Forward model recalibration of movement and perception</title>
<p>In line with various adaptation studies, we showed that people recalibrated their perception in a way that reduced how perturbed they felt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Haith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harris, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Moidell and Bedell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sombric et al., 2019</xref>) – i.e., their perception of the leg speed difference diminishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Statton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>). The extent of the perceptual change correlated with the extent of the motor change that was achieved through forward model recalibration. Although previous research suggested that perceptual changes may be mediated by recalibration processes, the specific link to motor adaptation remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">’t Hart and Henriques, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sombric et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Synofzik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yavari et al., 2016</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rossi et al., 2021a</xref>). Our findings demonstrate a direct relationship between perceptual and motor recalibrations, offering a novel approach to dissect forward model recalibration from stimulus-response mapping contributions to adaptation (SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussion 1).</p>
<p>Based on our findings, we suggest that forward model recalibration counters the perturbation in the motor and perceptual domains simultaneously – it adapts the walking pattern while realigning perception of leg speed. In support of this idea, perceptual realignment resembles a well-studied “sensory cancellation” phenomenon – where forward model predictions are used to filter redundant sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Blakemore et al., 1998</xref>). Forward model predictions may also be integrated with and sharpen proprioceptive estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bhanpuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Weeks et al., 2017</xref>), and may mediate a more complex integration of predicted and actual sensory signals contributing to perceptual changes. Consistent with the operation of a forward model thought to predict sensory consequences from efferent copies of motor commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Haruno et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ito, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>), perceptual changes are expressed during active and not passive movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sombric et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vazquez et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The cerebellum is thought to house forward models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tanaka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>), and plays a role in motor adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bastian, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Martin et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Morton and Bastian, 2006</xref>), perceptual realignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Statton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Synofzik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yavari et al., 2016</xref>), as well as coordinating motor and sensory cortical activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lindeman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Popa et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, motor and perceptual changes with adaptation may reflect recalibration of forward models in the cerebellum processed downstream by motor and sensory cortices. Neural substrates are further discussed in SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussion 2.</p>

<title>Flexible yet automatic stimulus-response mapping</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that a stimulus-response mapping mechanism plays a role in walking adaptation. Unlike previous work employing a slow (10-minute) post-adaptation perturbation ramp down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Roemmich and Bastian, 2015</xref>), our “Ramp Down” task was quick (averaging 1 minute and 20 seconds) so that participants did not undergo washout (the aftereffect magnitude after the Ramp Down was comparable to that measured post-adaptation in prior work) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Reisman et al., 2005</xref>). This ruled out the possibility that changes in walking patterns were due to washout, reaffirming the presence of a flexible mapping mechanism that complemented the adjustments made by recalibration to produce a walking pattern well-suited to the current treadmill configuration (SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussion 3).</p>
<p>Our results also suggest that this mapping mechanism may operate independently of explicit control. In previous work where an explicit goal is given, adaptation mechanisms deployed in addition to forward model recalibration are consistently found to operate under deliberate control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Codol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>) – including memory-based caching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huberdeau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">McDougle and Taylor, 2019</xref>) and structural learning mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">McDougle and Taylor, 2019</xref>). Mounting evidence indicates that explicit strategies do not play a strong role in split-belt walking adaptation where an explicit movement goal is not provided to the participants; for example, people do not adapt faster even after watching someone else adapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Song et al., 2020</xref>). Strategic adjustments to the walking pattern can be temporarily elicited by providing additional visual feedback of the legs and an explicit goal of how to step. Yet, these adjustments disappear immediately upon removal of the visual feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>), and have no effect on the underlying adaptive learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Malone and Bastian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, performing a secondary cognitive task during walking adaptation does not affect the amount of motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hinton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Malone and Bastian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rossi et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Vervoort et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we show that explicit strategies are not systematically used to adapt step length asymmetry and Δ motor output: the participants in our study either did not know what they did, reported changes that did not actually occur or would not lead symmetry. Only one person reported “leaning” on the left (slow) leg for as much time as possible, which is a relevant but incomplete description for how to walk with symmetry (SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussion 4).</p>
<p>Recalibration-adjusted perceptual information on the treadmill configuration may be relayed via sensory cortical areas and cerebellum to motor cortical areas, where it may be mapped to motor adjustments. This is supported by the interconnectivity between these substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Judd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kandel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sultan et al., 2012</xref>), and by the cortical contribution to the flexible control of walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Drew and Marigold, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Reisman et al., 2010</xref>) beyond voluntary control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Delval et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Petersen et al., 2012</xref>). Mapping may also involve spinal control – which is rapid and automatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Takakusaki, 2013</xref>) and can play a role in split-belt walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Ogawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Vasudevan et al., 2011</xref>) – but likely through connection with supraspinal structures due to the extensive training needed for plasticity within the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>) (SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussion 5).</p>
<p>In sum, the mapping mechanism combines the advantages of automaticity and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>). This is ecologically important for both movement accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Uiga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wong et al., 2008</xref>) and for walking safely in real-world situations, where we walk while talking or doing other tasks, and terrains are uneven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Clark, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Paul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wong et al., 2008</xref>) (SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussion 6).</p>

<title>Mapping operates as memory-based in some people, structure-based in others</title>
<p>Results from Experiment 2 highlight individual differences in the learning mechanisms underlying generalization to unexperienced belt speed differences (usage of the term “generalization” is discussed in SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussion 7). The generalization to novel perturbation sizes observed here is in line with previous suggestions of “meta-learning” in the savings of walking adaptation (i.e., faster relearning when exposed to a different perturbation) (Leech et al., 2018b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Malone et al., 2011</xref>). Generalization to <italic>larger</italic> perturbations after reaching adaptation was shown to be incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abeele and Bock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lazar and Van Laer, 1968</xref>), and it was unclear whether the movement patterns had been <italic>extrapolated</italic> beyond what had been experienced, or rather was just the same as in adaptation. Surprisingly, we found 40%-60% divide in our participants regarding the capacity to extrapolate walking patterns to account for larger perturbations.</p>
<p>We suggest that structural learning may underlie the ability to extrapolate walking patterns and walk symmetrically for belt speed differences larger than adaptation, as seen in 8 of 20 participants. Indeed, generalization in reaching adaptation may rely on a process of structural learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Braun et al., 2009</xref>) (note, however, that this was tied to explicit aiming; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bond and Taylor, 2017</xref>). Our participants may have learned the scaling relationship between belt speed perturbation and the walking pattern needed to walk symmetrically and use this scaling to produce new walking patterns matching larger perturbations. In contrast, memory-based theories of mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dassonville et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poggio and Bizzi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Van Vugt and Ostry, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>) may explain why 12 participants walked asymmetrically for perturbations larger than adaptation, despite generalizing to smaller perturbations. Here, the walking patterns may be stored in memory during adaptation in association with the amount of perturbation they correct, and then retrieved during the ramp tasks. People transition through a range of walking patterns in adaptation (see gradual transition from baseline to adapted Δ motor outputs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig1">Box 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), so storage of intermediate outputs may reflect generalization to smaller perturbations (while larger Δ motor outputs are not experienced).

<caption><title>Schematic model of adaptation.</title>
<p>Body movement depends on environment perturbations (red) and Δ motor output (blue). The Δ motor output is adjusted by recalibration (light blue) and mapping (dark blue) mechanisms, which perform different operations and are arranged in tandem. We propose the following architecture and flow: <bold>(1. Recalibration)</bold> The recalibration mechanism produces adjustment <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> that is fixed regardless of perturbation size (light blue box, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> is constant for varying <italic>p</italic>). The <italic>same</italic> recalibration adjustment <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> serves as an input to <italic>both</italic> areas responsible for conscious perception (green box) and Δ motor output (blue box). <bold>(2. Perception)</bold> Conscious perception is computed by cancelling out the recalibration adjustment from the actual sensory feedback (green box, perception of the belt speed difference perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the difference between the actual speed difference <italic>p</italic> and recalibration <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>). The perceived perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> serves as an input to the mapping mechanism (dark blue box). <bold>(3. Mapping)</bold> The mapping mechanism produces adjustment <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> that can vary in magnitude to appropriately account for the perceived perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (dark blue box, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> scales with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and matches its magnitude). <bold>(4. Δ Motor output)</bold> The overall adjustment to Δ motor output is computed by adding the mapping adjustment <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and recalibration adjustment <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>. The corner in the Δ motor output versus perturbation profile arises because mapping is computed based on the perceived perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (not the actual perturbation <italic>p</italic>) and is only learnt for positive <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline11.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (the experienced direction). When the perturbation is perceived to be opposite than adaptation, even if it is not, mapping is zero and the Δ motor output is constant, reflecting recalibration adjustments only (blue box, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline12.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0 the mapping adjustment <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> is zero and <italic>u</italic> = <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>).</p></caption>

<p>The perturbation <italic>p</italic> represents the effect of the belt speed difference on movement or perception. Note that motor and perceptual quantities are represented in the same relative units (relative to the perturbation).</p>
<p>The light blue “recalibration” box represents the operation of the forward model recalibration mechanism: this mechanism is not flexible, so that it produces the same output <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> for any perturbation <italic>p</italic>. The recalibration <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> may project to both sensory integration and motor control areas (green and blue boxes), where it may be used to recalibrate perception and movement.</p>
<p>The green “perception” box represents the process of perceptual realignment. It receives sensory information regarding the perturbation, <italic>p</italic>, and the forward model recalibration output, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>. It cancels out the portion of the perturbation predicted by the forward model, so that it is output is the perceived perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. The perceived perturbation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> may serves both as signal for conscious speed perception (that captured by perceptual tests), and as an input to the stimulus-response mapping mechanism (dark blue box).</p>
<p>The dark blue “mapping” box represents the operation of the stimulus-response mapping mechanism. It receives the perceived perturbation signal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and transforms into a motor adjustment appropriate to counter the perceived perturbation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The blue “Δ motor output” box represent the computation of the Δ motor output. It receives the recalibration <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> and mapping <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> adjustments as inputs, and sums them to compute the Δ motor output <italic>u</italic> = <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> + <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>We propose the following series of computations. First, the recalibration is used to compute the perceived perturbation (green box). Second, the perceived perturbation is relayed to the mapping mechanism and used to compute the mapping-related motor adjustment (dark blue box). Third, recalibration-related and mapping-related motor adjustments are summed to produce the Δ motor output (blue box).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our model proposes three key features of the mapping mechanism that distinguish it from standard adaptation models. First, the mapping produces near-immediate changes to motor output in response to varying perturbations – contrasting the gradual changes proposed by state-space models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). Second, it accesses the perceived perturbation signal which integrates external sensory information with internal forward model state – contrasting the unimodal input proposed by optimal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Todorov, 2005</xref>). Third, the mapping operates automatically and is learnt with adaptation – contrasting the readily implementable explicit strategies modeled for reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Taylor and Ivry, 2011</xref>). These features enable automatic motor adjustments that complement recalibration to match varying perturbations, allowing our model to account for the observed symmetric walking across different treadmill speed configurations (SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussion 9).</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We aim to propose a framework for motor adaptation that is both parsimonious and based on a simple model. However, this simplicity inevitably comes with certain limitations. First, our model is descriptive and focused on capturing the novel features of the data revealed by the Ramp Down task, rather than the entire motor adaptation time series. Additionally, there may be alternative interpretations to our results, and a few mechanisms may underly the stimulus-response mapping observed here. As described in SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussion 10, there some evidence to suggest that walking adaptation involves optimizing motor commands to minimize energy costs (Finley et al., 2013; Sánchez et al., 2021, 2019, 2017). Therefore, our results may be explained by extending current optimal control models to account for our finding that motor commands are computed using internal state estimates and sensory feedback from the environment in tandem. Future work is needed to develop a generative model capable of capturing the features of adaptation presented here, and further characterize the nature of the stimulus-response mapping mechanism of automatic adaptation.</p>

<title>Conclusions and future directions</title>
<p>We here characterized two distinct learning mechanisms involved in walking adaptation, both of which are not under explicit control: recalibration – which leads to motor and perceptual aftereffects, and mapping – which only changes movement, does not contribute to aftereffects, and shows meta-learning to different perturbation sizes. Future work should explore whether the mapping mechanism described here could be of clinical significance: given the combined flexibility and automaticity, mapping has the potential to ameliorate known problems such as transitioning between walking environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sombric et al., 2017</xref>) and dual-tasking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Clark, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, our findings that different people adapt using different learning mechanisms (i.e., memory or structure-based mapping) highlights the importance of assessing individual characteristics of adaptation for both understanding of the neural mechanisms as well as translation to rehabilitation. Finally, as detailed in SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussions 9-11, the framework proposed here has important implications for the development of computational models of adaptation, and may help reconcile different findings related to savings, energetics, and sources of errors.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited one-hundred adults (66 females, 23.6 ± 3.9 years old, mean ± SD) for this study, and we reanalyzed data from ten additional adults collected in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>) (9 female, 21.3 ± 2.9 years old). The protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board and participants provided written informed consent. Participants had no known neurological or musculoskeletal disorders, were naïve to split-belt walking, and participated in only one of the nine experiments.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Participants walked on a split-belt treadmill (Woodway, Waukesha, WI, USA) and belt speeds were controlled using a custom Vizard program (WorldViz). Kinematic data were collected using infrared-emitting markers (Optotrak, Northern Digital, Waterloo, ON, Canada) at 100Hz (SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods).</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Ramp tasks</title>
<p>For all ramp tasks of Experiments 1 and 2, the speed of the right belt was changed by 0.05m/s every 3 strides (defined below) during right leg swing. The baseline ramp of both experiments consisted of 7 increasing right speeds from 0.35m/s to 0.65m/s. The post-adaptation Ramp Down of Experiment 1 consisted of 21 decreasing right speeds from 1.5m/s to 0.5m/s. The post-adaptation Ramp Up &amp; Down of Experiment 2 consisted of 41 total right speeds: 11 increasing speeds from 1.5m/s to 2m/s, followed by 30 decreasing speeds from 1.95m/s to 0.5m/s. The left belt speed was constant at 0.5 m/s for all ramp tasks. The treadmill was not stopped before the ramp tasks (people transitioned directly from the preceding walking blocks into the ramp) but was briefly stopped after each ramp task. We decided to not pause the treadmill between adaptation and the post-adaptation ramp tasks, and to make the tasks relatively quick – the Ramp Down was ∼80 seconds on average – to limit unwanted forgetting and/or unlearning. We occluded vision and sound of the belt speeds using a cloth drape and headphones playing white noise.</p>
<p>In Experiment 1, a keyboard was placed on the treadmill handrail. In the post-adaptation Ramp Down task, participants were asked to press a button the first time they perceived the right belt to be (1) as fast as the left, and (2) faster than the left. In the baseline ramp, they press to report the right belt feeling (1) as fast as the left, and (2) slower than the left. This was explained prior to the experiment and the above prompts were displayed during the tasks on a television screen placed in front of the treadmill.</p>

<p>In Experiment 2, we also computed the measure of “strides to plateau” using individual step length asymmetry data from the adaptation phase only. We first smoothed the data with a 5-point moving average filter. We then calculated the number of strides till five consecutive strides fell within the “plateau range”, defined as the mean ± 1SD of the last 30 strides of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Malone and Bastian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Clustering analysis</title>
<p>We tested to see if there were separate clusters of participants in our dataset. For Experiment 1, the measure used for clustering was the number of strides in the Ramp Down with step length asymmetry above the baseline CI. For Experiment 2, it was the number of strides in the first portion of the Ramp Up &amp; Down (first 60 strides, teal in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) with step length asymmetry below the baseline CI. For both experiments, “baseline CI” was computed separately for each participant as the 95% CI of the mean of step length asymmetry data in the second baseline tied-belt block (after the baseline ramp task; see Statistical Analysis).</p>
<p>We used the MATLAB “dbscan” density-based clustering algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ester et al., 1996</xref>) and automated the choice of parameters adapting previously published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Naik Gaonkar and Sawant, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rahmah and Sitanggang, 2016</xref>) (SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods and pseudocode). The resulting algorithm does not require any user input; it automatically assigns participants to clusters (whose number is not predefined), or labels them as outliers, based solely on each participant’s measure of interest.</p>

<title>Data fitting</title>
<p>In Experiment 1, we fitted different models to individual participants’ Δ motor output data in the Ramp Down. We developed and fitted our own recalibration + mapping model, presented in the Results section in <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 3</xref>. A reasonable upper limit for the parameter <italic>r</italic> would be the magnitude of the perturbation in adaptation, but this motor measure differs across participants, which would lead to inconsistencies in the data fitting analysis. We therefore reformulated the recalibration and recalibration + mapping models to use a normalized parameter <italic>r</italic><sub>norm</sub>:
<disp-formula id="eqn19">

</disp-formula>
<p>Where <italic>p</italic><sub>plateau</sub> is mean perturbation over the last 30 strides of adaptation, computed separately for each participant, <italic>p</italic> is the perturbation in the Ramp Down, and <italic>u</italic> is the modelled Δ motor output. We fitted the normalized parameter <italic>r</italic><sub>norm</sub> using initial parameter value = 0.5 and bounds = [0, 1] for all participants. We then used <xref rid="eqn19" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 19</xref> to compute the unnormalized value <italic>r</italic>.</p>
<p>For the recalibration only hypothesis, we fitted the dual state model defined as in Smith et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Smith et al., 2006</xref>):

<p>Where <italic>k</italic> is the stride number, <italic>p</italic> is the perturbation, <italic>x</italic> is the net internal estimate of the perturbation, <italic>x</italic><sub>f</sub> and <italic>x</italic><sub>s</sub> are the fast and slow states contributing to the estimate. Participants generate Δ motor output <italic>u</italic> that equals the internal estimate of the perturbation <italic>x</italic> to minimize the predicted step length asymmetry. The model has four free parameters: <italic>A</italic><sub>f</sub>, <italic>A</italic><sub>s</sub> are retention factors controlling forgetting rate, and <italic>B</italic><sub>f</sub>, <italic>B</italic><sub>s</sub> are error sensitivities controlling learning rate. We fitted the model parameters using initial values <italic>A</italic><sub>f</sub> =0.92, <italic>A</italic><sub>s</sub> =0.99, <italic>B</italic><sub>f</sub> =0.1, and <italic>B</italic><sub>s</sub> =0.01 (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>), and constraints 0&lt;<italic>A</italic><sub>f</sub>&lt;<italic>A</italic><sub>s</sub>&lt;1 and 0&lt;<italic>B</italic><sub>f</sub>&gt;<italic>B</italic><sub>s</sub>&lt;1 (as defined by the model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Smith et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We also fitted two additional models that are prominent in literature: optimal feedback control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Todorov, 2004</xref>) and memory of errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Herzfeld et al., 2014</xref>). The details for these models are provided in SI Appendix, “Experiment 1 additional models”.</p>
<p>We fitted each model to individual participants’ Δ motor output data in the Ramp Down. Specifically, we found parameter values that minimize the residual sum of squares between the Ramp Down Δ motor output data and the modelled <italic>u</italic>. Dual state, optimal control, and memory of errors models involve hidden states that depend on the history of perturbations and are not expected to be zero at the start of the Ramp Down. To account for this, we simulated these models over the entire paradigm, but computed the residual sum of squares solely on the Ramp Down to ensure fair model comparison with the recalibration + mapping model. We used the <italic>fmincon</italic> MATLAB function with constraint and optimality tolerances tightened to 10^-20 (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roemmich et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical tests were performed in MATLAB with significance level α=0.05 (two-sided). For Experiment 1, we performed within-group statistical analyses to compare the following measures to zero. For each participant and for each speed in the ramp tasks, we first averaged step length asymmetry over the 3 strides taken at that speed to obtain the measures listed in a) and b):
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Step length asymmetry for each of the 7 speeds in the baseline ramp task (m=7)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step length asymmetry for each of the 21 speeds in the Ramp Down task (m=21)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Difference in BIC between our model (recalibration + mapping) and each of the alternative models (dual state, optimal feedback control, memory of errors) (m=3)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Difference between <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor total</sub> or <italic>compensation</italic><sub>motor recalibration</sub>, and the upper and lower bounds of <italic>compensation</italic><sub>perceptual</sub> (m=4)</p></list-item>
</list>
Each item on the list represents a “family of related tests” (measures considered together for multiple comparisons), where “m” is the number of tests in the family. We computed bootstrap distributions of each measure by generating 10,000 bootstrapped samples of 20 participants (resampled with replacement from Experiment 1) and averaging the measure over participants in each sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994</xref>). We then computed confidence intervals (CI) corrected for multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate procedure (FDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2005</xref>). That is, for each family of related tests, we adjusted the significance level to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="559267v2_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where “m” is the total number of tests and “R” is number of tests deemed significant for α = 0.05. A test is significant if the CI does not overlap zero, indicating that the measure is significantly different from zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cumming and Finch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>For both experiments, we computed within-participant CIs for the mean baseline step length asymmetry. For each participant, we generated 10,000 bootstrapped samples of N strides, resampled with replacement from 2-min baseline block following the ramp task, where N is the number of strides in this phase. We averaged step length asymmetry over strides in each sample and computed the 95% CI.</p>
<p>For Experiment 2, we performed between-group statistical analyses to assess whether the following measures differed between the memory-based and structure-based subgroups:
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Number of strides to plateau (m=1)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Number of strides in teal portion of the Ramp Up &amp; Down (first 60 strides) with step length asymmetry below the within-participant baseline CI (as described above) (m=1)</p></list-item>
</list>
We generated 10,000 bootstrapped samples, each comprising 20 participants: 12 from the memory-based subgroup and 8 from the structure-based subgroup (resampled with replacement). For each sample “b”, we averaged the measure of interest over participants resampled from each subgroup to obtain µ<sub>memory</sub> (b) and µ<sub>structure</sub> (b), and evaluated the difference of the means between the subgroups: Δµ(b)= µ<sub>memory</sub> (b)-µ<sub>structure</sub>(b). We computed the CI for this difference, correcting for multiple comparisons using FDR as explained for Experiment 1. Note that we report FDR-corrected CIs in the Results sections.</p>

<p>There are three established motor measurements that are used to quantify split-belt walking adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Finley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Reisman et al., 2005</xref>): “Perturbation” measures the effect of the split-belt treadmill on the stepping pattern — the total movement error we would see in the absence of adaptation. “Δ motor output” measures the extent that individuals compensate for the perturbation by changing their stepping pattern — how much they alter when (time) and where (position) they step on the treadmill with each foot. “Step length asymmetry” measures the remaining movement error — the difference between Δ motor output and perturbation (see Methods).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig1">Box 1-Figure 1A</xref> illustrates the standard paradigm used in studies of split-belt adaptation, with abrupt transitions between tied-belt to split-belt phases, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig1">Box 1-Figure 1B</xref> illustrates the standard motor response. In the “baseline” phase, the perturbation (red), Δ motor output (blue), and step length asymmetry (purple) are zero, reflecting equal belt speeds and symmetric walking. In the “adaptation” phase, the belt speeds are different and the perturbation is positive. Initially, this leads to movement errors observed as the negative step length asymmetry. The Δ motor output gradually adapts to compensate for the perturbation, so that the step length asymmetry returns to zero. In “post-adaptation”, the belt speeds are tied and the perturbation is again zero. Individuals exhibit initial movement errors called “aftereffects”: the Δ motor output mismatches the perturbation (it remains elevated) and step length asymmetry is positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rossi et al., 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Statton et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig2">Box 2-Figure 1</xref> illustrates selected portions of the “speed match” paradigm manipulation used in prior work and the respective step length asymmetry data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Leech et al., 2018a</xref>). The paradigm and data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig2">Box 2-Figure 1A</xref> are consistent with that explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig1">Box 1</xref> (with the addition of a brief tied-belt catch trial in adaptation). Note that participants walk with near-zero step length asymmetry by the end of adaptation and exhibit large aftereffects post-adaptation.</p>
<p>The study investigated “perceptual realignment”, where perception of speed becomes biased in adaptation, partially compensating for the speed difference so that it feels smaller. They measured perception of speed with “speed match” tasks: participants control the speed of the right belt and try to match it to that of the left belt (as described later in our Control experiments).</p>
<p>Left and right panels <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ufig2">Box 2-Figure 1B</xref> depict the tasks performed before and after adaptation – top row shows belt speeds and bottom row shows step length asymmetry. Before adaptation, participants can accurately match the speeds and walk symmetrically at this near-tied-belt configuration (right and left speeds are ∼equal and step length asymmetry is ∼zero at the end of the “before adapt” task). After adaptation, participants overshoot the speed of the right belt and select a speed configuration that is biased towards that experienced in adaptation, perceiving this as “equal speeds” (the right speed is intermediate between the adaptation right speed and the target left speed at the end of the “after adapt” task). The key result is that participants walk with near-zero step length asymmetry at this configuration (“after adapt”, bottom row).</p>
<p>This suggests that participants may have learned to walk symmetrically at two distinct speed configurations: the adaptation configuration, and the configuration that they perceive as “equal speeds”. As illustrated in a later section (Results: Experiment 1 – Motor paradigm and hypotheses), this flexible behavior may be indicative of stimulus-response mapping mechanisms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Rossi et al. asked whether gait adaptation is solely a matter of slow perceptual realignment or if it also involves fast/flexible stimulus-response mapping mechanisms. To test this, they conducted a series of split-belt treadmill experiments with ramped perturbations, revealing behavior indicative of a flexible, automatic stimulus-response mapping mechanism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study includes a perceptual test of leg speed, which correlates with the perceptual realignment component of motor aftereffects. This indicates that there are motor performances that are not accounted for by perceptual re-alignment.</p>
<p>(2) They study incorporates qualitatively distinct, hypothesis-driven models of adaptation and proposes a new framework that integrates these various mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The study could benefit from considering other alternative models. As the authors noted in their discussion, while the descriptive models explain some patterns of behaviour/aftereffects, they don't currently account for how these mechanisms influence the initial learning process itself.</p>
<p>a. For example, the pattern of gait asymmetric might differ for perceptual realignment (a smooth, gradual process), structural learning (more erratic, involving hypothesis testing/reasoning to understand the perturbation, see (Tsay et al. 2024) for a recent review on Reasoning), and stimulus-response mapping (possibly through a reinforcement based trial-and-error approach). If not formally doing a model comparison, the manuscript might benefit from clearly laying out the behavioural predictions for how these different processes shape initial learning.</p>
<p>b. Related to the above, the authors noted that the absence of difference during initial learning suggests that the differences in Experiment 2 in the ramp-up phase are driven by two distinct processes: structural learning and memory-based processes. If the assumptions about initial learning are not clear, this logic of this conclusion is hard to follow.</p>
<p>c. The authors could also test a variant of the dual-rate state-space model with two perceptual realignment processes where the constraints on retention and learning rate are relaxed. This model would be a stronger test for two perceptual re-alignment processes: one that is flexible and another that is rigid, without mandating that one be fast learning and fast forgetting, and the other be slow learning and slow forgetting.</p>
<p>(2) The authors claim that stimulus-response mapping operates outside of explicit/deliberate control. While this could be true, the survey questions may have limitations that could be more clearly acknowledged.</p>
<p>a. Specifically, asking participants at the end of the experiments to recall their strategies may suffer from memory biases (e.g., participants may be biased by recent events, and forget about the explicit strategies early in the experiment), be susceptible to the framing of the questions (e.g., participants not being sure what the experimenter is asking and how to verbalize their own strategy), and moreover, not clear what is the category of explicit strategies one might enact here which dictates what might be considered &quot;relevant&quot; and &quot;accurate&quot;.</p>
<p>b. The concept of perceptual realignment also suggests that participants are somewhat aware of the treadmill's changing conditions; therefore, as a thought experiment, if the authors have asked participants throughout/during the experiment whether they are trying different strategies, would they predict that some behaviour is under deliberate control?</p>
<p>(3) The distinction between structural and memory-based differences in the two subgroups was based on the notion that memory-based strategies increase asymmetry. However, an alternative explanation could be that unfamiliar perturbations, due to the ramping up, trigger a surprise signal that leads to greater asymmetry due to reactive corrections to prevent one's fall - not because participants are generalizing from previously learned representations (e.g., (Iturralde &amp; Torres-Oviedo, 2019)).</p>
<p>Further contextualization:</p>
<p>Recognizing the differences in dependent variables (reaching position vs. leg speed/symmetry in walking), could the Proprioceptive/Perceptual Re-alignment model also apply to gait adaptation (Tsay et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024)? Recent reaching studies show a similar link between perception and action during motor adaptation (Tsay et al., 2021) and have proposed a model aligning with the authors' correlations between perception and action. The core signal driving implicit adaptation is the discrepancy between perceived and desired limb position, integrating forward model predictions with proprioceptive/visual feedback.</p>

<p>Recent findings in the field of motor learning have pointed to the combined action of multiple mechanisms that potentially contribute to changes in motor output during adaptation. A nearly ubiquitous motor learning process occurs via the trial-by-trial compensation of motor errors, often attributed to cerebellar-dependent updating. This error-based learning process is slow and largely unconscious. Additional learning processes that are rapid (e.g., explicit strategy-based compensation) have been described in discrete movements like goal-directed reaching adaptation. However, the role of rapid motor updating during continuous movements such as walking has been either under-explored or inconsistent with those found during the adaptation of discrete movements. Indeed, previous results have largely discounted the role of explicit strategy-based mechanisms for locomotor learning. In the current manuscript, Rossi et al. provide convincing evidence for a previously unknown rapid updating mechanism for locomotor adaptation. Unlike the now well-studied explicit strategies employed during reaching movements, the authors demonstrate that this stimulus-response mapping process is largely unconscious. The authors show that in approximately half of subjects, the mapping process appears to be memory-based while the remainder of subjects appear to perform structural learning of the task design. The participants that learned using a structural approach had the capability to rapidly generalize to previously unexplored regions of the perturbation space.</p>
<p>One result that will likely be particularly important to the field of motor learning is the authors' quite convincing correlation between the magnitude of proprioceptive recalibration and the magnitude error-based updating. This result beautifully parallels results in other motor learning tasks and appears to provide a robust marker for the magnitude of the mapping process (by means of subtracting off the contribution of error-based motor learning). This is a fascinating result with implications for the motor learning field well beyond the current study.</p>
<p>A major strength of this manuscript is the large sample size across experiments and the extent of replication performed by the authors in multiple control experiments.</p>
<p>Finally, I commend the authors on extending their original observations via Experiment 2. While it seems that participants use a range of mapping mechanisms (or indeed a combination of multiple mapping mechanisms), future experiments may be able to tease apart why some subjects use memory versus structural mapping. A future ability to push subjects to learn structurally-based mapping rules has the potential to inform rehabilitation strategies.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well written, the results are clear, and the data and analyses are convincing. The manuscript's weaknesses are minor, mostly related to the presentation of the results and modeling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The overall weaknesses in the manuscript are minor and can likely be addressed with textual changes.</p>
<p>(1) A key aspect of the experimental design is the speed of the &quot;ramp down&quot; following the adaptation period. If the ramp-down is too slow, then no after-effects would be expected even in the alternative recalibration-only/error-based only hypothesis. How did the authors determine the appropriate rate of ramp-down? Do alternative choices of ramp-down rates result in step length asymmetry measures that are consistent with the mapping hypothesis?</p>
<p>(2) Overall, the modeling as presented in Figure 3 (Equation 1-3) is a bit convoluted. To my mind, it would be far more useful if the authors reworked Equations 1-3 and Figure 3 (with potential changes to Figure 2) so that the motor output (u) is related to the stride rather than the magnitude of the perturbation. There should be an equation relating the forward model recalibration (i.e., Equation 1) to the fraction of the motor error on a given stride, something akin to u(k+1) = r * (u(k) - p(k)). This formulation is easier to understand and commonplace in other motor learning tasks (and likely what the authors actually fit given the Smith &amp; Shadmehr citation and the derivations in the Supplemental Materials). Such a change would require that Figure 3's independent axes be changed to &quot;stride,&quot; but this has the benefit of complementing the presentation that is already in Figure 5.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Rossi et al. use a novel split-belt treadmill learning task to reveal distinct sub-components of gait adaptation. The task involved following a standard adaptation phase with a &quot;ramp-down&quot; phase that helped them dissociate implicit recalibration and more deliberate SR map learning. Combined with modeling and re-analysis of previous studies, the authors show multiple lines of evidence that both processes run simultaneously, with implicit learning saturating based on intrinsic learning constraints and SR learning showing sensitivity to a &quot;perceptual&quot; error. These results offer a parallel with work in reaching adaptation showing both explicit and implicit processes contributing to behavior; however, in the case of gait adaptation the deliberate learning component does not appear to be strategic but is instead a more implicit SR learning processes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The task design is very clever and the &quot;ramp down&quot; phase offers a novel way to attempt to dissociate competing models of multiple processes in gait adaptation.</p>
<p>(2) The analyses are thorough, as is the re-analysis of multiple previous data sets.</p>
<p>(3) The querying of perception of the different relative belt speeds is a very nice addition, allowing the authors to connect different learning components with error perception.</p>
<p>(4) The conceptual framework is compelling, highlighting parallels with work in reaching but also emphasizing differences, especially w/r/t SR learning versus strategic behaviors. Thus the discovery of an SR learning process in gait adaptation would be both novel and also help conjoin different siloed subfields of motor learning research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The behavior in the ramp-down phase does indeed appear to support multiple learning processes. However, I may have missed something, but I have a fundamental worry about the specific modeling and framing of the &quot;SR&quot; learning process. If I correctly understand, the SR process learns by adjusting to perceived L/R belt speed differences (Figure 7). What is bugging me is why that process would not cause the SR system to still learn something in the later parts of the ramp-down phase when the perceived speed differences flip (Figure 4). I do believe this &quot;blunted learning&quot; is what the SR component is actually modeled with, given this quote in the caption to Figure 7: &quot;When the perturbation is perceived to be opposite than adaptation, even if it is not, mapping is zero and the Δ motor output is constant, reflecting recalibration adjustments only.&quot; It seems a priori odd and perhaps a little arbitrary to me that a SR learning system would just stop working (go to zero) just because the perception flipped sign. Or for that matter &quot;generalize&quot; to a ramp-up (i.e., just learn a new SR mapping just like the system did at the beginning of the first perturbation). What am I missing that justifies this key assumption? Or is the model doing something else? (if so that should be more clearly described).</p>
<p>(2) A more minor point, but given the sample size it is hard to be convinced about the individual difference analysis for structure learning (Figure 5). How clear is it that these two groups of subjects are fully separable and not on a continuum? The lack of clusters in another data set seems like a somewhat less than convincing control here.</p>
