<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is the most common form of spinal deformity with unclear pathogenesis. In this study, we firstly reanalyzed the loci associated with IS, drawing upon previous studies. Subsequently, we mapped these loci to candidate genes using either location-based or function-based strategies. To further substantiate our findings, we verified the enrichment of variants within these candidate genes across several large IS cohorts encompassing Chinese, East Asian, and European populations. Consequently, we identified variants in the <italic>EPHA4</italic> gene as compelling candidates for IS. To confirm their pathogenicity, we generated zebrafish mutants of <italic>epha4a</italic>. Remarkably, the zebrafish <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants exhibited pronounced scoliosis during later stages of development, effectively recapitulating the IS phenotype. We observed that the <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants displayed defects in left-right coordination during locomotion, which arose from disorganized neural activation in these mutants. Our subsequent experiments indicated that the disruption of the central pattern generator (CPG) network, characterized by abnormal axon guidance of spinal cord interneurons, contributed to the disorganization observed in the mutants. Moreover, when knocked down <italic>efnb3b</italic>, the ligand for Epha4a, we observed similar CPG defects and disrupted left-right locomotion. These findings strongly suggested that ephrin B3-Epha4 signaling is vital for the proper functioning of CPGs, and defects in this pathway could lead to scoliosis in zebrafish. Furthermore, we identified two cases of IS in <italic>NGEF</italic>, a downstream molecule in the EPHA4 pathway. Collectively, our data provide compelling evidence that neural patterning impairments and disruptions in CPGs may underlie the pathogenesis of IS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is the most common form of spinal deformity, affecting about 2.5% of the global population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hresko, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Luk et al., 2010</xref>). IS may have long-term physical and mental health consequences, such as cosmetic deformity, cardiopulmonary impairment, and even disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Weinstein et al., 2003</xref>). All these consequences can severely reduce the quality of life. Early intervention with conservative treatments, such as braces, can control scoliosis progression and reduce the need for surgical intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Weinstein et al., 2013</xref>). However, IS often remains undiagnosed until malformation is evident, emphasizing the importance of risk-prediction measurements in medical management.</p>
<p>Genetic factors are thought to play a significant role in the development of IS, while only a few genes have been associated with the condition to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Miller, 2007</xref>). Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with susceptibility to IS have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), including SNPs linked to genes such as <italic>LBX1</italic>, <italic>GPR126</italic>, and <italic>BNC2</italic>. Notably, knockdown or overexpression of zebrafish homologs of these IS-associated genes have yielded body axis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ogura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to common SNPs, rare variants with larger effect sizes or causing rare Mendelian disease traits also contribute to IS. Rare variants in <italic>FBN1</italic>, <italic>FBN2,</italic> and other extracellular matrix genes are associated with severe IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buchan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haller et al., 2016</xref>). Linkage analysis of familial IS suggests that it follows autosomal dominant (AD), X-linked dominant, and multifactorial patterns of inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miller et al., 2005</xref>). Variants in <italic>CHD7</italic> and <italic>AKAP2</italic> are also implicated in the pathogenesis of Mendelian forms of IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liebeskind et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, centriolar protein POC5 and planar cell polarity protein Vang-like protein 1 (VANGL1) were also shown to be associated with IS. Notably, all these genes participate in a wide range of biological processes, the mechanisms underlying IS progression still require further investigation. Consequently, there is currently no consensus on the etiology of IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tang et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we developed a novel pipeline that combines SNP-to-gene mapping and rare variant association analysis. Using this approach, we analyzed a large Chinese population with IS and further validated our findings in East Asian and European populations. Through these analyses, we identified <italic>EPHA4</italic> as a novel gene associated with IS. To confirm the pathogenicity of this gene, we used a zebrafish model and found that impaired EPHA4 pathway components and resulting defects in central pattern generators (CPGs) were associated with asymmetric spinal locomotion, which may serve as a contributory factor in the development of IS. Additionally, we searched for candidate genes related to EPHA4 signaling pathways and identified mutations in the <italic>NGEF</italic> among IS patients. Overall, our data suggest that the impairment of the EPHA4 pathway and central pattern generators plays a previously unknown role in the development and progression of IS.</p>

<title>Enrichment analysis of rare variants in IS candidate genes</title>
<p>To identify candidate genes associated with IS, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of SNPs that are linked to IS from 14 published GWASs. This led us to obtain forty-one SNPs that showed genome-wide significance (P &lt; 5×10<sup>−8</sup>) as detailed in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>. We then employed positional mapping, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, or chromatin interaction mapping to identify 156 candidate genes that could be potentially linked to these SNPs. Further analysis of rare variants for the 156 candidate genes using exome data from 411 Chinese probands and 3,800 unrelated Chinese controls identified <italic>EPHA4</italic> as the only significant gene (P=0.045, OR=4.09) (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). EPHA4 is a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases which play a vital role in the development of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kania and Klein, 2016</xref>). We identified three rare variants in <italic>EPHA4</italic> from three IS patients, including one splicing-donor variant and two missense variants (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). The flowchart of the entire pipeline is shown in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Inheritance pattern and functional analyses of variants in <italic>EPHA4</italic></title>
<p>We characterized the inheritance pattern of variants in <italic>EPHA4</italic> using either trio sequencing data or Sanger sequencing for the parents. None of the parents being tested had scoliosis based on a clinical screening test. Of the three rare variants in <italic>EPHA4</italic>, two (NM_004438.3: c.1443+1G&gt;C and c.2546G&gt;A [p.Cys849Tyr]) arose <italic>de novo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The heterozygous splicing variant (c.1443+1G&gt;C) was identified in a female IS patient (SCO2003P0846) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Scoliosis in this patient was diagnosed in her 10s, with a main curve Cobb angle of 60°. The <italic>in vitro</italic> minigene assay showed that the c.1443+1G&gt;C variant introduced a new splicing site, resulting in a 36-bp in-frame deletion in exon 6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G, 1I</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2A</xref>). The <italic>EPHA4</italic> heterozygous missense variant (c.2546G&gt;A, p.Cys849Tyr), identified in a female IS patient (SCO2003P2146) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), is located in the protein tyrosine kinase domain of EPHA4 protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The onset of scoliosis in this patient was in her 10s with a 70° main curve Cobb angle. Given the critical role of EPHA4 in phosphorylating CDK5, which in turn activates downstream signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fu et al., 2007</xref>), a western blot analysis of <italic>EPHA4</italic>-c.2546G&gt;A variant was conducted to investigate the protein expression levels of EPHA4 and CDK5 and the amount of phosphorylated CDK5 (pCDK5) in HEK293T cells transfected with <italic>EPHA4</italic>-mutant or <italic>EPHA4</italic>-WT plasmid. Our results revealed that the missense variant resulted in a decreased phosphorylation level of CDK5 (p=0.015), suggesting a partial loss-of-function (LoF) of <italic>EPHA4</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<p>We next investigated <italic>de novo</italic> non-coding variants of <italic>EPHA4</italic> via whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 116 trio families with IS. A <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous <italic>EPHA4</italic> intronic variant (c.1318+10344A&gt;G) was identified in a female patient (SCO2003P2080) in an age range of 15-20 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). She developed scoliosis in her 10s with a 70° main curve Cobb angle. This variant is predicted to affect the branch point of the fifth intron of <italic>EPHA4</italic> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). We performed nested PCR to show that this variant induced exon 5 skipping, resulting in a 339-bp in-frame deletion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H, J</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we employed an in-house gene matching approach under the framework of DISCO study, which identified a patient (SCO2003P3202) in an age range of 5-10, who had been previously diagnosed with Waardenburg syndrome caused by a 4.46 Mb <italic>de novo</italic> deletion at 2q35-q36.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Intriguingly, the patient also presented mild scoliosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The deletion included the entire <italic>PAX3</italic> gene, which was responsible for the Waardenburg syndrome phenotype, and 36 neighboring genes, including <italic>EPHA4</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). As scoliosis is not typically associated with Waardenburg syndrome caused solely by <italic>PAX3</italic> pathogenic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tassabehji et al., 1993</xref>), we hypothesize that the deletion of <italic>EPHA4</italic> may be responsible for the IS phenotype in this patient. Notably, the patient IDs used in this study are unique to our research group and will not be recognizable to anyone outside the research team, including hospital staff and the patients themselves.</p>
<p>Notably, the GWAS signal which we mapped to <italic>EPHA4</italic> (rs13398147) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>) represents a significant eQTL in esophagus and colon tissues, with the T allele associated with decreased expression of <italic>EPHA4</italic>. In our East Asian GWAS cohort of 6,449 adolescent IS patients and 158,068 controls, we identified another two eQTLs in <italic>EPHA4</italic> associated with decreased expression of <italic>EPHA4</italic> in brain tissue (Table S3). In the same GWAS cohort, common SNPs in <italic>EPHA4</italic>, after aggregation, also showed significant enrichment (P=0.023) in IS patients versus controls. Taken together, the convergence between rare and common variants of <italic>EPHA4</italic> that lead to LoF or hypomorphic effects highlights the pivotal role of <italic>EPHA4</italic> in the pathogenesis of IS.</p>

<title>IS-like phenotypes in zebrafish <italic>epha4</italic> mutants</title>
<p>To investigate the role of <italic>EPHA4</italic> in scoliosis, we utilized zebrafish as a model system due to its versatile nature in modeling adolescent IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bagnat and Gray, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boswell and Ciruna, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Grimes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Xie et al., 2022</xref>). Zebrafish have two homologs of <italic>EPHA4</italic>, <italic>epha4a</italic> and <italic>epha4b</italic>. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we established a stable <italic>epha4a</italic> zebrafish mutant line with a 63-bp deletion in exon 3, which introduced a stop codon and resulted in a truncated protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). The homozygous <italic>epha4a</italic> mutant larvae had no apparent defects in either notochord or body axis development (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, the hindbrain rhombomeric boundaries were found to be defective in both the <italic>epha4a</italic> homozygous mutants and morphants (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cayuso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cooke et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, more than 75% adult mutants showed mild scoliosis (88 of 116), and some mutants exhibited severe scoliotic phenotype (4 of 116) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>, Movie S1&amp;S2). Remarkably, some heterozygous adult mutants also developed mild scoliosis (14 of 95), whereas none of the wild-type fish showed any signs of scoliosis (0 of 76) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). Similarly, we further generated the <italic>epha4b</italic> mutants with a 25-bp deletion in exon 3, which resulted in a frameshift mutation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). The <italic>epha4b</italic> zebrafish mutants also developed mild scoliosis (28 of 43) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B-C</xref>). Intriguingly, both <italic>epha4a</italic> and <italic>epha4b</italic> mutants exhibited early onset scoliosis starting from around 20 days post fertilization (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D</xref>), a stage similar to that of IS patients. Collectively, these data suggest that mutations in Epha4 proteins are linked to the scoliotic phenotype in zebrafish.</p>

<title>Abnormal left-right swimming pattern in the absence of Epha4a</title>
<p>While the <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants seemed to be grossly normal during the larvae stages, they developed spinal curvature gradually during later development. We decided to investigate whether these mutants exhibited any abnormalities in their behavior at the larvae stages using EthoVision XT software. By monitoring the swimming behavior of 8 days post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae, we found the motion distance and swimming velocity were significantly decreased in <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). In addition, we observed a remarkable difference in the relative turning angle and angular velocity between these two groups. The wild-type group changed their swimming direction randomly, showing a relative angle around 0 degrees (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants favored turning to one side of their directions (a positive angle reflects a leftward turn) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). Moreover, the absolute turn angles and turning speed (angular velocity) were significantly higher in these mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-F</xref>). To rule out potential off-target effects, we injected <italic>epha4a</italic> mRNA into <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants, which significantly restored the swimming coordination defects (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we compared the swimming behavior after startle response between wild-type and <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants. We used a needle to touch the head or the tail of 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae to stimulate swimming behavior. In sibling controls, the larvae responded to the tactile stimulation and swam away quickly (Movie S3). Conversely, the <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants failed to respond to the initial stimulation, and the swimming pattern was defective with an abnormal bending pattern (37 of 62 from tail-stimulation group and 34 of 77 from head-stimulation group) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, Movie S4). We further performed more comprehensive analysis by high-speed video microscopy. After tactile stimulation, wild-type larvae displayed a high-speed C-bend turn followed by a weaker counterbend turn after several milliseconds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H-I</xref>). This rhythmic left/right swimming pattern ensures that the fish swim away from the frightening stimulus. The turning angles of the control larvae after stimulation changed with a sinusoidal wave pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>). In contrast, this pattern was dramatically different in <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I,K</xref>). Of note, although the C-bend turning angles were similar between <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants and control siblings, the turning angles of the counterbend decreased significantly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>), implying a left/right coordination defect. Taken together, both regular swimming and tactile stimulation analyses suggested that the left-right coordination swimming pattern is compromised in the absence of Epha4a.</p>

<title>Defects of left-right coordination due to abnormal CPG in the absence of Epha4a</title>
<p>The coordinated left-right locomotion of zebrafish larvae relies on the synchronized contraction of muscle fibers, a process regulated by motor neurons situated on each side of the fish. To explore this intricate mechanism, we utilized a Tg(<italic>elavl3</italic>:GAL4; <italic>UAS</italic>: GCaMP) double transgene, allowing the expression of a genetically encoded calcium sensor in all neurons. We observed the rhythmic activation of calcium signaling in motor neurons located within the spinal cord (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>, Movie S5, Movie S6). In wild-type larvae, the calcium signals exhibited an alternating pattern between the left and right sides of the body, whereas this coordinated pattern was disrupted in both <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants and morphants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref> vs A’-B’, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A-B</xref> vs A’-B’, Movie S7, Movie S8). Additionally, we found that the activation frequency of motor neurons on the left and right sides was comparable in wild-type larvae, but significantly different in the absence of Epha4a (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C-D</xref>).</p>

<p>One well-established concept regarding left-right coordination involves the presence of central pattern generators (CPGs), which are regulated by interneuron circuitry within the spinal cord. We further examined the axon guidance of interneurons in <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants. First, we investigated the commissural trajectories of reticulospinal (RS) interneurons. In control larvae, the large Mauthner neurons, along with other RS neurons, were symmetrically positioned on each side of the midline and projected their axons to the contralateral sides (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). These bilaterally projected axons typically crossed at the midline and subsequently synapsed on motoneurons of the opposite sides, contributing to the generation of spinal cord neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hale et al., 2016</xref>). However, in <italic>epha4a</italic> mutant larvae, we observed an abnormal pattern in axonal projections.

<p>Cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs) represent a unique type of interneuron responsible for modulating the V0 and V2a interneurons, which are integral components of locomotor CPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fidelin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). In wild-type larvae, we observed that the ascending axons of these neurons projected either to the right or left side from the midline, as visualized using Tg(<italic>pkd2l1</italic>:GAL4;<italic>UAS</italic>:Kaede) double transgenic larvae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, in the absence of Epha4a, the projection of these neurons exhibited notable disorganization, with numerous axons crossing the midline from one side of the trunk. This disorganized pattern was observed in both heterozygotic and homozygotic mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-B</xref>). Additionally, we employed an optogenetic approach to activate these CSF-cNs, utilizing the Tg(Gal4<sup>s1020t</sup>; <italic>UAS</italic>:ChR2) double transgene. Following optical stimulation, we observed robust tail oscillations as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wyart et al., 2009</xref>). In wild-type larvae, these tail oscillations exhibited a symmetrical left-right beating pattern(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C-D</xref>, Movie S9). However, a striking disruption of this symmetry was observed in <italic>epha4a</italic> morphants, as they consistently beat towards one side of the trunk following optical stimulation (a positive angle reflects a rightward turn) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>’-D’ and E, Movie S10). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the left-right coordination deficiencies observed in <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants arise from abnormal neural circuit formation, which consequently disrupts the integrity of the CPGs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>IS is a disease with diverse causes, and the underlying mechanisms can vary even among patients with similar scoliotic phenotypes. Previous genetic studies have highlighted the significance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in maintaining the balance of axial bone and supporting soft tissues in the spine, thus playing a crucial role in IS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haller et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the top SNP associated with IS maps to <italic>LBX1</italic>, an essential molecule for ECM maintenance and bone homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, genetic loci in muscle development-related genes have also been associated with the onset of scoliosis, emphasizing the intricate interaction between bones and muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ogura et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is worth noting that the variants in these genes explain only a small fraction of the overall heritability of IS. Consequently, it is imperative to establish connections between the extensive genetic findings and biological mechanisms that can elucidate the etiological landscape of IS.</p>
<p>In this study, we mapped 41 significant genome-wide loci to functional genes through positional mapping and functional mapping such as eQTL. Then we determined the enrichment in patient cohorts of rare variants in these genes, which may have greater impacts compared with common SNPs. This approach revealed the convergence of SNPs and rare variants in <italic>EPHA4</italic> that are enriched in patients with IS. We also identified additional high-impact variants in <italic>NGEF</italic>, which is involved in the EPHA4 pathway.</p>
<p>Our studies using zebrafish have revealed that deficiency of Epha4 can lead to the development of scoliosis. Interestingly, we observed that even heterozygotic <italic>epha4a</italic> zebrafish mutants displayed mild scoliosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), which is consistent with the occurrence of this condition in scoliosis patients. Further analysis involving behavior and imaging demonstrated that the absence of Epha4a resulted in defective left-right coordination. This coordination is crucially governed by CPGs, which generate rhythmic patterns of neural activity to coordinate limb movements on both sides of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kiehn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies have reported the involvement of ephrin and its receptors in axon guidance during the maturation of neural circuits, including CPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andersson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Borgius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Iwasato et al., 2007</xref>). Ephrin B3, present in radial glial cells at the dorsal midline, serves as a repulsive barrier to axons expressing Epha4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Imondi et al., 2000</xref>). Axon guidance is disrupted when this repulsive pathway is inactivated, leading to midline invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Butt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kullander et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Paixão et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Epha4</italic> and <italic>Efnb3</italic> knockout mice, a ‘hopping’ gait is observed, which is attributed to the aberrant crossing of motor neurons expressing Epha4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kullander et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with these observations, we observed disrupted axon guidance in the interneurons, which are integral components of CPGs, in both <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants and <italic>efnb3b</italic> morphants. This finding suggests that CPG malfunction may be a significant contributing factor to the scoliosis phenotype observed in these genetic backgrounds. It is highly likely that the lack of coordinated left-right locomotion generates imbalanced mechanical forces on the spine, gradually leading to spinal curvature during later stages of development (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>The proposed mechanism of IS mediated by <italic>EPHA4</italic> dysfunction.</title>
<p>In healthy individuals, EphrinB3-activated EPHA4 phosphorylates CDK5, leading to the phosphorylation of Ephexin, a protein encoded by NGEF. Phosphorylated Ephexin can regulate axon guidance through either activating RHOA or suppressing CDC42 and RAC1 signaling. These processes are critical to maintain the normal function of the CPG, the local neural network that provides coordinated bilateral muscle control. Impairment of the EPHA4 pathway and CPG may cause an imbalance of the motor drive from the spinal cord during development, thus causing the uncoordinated left/right swimming behavior in zebrafish larvae and the asymmetry of the bilateral muscular pull in a young child. Although the appearance is normal in early childhood, the dysfunction produces a scoliotic curve during the growth spurt.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Thus, our data provided a novel biological mechanism of IS, i.e., the impairment of neural patterning and CPG. Previous studies have provided clues on the role of CPGs in IS. Patients with adolescent IS showed asymmetric trunk movement during gait, as characterized by increased relative forward rotation of the right upper body in relation to the pelvis (Kramers-de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Quervain et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nishida et al., 2017</xref>). An electromyography (EMG) study also showed asymmetric activation of paraspinal muscles between the convex and concave sides at the scoliosis curve apex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shimode et al., 2003</xref>). In a child with a strong family history of IS, asymmetric hyperactivity was observed by EMG months before scoliosis was evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Valentino et al., 1985</xref>). These left-right locomotor coordination abnormalities indicated the maldevelopment of CPGs as potential cause of IS. The CPG asymmetry may induce an imbalance in trunk muscle strength, resulting in asymmetric rib drooping. This leads to an abnormal vertebral rotation and then the onset of IS. Moreover, in a companion study, Wang et al. identified a number of rare variants in <italic>SLC6A9</italic>, which encodes glycine transporter 1 (GLYT1), in familial and sporadic adolescent IS cases. The <italic>slc6a9</italic> mutant zebrafish also exhibited discoordination of spinal neural activities with pronounced lateral spinal curvature, recapitulating the human IS phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). Taken together, we propose that the dysfunction of CPGs would cause an imbalance in the motor drive from the spinal cord and the asymmetric transversospinalis muscle pull, eventually producing a scoliotic curve (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our study demonstrates that both common and rare variants within the EPHA4 pathway contribute to the genetic architecture of IS. EPHA4 pathway dysfunction causes axon pathfinding defects, resulting in impaired coordinated left-right locomotion by disrupting neural patterning and the function of CPGs, thereby potentially leading to IS.</p>

<title>Rare variant association analysis of the candidate genes</title>

<p>The splicing variant (<italic>EPHA4:</italic> c.1443+1G&gt;C) was characterized by a minigene assay. Genomic DNA from the heterozygous patient was amplified by PCR using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Amplicons included exon 6, intron 6, exon 7, intron 7, and exon 8 of the <italic>EPHA4</italic> gene. PCR products were cloned into the vector via the restriction sites BamHI and MluI for pCAS2, which is based on the pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Clones with wild-type or mutant genomic inserts were selected and verified by sequencing the cloned DNA fragments. The recombinant plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using LipofectamineTM 3000 reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For RT-qPCR, total RNA was isolated from the transfected cells using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA and reverse transcription was performed using the GoScript™ Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, MI, USA). PCR amplification was performed using the pCAS2-RT-F and pCAS2-RT-R primers, and the products were sequenced using pCAS2-RT-F.</p>
<p>Primers sequences for the minigene assay were as follows:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is a common spinal deformity. Various studies have linked genes to IS, but underlying mechanisms are unclear such that we still lack understanding of the causes of IS. The current manuscript analyzes IS patient populations and identified EPHA4 as a novel associated gene, finding three rare variants in EPHA4 from three patients (one disrupting splicing and two missense variants) as well as a large deletion (encompassing EPHA4) in a Waardenburg syndrome patient with scoliosis. EPHA4 is a member of the Eph receptor family. Drawing on data from zebrafish experiments, the authors argue that EPHA4 loss of function disrupts central pattern generator (CPG) function necessary for motor coordination.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of this manuscript is the human genetic data, which provide convincing evidence linking EPHA4 variants to IS. The loss of function experiments in zebrafish strongly support the conclusion that EPHA4 variants that reduce function lead to IS.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusion that disruption of CPG function causes spinal curves in the zebrafish model is not fully supported. The authors' final model is that a disrupted CPG leads to asymmetric mechanical loading on the spine and, over time, the development of curves. This is a reasonable idea, but currently not strongly backed up by data in the manuscript. Potentially, the impaired larval movements simply coincide with, but do not cause, juvenile-onset scoliosis. Support for the authors' conclusion would require independent methods of disrupting CPG function and determining if this is accompanied by spine curvature. Nevertheless, the data showing correlations between spine curvature and abnormal neural patterning, neuronal firing, and swimming in eph4a loss-of-function mutant larvae are sound.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I think the authors misunderstood my point about genetic nomenclature for the zebrafish alleles. The nomenclature guidelines are described at ZFIN, and ZFIN will ask for appropriate allele designations.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Joint Public Review:</bold></p>
<p>Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is a common spinal deformity. Various studies have linked genes to IS, but underlying mechanisms are unclear such that we still lack understanding of the causes of IS. The current manuscript analyzes IS patient populations and identifies EPHA4 as a novel associated gene, finding three rare variants in EPHA4 from three patients (one disrupting splicing and two missense variants) as well as a large deletion (encompassing EPHA4) in a Waardenburg syndrome patient with scoliosis. EPHA4 is a member of the Eph receptor family. Drawing on data from zebrafish experiments, the authors argue that EPHA4 loss of function disrupts the central pattern generator (CPG) function necessary for motor coordination.</p>
<p>The main strength of this manuscript is the human genetic data, which provides convincing evidence linking EPHA4 variants to IS. The loss of function experiments in zebrafish strongly support the conclusion that EPHA4 variants that reduce function lead to IS.</p>
<p>The conclusion that disruption of CPG function causes spinal curves in the zebrafish model is not well supported. The authors' final model is that a disrupted CPG leads to asymmetric mechanical loading on the spine and, over time, the development of curves. This is a reasonable idea, but currently not strongly backed up by data in the manuscript. Potentially, the impaired larval movements simply coincide with, but do not cause, juvenile-onset scoliosis. Support for the authors' conclusion would require independent methods of disrupting CPG function and determining if this is accompanied by spine curvature. At a minimum, the language of the manuscript could be toned down, with the CPG defects put forward as a potential explanation for scoliosis in the discussion rather than as something this manuscript has &quot;shown&quot;. An additional weakness of the manuscript is that the zebrafish genetic tools are not sufficiently validated to provide full confidence in the data and conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We highly appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments and the acknowledgment of the main values of our study. We agree with the reviewer that further experiments are needed to fully establish the relationship between CPG and scoliosis. In response, we have revised the conclusion in the manuscript to better reflect this. Additionally, we conducted further analyses on the mutants to provide additional evidence supporting this concept.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Epha4a mutant zebrafish exhibited mild spinal curves, mostly laterally and in the tail. This was 75% of homozyous mutants but also, surprisingly, about 20% of heterozygotes. epha4b mutants also developed some mild scoliosis. If the two zebrafish paralogs can compensate for each other (partial redundancy), we might expect more severe scoliosis in double mutants. Did the authors generate and analyze double mutants? I believe it would be very useful for this study to report the zebrafish phenotype of loss of both paralogs together.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment regarding the potential value of reporting the phenotype of <italic>eph4a/eph4b</italic> double mutants. While we fully agree that this analysis would be valuable, our attempts to generate double mutants have been unsuccessful. These two genes are closely linked on the chromosome, with less than 100 kb separating them, which makes it challenging to generate double mutants through standard genetic crossing. Establishing a double mutant line would require more than a year due to the technical constraints of the process. Although we are unable to address this question directly at this time, we hypothesize that <italic>eph4a/eph4b</italic> double mutants may exhibit a higher likelihood of body axis abnormalities based on the phenotypes observed in single mutants and the known functions of these genes.</p>
<p>We hope this perspective will provide some useful context despite the limitations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 1F, a pCDK5 western blot is performed as a readout of EPH4A signaling after either WT or C849Y mutant EPH4A is transfected into HEK 293T cells. It would be useful to mention in the text, or at least the figure legend, how this experiment was performed/where the protein samples came from. It is included in the methods, but in the main text, it simply says &quot;we conducted western blotting&quot; without mentioning whether the protein samples were from cell lines, patients, or another source.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry for our ignorance. A detailed description of the western blotting conduction was supplemented at both “results” part (page 8, line 187-190) and the Figure 1 legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Was the relative turn angle biased to the left or right side of the fish? (i.e. is a positive angle a rightward or leftward turn?)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for our unclear description. In Figure 3D, positive angle means turning left, while negative angle means turning right. In wild-type larvae, the average turning angle over a 4-minute period is approximately 0, whereas in mutants, this value deviates from 0, indicating a directional preference (positive for leftward and negative for rightward turns) in swimming behavior during the recording period. We have also made the necessary supplementation in the text and figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 4, morpholinos rather than mutants are used, but it is not clear why. Has it been established that the MO used disrupts gene function specifically? Can the effect of the MO be rescued by expressing a wild-type mRNA of Epha4a? Does MO knockdown induce spinal curves if fish are raised? Indeed, this could be a way to determine whether the spinal curves are caused by early events in development (when MOs are active).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comments. The efficacy of relevant MOs has been well-documented in numerous previous studies (Addison et al., 2018; Cavodeassi et al., 2013; Letelier et al., 2018; Royet et al., 2017). Following this reviewer’s suggestion, we have raised the <italic>epha4a</italic> morphants into adults, while no scoliosis were observed, suggesting that the spinal curvature formation may be induced by long-term defects in the absence of Epha4a. Additionally, we reconfirmed the abnormal motor neuron activation frequency phenotype in the mutants background. The corresponding data have replaced the original Figure 4 in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Sorry for any inconvenience caused to the reviewers. Due to the size of the supplementary Table 3, we have separately uploaded an Excel file as supplementary materials. We have also double-checked during the resubmission process of the revised manuscript. Thanks for your thorough review.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors report only a single mutant allele for zebrafish epha4a and epha4b. Additionally, they provide no information about how many generations each allele has been outcrossed. The authors should provide some type of validation that the phenotypes they describe result from loss of function of the targeted gene and not from an off-targeting event.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comments. For <italic>epha4a</italic> and <italic>epha4b</italic> mutants, each homozygous mutant was initially derived from the self-crossing of first filial generation heterozygotes, and subsequent homozygous generations were maintained for fewer than three rounds of in-crossing. Interestingly, we observed a reduction in the incidence of scoliosis across successive generations. This trend may be attributed to potential genetic compensation mechanisms, which could mitigate the phenotypic severity over time. To address concerns about possible off-target effects, we synthesized and injected <italic>epha4a</italic> mRNA to test for phenotypic rescue. Our data show that <italic>epha4a</italic> mRNA injection partially restored swimming coordination in the mutants (Fig. S5). Moreover, similar motor coordination defects have been reported in Epha4-deficient mice, as documented in previous studies (Kullander et al., 2003; Borgius et al., 2014). These findings collectively strengthen the hypothesis that Epha4a plays a critical role in regulating motor coordination.</p>

<p>The three antisense morpholino oligonucleotides need to be validated for efficacy and specificity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comments. The morpholinos were extensively used and validated in previous studies, and the efficacy of these morpholinos has been thoroughly validated in multiple studies (Addison et al., 2018; Cavodeassi et al., 2013; Letelier et al., 2018; Royet et al., 2017). Furthermore, we also performed swimming behavior analysis in the mutant background, which showed similar results as the morphants. Moreover, we also performed rescue experiments to confirm the specificity of the mutants (Fig. S5). Finally, we reconfirmed the abnormal calcium signaling in the mutants (Fig. 4), which further support our previous knockdown results.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments and sorry for the unclear description, we have described this more clearly in our revised manuscript (page 9, line 229-230).</p>

<p>Animals frequently are described as &quot;heterozygous mutants&quot; or &quot;mutants&quot;. Please make clear that the latter are homozygous mutant animals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comments. In the manuscript, all references to mutants specifically indicate homozygous mutants. Heterozygous mutants are explicitly identified as such.</p>

<p>The chromatin interaction portion of the Methods does not include any information on how these experiments were conducted or where the data were obtained. This information needs to be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your advice. The detailed information of chromatin interaction mapping has been provided in “Methods and Materials” (page 18-19, line 450-455). Information about the interacting regions was derived from Hi-C datasets of 21 tissues and cell types provided by GSE87112. The significance of interactions for Hi-C datasets was computed by Fit-Hi-C, with an FDR ≤ 10-6 considered significant.</p>

<p>The authors present single-cell RNA-seq data in Supplementary Figure 5 for which they cite Cavone et al, 2021. This seems like an odd database to use. Can the authors provide an explanation for choosing it? In any case, the citation should also be made in the Supplementary Figure 5 legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your rigorous comment, we have cited this literature in the proper place of the revised manuscript. Cavone et al. used the <italic>her4.3</italic>:GFP line to label ependymo-radial glia (ERG) progenitor cells and performed single-cell RNA-seq on FACS-isolated fluorescent cells. The isolated cells included not only ERG progenitors but also undifferentiated and differentiated neurons and oligodendrocytes. The authors attributed this to the relative stability of the GFP protein, which remained in the progeny of GFP-expressing <italic>her4.3</italic>+ ERG progenitor cells, thus effectively acting as a short-term cell lineage tracer. Indeed, clustering analysis of this data successfully identifies neural progenitors and other neural clusters. Therefore, we consider that this scRNA-seq data encompasses a comprehensive range of neural cell types and is suitable for analyzing the expression of genes of interest. Furthermore, we downloaded and analyzed the scRNA-seq data of the zebrafish nervous system reported by Scott et al. in 2021 (Fig. S7B) (Scott et al., 2021). Despite differences in the developmental stages of the larvae analyzed (Cavone et al. examined larvae at 4 dpf, whereas Scott et al. analyzed larvae at 24, 36, and 48 hpf), our findings are consistent. Specifically, <italic>epha4a</italic> and <italic>epha4b</italic> are expressed in interneurons, whereas <italic>efnb3a</italic> and <italic>efnb3b</italic> are enriched in floor plate cells.</p>

<p>In Figure Legend 1, &quot;expressed from the EPHA4-mutant plasmid&quot; is not an accurate description of the experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry for the previous inaccurate description. The description has been revised to accurately reflect the experiment. “Western blot analysis of <italic>EPHA4</italic>-c.2546G&gt;A variant showing the protein expression levels of EPHA4 and CDK5 and the amount of phosphorylated CDK5 (pCDK5) in HEK293T cells transfected with <italic>EPHA4</italic>-mutant or <italic>EPHA4</italic>-WT plasmid”.</p>

<p>Figure 3 panels J and K need more explanation. I don't understand what the different colors represent nor do I understand what are wild type and what are mutant data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We apologize for the lack of clarity in the original figure legend. To address this, we have revised the legend of Figure 3 to provide a more detailed explanation. In panels J and K, each color-coded curve represents the response of an individual larva from an independent experimental trial to the stimulus. Specifically, panel J depicts the response data for the wild-type larvae, whereas panel K presents the response data for the homozygous <italic>epha4a</italic> mutants.</p>

<p>Epha4 and Efnb3 have well-established roles in axon guidance. Although this is noted in the Discussion, I think a more extensive description of prior findings would be helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks for your valuable feedback. A more detailed description of the roles of Epha4 and Efnb3 in axon guidance was provided in the “Discussion” (page 16, line 388-396).</p>

<p>The main conclusion of this manuscript is that EPHA4 variants cause IS by disrupting central pattern generator function. I think this is misleading. I think that the more valid conclusion is that EPHA4 loss of function causes axon pathfinding defects that impair locomotion by disrupting CPG activity, thereby leading to IS. I urge the authors to consider this more nuanced interpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments. We appreciate your suggestion to refine our main conclusion. We agree that the proposed revision more accurately reflects our findings and will revise the manuscript accordingly to state that “EPHA4 loss of function causes axon pathfinding defects, which impair locomotion by disrupting central pattern generator activity, potentially leading to IS.”</p>
