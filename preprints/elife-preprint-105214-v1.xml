<title>Abstract</title><p>Striatal dopamine (DA) release regulates reward-related learning and behavioural activation and is believed to consist of a short-lived <italic>phasic</italic> and continuous <italic>tonic</italic> component. Here, we build a three-dimensional model of extracellular DA dynamics in dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS) that include tens of thousands of DA release sites. The model predicts rapid dynamics in DS with little-to-no basal DA, and much slower dynamics in the VS enabling build-up of a <italic>tonic</italic> DA level. These regional differences do not primarily reflect different release phenomena but rather arise from differential dopamine transporter (DAT) activity. Interestingly, our simulations posit prevalent nanoclustering of DAT as a possible regulator of this activity. Receptor binding simulations show that D1 receptor occupancy follows extracellular DA concentration with millisecond delay, while D2 receptors integrate DA signal over seconds. Summarized, our model distills recent experimental observations into a computational framework that challenge prevailing paradigms of striatal DA signalling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Striatal dopamine (DA) release is essential for regulating reward-related learning, incentive motivation, and motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Klaus et al, 2019</xref>). DA exerts these roles over a broad range of time scales, yet DA primarily operates as a volume transmitter that targets metabotropic receptors located within a micrometre range from the sites of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agnati et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borroto-Escuela et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cragg &amp; Rice, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gonon et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sulzer et al, 2016</xref>). The temporal and spatial dynamics of DA release in striatum, however, remain a highly contested topic. Classically, DA release has been divided into <italic>tonic</italic> release, driven by pacemaker-like spontaneous firing, and <italic>phasic</italic> release from coordinated bursts of firing across neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Niv et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schultz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>). However, this sharp distinction in release modes, as well as the existence of a basal DA level has recently been challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ejdrup et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorgensen et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sippy &amp; Tritsch, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The picture is further complicated by major regional differences across striatal sub domains. These include differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression profiles on DA terminals, as well differential regulation and expression of the DA transporter (DAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brown et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cardozo &amp; Bean, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kearney et al, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Richards &amp; Zahniser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Threlfell et al, 2010</xref>). In addition, we and others have found remarkable differences in extracellular DA release dynamics between the dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorgensen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mohebi et al, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Salinas et al, 2023</xref>). Fibre photometry recordings in the DS in mice using the DA sensor dLight1.3b during self-paced exploratory activity showed a rapidly fluctuating signal, whereas we observed up to minutes-long DA dynamics in VS that correlated with behavioural output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorgensen et al., 2023</xref>). Concurrent measurements of extracellular DA by microdialysis and fibre photometry have furthermore corroborated the lack of tonic levels of DA in DS while supported its presence in VS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ejdrup et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorgensen et al., 2023</xref>). Despite these reported differences in striatal DA dynamics, electrophysiological recordings suggest that DA neurons from the primary innervators of DS, substantia nigra par compacta (SNc) and VS, ventral tegmental area (VTA), have remarkably similar firing patterns at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dodson et al, 2016</xref>). We therefore set out to better understand the fundamental principles governing extracellular DA dynamics by constructing a new computational model of the striatal DA system.</p>
<p>Extracellular DA dynamics have been modelled before; either one-dimensionally or with a primary focus on single release events or post-synaptic receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beyene et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dreyer et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dreyer &amp; Hounsgaard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dreyer et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Venton et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wiencke et al, 2020</xref>). Here, we present a three-dimensional model of tens of thousands of release sites, focused on larger-scale signalling and based on experimentally observed biological parameters. The model faithfully replicates experimentally observed results as well as the difference in DA dynamics between DS and VS. Importantly, it offers compelling evidence that these differences do not primarily reflect different release phenomena but rather arise from differential expression and possibly nanoscale localization of the DA transporter (DAT).</p>

<title>Construction of a model of DA dynamics in the striatum</title>
<p>We constructed a novel model of DA release using experimentally determined parameters from DS, including release, uptake, and cytoarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Doucet et al, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dreyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dreyer &amp; Hounsgaard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Olson et al, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>). DA release sites on axons projecting from the midbrain were randomly simulated as uniformly distributed discrete points in a three-dimensional space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The release events themselves were simulated as point source events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cragg &amp; Rice, 2004</xref>) driven by action potentials (AP). We then modelled DA release for each voxel in the simulation containing a release site as function of three key parameters; firing rate, release probability and quantal size:

where Poisson<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601861v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is a Poisson distribution of action potentials (AP) for the given neuron (n) with the firing rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601861v2_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the probability of release at the individual terminal (t) for each AP, while Q is the number of DA molecules released per event (dopaminergic quantal size) and dt the time step. Changing f<sub>rate</sub> can be used to model both pacemaker firing, typically reported at 2-10 Hz, and burst firing, which can exceed 20 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>DA reuptake in the striatum is almost exclusively mediated by the DA transporter (DAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jones et al, 1998</xref>), which is widely distributed along DA axons and varicosities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Block et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eriksen et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eriksen et al, 2009</xref>). As reuptake follows concentration-dependent Michaelis-Menten kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Nicholson, 1995</xref>), we simulated uptake as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="601861v2_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where [DA] is the concentration of DA for each voxel in the model, V<sub>max</sub> is the maximal uptake capacity in the region and K<sub>m</sub> is the concentration of DA at which half of V<sub>max</sub> is reached.</p>
<p>The spatial distribution of released DA is a complex interplay between release, uptake and diffusion. Diffusion in an open 3D space can be simulated for each voxel with a Laplacian operator:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="601861v2_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where D<sub>a</sub>is a corrected diffusion coefficient and <italic>dt</italic> is the timestep. As the extracellular space of the striatum is tortuous, we modified the conventional diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic> to an apparent diffusion coefficient (D<sub>a</sub>) to correct for the tortuosity (λ) of the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cragg &amp; Rice, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nicholson, 1985</xref>):

Combining <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 1</xref> through 4, we model DA changes in each voxel with a single conceptual equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="601861v2_eqn5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
We first compared our 3D model of DA dynamics to the analytical solution of a single release event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cragg &amp; Rice, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gonon et al., 2000</xref>). To do this, we simulated a quantal event of 3000 DA molecules and calculated DA concentrations across space at three separate time points (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, C). The analytic solution and our model predicted almost identical results. Slight differences were introduced as the analytical solution assumes linear uptake from DAT while our model incorporate non-linear Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These differences, however, were almost negligible. The main difference between the two models lies in scalability across both space and time. Summarized, the model enables a dynamic incorporation of the surrounding DA concentration, release events and uptake, and can be scaled to cover DA dynamics of a large 3D space, whose size and granularity is only limited by computing power (see Code Availability Section for the Python code with numerical implementations of the equations listed and scripts to run the simulations and plot the main figures).</p>
<p>We also tested the validity of our model, by examining the response to electrical stimulation. Importantly, our model faithfully mirrored DA release seen with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) recordings upon direct stimulation of striatal slices when we corrected for kinetics of the typical FSCV recording setup (Figure S1b, c and discussion in Supplementary Information) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atcherley et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brimblecombe et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Stuber et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Xie et al, 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Simulating large scale DA dynamics of the dorsal striatum</title>
<p>To better understand the extracellular DA dynamics that arise from the balance between dopaminergic pacemaker activity and uptake, we simulated DA dynamics in the DS generated by pacemaker activity (4 Hz) of 150 neurons in the midbrain in a 100×100×100 µm space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, see parameters in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our simulations yielded a pattern of partially segregated DA hot spots with large fractions of the simulated space devoid of DA, suggesting that release events in DS only elevate DA in the immediate surroundings with DAT-dependent clearance preventing a larger spread in space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This was also illustrated by a cross-section in time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In line with our recent in vivo microdialysis experiments, the average DA concentration in the simulations during pacemaker activity was approximately 10 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ejdrup et al., 2023</xref>). Further, when we calculated the average concentration of a larger area across time, which fibre photometry conceivably does, the results resembled a tonic DA concentration (Figure S1A). However, our model predicted a spatial distribution that is highly heterogenous and devoid of pervasive resting or tonic DA levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-F</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>To ensure our simulations were performed within a sufficiently large space to yield consistent results, we tested different sizes of the simulated area and found a diameter of 50 μm to faithfully mimic the results of larger simulations (Figure S2A, B). Additionally, we tested our simulations at different granularity (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 μm). The finer the spatial grain, the higher detail close to a release event; however, at a spatial granularity of 1 μm, [DA] deviated by &lt;2% across most percentiles and only by &gt;1 nM above the 99.5<sup>th</sup> percentile (Figure S2C-F), leading us to use this voxel size for our simulations.</p>

<title>Burst firing and receptor occupancy</title>
<p>DA cell bodies are known to fire short bursts of APs, which is a phenomenon strongly linked to reward-prediction error and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schultz, 2007</xref>). To gain insights into accompanying extracellular DA dynamics, we simulated three different firing scenarios for a group of terminals within a 10×10×10 µm field encompassing roughly 40 release sites from the randomly simulated 150 neurons: 3 pulses at 10 Hz, 6 pulses at 20 Hz and 12 pulses at 40 Hz (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> – burst properties matched to be the same duration). Unsurprisingly, peak DA concentration was reached at the end of the bursts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The 3 APs/10 Hz bursting scenario generated no significant spill-over of DA outside the region of activity, whereas the 6 APs/20 Hz and 12 APs/40 Hz bursting scenarios markedly overwhelmed uptake (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The relationship between firing rate and the sphere of influence by DA became further evident when plotting maximal concentration of the surrounding space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>) and the volume of space with a DA concentration above 100 nM (Figure S1D). We found that the 3 APs/10 Hz stimulation produced DA responses that largely resembled that of a single pulse. In both cases, DA was mostly cleared after 100 ms and the volume exposed to greater than 100 nM was similar (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and Figure S1D). In contrast, the high bursting activities caused a frequency-dependent spill-over, where the areas exposed to a DA concentration above 100 nM were 10 and 30 times larger than the terminal origin for 6 APs/20 Hz and 12 APs/40 Hz, respectively. Even after 100 ms, a considerable amount of DA remained in the 12 APs/40 Hz scenario (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand how these DA dynamics could affect the postsynaptic response, we modelled receptor binding. D1 receptors (-Rs) were assumed to have a half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 1000 nM and we extrapolated the reverse rate constant (K<sub>off</sub>) to 19.5 s<sup>-1</sup> based on a linear fit of the recently characterized DA receptor-based sensors (Figure S1E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Labouesse &amp; Patriarchi, 2021</xref>). We set the EC<sub>50</sub> of D2Rs to 7 nM and K<sub>off</sub> to 0.2 s<sup>-1</sup> based on the DA sensor kinetic fit (Figure S1E), which matches a recent binding study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agren et al, 2021</xref>). To determine how these receptors would respond to our predicted DA dynamics, we simulated pacemaker activity at 4 Hz with an added burst of 6 APs/20 Hz. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref> shows a representative trace of DA concentration and occupancy of the D1R and D2R within 1 µm of a release site. During pacemaker activity, D1R showed an occupancy close to 0, whereas D2R occupancy was approximately 0.65 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Both D1Rs and D2Rs occupancies were largely invariant to individual release events caused by pacemaker activity. However, upon coordinated burst firing, the occupancy rapidly increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). D1R receptor occupancy closely tracked extracellular DA with a delay of only ∼50 ms (Figure S1F). In contrast, it took at least 5 seconds before the burst-induced increase in D2R occupancy had declined to baseline levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>), and, perhaps more surprisingly, the D2R occupancy only fell from 0.55 to 0.45 when simulating a full second pause in firing due to the slow off kinetics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>).</p>
<p>These simulations suggest that the dopaminergic architecture of the DS limits DA overflow during physiologically relevant bursting activity. Further, DA receptors had a temporally mostly uniform response to DA release caused by pacemaker activity with D1R occupancy responding rapidly to both onset and offset extracellular DA concentrations following bursts, while D2R showed seconds-long delays in offset.</p>

<title>Ventral striatum maintains pervasive DA tone</title>
<p>Mounting evidence points to considerable differences in DA dynamics across striatal subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorgensen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mohebi et al., 2024</xref>), which might reflect differences in the cytoarchitectural and/or molecular dopaminergic make up. In line with this, most studies report lower dopaminergic density in the VS than in DS regardless of methodological modality with a median value of ∼90% in VS relative to DS (Table S1). Further, DAT-mediated uptake capacity is reported to be lower in VS with a median capacity at ∼30% of DS (Table S2). Consistently, we observed a clear dorsoventral gradient for DAT expression when analysing immunostainings in striatal mouse brain slices from a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sorensen et al, 2021</xref>)(Figure S3A, B). By contrast, the VMAT2 staining only decreased slightly from VS to DS (Figure S3A-C).</p>
<p>We simulated DA release during pacemaker activity in both DS and VS. DS values were set as previously described (25 µm<sup>3</sup> per terminal, uptake capacity of 6.0 μM s<sup>-1</sup>), but for VS we reduced the terminal density to 90% (27.8 µm<sup>3</sup> per terminal) and DAT uptake capacity to 33% (2.0 µM s<sup>-1</sup>) (Tables S1 and S2). The remaining parameters were kept identical. With these two differences, our simulations revealed markedly different spatiotemporal DA distributions during pacemaker activity. While DS formed segregated domains with low DA concentrations in the inter-domain space (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), DA diffused further throughout the simulated space in VS, before being cleared by DAT. This gave rise to what may be considered a tonic DA level with hotspots of higher DA concentrations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, B).</p>

<p>We compared our model of the two regions with existing experimental data. In an earlier study by May and Wightman, 120 stimulus pulses were delivered in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) at either 10, 30 or 60 Hz and DA responses were recorded by FSCV in both caudate-putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">May &amp; Wightman, 1989</xref>). To mirror this, we simulated 120 action potentials at similar frequencies (10, 30, and 60 Hz) at 6% release probability and ran the result through convolution, as in Figure S1B and C, to generate an FSCV read-out (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Since May and Wightman reported no significant difference in DA released per electrically delivered pulse ([DA]<sub>p</sub>) between VS and DS, we applied equal quantal size and R<sub>%</sub> for DS and VS in our simulations, while uptake capacity in VS was kept to a third of DS and terminal density was set to 90% as specified above. Importantly, our simulated FSCV data closely resembled the earlier findings, with VS reaching considerably higher DA levels for all three stimulation frequencies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). This regional difference presumably arises from differences in DAT capacity between DS and VS, as the lower terminal density in VS would have the opposite effect (see below) and the remaining parameters were held identical.</p>
<p>To compare with our results for DS, we tested how VS responded during simulated burst activity. Using firing patterns identical to the DS simulations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), we found a larger spill-over of DA into the surrounding areas in VS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and Figure S3D, E). Significant amounts of extracellular DA also remained 100 ms after the physiologically relevant 6APs/20Hz firing stimulus. At the receptor level, D1R occupancy in VS showed a similar response to that in DS during the burst (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). By contrast, D2R occupancy during pacemaker activity was higher in VS than DS (∼0.8 versus ∼0.65 in DS), in accordance with the higher prevailing basal DA concentration. Additionally, the larger DA overflow in VS after a burst caused a higher relative increase in receptor occupancy further away from the area actively bursting than compared to DS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). A pause in firing had the same effect on D2R as in DS (Figure S3F).</p>

<title>Testing sensitivity of model parameters</title>
<p>To test the robustness of the results, we performed simulations across wide ranges of the variable key parameters on which the model is based. First, we varied the number of varicosities actively releasing DA by setting the varicosity density to one site per 9 µm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Doucet et al., 1986</xref>) and simulating 4 Hz pacemaker activity with the release fraction ranging from 5% to 100% (reported values range from 20% to virtually all) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ducrot et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Liu et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Pereira et al, 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). As the fraction of active sites increased, DA concentrations increased at both the median level (50<sup>th</sup> percentile), which we consider a measure of tonic or baseline DA levels, and at peak levels (99.5<sup>th</sup> percentile) in both DS and VS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, see Figure S4A for schematic of tonic and peak DA). We then used the 99.5<sup>th</sup>/50<sup>th</sup> percentile ratio as a measure of the focality of the DA distribution (i.e. hotspot DA relative to baseline DA). Quantifying this across the percentage of active terminals showed that the focality of the DA distribution dropped as the active fraction increased in both regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the percentage of active sites in VS needed to drop to 5% to reach a relative distribution resembling the DS at a full 100% active sites, underscoring a marked difference in the spatial confinement of DA signals in VS and DS.</p>

<p>The predicted total DA content of a vesicle and the fraction of content released per fusion event is reported to range from 1,000 to 30,000 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Garris et al, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pothos et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Staal et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sulzer &amp; Pothos, 2000</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). As expected, tonic and peak concentrations increased in both DS and VS as quantal size was increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Also as expected, the focality of the DA distributions dropped for both regions as quantal size increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). The relative difference in tonic DA, however, remained persistently higher in VS and even increased as quantal size increased, indicating a tendency for VS to maintain basal levels of DA regardless of release content (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). The higher end of quantal sizes, however, resulted in median concentrations far beyond what is typically reported (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>). We observed largely similar pattern when changing either release probability or firing rate (Figure S4B-G).</p>
<p>DAT activity is governed by two parameters: K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kristensen et al, 2011</xref>). To mimic competitive inhibition of DAT by e.g., cocaine, we ran a simulation across various K<sub>m</sub> values (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>) showing that increasing K<sub>m</sub> caused a linear increase in DA levels, consistent with DAT uptake rate responding almost linearly to increases in [DA] below K<sub>m</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Of note, most microdialysis studies have reported that cocaine increases [DA] to the same degree in both DS and VS; however, these quantifications are usually derived as a ratio of the absolute baseline level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Carboni et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Maisonneuve &amp; Glick, 1992</xref>). If we divide our simulations of increasing K<sub>m</sub> with the basal levels estimated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref> a similar response for DS and VS is found (Figure 5A). Further, we observe a convergence on a two-fold difference in the absolute values at both tonic and peak levels, which matches reports from earlier FSCV studies (Figure S5B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wu et al, 2001</xref>). This regionally differential response to cocaine matches our observations in a previous biosensor-based study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorgensen et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we changed V<sub>max</sub> by ± 50% in both regions and observed a smaller change in for tonic level in DS (11 nM) than in VS (38 nM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). This suggests modulation of V<sub>max</sub> has higher impact in VS than DS. Further, the cusp-like behaviour of V<sub>max</sub> in VS was independent of both Q and R<sub>%</sub> within values typically reported in the literature (Figure S5C, D). In contrast to the changes in tonic levels, the relative effect V<sub>max</sub> had on peak levels was much more modest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>).</p>
<p>Changes to uptake rate may be mediated by DAT internalization pathways but to our knowledge there is not in vivo evidence of differential release-uptake balances between animals that could lead to varying tonic DA levels across animals. We therefore reanalysed data from our previously published comparison of fibre photometry and microdialysis and found evidence of natural variations in the release-uptake balance of the mice (Figure 5F, G), which may underlie different tonic levels of DA in the striatum between animals.</p>

<title>Simulations of DAT nanoclustering</title>
<p>Our simulations highlight DAT V<sub>max</sub> as an effective regulator of extracellular DA levels in VS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Internalization of DAT can serve as a mechanism for this control but is a relatively slow process operating on the order of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, our recent studies have provided evidence that DAT move laterally in the plasma membrane and transition from a clustered to an unclustered nanoscale distribution in response to excitatory drive and other inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lycas et al, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rahbek-Clemmensen et al, 2017</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that DAT nanoclustering serve as a mechanism for regulating DAT activity on a faster time scale. We speculated that dense nanoclusters of DAT would produce domains of low [DA] due to uptake overpowering diffusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). As uptake rate is concentration dependent, this would reduce uptake efficiency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). To address this hypothesis, we simulated a single ellipsoid varicosity of 1.5 μm in length and 800 nm thick with surrounding extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ducrot et al., 2021</xref>). The surface was unfolded to a square of equal area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), and as 9-16.4% of terminals in the striatum are estimated to be dopaminergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hokfelt, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tennyson et al, 1974</xref>), we set the volume of the surrounding space to seven times the varicosity volume. On the surface of the varicosity, we randomly distributed eight DAT nanoclusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and ran simulations of how DAT clustering density influenced the DA clearance from the surrounding space. The observed DA concentration in the space surrounding the varicosity shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> is illustrated by the cross-section shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>. Mean DA uptake capacity of the entire space was kept constant at 4 μM s<sup>-1</sup> (between the values observed for DS and VS) throughout the simulations, representing a constant amount of DAT molecules on the surface of the varicosity. We only changed the fraction of the surface of the varicosity that was uptake competent by altering the cluster size from small clusters of high density to large clusters of lower density. We ran simulations of eight clusters at 20, 40, 80 or 160 nm in diameter to mirror experimentally observed cluster sizes on DA varicosities, as well as a scenario with DAT fully dispersed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lycas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rahbek-Clemmensen et al., 2017</xref>). We then set the extracellular space to a [DA] of 100 nM and simulated uptake for the four cluster sizes and an unclustered distribution of DAT. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, the distribution of DAT into clusters of increasing density resulted in progressively slower DA clearance. Thus, the unclustered scenario reduced [DA] to 10 nM in just above 200 ms, whereas the 20 nm clusters took ∼400 ms. As cluster size increased and DAT density decreased, clearance time approached that of the fully unclustered scenario (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). The resulting hyper-local low-[DA] environment that came from dense DAT clusters was apparent when we plotted the [DA] at the centre of a cluster compared to the mean [DA] of the extracellular space (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). For the 20 nm cluster-scenario, the clearance was almost entirely limited by how quickly DA diffused to the nanocluster, as the local [DA] dropped to near zero. We originally hypothesized the effect would mainly be due to a depression in [DA] at the cluster centre, but a concentration profile of the 80 nm cluster-scenario revealed the entirety of the cluster was enveloped in a low-[DA] environment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>).</p>

<p>Summarized, the data supports that dense DAT nanoclusters produce domains of low [DA] as uptake outcompetes diffusion.

<title>DAT clusters more in the ventral striatum</title>
<p>As our simulations suggest that nanodomain clustering is a way of regulating uptake, and this may be particularly efficient at controlling extracellular DA in VS, we hypothesized nanoscale clustering would be more prominent in VS. To investigate this, we reanalysed data from a previous publication(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sorensen et al., 2021</xref>), where we acquired super-resolution images of coronally sliced striatal sections from mice stained for DAT. For the present study, images were split in DS and VS based on where in the slices they were taken (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). DA terminals were identified by vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) expression, and qualitatively DAT appeared more clustered in VS than DS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). To quantify this, we applied the clustering algorithm Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>). This confirmed a regional difference with more DAT localized to mean cluster size of 80 nm in VS compared to DS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref>), and we observed a similar regional difference across the range of sizes typically reported (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4N</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lycas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rahbek-Clemmensen et al., 2017</xref>) supporting the conclusion that DAT nanoclustering is more prevalent in VS than DS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We developed a three-dimensional, finite-difference computational model to investigate spatiotemporal DA dynamics of striatal subregions in detail. Leveraging prior experimental information on regional differences in dopaminergic innervation density and DAT uptake capacity, our model predicts important differences in dopaminergic dynamics between DS and VS. Strikingly, our simulations suggest that large areas of the DS are effectively devoid of a basal level of DA at pacemaker activity, whereas VS maintain a more homogenous tonic-like basal DA concentration with only small changes in uptake activity powerfully regulating the extracellular DA tone. Furthermore, we modelled receptor binding kinetics and found that D1R binding faithfully followed recently described rapid DA dynamics of the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ejdrup et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorgensen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Markowitz et al, 2023</xref>), while D2R, with an off-rate of ∼5 seconds, appeared better suited for detecting background tone, ramps and integrating prolonged activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Howe et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorgensen et al., 2023</xref>). Collectively, these observations have important implications for our understanding of striatal function in behaviour, including decoding of inputs from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and limbic system as well as the influential phasic-tonic model of dopaminergic signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Grace et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Niv et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schultz, 2007</xref>)</p>
<p>It has been assumed for long that there are tonic levels of DA in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Niv et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schultz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>), although the phenomenon has no clear definition <italic>(1</italic>). Our simulation of DA dynamics in DS during pacemaker activity showed no evidence for a homogenous extracellular distribution. Rather, elevated [DA] was transiently present around release sites during pacemaker activity with the remaining space mostly depleted of DA. The absence of a general tonic DA level in DS predicted by our model directly supports the notion that DA release sites in DS establish distinct and only partially overlapping DA domains rather than diffuse, tonic DA levels (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al., 2021</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). This conclusion aligns with recent data where we found that DA concentrations measured by microdialysis correlates with the average of rapid activity recorded with fibre photometry rather than a baseline DA tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ejdrup et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the DS, our model predicted VS to hold a considerable basal level of DA even in spaces without an immediately adjacent release site. This is conceivably what most refer to as tonic DA. In this study, we quantified tonic DA as the median concentration of the entire space (50<sup>th</sup> percentile), which appeared significantly higher in VS than DS because of the lower VS uptake capacity. Importantly, this matches the results of our direct in vivo comparison of DS and VS in freely moving mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorgensen et al., 2023</xref>). To challenge our model, we performed our simulations across a wide range of parameters. Only changes to V<sub>max</sub> for uptake generated differential responses in the two regions. With release and uptake parameters at values from the literature, VS was at a critical point where minor changes to uptake significantly impacted the tonic levels without any major effect on peak concentrations.</p>
<p>Contrary to our observations, some previous microdialysis experiments have suggested higher basal DA levels in the DS compared to VS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kuczenski &amp; Segal, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Shen et al., 2004</xref> have reported 2-4 times higher [DA] in DS compared to VS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kuczenski &amp; Segal, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Shen et al, 2004</xref>).However, there are disparate observations in the literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Carboni et al., 2001</xref> reported 20% higher [DA] in VS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Carboni et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, it is important to note that regional comparisons in microdialysis might be confounded by the considerably higher uptake rate in DS. This will increase the extraction fraction and possibly lead to a significant overestimation of the extracellular concentration as compared to a region with lower uptake rate, such as the VS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chefer et al, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Our three-dimensional simulations highlight DAT-mediated reuptake as a key mechanism governing striatal DA dynamics and as a key mediator of regional-specific DA dynamics. A physiologically relevant way to regulate uptake capacity is moving DAT to-and-from the plasma membrane. Indeed, DAT is subject to such regulation and some of these mechanisms may even be exclusive to the ventral region, including protein kinase C-induced DAT internalization and Vav2 regulation of DAT surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fagan et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhu et al, 2015</xref>). Chemogenetic G<sub>q</sub>-coupled DREADD activation of DA neurons also result in differential DAT trafficking in the two regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fagan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kearney et al., 2023</xref>). The findings position DAT regulation as an excellent candidate for changing tonic DA levels in VS, which has been proposed to selectively attenuate afferent drive from the PFC through D2R activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Grace et al., 2007</xref>). Recent studies of D2R expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the VS also suggest that the receptor is not fully saturated under basal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lee et al, 2020</xref>), matching both our simulations of receptor binding and the notion that tonic DA can be manipulated to alter D2R activation.</p>
<p>If changing uptake capacity is to have a behavioural relevance on a fast timescale, a mechanism to regulate DAT function faster than internalization must exist. Importantly, the transporter does not only move to-and-from the surface, but also laterally in the plasma membrane. We have reported that DAT forms nanoclusters in the plasma membrane that dynamically reshape based on excitatory and inhibitory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lycas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rahbek-Clemmensen et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, we have previously shown that cocaine, which both competitively inhibits DAT and reorganizes the transporter nanodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lycas et al., 2022</xref>), changes the DA signal of the DS to dynamics akin to the VS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorgensen et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, our simulations showed that nanoclustering may be an effective way to sequester DAT in a dense domain where uptake overpowers diffusion and as a result brings down effective uptake speed through microdomain DA depletion. This is in line with evidence that these DAT nanoclusters are enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and that metabolism of PIP2 decreases uptake rate of DAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lycas et al., 2022</xref>); Carvelli, 2002 #2339}. We also found that the nanoclustering phenomenon was considerably more prevalent in VS than in DS. Taken together, these data point to DAT nanoclustering as a way to shape tonic levels of DA in the striatum – particularly in the VS.</p>
<p>Our incorporation of receptor binding was inspired by previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dreyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dreyer &amp; Hounsgaard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hunger et al, 2020</xref>). Dreyer &amp; colleagues assumed instantaneous equilibrium between extracellular DA and receptor occupation while Hunger &amp; colleagues based their kinetics on early pharmacological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burt et al, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Maeno, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nishikori et al, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sano et al, 1979</xref>). However, we based our receptor kinetics on newer pharmacological experiments in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agren et al., 2021</xref>) and properties of the recently developed DA receptor-based biosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Labouesse &amp; Patriarchi, 2021</xref>). Indeed, these sensors are mutated receptors but only on the intracellular domains with no changes of the binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Labouesse &amp; Patriarchi, 2021</xref>). Overall, they exhibit kinetics that are well aligned with both modelled and experimentally reported extracellular DA dynamics using non-biosensor-based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atcherley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gonon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Venton et al, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The presented simulations suggested that receptor binding was largely invariant to single release events during pacemaker activity, while bursts of activity rapidly changed occupancy. Both D1R and D2R immediately responded to burst onset; however, while D1R occupancy rapidly declined to zero within approximately 50 ms, the slow D2R kinetics resulted in an occupancy decline over ∼5 seconds, returning to the baseline maintained by tonic firing. This means that D1R is better suited to discriminate inputs in rapid succession and allow for postsynaptic decoding of the fast-paced in vivo dynamics described in particularly for DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ejdrup et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jorgensen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Markowitz et al., 2023</xref>). By contrast, our analysis shows that D2Rs integrate DA signals over several seconds. As D1R occupancy is negligible during pacemaker activity and D2R kinetics are too slow to pick up rapid changes in DA concentration, our simulations moreover suggest pauses in firing of less than 1 second is not an effective way of signalling for the striatal dopaminergic system.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have developed a three-dimensional model for DA release dynamics and receptor binding that integrates a wealth of experimentally determined parameters and generates responses to electrical and pharmacological input that fits robustly with literature observations. The model offers an important theoretical framework and a predictive tool that can serve as the basis for future experimental endeavours and help guide the interpretation of new as well as older empirical findings on DA signalling dynamics under both physiological conditions and in disease.</p>

<title>Three-dimensional finite difference model</title>
<p>DA release sites in the striatum were simulated at a density of one site per 25 µm<sup>3</sup> in DS and one site per 27.8 µm<sup>3</sup> in VS (except for <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b and c</xref>). As a single medium spiny neuron in the striatum is estimated to be influenced by axons from 95 to 194 dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Matsuda et al, 2009</xref>), we simulated DA release sites as originating from 150 separate cell bodies. These were set to fire independently from each other at 4 Hz generated by a Poisson distribution. We set the release probability in response to an action potential at the individual terminal levels to 6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dreyer et al., 2010</xref>), and if a release occurred the DA concentration of the voxel was elevated by the equivalent of 3000 DA molecules as per <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref>. The volume of each voxel was corrected for an extracellular volume fraction of 0.21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rice &amp; Nicholson, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>We did not incorporate paired-pulse depression in our model as most in vivo FSCV studies have not reported this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chergui et al, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Garris &amp; Wightman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hamid et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">May &amp; Wightman, 1989</xref>). In addition, we could explain the gradual blunt of the response during prolonged stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) as the result of an equilibrium between release and uptake rather than a depression in release. Newer in vivo biosensor-based studies observe the same “blunting” phenomenon during stimulation trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohebi et al, 2023</xref>). A low initial release probability that scales well with frequency has also been reported for VMAT2-positive release sites in dopaminergic cultures where the axons are not severed from their cell bodies as in acute striatal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Silm et al, 2019</xref>). Note that we did not explicitly model autoreceptor inhibition at pacemaker activity. However, this value should be implicitly reflected in the in vivo estimates we base our model on.</p>
<p>When simulating bursts or trains of stimulations, action potentials were added as described for each simulation, but release probability was kept the same unless otherwise noted. Uptake was evenly distributed throughout the simulation space with a V<sub>max</sub> at 6 µm s<sup>-</sup> <sup>1</sup> for DS and 2 µm s<sup>-1</sup> for VS (see Table S2) and a K<sub>m</sub> at 210 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hovde et al, 2019</xref>) and calculated for each voxel as per <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 2</xref>. For each time step, <italic>dt</italic>, diffusion calculated with a finite difference implementation of the Laplacian operator described in <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 3</xref> using a diffusion coefficient corrected for tortuosity at 321.7 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Periodic boundaries were used to avoid edge issues with a simulation size of 50×50×50 µm unless otherwise noted. The Python-based implementation of the model can be found as described in the Code and Data Availability section.</p>

<title>Nanocluster uptake modelling</title>
<p>Nanoclustering of DAT was simulated in Python. An ellipsoid-shaped varicosity of 1.5 μm in length and 800 nm in width was modelled as a flat, square surface with a width of 1.8 μm to match the total surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lycas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rahbek-Clemmensen et al., 2017</xref>). As 9-16.4% of terminals in the striatum are estimated to be dopaminergic(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hokfelt, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tennyson et al., 1974</xref>), we set the height of the simulation space to 3.52 μm to generate an extracellular volume seven times the size of the varicosity. Axons and cell bodies are likely a non-negligible part of the striatal volume but omitted in this analysis due to a lack of information in the literature (however, decreasing the share of striatal space taken up by DA varicosities works in the direction of our hypothesis). Spatial granularity was set to 20 nm, and we randomly placed eight non-overlapping locations for clusters on the simulated varicosity. Uptake capacity per voxel for each clustering scenario was set so the mean uptake of the entire space was 4 μm s<sup>-1</sup>, which resulted in clusters with increased DAT density with decreasing cluster size. We set the initial DA concentration of the entire space to 100 nM and ran the simulation with a time step of 1.875e<sup>-7</sup> s to avoid numerical instability. Diffusion corrected for tortuosity was set to 321.7 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and calculated with a Laplacian operation as described in <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 3</xref>. Periodic boundaries were used to account for the varicosity being circular and avoid issues at the edge of the simulation space.

<p>Ejdrup, Gether, and colleagues present a sophisticated simulation of dopamine (DA) dynamics based on a substantial volume of striatum with many DA release sites. The key observation is that a reduced DA uptake rate in the ventral striatum (VS) compared to the dorsal striatum (DS) can produce an appreciable &quot;tonic&quot; level of DA in VS and not DS. In both areas they find that a large proportion of D2 receptors are occupied at &quot;baseline&quot;; this proportion increases with simulated DA cell phasic bursts but has little sensitivity to simulated DA cell pauses. They also examine, in a separate model, the effects of clustering dopamine transporters (DAT) into nanoclusters and say this may be a way of regulating tonic DA levels in VS. I found this work of interest and I think it will be useful to the community. At the same time, there are a number of weaknesses that should be addressed, and the authors need to more carefully explain how their conclusions are distinct from those based on prior models.</p>
<p>(1) The conclusion that even an unrealistically long (1s) and complete pause in DA firing has little effect on DA receptor occupancy is potentially important. The ability to respond to DA pauses has been thought to be a key reason why D2 receptors (may) have high affinity. This simulation instead finds evidence that DA pauses may be useless. This result should be highlighted in the abstract and discussed more.</p>
<p>(2) The claim of &quot;DAT nanoclustering as a way to shape tonic levels of DA&quot; is not very well supported at present. None of the panels in Figure 4 simply show mean steady-state extracellular DA as a function of clustering. Perhaps mean DA is not the relevant measure, but then the authors need to better define what is and why. This issue may be linked to the fact that DAT clustering is modeled separately (Figure 4) to the main model of DA dynamics (Figures 1-3) which per the Methods assumes even distribution of uptake. Presumably, this is because the spatial resolution of the main model is too coarse to incorporate DAT nanoclusters, but it is still a limitation. As it stands it is convincing (but too obvious) that DAT clustering will increase DA away from clusters, while decreasing it near clusters. I.e. clustering increases heterogeneity, but how this could be relevant to striatal function is not made clear, especially given the different spatial scales of the models.</p>
<p>(3) I question how reasonable the &quot;12/40&quot; simulated burst firing condition is, since to my knowledge this is well outside the range of firing patterns actually observed for dopamine cells. It would be better to base key results on more realistic values (in particular, fewer action potentials than 12).</p>
<p>(4) There is a need to better explain why &quot;focality&quot; is important, and justify the measure used.</p>
<p>(5) Line 191: &quot; D1 receptors (-Rs) were assumed to have a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 1000 nM&quot;</p>
<p>
The assumptions about receptor EC50s are critical to this work and need to be better justified. It would also be good to show what happens if these EC50 numbers are changed by an order of magnitude up or down.</p>
<p>(6) Line 459: &quot;we based our receptor kinetics on newer pharmacological experiments in live cells (Agren et al., 2021) and properties of the recently developed DA receptor-based biosensors (Labouesse &amp; Patriarchi, 2021). Indeed, these sensors are mutated receptors but only on the intracellular domains with no changes of the binding site (Labouesse &amp; Patriarchi, 2021)&quot;</p>
<p>
This argument is diminished by the observation that different sensors based on the same binding site have different affinities (e.g. in Patriarchi et al. 2018, dLight1.1 has Kd of 330nM while dlight1.3b has Kd of 1600nM).</p>
<p>(7) Estimates of Vmax for DA uptake are entirely based on prior fast-scan voltammetry studies (Table S2). But FSCV likely produces distorted measures of uptake rate due to the kinetics of DA adsorption and release on the carbon fiber surface.</p>
<p>(8) It is assumed that tortuosity is the same in DS and VS - is this a safe assumption?</p>
<p>(9) More discussion is needed about how the conclusions derived from this more elaborate model of DA dynamics are the same, and different, to conclusions drawn from prior relevant models (including those cited, e.g. from Hunger et al. 2020, etc).</p>

<p>The work presents a model of dopamine release, diffusion, and reuptake in a small (100 micrometer^2 maximum) volume of striatum. This extends previous work by this group and others by comparing dopamine dynamics in the dorsal and ventral striatum and by using a model of immediate dopamine-receptor activation inferred from recent dopamine sensor data. From their simulations, the authors report two main conclusions. The first is that the dorsal striatum does not appear to have a sustained, relatively uniform concentration of dopamine driven by the constant 4Hz firing of dopamine neurons; rather that constant firing appears to create hotspots of dopamine. By contrast, the lower density of release sites and lower rate of reuptake in the ventral striatum creates a sustained concentration of dopamine. The second main conclusion is that D1 receptor (D1R) activation is able to track dopamine concentration changes at short delays but D2 receptor activation cannot.</p>
<p>The simulations of the dorsal striatum will be of interest to dopamine aficionados as they throw some doubt on the classic model of &quot;tonic&quot; and &quot;phasic&quot; dopamine actions, further show the disconnect between dopamine neuron firing and consequent release, and thus raise issues for the reward-prediction error theory of dopamine.</p>
<p>There is some careful work here checking the dependence of results on the spatial volume and its discretisation. The simulations of dopamine concentration are checked over a range of values for key parameters. The model is good, the simulations are well done, and the evidence for robust differences between dorsal and ventral striatum dopamine concentration is good.</p>
<p>However, the main weakness here is that neither of the main conclusions is strongly evidenced as yet. The claim that the dorsal striatum has no &quot;tonic&quot; dopamine concentration is based on the single example simulation of Figure 1 not the extensive simulations over a range of parameters. Some of those later simulations seem to show that the dorsal striatum can have a &quot;tonic&quot; dopamine concentration, though the measurement of this is indirect. It is not clear why the reader should believe the example simulation over those in the robustness checks, for example by identifying which range of parameter values is more realistic.</p>
<p>The claim that D1Rs can track rapid changes in dopamine is not well supported. It is based on a single simulation in Figure 1 (DS) and 2 (VS) by visual inspection of simulated dopamine concentration traces - and even then it is unclear that D1Rs actually track dynamics because they clearly do not track rapid changes in dopamine that are almost as large as those driven by bursts (cf Figure 1i). The claim also depends on two things that are poorly explained. First, the model of binding here is missing from the text. It seems to be a simple bound-fraction model, simulating a single D1 or D2 receptor. It is unclear whether more complex models would show the same thing. Second, crucial to the receptor model here is the inference that D1 receptor unbinding is rapid; but this inference is made based on the kinetics of dopamine sensors and is superficially explained - it is unclear why sensor kinetics should let us extrapolate to receptor kinetics, and unclear how safe is the extrapolation of the linear regression by an order of magnitude to get the D1 unbinding rate.</p>

<p>We will improve our definitions and descriptions relating to nanoclustering of DAT in the revised version of the manuscript.

Unfortunately, this would require many orders of magnitude more computational power than currently available.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this important point. While it is true that DAT clustering increases heterogeneity in DA distribution at the microscopic level, the diffusion rate is, in most circumstances, too fast to permit concentration differences on a spatial scale relevant for nearby receptors. Accordingly, we propose that the primary effect of DAT nanoclustering is to decrease the overall uptake capacity, which in turn increases overall extracellular DA concentrations. Thus, homogeneous changes in extracellular DA concentrations can arise from regulating heterogenous DAT distribution. An exception to this would be the circumstance where the receptor is located directly next to a dense cluster – i.e. within nanometers. In such cases, local DA availability may be more directly influenced by clustering effects. This will be further discussed in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for highlighting this important point. We fully recognize the fundamental importance of absolute and relative DA receptor kinetics for modeling DA actions and acknowledge that differences in affinity estimates from sensor-based measurements highlight the inherent uncertainty in selecting receptor kinetics parameters.

Importantly, we are making our model available to the research community, allowing others to test their own estimates of receptor kinetics and assess their impact on the model’s behavior. In our revised manuscript, we will further discuss the rationale behind our parameter choices, including: Our selection of a Kd value of 1000 nM for D1R (based on the observed affinities for D1R sensors) and an extrapolated Koff of 19.5 s<sup>-1</sup> (Labouesse &amp; Patriarchi, 2021).

<p>We appreciate that the reviewer finds our work interesting and carefully performed. The reviewer is correct that DA dynamics, including the presence and level of tonic DA, are parameter-dependent in both the dorsal striatum (DS) and ventral striatum (VS). Indeed, our simulations across a broad range of biological parameters were intended to help readers understand how such variation would impact the model’s outcomes, particularly since many of the parameters remain contested. Naturally, altering these parameters results in changes to the observed dynamics. However, to derive possible conclusions, we selected a subset of parameters that we believe best reflect the physiological conditions, as elaborated in the manuscript. This is eventually required in computational modelling of biological systems. In response to the reviewer’s comment, we will place greater emphasis on clarifying which parameter regimes produce a &quot;tonic&quot; versus &quot;non-tonic&quot; DA state in the DS. Additionally, we will underscore that the distinction between tonic and non-tonic states is not a binary outcome but a parameter-dependent continuum—one that our model now allows researchers to explore systematically. Finally, we will highlight how our simulations across parameter space not only capture this continuum but also identify the regimes that produce the most heterogeneous DA signaling, both within and across striatal regions.</p>

<p>The claim that D1Rs can track rapid changes in dopamine is not well supported. It is based on a single simulation in Figure 1 (DS) and 2 (VS) by visual inspection of simulated dopamine concentration traces - and even then it is unclear that D1Rs actually track dynamics because they clearly do not track rapid changes in dopamine that are almost as large as those driven by bursts (cf Figure 1i).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to draw the attention also to Fig. S1, where the claim that D1R track rapid changes is supported in more depth. According to this figure, upon coordinated burst firing, the D1R occupancy rapidly increased as diffusion no longer equilibrated the extracellular concentrations on a timescale faster than the receptors – and D1R receptor occupancy closely tracked extracellular DA with a delay on the order of tens of milliseconds. Note that the brief increases in [DA] from uncoordinated stochastic release events from tonic firing in Fig. 1i are too brief to drive D1 signaling, as the DA concentration diffuses into the remaining extracellular space on a timescale of 1-5 ms. This is faster than the receptors response rate, and does not lead to any downstream signaling according to our simulations. This means D1 kinetics are rapid enough to track coordinated signaling on a ~50 ms timescale and slower, but not fast enough to respond to individual release events from tonic activity. In our revised manuscript we will expand the discussion of this topic to provide greater clarity.</p>

<p>The claim also depends on two things that are poorly explained. First, the model of binding here is missing from the text. It seems to be a simple bound-fraction model, simulating a single D1 or D2 receptor. It is unclear whether more complex models would show the same thing.</p>

<p>We realize that this is not made clear in the methods and, accordingly, we will update the method section to elaborate on how we model receptor binding. The model simulates occupied fraction of D1R and D2R in every single voxel of the simulation space.</p>

<p>Second, crucial to the receptor model here is the inference that D1 receptor unbinding is rapid; but this inference is made based on the kinetics of dopamine sensors and is superficially explained - it is unclear why sensor kinetics should let us extrapolate to receptor kinetics, and unclear how safe is the extrapolation of the linear regression by an order of magnitude to get the D1 unbinding rate.</p>

<p>We chose to use the sensors because it was possible to estimate precise affinities/off-rates from the fluorescent measurements. Although there might some variation in affinities that could be attributable to the mutations introduced in the sensors, the data clearly separated D1R and D2R with a D1R affinity of ~1000 nM and a D1R affinity of ~7 nM (Labouesse &amp; Patriarchi, 2021) consistent with earlier predictions of receptor affinities. From our assessment of the literature we found that this was the most reasonable way to estimate affinities and thereby off-rates. Importantly, the model has been made publicly available, so should new measurements arise, the simulations can be rerun with tweaks to the input parameters.</p>
