<title>Abstract</title><p>TGF-β stimulates CCN2 expression which in turn amplifies TGF-β signaling, thereby promoting extracellular matrix production and accelerating the pathological progression of fibrotic diseases. Alternative splicing plays an important role in multiple disease development, while U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 2 (U2AF2) is an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor in an early step of splicing. However, the molecular mechanism underlying abnormal <italic>CCN2</italic> expression upon TGF-β stimulation remains unclear. This study elucidates that SIRT4 acts as a master regulator for CCN2 expression in response to TGF-β by modulating U2AF2-mediated alternative splicing. Analyses of renal biopsy specimens from patients with CKD and mouse fibrotic kidney tissues revealed marked nuclear accumulation of SIRT4. The tubulointerstitial fibrosis was alleviated by global deletion or tubular epithelial cell (TEC)-specific knockout of <italic>Sirt4</italic>, and aggravated by adeno-associated virus-mediated SIRT4 overexpression in TECs. Furthermore, SIRT4 was found to translocate from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm through the BAX/BAK pore under TGF-β stimulation. In the cytoplasm, TGF-β activated the ERK pathway and induced the phosphorylation of SIRT4 at Ser36, further promoting its interaction with importin α1 and subsequent nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, SIRT4 was found to deacetylate U2AF2 at K413, facilitating the splicing of CCN2 pre-mRNA to promote CCN2 protein expression. Importantly, exosomes containing anti-SIRT4 antibodies were found to effectively mitigate the UUO-induced kidney fibrosis in mice. Collectively, these findings indicated that SIRT4 plays a role in kidney fibrosis by regulating CCN2 expression via the pre-mRNA splicing.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the kidney and other organ systems, the overexpression (OE) of cellular communication network 2 (CCN2), also known as connective tissue growth factor, is widely recognized as a marker of fibrotic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a master regulator of tissue growth, regeneration, remodeling, and fibrosis, and most TGF-β responses involve CCN2 stimulation at some level, such as the stimulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Numerous signaling molecules are involved in the crosstalk and integration of TGF-β and CCN2 effects and vary depending on the cell type and the physiological or pathological process involved. For instance, TGF-β-stimulated SMADs are necessary for the induction of CCN2 expression in normal fibroblasts and basal CCN2 induction in scleroderma fibroblasts, while maintenance of CCN2 expression is independent of SMADs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, it remains unknown whether TGF-β1 regulates CCN2 expression via non-transcriptional pathways.</p>
<p>Sirtuins (Sirts), mammalian Sir2 orthologs, are a highly conserved family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent protein deacetylases and act as important regulators of the aging process, inflammation, cancer, and metabolic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Among the seven known mammalian Sirts, SIRT4 possesses ADP-ribosyltransferase, lipoamidase, and deacylase activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The inhibition of SIRT4 expression has been shown to increase the fat-oxidation capacity of the liver and mitochondrial function in the muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. As loss of fatty acid β-oxidation in the proximal tubule is a critical mediator of acute kidney injury and eventual fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, we hypothesize that SIRT4 may act as a pro-fibrotic factor. However, other studies have demonstrated that SIRT4 OE inhibits glutamine metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, which is necessary for collagen protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, suggesting a potential protective role of SIRT4 in the context of fibrosis. However, the specific mechanism by which SIRT4 regulates renal fibrosis remains unclear. Therefore, research is needed to further explore the role and mechanisms of SIRT4 in renal fibrosis as well as potential therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>An estimated 60% of all human genes undergo alternative splicing, a highly regulated process that produces splice variants with different functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. There are five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs)—U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6. The status of these proteins helps in maintaining sufficient proteomic diversity for the functional requirements of cell fates and body homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1), together with U2AF2, forms the U2AF complex that recognizes and binds to the 3′ splice site of pre-mRNA and recruits U2 snRNPs, thereby facilitating the assembly of the spliceosome, a large RNA-protein complex responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The SF3B complex, the core of the U2 snRNP, comprises SF3B1, SF3B2, SF3B3, SF3B4, SF3B5, SF3B6, and PHF5A/SF3B14b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Dysregulation of U2AF2 can lead to the disruption of splicing events, which may contribute to the development and progression of kidney fibrosis. Accordingly, understanding the role of U2AF2 in kidney fibrosis may provide valuable insights into its underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 induced SIRT4 nuclear translocation, resulting in the deacetylation of U2AF2 and recruitment of U2 snRNP, subsequently contributing to pre-mRNA splicing and enhanced protein expression of CCN2. Overall, our study revealed that SIRT4 inhibition can alleviate the progression of renal fibrosis by suppressing CCN2 expression.</p>

<p>All Animal care and experimental protocols for in vivo studies conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH; NIH publication no.:85–23, revised 1996). The sample size for the animal studies was calculated based on a survey of data from published research or preliminary studies. <italic>Sirt4<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>(C57BL/6J-<italic>Sirt4<sup>em1flox</sup>/</italic>Cya; Strain ID: CKOCMP-75387-<italic>Sirt4</italic>-B6J-VA), Col1a2-Cre/ERT2 mice (Cat#: C001248) and Cdh16-Cre mice (Cat#: C001452) obtained from Cyagen Biosciences (Guangzhou) Inc (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China). C57BL/6J mice, <italic>Sirt4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (C57BL/6JGpt-<italic>Sirt4<sup>em13Cd19</sup></italic><sup>76</sup>/Gpt; Strain ID: T011568) and <italic>U2af2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (C57BL/6JGpt-<italic>U2af2<sup>em2Cd52</sup></italic><sup>59</sup>/Gpt; Strain ID: T029898) mice based on C57BL/6J background were purchased from Gempharmatech Co. Ltd (Jiangsu, Nanjing, China). These mice were maintained in SPF units of the Animal Center of Shenzhen People’s Hospital with a 12 h light cycle from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., 23 ± 1 °C, 60 – 70 % humidity. Mice were allowed to acclimatize to their housing environment for 7 days before the experiments. At the end of the experiments, all mice were anesthetized and euthanized in a CO<sub>2</sub> chamber, followed by the collection of kidney tissues. All animals were randomized before treatment. Mice were treated in a blinded fashion as the drugs used for treating animals were prepared by researchers who did not carry out the treatments. No mice were excluded from the statistical analysis. Studies were performed in accordance with the German Animal Welfare Act and reporting follows the ARRIVE guidelines.</p>

<p>Male C57BL/6, <italic>Sirt4</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, <italic>Sirt <sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>, and cell type–specific conditional knockout mice (∼8 to 10 weeks old) were subjected to various kidney injury models to induce renal fibrosis. UUO was performed by permanent ligation of the right ureter with 6-0 silk. Ureter-ligated kidneys and contralateral kidneys (CLs), used as nonfibrotic controls, were collected 10 days after surgery. To establish uIRI, left renal pedicles were clamped with microaneurysm clips for 30 minutes followed by reperfusion. During uIRI surgery, mice were placed on a heating pad to maintain body temperature at 37°C. Injured and contralateral kidneys were collected 1 day or 28 days after surgery for analyses. Folic acid (FA)–induced renal fibrosis was conducted by single intraperitoneal injection of 250 mg/kg folic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 7876) dissolved in 0.3M sodium bicarbonate, and mice were sacrificed 14 days after FA treatment. Mice injected with sodium bicarbonate served as vehicle control.</p>

<label>3.2</label><title>Global deletion of <italic>Sirt4</italic> protects against kidney fibrosis</title>
<p>To determine the role of SIRT4 in kidney fibrosis development in vivo, wild-type (WT) and <italic>Sirt4</italic> global knockout (S4KO) mice were subjected to UUO, uIRI, and folic acid (FA) treatment. Sirius red and Masson’s trichrome staining of the kidney sections revealed extensive renal fibrosis in WT mice following UUO (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), uIRI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), and FA administration <bold>(Fig. S1B)</bold>. In contrast, the global deletion of <italic>Sirt4</italic> resulted in a remarkably reduction in the extent of renal fibrosis in all three kidney injury models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, E</xref><bold> and S1B)</bold>. Immunoblots of whole-kidney tissue lysates showed that UUO, uIRI, and FA treatment led to induced levels of the markers of kidney fibrosis (CCN2, FN1, COL1A1, COL3A1, and α-SMA), while the expression of E-cadherin, a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, was decreased, with the changes being more pronounced in WT mice than in S4KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, F</xref><bold> and S1A)</bold>. Consistent with the attenuated post-injury fibrotic response in S4KO mouse kidneys observed via imaging studies, deletion of <italic>Sirt4</italic> also mitigated the upregulation of the profibrotic genes <italic>Col1a1</italic>, <italic>Fn1</italic>, <italic>Eln</italic>, <italic>Ccn2</italic>, <italic>Acta2</italic>, and <italic>Col3a1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, G</xref><bold> and S1C)</bold>. In addition, the mRNA levels of both neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<italic>Ngal</italic>) and kidney injury molecule 1 (<italic>Kim-1</italic>), which are markers of acute kidney injury, were significantly increased in the kidney tissues from WT and S4KO mice following injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, H</xref><bold> and S1D)</bold>. Notably, the levels of <italic>Ngal</italic> and <italic>Kim-1</italic> were significantly reduced in S4KO mice compared to those in WT mice following injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, H</xref><bold> and S1D)</bold>.

<label>3.3.</label><title>Deletion of <italic>Sirt4</italic> in renal tubule epithelial cells markedly attenuates the extent of kidney fibrosis following injury</title>
<p>Using conventional agarose gel-based RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, we analyzed the expression of SIRT4 in renal parenchymal cells, including mouse podocytes (MPCs), glomerular endothelial cells (GECs), kidney fibroblasts (KFs), and tubule epithelial cells (TECs). Compared to their levels in TECs, the basal levels of SIRT4 in MPCs and GECs were relatively low, while in KFs is moderate <bold>(Fig. S1E)</bold>. To determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> contribution of SIRT4 in renal TECs and fibroblasts to the development of kidney fibrosis, we generated TEC-specific (S4TKO; Cdh16-cre/ERT2×<italic>Sirt4<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>) and fibroblast-specific (S4FKO; Col1a2-Cre/ERT2×<italic>Sirt4<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>) <italic>Sirt4</italic> knockout mice; in these experiments, Cadh16-cre mice and tamoxifen-treated Col1a2-Cre mice were used as controls, respectively. The extent of kidney fibrosis induced by UUO was markedly reduced in S4TKO mice compared to that in control mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I, J</xref>). In addition, the expression levels of kidney fibrosis markers (CCN2, FN1, COL1A1, COL3A1, and α-SMA) were also significantly reduced in S4TKO compared to those in control mice following UUO surgery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). Consistently, the profibrotic genes (<italic>Col1a1, Fn1, Eln, Ccn2, Acta2</italic>, and <italic>Col3a1</italic>) and acute kidney injury markers <italic>Nagl</italic> and <italic>Kim-1</italic> were downregulated in S4TKO mice compared to those in control mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K, L</xref>). Nevertheless, the targeted deletion of SIRT4 in fibroblasts did not affect the extent of UUO-induced kidney fibrosis <bold>(Fig. S1F–H)</bold>. These results suggest that SIRT4 expressed in TECs but not in fibroblasts primarily contributes to the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis.</p>

<label>3.4</label><title>SIRT4 OE aggravates kidney fibrosis</title>
<p>Since the deletion of <italic>Sirt4</italic> attenuated the post-injury fibrotic response, we next determined whether <italic>Sirt4</italic> OE can aggravate the response. We introduced SIRT4 into WT mouse kidneys using the adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector with a tubule-specific <italic>Ksp-cadherin</italic> promoter, and AAV9-<italic>Ksp</italic>-<italic>null</italic> transfection was used as the control treatment.

The expression levels of kidney fibrosis markers (CCN2, FN1, COL1A1, COL3A1, and α-SMA) and the decreased E-cadherin were also significantly enhanced in <italic>Sirt4</italic> OE mice compared to those in the control mice following kidney injury (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, E, H</xref>).

<label>3.5.</label><title>SIRT4 interacts with U2AF2 under TGF-β stimulation</title>
<p>To explore the action mechanism of SIRT4 in kidney fibrosis, we first identified the proteins interacting with SIRT4 in TECs. We employed rapid immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins (RIME), which is an efficient and unbiased proteomic approach for identifying interacting proteins. Human TECs were treated with TGF-β1 or the control (DMSO) for 24 h, followed by protein-DNA crosslinking in 1% formaldehyde. Cells were sonicated, followed by immunoprecipitation with an SIRT4 antibody (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). A total of 1081 unique proteins copurified with SIRT4 were identified using mass spectrometry. We only considered SIRT4-associated proteins that occurred in three of three independent replicates and excluded any proteins that appeared in any one of the IgG control RIMEs. As a result, we selected of 22 SIRT4-associated proteins. Notably, the SIRT4 interaction involved numerous specific nuclear localization proteins, such as PUF60, U2AF2, RPS2, TSR1, ZC3H15, and SART1. Of these, U2AF2 and PUF60 function cooperatively in pre-mRNA splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The levels (normalized) of PUF60 and U2AF2 are shown in the <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>. We next determined whether PUF60 or U2AF2 was recruited to SIRT4 in TECs stimulated with TGF-β1. Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated SIRT4 with anti-PUF60 and -U2AF2 antibodies showed that TGF-β1 treatment resulted in an interaction among SIRT4, PUF60, and U2AF2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref><bold>, left panel)</bold>. Whole-kidney tissue lysates consistently showed an interaction among SIRT4, PUF60, and U2AF2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref><bold>, middle panel)</bold>. As U2AF2 has been shown to interact with PUF60<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we tested whether SIRT4 interacts with either of the two proteins via the U2AF2-PUF60 interaction. The interaction between SIRT4 and PUF60 was abolished in U2af2-knockout cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). However, the interaction of SIRT4 and U2AF2 was not affected in <italic>Puf60</italic> knockdown cells (data not shown). Furthermore, exogenous co-IP revealed an interaction between SIRT4 and U2AF2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref><bold>, right panel)</bold>. Together, these results suggest that SIRT4 interacts with U2AF2 under TGF-β1 stimulation or kidney injury.</p>

<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that SIRT4 can show weak ADP-ribosyltransferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> as well as substrate-specific deacetylase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, akin to that observed for SIRT6 and SIRT7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Hence, we tested whether SIRT4 regulates the ADP-ribosylation or acetylation of U2AF2. Our results showed that <italic>Sirt4</italic> OE reduced the levels of acetylated U2AF2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). However, the ADP-ribosylation of U2AF2 was extremely low in both SIRT4 OE and control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). According to the database Compendium of Protein Lysine Modifications 4.0, lysine (K) 70, 276, 292, 413, 453, and 462 on U2AF2 can be acetylated. Hence, we mutated all six K residues to arginine (R), which mimics the deacetylated state of the protein. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, the U2AF2-K413R mutant showed reduced acetylation compared to U2AF2 WT. Conservation analysis of U2AF2 indicated that K413 is a highly conserved site spanning from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> to <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Next, we examined whether U2AF2 K413 is the key acetylation site in response to TGF-β1 stimulation. TGF-β1 treatment reduced the levels of acetylated U2AF2 in WT but had little effect in the K413R mutant U2AF2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). Consistently, U2AF2 acetylation decreased in the kidney following injury (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). Interestingly, U2AF2 acetylation was also remarkably reduced in the cells subjected to serum starvation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (induced by tunicamycin), viral infection [poly (I:C)], or DNA damage stress (induced by cisplatin) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). These results collectively demonstrate that U2AF2 deacetylation occurs universally in response to cellular stress.</p>

<sec id="s3g">
<label>3.7.</label><title>U2AF2 acetylation affects the interaction of U2AF and SF3B complexes</title>
<p>Next, we investigate the effect of U2AF2 acetylation at K413 on the formation of the U2AF complex and recruitment of the SF3B complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>). The expression of K413R did not regulate the stability of the SF3B and U2AF components. Next, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay to detect the interaction between the U2AF and SF3B complexes using U2AF2-WT- and U2AF2-K413R-expressing cells. Interestingly, U2AF2 K413R interacted strongly with components of the SF3B complex and with U2AF1 compared to that with U2AF2 WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>). Notably, the interaction of U2AF2 and U2AF1 was not obviously regulated after RNAase treatment, while the interaction of U2AF2 and SF3B complex was reduced following RNase treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>). These findings implied the interactions between U2AF1 and U2AF2 were independent of RNA binding, while the interaction of U2AF2 and SF3B complex were dependent on RNA binding. As a component of the U2AF complex, U2AF2 interacts with U2AF1 to form the U2AF complex, which recognizes the 3′ splice site (3’ SS) of U2 introns and recruits U2 snRNP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>).

<label>3.8.</label><title>U2AF2 acetylation under cellular stress is not HAT1-dependent</title>
<p>To identify the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) responsible for U2AF2 acetylation under cellular stress, we co-transfected U2AF2 with different HATs, namely CBP, p300, HAT1, P/CAF, KAT5, and KAT8. Of these, HAT1 mainly promoted U2AF2 acetylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>). Both endogenous and exogenous co-IP results showed an interaction between HAT1 and U2AF2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref>). Further experiments were performed to determine whether U2AF2 acetylation in response to stress is dependent on HAT1. We found that knockdown of <italic>Hat1</italic> reduced U2AF2 acetylation, while <italic>Hat1</italic> OE induced the acetylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref>). Furthermore, U2AF2 acetylation was not affected by enzymatically defective HAT1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4P</xref>). Although U2AF2 interacted with HAT1, the interaction was altered weakly under TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Q</xref><bold>, left panel)</bold>. Consistently, under <italic>Hat1</italic> knockdown conditions as well, TGF-β1 stimulation further reduced U2AF2 acetylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Q</xref><bold>, right panel)</bold>. Thus, although HAT1 acetylated U2AF2, the decreased acetylation level of U2AF2 by TGF-β1 stimulation was independent of HAT1.</p>

<label>3.9.</label><title>SIRT4 deacetylates U2AF2 at Lys413</title>
<p>As SIRT4 interacted with U2AF2, we intend to figure out the directly role of SIRT4 in U2AF2 acetylation. We found that SIRT4 OE reduced U2AF2 acetylation, whereas SIRT4 knockdown increased its acetylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Additionally, TGF-β1 stimulated the interaction between SIRT4 and U2AF2 in a dose dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Consistently, the TGF-β1-induced decrease in U2AF2 acetylation was blocked by the knockdown of <italic>Sirt4</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). In contrast, SIRT4 OE further enhanced the TGF-β1-induced U2AF2 deacetylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Compared to U2AF2 WT, U2AF2 K413R blocked the SIRT4 OE-induced deacetylation of U2AF2 as well as the interaction of U2AF2 with U2AF1 and the SF3B complex under TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Accordingly, these phenotypes induced by SIRT4 OE were restricted when an enzyme-defective SIRT4 (SIRT4 H161Y) was used (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Molecular docking simulations showed that U2AF2 Lys413 was present at the contact surface between SIRT4 and U2AF2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), further demonstrating that SIRT4 can interact with U2AF2 to promote its deacetylation.</p>

<p>To determine whether S4KO alleviates renal fibrosis by upregulating the acetylation of U2AF2 in mouse kidney, we crossed Sirt4<sup>+/−</sup> and U2af2<sup>+/−</sup> mice to generate Sirt4<sup>−/−</sup>U2af2<sup>−/−</sup> (DKO) mice and then performed UUO surgery. No body weight differences were noted due to genetic manipulation (data not shown).

<label>3.10.</label><title>SIRT4 deacetylates U2AF2 at K413 to regulate <italic>CCN2</italic> expression and pre-mRNA splicing</title>
<p>U2AF1 S34F and Q157R mutations have been reported to compromise U2AF2–RNA interactions, resulting predominantly in intron retention and exon exclusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Hence, we hypothesized that the SIRT4-mediated deacetylation of U2AF2 participates in the regulation of these processes. RNA-sequencing was performed to identify the changes in gene expression and alternative splicing in adenovirus-mediated SIRT4<sup>OE</sup>-transfected cells or adenovirus-Ctrl-transfected cells after TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Surprisingly, SIRT4 stimulation upregulated several genes (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; Table EV1) that are involved in mRNA processing and the TGF-β signaling pathway. A total of 142 differentially expressed genes (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0005) were identified (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Meanwhile, 248 genes showed differential intron retention (FDR &lt; 0.05; Table EV2) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). This analysis revealed four genes that were common between the differentially expressed genes and the differentially spliced genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). <italic>Ccn2</italic>, one of these four genes, ranked third among the all upregulated genes (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0005) after SIRT4 overexpression. Given that intron retention due to abnormal splicing can trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, gene expression could be affected by a change in splicing pattern. The mRNA levels of <italic>CCN2</italic> were remarkably increased in SIRT4<sup>OE</sup> cells but reduced in <italic>Sirt4-</italic>knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In addition, <italic>CCN2</italic> mRNA levels were significantly increased in U2AF2 K413R-transfected cells but remarkably reduced in U2AF2 K413Q [lysine to glutamine (Q) mutant for protein hyperacetylation mimic]-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In line with the mRNA levels, SIRT4 OE significantly elevated the protein levels of CCN2 in U2AF2 WT or U2AF2 K453Q-transfected cells but not in U2AF2-K413Q or K413R-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C, D</xref>), suggesting that only the U2AF2 acetylation at K413 is efficient to regulate CCN2 expression.</p>

<p>CCN2 is transcriptionally regulated by Sp1 in response to TGF-β1 stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, we examined whether SIRT4 induced CCN2 expression through transcription co-activator function. An analysis of the promoter region of <italic>Ccn2</italic> (including Sp1 binding site) showed that there was no increase in the promoter activity following overexpression of U2AF2 WT, U2AF2-K413R or U2AF2-K413Q upon TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), implying that the SIRT4-induced CCN2 expression is not transcription dependent. According to the RNA sequencing data, SIRT4 stimulation increased the efficiency of <italic>Ccn2</italic> pre-mRNA exon2/intron2 and exon3/intron3 splicing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Upon analyzing the gene sequence of <italic>Ccn2</italic>, we found that both <italic>Ccn2</italic> introns 2 and 3 contain a TGA stop codon, implying that they could trigger the degradation of abnormal mRNAs. Furthermore, we confirmed that SIRT4 knockdown or U2AF2 K413Q increased the retention index of <italic>Ccn2</italic> introns 2 and 3, whereas SIRT4 OE or U2AF2 K413 reduced the retention index (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G, H</xref>). U2AF2 K413R or K413Q impeded the changes in intron 2 and 3 retention indices of <italic>Ccn2</italic> caused by SIRT4 OE or <italic>Sirt4</italic> knockdown, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G, H</xref>). Next, we assessed whether U2AF2 regulates CCN2 expression by regulating mRNA stability. We treated SIRT4 OE or <italic>Sirt4</italic> knockdown cells with Actinomycin D to block transcription and measured <italic>Ccn2</italic> mRNA stability over time. The mRNA stability of <italic>Ccn2</italic> was significantly enhanced in SIRT4 OE cells, whereas it was reduced in <italic>Sirt4</italic> knockdown cells compared to that in control cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). As expected, compared to that in U2AF2 WT-transfected cells, U2AF2 K413R increased the mRNA stability of <italic>Ccn2</italic>, while U2AF2 K413Q reduced its stability (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). In addition, K413R and K413Q repressed the changes in the stability of <italic>Ccn2</italic> mRNA caused by SIRT4 OE or <italic>Sirt4</italic> knockdown, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). Next, a RiboIP experiment was performed wherein U2AF2 was immunoprecipitated to determine whether it can bind endogenous <italic>Ccn2</italic> transcripts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). SIRT4 OE enhanced the interaction between U2AF2 and <italic>Ccn2</italic> pre-mRNA (indicated by the PCR product containing intron 2 and exon 3 or intron 3 and exon 4) in U2AF2 WT-transfected cells but had little effect on their interaction in U2AF2 K413R-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). This indicates that the SIRT4-induced deacetylation of U2AF2 at K413 increases CCN2 expression by regulating the alternative splicing of <italic>Ccn2</italic>.</p>

<p>SIRT4 is located in the mitochondrial matrix under normal conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. A previous study showed that SIRT4 translocates from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm upon Wnt stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Hence, we conducted an immunofluorescence assay and organelle separation experiment to compare the localization of SIRT4 before and after TGF-β1 treatment. Interestingly, SIRT4 localization changed from mitochondria to the cytoplasm or even nucleus at after 12 h of TGF-β1 treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A–C</xref>). Moreover, TGF-β1 stimulation did not induce U2AF2 release from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, even after 24 h (data not shown). Other stimulations such as serum starvation, tunicamycin, poly (I: C), and cisplatin also induced this translocation of SIRT4 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). It is well known that BAX and BAK are two key molecules of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. They form polymers on the mitochondrial outer membrane and mediate the release of mitochondrial contents such as mtDNA, mitochondrial dsRNA, and cytochrome c<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested whether the TGF-β1-induced release of SIRT4 is dependent on the BAX/BAK oligomeric pore. Notably, BAX or BAK deficiency or MSN-125 (an effective oligomeric inhibitor of Bax and Bak) treatment almost abolished the release of SIRT4 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm as well as the upregulation of <italic>Ccn2</italic> under TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E, F</xref>). As expected, the <italic>in vivo</italic> results showed that MSN-125 inhibited the translocation of SIRT4 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm in the kidneys of mice following UUO surgery (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>).

<p>As SIRT4 showed nuclear localization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>) and interacted with the nuclear protein U2AF2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) under TGF-β1 stimulation, we investigated the mechanisms underlying SIRT4 accumulation in the nucleus. Pretreatment of TECs with LY290042 (phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor), SU6656 (Src inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and U0126 (MEK/ERK inhibitor) blocked TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of AKT, c-Src, c-Jun, and ERK1/2, respectively. Immunoblotting analyses showed that only U0126 treatment abrogated the TGF-β1-induced nuclear translocation of SIRT4 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref><bold>, upper panel)</bold>. Compared to the amount of cytosolic SIRT4, nuclear SIRT4 is present in a small portion (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref><bold>, bottom panel)</bold>. These results were further supported by the immunofluorescence analyses (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>).

<p>To further determine the relationship between ERK1/2 and SIRT4, we performed a Co-IP assay and found that TGF-β1 treatment resulted in the binding of ERK1/2 to SIRT4 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). MAP kinases bind to their substrates through a docking groove comprising an acidic common docking (CD) domain and glutamic acid-aspartic acid (ED) pockets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Our results showed that mutation of either the ERK2 CD domain (D316/319N) or the ED pocket (T157/158E) reduced the binding to endogenous SIRT4 compared to that in the WT ERK2 control (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). Combined mutations at both the CD domain and ED pocket (T/E-D/N) abrogated the binding of ERK2 to SIRT4 entirely (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>), indicating that ERK2 binds SIRT4 through its docking groove. Furthermore, the server provided docking information regarding SIRT4– ERK2, indicating SIRT4 and ERK2 CD domain and ED pocket interactions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). ERK substrates often have a docking domain characterized by a cluster of basic residues, followed by an LXL motif (L represents Leu, but can also be Ile or Val; X represents any amino acid)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. An analysis of the docking information of SIRT4 - ERK2 and the amino acid sequence of SIRT4 revealed the putative ERK-binding sequence 77-EKVGLYARTDRR-88 and 203-GDVFLSE-209, which contain LXL motifs at V79/L81 and V205/L207, respectively. Immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitated Flag-SIRT4 proteins with an anti-ERK1/2 antibody showed that a SIRT4 V205/L207 mutant, but not a SIRT4 V79/L81 mutant, markedly reduced its binding to ERK1/2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>). These results indicate that the ERK2 docking groove binds to a CD domain in SIRT4 at V205/L207. Sequence analysis of SIRT4 revealed that it contains an ERK consensus phosphorylation motif (Ser-Pro) at the S36/P37 residues. Notably, S36A mutation completely abrogated the TGF-β1-dependent phosphorylation of SIRT4 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H</xref>). Consistently, pretreatment with U0126 blocked the TGF-β1-induced S36 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SIRT4 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8I</xref>). In addition, expression of constitutively active MEK1 Q56P with WT ERK2, but not of ERK2 K52R, induced SIRT4 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8J</xref>). These results indicate that ERK2 specifically phosphorylates SIRT4.</p>
<p>Notably, we found that SIRT4 contains a potential nuclear localization signal (NLSs), a single type containing 3–5 basic amino acids with the weak consensus Lys-Arg/Lys-X-Arg/Lys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, 248-KRVK-251. We mutated the K248/251 and R249 residues in the putative NLS sequences of SIRT4 to alanine (named as mNLS). Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence analyses showed that Flag-SIRT4-mNLS, unlike the WT SIRT4, was unable to translocate into the nucleus upon TGF-β1 treatment (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8K, L</xref>). These results indicate that the NLS in SIRT4 is essential for TGF-β1-induced nuclear translocation of SIRT4. Importin α functions as an adaptor and links NLS-containing proteins to importin β, which then docks the ternary complex at the nuclear-pore complex to facilitate the translocation of these proteins across the nuclear envelope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Six importin α family members (α1, α3, α4, α5, α6 and α7) have been identified in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We found that the endogenous SIRT4 only binds importin α1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8M</xref>). Importin a1/Rch1 is barely detectable in the glomeruli of normal SD rat kidneys but is highly expressed in tubular cells, and the importin α1/Rch1 staining is significantly enhanced in the kidneys of diabetic rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Depletion of importin α1 with <italic>Rch1</italic> (coding for importin α1) shRNA (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8N</xref>) largely blocked the TGF-β1-induced nuclear translocation of SIRT4 and resulted in the accumulation of phosphorylated SIRT4 in the cytosol (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8N</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, U0126 restrained the <italic>Sirt4<sup>OE</sup></italic>-induced nuclear translocation of SIRT4 <bold>(Fig. S3A, B)</bold>. Furthermore, SIRT4 S36A or SIRT4 mNLS overexpression failed to accumulate SIRT4 in the nucleus and aggravated renal fibrosis in S4KO UUO mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8O–R</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that TGF-β1-induced SIRT4 nuclear translocation is mediated by SIRT4 phosphorylation at S36, which is regulated by the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.</p>

Since knockout or complete inhibition of SIRT4 may not be an advisable therapeutic strategy, we constructed exosomes containing anti-SIRT4 antibodies (αSRIT4) to treat UUO mice.

<p>Reportedly, the initial stage of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in which SIRT4 translocates from mitochondria into the cytoplasm leads to β-catenin protein accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. To determine whether the β-catenin accumulation is involved in the SIRT4-mediated kidney fibrosis <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated mice expressing SIRT4<sup>OE</sup> TECs and subjected them to UUO surgery with or without MSAB treatment (MSAB binds to β-catenin and promotes its degradation).

Moreover, downregulation of β-catenin accumulation by MSAB can inhibit renal fibrosis in WT mice, but not the SIRT4<sup>OE</sup> mice <bold>(Fig. S5A–C).</bold> These findings suggest that SIRT4-mediated the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis is independent of β-catenin accumulation.</p>

<p>Renal fibrosis, especially tubulointerstitial fibrosis, is an inevitable common pathway of progressive chronic kidney disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. However, there is a lack information regarding the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, which hampers the development of effective therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that the nuclear translocation of SIRT4 is a prime initiator of kidney fibrosis. SIRT4 significantly accumulates in the nucleus during fibrosis following obstructed nephropathy and renal ischemia reperfusion injury. Global knockout or target deletion of <italic>Sirt4</italic> in TECs attenuated UUO-induced kidney fibrosis, whereas TEC-specific SIRT4<sup>OE</sup> aggravated the fibrosis. Mechanistically, we found that TGF-β1 promoted SIRT4 release from mitochondria through the BAX/BAK pore. Furthermore, TGF-β1 activation resulted in the nuclear translocation of SIRT4, which was mediated by the ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of SIRT4 at S36, and consequently the binding of SIRT4 to importin α1. Nuclear SIRT4 deacetylates U2AF2 and promotes U2 snRNP formation, which promoting the <italic>Ccn2</italic> pre-mRNA splicing, ultimately leading to the increased CCN2 expression. In vivo, SIRT4 S36 or NLS mutants blocked SIRT4<sup>OE</sup>-aggravated kidney fibrosis in UUO mice, which implied that SIRT4 nuclear translocation plays a significant role in the progression of kidney fibrosis.</p>
<p>Acetyl-CoA is an important energy-rich metabolite for homeostasis. In normal states, abundant acetyl-CoA in the cytosol shuttles freely in the nucleus or mitochondria to modulate the acetylation of histone or non-histone proteins. A rapid reduction in total acetyl-CoA levels in renal cells is observed after TGF-β1 stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Non-enzymatic acetylation levels are strongly reduced by acetyl-CoA. Under such circumstances, few exceptional hyperacetylated proteins can function as key regulators of kidney fibrosis development. In accordance with this hypothesis, we found that U2AF2 acetylation decreased and U2 snRNP formation increased after deacetylation of U2AF2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H–K</xref>). Strikingly, U2AF2-K413, the deacetylation form, promotes the pre-mRNA splicing and expression of <italic>Ccn2</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C, D</xref>), supporting the idea that acetylation of U2AF2 is responsible for fibrotic reaction under TGF-β1. Additionally, a recent study showed that U2AF2 can directly bind and stabilize circNCAPG, which participates in the nuclear translocation of ras responsive element binding protein 1, thereby activating the TGF-β pathway and promoting glioma progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Taking this into consideration, we speculate that U2AF2 may be a positive feedback regulator of TGF-β1, although further investigations are required to ascertain this.</p>
<p>SIRT4 is mainly located in the mitochondria and participates in various mitochondrial metabolic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Some studies have revealed a potential role of SIRT4 in fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In heart, loss of SIRT4 has been found to result in the development of fibrosis. These studies indicated the protective role of SIRT4 in mitochondria. In recent research, the authors found that SIRT4 abolish can ameliorate CCl4-induced hepatic encephalopathy phenotypes, which was mediated by downregulating detoxify ammonia through the urea cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. In our study, we indicated that SIRT4 translocates from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, which was caused by TGF-β induced mitochondria damage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Furthermore, the cytoplasm SIRT4 was phosphorylated by ERK2, which is a downstream of TGF-β signaling (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A-J</xref>). The phosphorylated SIRT4 further translocated to the nuclear for promoting CCN2 expression by regulating the alternative splicing, then accelerated the kidney fibrosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Some studies have shown that SIRT4 exerts a protective effect on podocytes. SIRT4 OE prevents glucose-induced podocyte apoptosis and ROS production, thereby alleviating diabetic kidney disease (DKD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Furthermore, FOXM1 transcriptionally activates SIRT4 and inhibits NF-κB signaling and the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome to alleviate kidney injury and podocyte pyroptosis in DKD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. In the present study, we suggest a profibrotic role of SIRT4 in TECs, which was contributed by upregulated expression of CCN2. Although these are complicatedly related to one another in CKD pathophysiology, injury to TECs is considered a core element that initiates progressive fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Therefore, we indicated that it is SRIT4 may perform different role in different kinds of cells or subcellular organelles. Moreover, further studies on the role of SIRT4 in DKD are needed to evaluate the safety of anti-SIRT4 therapy.</p>
<p>Overall, our study reveals that TGF-β1 activation resulted in the nuclear translocation of SIRT4, mediated by the ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of SIRT4 at S36, and consequently the binding of SIRT4 to importin α1. In nucleus, SIRT4-mediated U2AF2 deacetylation at K413, a key protein for the spliceosome, acts as a responder under TGF-β1 stimulation. SIRT4 promotes CCN2 expression through alternative pre-mRNA splicing by deacetylation U2AF2, which contributes to the progression of kidney fibrosis. These findings expand the field of epigenetic regulation of fibrogenic gene expression and provide a potential therapeutic target for kidney fibrosis.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Protein extraction and Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were prepared from cells or kidneys using a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein isolation kit (Cat# 78833, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, the tube was vortexed vigorously in the highest setting for 15 s to fully suspend the cell pellet (or tissues were homogenized in PBS). The tubes were incubated on ice for 10 min. Next, ice-cold cytoplasmic extraction reagent II solution was added to the tubes. The tube was vortexed and incubated on ice. The tube was centrifuged for 5 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge (∼16,000 × g), and the supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was transferred to a tube. The insoluble (pellet) fraction, which contains nuclei, was suspended in ice-cold nuclear extraction reagent and then vortexed at the highest setting for 15 s. The sample was placed on ice and vortexed for 15 s every 10 min for 40 min. The tube was centrifuged at maximum speed (∼16,000 × g) in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) fraction was transferred to a tube.</p>
<p>Mitochondria were extracted using a Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, 2 ×10<sup>7</sup> cells were pelleted by centrifuging the harvested cell suspension, and then mitochondria isolation reagent was added to the cell pellets. The cell resuspension was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and then the supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 ml tube and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was transferred to a new tube, and the pellet contained the isolated mitochondria. The pellet was further lysed to yield the final mitochondrial lysate. The extracted proteins were prepared for subsequent western blotting analysis.</p>
<p>For western blot analysis, 50 µg of lysate was loaded onto sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Proteins were analyzed with their corresponding specific antibodies. Densitometry analysis was performed using Quantity One® Software and quantified relative to the loading control, Tubulin.</p>

<label>2.5</label><title>RIME</title>
<p>The procedure was performed as previously described. The hTECs (2 × 10<sup>7</sup>) were treated with DMSO or DMOG (1mM) for 8 h and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 8min and quenched by 0.125M glycine. Cells were harvested and the nuclear fraction was extracted. After sonication, the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with bead-prebound SIRT4 antibody (NB100-479, Novus Biologicals). Precipitated proteins in 30 μl of 100mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate were reduced in 2.5mM dithiothreitol at 60 °C for 1 h, then alkylated with 5mM iodoacetamide in the dark at room temperature for 15min. Proteins were digested with 20 ng/μl Trypsin/LysC (Promega) at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were desalted on Oasis HLB μ-elution plates (Waters), eluted with 65 % acetonitrile/0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry using a nano-Easy LC 1000 interfaced with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tandem mass spectra were extracted by Proteome Discoverer version 2.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and searched against the SwissProt_Full_Synchronized_2018_08 database using Mascot version 2.6.2 (Matrix Science). Mascot “.dat” files were compiled in Scaffold version 3 (Proteome Software) to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if false discovery rate (FDR) was less than 1%, based on a concatenated decoy database search by the Peptide Prophet algorithm with Scaffold delta-mass correction.</p>

The cell homogenates were then centrifuged at 13,000g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a shaker with primary antibodies (anti-Flag, anti-SIRT4, anti-HA, anti-U2AF2 or anti-IgG). To ensure complete saturation of the primary antibodies, sufficient cell lysates were cultured and collected for IP. The mixture of antibodies and proteins was subsequently incubated with protein A/G-agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#: 78610) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed 5-6 times with cold IP buffer and resuspended in loading buffer.

<p>RIP is a powerful method to investigate the interactions between RNA and RNA binding proteins in vivo by immunoprecipitating RNA-protein complexes using specific antibodies against RNA binding proteins. An example of the RIP protocol is as follows: Covalently conjugate protein-specific antibody to the beads. Wash extensively with lysis buffer. Collect cell lysate and incubate with antibody conjugated beads allowing RNA-protein complexes formation. Use normal IgG as negative control. Incubate the lysate for 2-4 hours at 4°C with gentle rotation. Wash beads stringently with ice-cold lysis buffer containing RNase inhibitors, protease inhibitors and nonionic detergents. Perform 4-6 quick washes. Elute RNA-protein complexes from beads, generally with 1% SDS buffer heated to 95°C for 5min. Extract RNA with phenol/chloroform.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Yang et al report a novel regulatory role of SIRT4 in the progression of kidney fibrosis. The authors showed that in the fibrotic kidney, SIRT4 exhibited an increased nuclear localization. Deletion of Sirt4 in renal tubule epithelium attenuated the extent of kidney fibrosis following injury, while overexpression of SIRT4 aggravates kidney fibrosis. Employing a battery of in vitro and in vivo experiments, the authors demonstrated that SIRT4 interacts with U2AF2 in the nucleus upon TGF-β1 stimulation or kidney injury and deacetylates U2AF2 at K413, resulting in elevated CCN2 expression through alternative splicing of Ccn2 gene to promote kidney fibrosis. The authors further showed that the translocation of SIRT4 is through the BAX/BAK pore complex and is dependent on the ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of SIRT4 at S36, and consequently the binding of SIRT4 to importin α1. This fundamental work substantially advances our understanding of the progression of kidney fibrosis and uncovers a novel SIRT4-U2AF2-CCN2 axis as a potential therapeutic target for kidney fibrosis.</p>

<p>Overall, this is an extensive, well-performed study. The results are convincing, and the conclusions are mostly well supported by the data. The message is interesting to a wider community working on kidney fibrosis, protein acetylation, and SIRT4 biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript could be further strengthened if the authors could address a few points listed below:</p>
<p>(1) In the results part 3.9, an in vitro deacetylation assay employing recombinant SIRT4 and U2AF2 should be included to support the conclusion that SIRT4 is a deacetylase of U2AF2. Similarly, an in vitro binding assay can be included to confirm whether SIRT4 and U2AF2 are directly interacted.</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 6D, the Western Blot data using U2AF2-K453Q is confusing and is quite disconnected from the rest of the data and not explained. This data can be removed or explained why U2AF2-K453Q is employed here.</p>
<p>(3) Although ERK inhibitor U0126 blocked the nuclear translocation of SIRT4 in vivo, have the authors checked whether treatment with U0126 could affect the expression of kidney fibrosis markers in UUO mice?</p>
<p>(4) The format of gene and protein abbreviations in the manuscript should be standardized.</p>
<p>(5) There are a few grammar issues throughout the manuscript. The English/grammar could be stronger, thus improving the overall accessibility of the science to readers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents a novel and significant investigation into the role of SIRT4 For CCN2 expression in response to TGF-β by modulating U2AF2-mediated alternative splicing and its impact on the development of kidney fibrosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors' main conclusion is that SIRT4 plays a role in kidney fibrosis by regulating CCN2 expression via pre-mRNA splicing. Additionally, the study reveals that SIRT4 translocates from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm through the BAX/BAK pore under TGF-β stimulation. In the cytoplasm, TGF-β activated the ERK pathway and induced the phosphorylation of SIRT4 at Ser36, further promoting its interaction with importin α1 and subsequent nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, SIRT4 was found to deacetylate U2AF2 at K413, facilitating the splicing of CCN2 pre-mRNA to promote CCN2 protein expression. Overall, the findings are fully convincing. The current study, to some extent, shows potential importance in this field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Exosomes containing anti-SIRT4 antibodies were found to effectively mitigate UUO-induced kidney fibrosis in mice. While the protein loading capacity and loading methods were not mentioned.</p>
<p>(2) The method section is incomplete, and many methods like cell culture, cell transfection, gene expression profiling analysis, and splicing analysis, were not introduced in detail.</p>
<p>(3) The authors should compare their results with previous studies and mention clearly how their work is important in comparison to what has already been reported in the Discussion section.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Yang et al reported in this paper that TGF-beta induces SIRT4 activation, TGF-beta activated SIRT4 then modulates U2AF2 alternative splicing, U2AF2 in turn causes CCN2 for expression. The mechanism is described as this: mitochondrial SIRT4 transport into the cytoplasm in response to TGF-β stimulation, phosphorylated by ERK in the cytoplasm, and pathway and then undergo nuclear translocation by forming the complex with importin α1. In the nucleus, SIRT4 can then deacetylate U2AF2 at K413 to facilitate the splicing of CCN2 pre-mRNA to promote CCN2 protein expression. Moreover, they used exosomes to deliver Sirt4 antibodies to mitigate renal fibrosis in a mouse model. TGF-beta has been widely reported for its role in fibrosis induction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>TGF-beta induction of SIRT4 translocation from mitochondria to nuclei for epigenetics or gene regulation remains largely unknown. The findings presented here that SIRT4 is involved in U2AF2 deacetylation and CCN2 expression are interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>SIRT4 plays a critical role in mitochondria involved in respiratory chain reaction. This role of SIRT4 is critically involved in many cell functions. It is hard to rule out such a mitochondrial activity of SIRT4 in renal fibrosis. Moreover, the major concern is what kind of message mitochondrial SIRT4 proteins receive from TGF-beta. Although nuclear SIRT4 is increased in response to TNF treatment, it is likely de novo synthesized SIRT4 proteins can also undergo nuclear translocation upon cytokine stimulation. TGF-beta-induced mitochondrial calcium uptake and acetyl-CoA should be evaluated for calcium and acetyl-CoA may contribute to the gene expression regulation in nuclei.</p>
