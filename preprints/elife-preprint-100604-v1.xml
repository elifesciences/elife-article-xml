<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Metabolic pathways are remodeled in response to energy and other homeostatic demands and are dynamically regulated during embryonic development, suggestive of a role in guiding cellular differentiation. Here, we show that glycolytic flux is required and sufficient to bias multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) to acquire a rod photoreceptor fate in the murine retina. In an RPC-specific conditional knock-out of <italic>Phosphatase and tensin homolog</italic> (<italic>Pten-</italic>cKO) and in an RPC-specific conditional gain-of-function of dominant active <italic>PFKB3</italic> (cyto<italic>PFKB3</italic>), glycolytic gene expression and activity are elevated, correlating with precocious rod photoreceptor differentiation and outer segment maturation. Conversely, glycolytic inhibition in retinal explants, achieved either with 2-deoxy-d-glucose, a competitive inhibitor of glucose metabolism, by lowering media pH, which disables PKM2, a rate-limiting enzyme, or by inhibiting lactate/H<sup>+</sup> symporters, which lowers intracellular pH, suppresses RPC proliferation and photoreceptor differentiation. Mechanistically, we show that Wnt signaling, the top-upregulated pathway in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas, is a glycolysis-dependent pathway. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of Wnt signaling using a <italic>Ctnnb1-</italic>cKO phenocopies glycolytic inhibition, suppressing RPC proliferation, photoreceptor differentiation and outer segment maturation. Thus, developmental rewiring of glycolytic flux modulates Wnt signaling to drive rod photoreceptor differentiation and maturation, an instructive role that may be exploited therapeutically for cell replacement strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple neural cell types comprise the mature retina, all of which must be produced in correct numbers with precise identities for effective visual processing. Included are rod and cone photoreceptors, the light-sensing neurons; amacrine, bipolar and horizontal cells, retinal interneurons; ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina; and supportive glial cells known as Müller glia. Clonal analyses across vertebrate species have revealed that all seven retinal cell types are derived from multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that give rise to clones of varying sizes and compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alexiades &amp; Cepko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fekete et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gomes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Holt et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jensen &amp; Raff, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Turner &amp; Cepko, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Turner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wetts &amp; Fraser, 1988</xref>). In mice, RPCs begin to differentiate at embryonic day (E) 12, completing their proliferation and differentiation by postnatal day (P) 10 −12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cepko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Young, 1985</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Symmetric proliferative (P/P) divisions predominate early in development, followed by a shift to asymmetric (P/D) divisions that renew the RPC pool and generate differentiated cells, and finally, by symmetric differentiative (D/D) divisions that generate two postmitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baye &amp; Link, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nerli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Paolini et al., 2015</xref>). At each stage, individual RPC fate decisions are largely stochastic, albeit with temporal biases, such that the seven retinal cell types are born in overlapping windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gomes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">He et al., 2012</xref>). Ganglion, horizontal and cone cells are born in the earliest embryonic stages, followed closely by amacrine cells, and finally by bipolar cells, rods and Müller glia, which mainly differentiate in the first two postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rapaport et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Young, 1985</xref>). How RPCs interpret extrinsic signals and intrinsic contextual cues to ultimately produce the correct numbers of each retinal cell type remains incompletely understood.</p>
<p>Cellular energy and precursor metabolites are produced by the metabolism of glucose, which is converted into pyruvate via glycolysis. Glycolysis is a multi-step enzymatic process that occurs in the cytosol, does not require O<sub>2</sub>, and produces 2 molecules of ATP per glucose molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hanna et al., 2022</xref>). Pyruvate is either transported to mitochondria for further oxidation to drive oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by the electron transport chain, or converted to lactate and secreted out of the cell. OXPHOS is an O<sub>2</sub>-dependent metabolic pathway that produces 30-38 ATP molecules for each glucose molecule, and hence, produces more cellular energy than glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hanna et al., 2022</xref>). Yet, the majority of vertebrate retinal cells rely on glycolysis as the main metabolic pathway, even in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hurley et al., 2015</xref>). The preference for aerobic glycolysis has been termed the Warburg effect, an adaptation commonly observed in cancer cells that is also used by some ‘normal’ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Warburg, 1956a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">1956b</xref>). Included are dividing neural progenitor cells, which use aerobic glycolysis for energy production across tissue types, including in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hanna et al., 2022</xref>). In Xenopus, RPCs rely on glycogen stores as a fuel source for glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>), whereas in human retinal organoids, glucose is the essential fuel, and is required for RPC expansion at the earliest stages of optic vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Finally, during murine retinal development, mitophagy clears mitochondria to drive a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, which supports early RPC differentiation into ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Esteban-Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). However, whether metabolic reprogramming and levels of glycolytic activity influence RPC differentiation decisions during later developmental stages is not known.</p>
<p>Metabolic reprogramming, or alterations in metabolic rates and/or pathways, occurs in stem and progenitor cells during tissue development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tatapudy et al., 2017</xref>), including in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Esteban-Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). In a few lineages, metabolism has been ascribed instructive roles in driving cellular differentiation, including in skeletal muscle and helper T cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Peng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tatapudy et al., 2017</xref>). In these lineages, glycolysis is important for more than energy production, for instance, modifying histone acetylation in murine skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>), activating Wnt signaling to control chick neuromesodermal progenitor cell fate choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>), and altering protein subcellular localization in the murine presomitic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>). To further investigate how developmental signaling pathways intersect with metabolism to control RPC fate choice in the retina, we focused on PTEN, an intracellular protein and lipid phosphatase with pleiotropic actions, including the direct inhibition of glycolysis through dephosphorylation and consequent inactivation of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Qian et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Pten</italic> conditional knockout (KO) retinas, RPCs proliferate excessively early in embryonic development, accompanied by the accelerated differentiation of photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cantrup et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tachibana et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that elevated glycolysis accompanies the accelerated RPC differentiation kinetics in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas, which ultimately results in the precocious depletion of the RPC pool. Similarly, in an RPC-specific, conditional gain-of-function model of dominant active <italic>PFKB3</italic> (cyto<italic>PFKB3</italic>), glycolytic gene expression and activity are elevated, correlating with precocious rod photoreceptor differentiation and outer segment (OS) maturation. Conversely, multiple inhibitors of glycolysis reduce RPC proliferation and photoreceptor differentiation. Finally, we found that glycolysis is required and sufficient to control Wnt signaling, and show that Wnt activity is required for rod photoreceptor differentiation and OS maturation. We have thus uncovered a novel glycolytic flux-Wnt axis as an important regulator of RPC fate choice.</p>

<title>Elevated glycolysis and accelerated rod photoreceptor differentiation correlate in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas</title>
<p>Neural progenitor cells in the embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Khacho &amp; Slack, 2018</xref>) and retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>) preferentially use glycolysis for energy production. However, glycolytic metabolites and glycolytic gene expression are not at uniform levels throughout retinal development, peaking at E18.5-P0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Esteban-Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). Since these measurements were performed in bulk, and the ratio of RPCs to differentiated cells declines as development proceeds, it is not clear whether glycolytic activity is temporally regulated within RPCs. To assess glycolytic gene expression in RPCs at different stages of development, we mined scRNA-seq data collected from wild-type retinas between E11 and P14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clark et al., 2019</xref>). High dimensional uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots identified unique cell clusters corresponding to pre-neurogenic (pre-N) RPCs at E11, early-RPCs from E12-E18 and late-RPCs from P0-P5, all of which expressed <italic>Cdk1</italic>, a marker of active cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Several glycolytic genes were enriched in RPC clusters, including <italic>Hk1</italic>, the initial enzyme in the glycolytic pathway that converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, which was detected in all RPC pools (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, <italic>Pgk1,</italic> a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the first ATP-producing step in the glycolytic chain reaction, was at its highest levels in pre-N and early RPCs and not in late RPCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These data suggest that glycolytic activity peaks during the early-to-late RPC transition.</p>

<p>We noted that the highest levels of <italic>Pgk1</italic> expression at E18/P0 corresponded to the known pinnacle of RPC differentiation into committed, rod photoreceptor precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), which undergo a protracted differentiation period, only expressing mature photoreceptor markers between P2 and P8 (e.g., <italic>Prph2, Impg2, Pde6g, Gm11744, Gnat2</italic>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1). We thus asked whether levels of glycolytic activity have an instructive role in rod photoreceptor fate selection. To test this hypothesis, we used two genetic models to elevate glycolytic activity in RPCs. We first targeted PTEN, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates PGK1, a rate-limiting step (K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). PTEN is expressed throughout retinal development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1), including in late-RPCs (E18.5), which co-express VSX2 and PAX6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To delete <italic>Pten</italic> in RPCs, we generated a <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO model by crossing a floxed allele of <italic>Pten,</italic> in which exons 4 and 5 were flanked by loxP sites, with a <italic>Pax6-Cre-GFP</italic> driver allele (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). As a proxy of Cre activity, GFP was expressed in RPCs and postmitotic newborn cells with a high peripheral to central gradient in <italic>Pax6-Cre-GFP</italic> transgenics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, for the remainder of this study, we focused on the peripheral retina where the <italic>Pax6-Cre</italic> allele was most active, avoiding the central retina, which was readily distinguishable as it forms a visible hamartoma comprised of remaining wild-type cells in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tachibana et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Using cellular birthdating, we previously showed that <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO RPCs are hyperproliferative and differentiate on an accelerated schedule between E12.5 and E18.5, yet fewer rod photoreceptors are ultimately present in P7 retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>). Since retinal cell differentiation persists into the early postnatal period, we conducted similar birthdating experiments, but instead administered BrdU to P4 pups. In wild-type retinas harvested at P14, BrdU cells were mainly distributed between the INL, where late-born bipolar cells and Müller glia localize, and the ONL, where rod photoreceptors migrate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Labeled cells in the GCL likely represent displaced amacrine cells, which are at the end of their differentiation window. In contrast, only a few BrdU-labeled cells were detected in the GCL in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas, with no BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells present in the INL and ONL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Thus, the accelerated differentiation observed during embryonic stages is followed by the precocious depletion of dividing RPCs in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas by the early postnatal period, effectively limiting the overall period of rod photoreceptor differentiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>).</p>

<title>Glycolytic gene expression and activity are upregulated in P0 <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas</title>
<p>To investigate how <italic>Pten,</italic> encoding an intracellular phosphatase, controls the timing of RPC proliferation and differentiation, we began with a transcriptomic approach. To decipher transcriptomic changes associated with <italic>Pten</italic> loss, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on P0 wild-type (N=4) and <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO (N=5) retinas. A heatmap depiction revealed that there are distinct blocks of expressed genes in the two genotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a log2-fold change (log2FC) ≥2 between wild-type and <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas, there were 408 down-regulated and 667 up-regulated genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). To draw relationships between genes and pathways, we analysed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, showing enrichment of terms such as <italic>axon guidance</italic>, and <italic>regulation of actin cytoskeleton</italic> among the DEGs. In addition, metabolic pathway terms were enriched, including <italic>glycolysis</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), which involves a series of enzymatic reactions that break down glucose into pyruvate for energy production (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Indeed, analysis of Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM) revealed that most of the glycolytic regulatory enzymes were upregulated in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas, including <italic>Hk1, Gpi1, Pfkl, Aldoa, Pgk1, Pgam1,</italic> and <italic>Eno1,</italic> although others, such as <italic>Pkm,</italic> were not differentially expressed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, expression of <italic>Slc16a3</italic>, encoding a monocarboxylate transporter that symports lactate and one hydrogen ion outside of the cell, was increased in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).

<p>To test whether transcriptomic changes in P0 <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas reflected an increase in glycolytic activity, we performed a Seahorse assay. Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was elevated in P0 <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO RPCs compared to controls, indicative of an increase in lactic acid levels, which serves as a proxy measure for glycolysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). We further assessed mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub>-consumption rates in P0 retinal cells, showing that oligomycin, an ATP synthase inhibitor, suppressed basal respiration rates to the same extent in wild-type and <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Similarly, maximum or spare respiratory capacity measured upon stimulation did not differ between P0 wild-type and <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Finally, we used a colorimetric assay to measure lactate levels in tissue lysates, revealing an elevation of lactate in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas compared to wild-type retinas at P0 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that glycolytic gene expression and activity are elevated in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas, whereas oxygen-dependent OXPHOS is unaffected.</p>

<title>Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis decreases RPC proliferation and photoreceptor differentiation</title>
<p>To assess the requirement for glycolysis in P0 RPCs, we used a retinal explant assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), growing explants from P0 retinas for 24 hrs in the presence of 5 mM and 10 mM 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG), a competitive inhibitor of the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in glycolysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To label dividing RPCs, explants were exposed to BrdU, which is incorporated into S-phase cells, for 30 minutes prior to harvesting. 2DG treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of RPC proliferation as evidenced by a reduction in BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). To determine whether glycolytic inhibition reduced the overall percentage of RPCs that continued to proliferate, we measured the proliferative fraction (p-fraction) by exposing retinal explants to BrdU at the onset of 2DG treatment, and then immunostaining for BrdU and Ki67, which labels all cycling cells. The p-fraction was calculated as the ratio of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells that were BrdU<sup>+</sup> (<italic>i.e.,</italic> %BrdU<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells). The total numbers of BrdU<sup>+</sup> and Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells declined in 2DG-treated explants, as did the overall p-fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>A reduction in the p-fraction could indicate that RPCs had stopped cycling during the 24-hr window of 2DG treatment, or that these cells had undergone apoptosis. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first immunostained 2DG-treated retinal explants with VSX2, which primarily labels RPCs at P0. 2DG treatment for 24 hr did not alter the total number of VSX2<sup>+</sup> RPCs, even at the higher dose of 10 mM, despite the dramatic decline in proliferating RPCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, 2DG treatment did not elevate levels of apoptosis, as the number of cleaved-caspase 3 (CC3) expressing retinal cells remaining similar in 2DG-treated and control explants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). We then asked whether glycolytic inhibition impacted cellular differentiation, focusing on CRX-expressing photoreceptor precursors, which are the main cells generated at P0. At the highest 10 mM 2DG dose, the number of CRX<sup>+</sup> cells declined, indicative of a dose-dependent decrease in the number of photoreceptor precursors born (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that glycolytic inhibition suppresses RPC proliferation, and at higher doses, prevents RPCs from differentiating into photoreceptors. Stated differently, glycolysis is required to support RPC proliferation and photoreceptor differentiation.</p>
<p>Previous studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> similarly found that RPCs rely mainly on glycolysis for energy production, however, instead of the demand for a constant supply of glucose, Xenopus RPCs depend on glycogen storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>). To test whether mouse RPCs similarly require stored glycogen, P0 retinal explants were cultured in the presence of 12.5 µM and 25 µM glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor (GPI) for 24 hr (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>), the latter corresponding to the same concentrations used in Xenopus retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>). In murine retinal explants, GPI treatment did not impact the number of RPCs that incorporated BrdU (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). These data suggest that rather than depending on glycogen stores, murine RPCs depend on a constant supply of glucose to maintain proliferation, as shown in human retinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takata et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Precocious rod differentiation and maturation in <italic>cytoPFKB3</italic> gain-of-function mice phenocopies <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinal features</title>
<p>We previously showed that at P7, <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas are comprised of fewer differentiated rods and amacrine cells, while other cell types are not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>). Given the increase in glycolysis in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas observed in the current study, we asked whether metabolic reprogramming may be sufficient to bias RPC fate choice, thereby altering cellular composition. As a precedent, glycolytic flux alters neuromesodermal lineage selection in the chick tail bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>) and in mouse mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>). To determine whether increased glycolysis is a critical downstream effector pathway of <italic>Pten</italic> in retinal cell fate selection, we used a transgenic approach to elevate glycolytic flux in RPCs. Glycolytic flux is defined as the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), which is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase (PFK1), and is the first rate-limiting, commitment step in glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To promote glycolytic flux, we used a conditional gain-of-function (GOF) transgenic line driving the expression of a dominant active, cytoplasmic form of PFKB3 (cyto<italic>PFKB3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>). PFKB3 converts F6P to fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which is a strong, allosteric activator of PFK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shi et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To overexpress cyto<italic>PFKB3</italic> in RPCs, we removed the floxed stop cassette using a <italic>Pax6-Cre</italic> driver to create a cyto<italic>PFKB3</italic> GOF model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Of note, the same <italic>Pax6-Cre</italic> driver was employed to generate <italic>Pten-</italic>cKOs used in this study. To confirm that cyto<italic>PFKB3-</italic>GOF retinas undergo increased glycolytic flux, we measured levels of secreted lactate as a proxy measure using a colorimetric assay.

<p>Having validated the GOF model, we next asked whether elevating cyto<italic>PFKB3</italic> expression in RPCs impacted the timing of retinal cell differentiation using a birthdating assay. BrdU was administered to pregnant females at E12.5 and pups were sacrificed at P7. In wild-type retinas, BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were mainly distributed in the GCL, where newborn ganglion cells and displaced amacrine cells reside, and in the INL, where amacrine cells and horizontal cells are located (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Fewer BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells labeled at E12.5 were present in the P7-ONL, with these early-born ONL cells primarily including cones in wild-type retinas (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref>). In cyto<italic>PFKB3-</italic>GOF retinas, BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were also distributed amongst the three layers, but BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were more abundant in the ONL, where photoreceptors reside, with a concomitant reduction in the INL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref>). The shift in distribution of E12.5-labeled, BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells phenocopies the altered temporal differentiation observed in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The accelerated differentiation of ONL cells in cyto<italic>PFKB3-</italic>GOF retinas prompted us to ask whether photoreceptor maturation was similarly hastened, focusing on OS formation as a readout. While most differentiated cells use OXPHOS for energy production, photoreceptors are an important exception, as these metabolically demanding cells require glycolysis to maintain OSs, which undergo diurnal turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>). To examine OS formation, we immunostained P7 wild-type and cyto<italic>PFKB3-</italic>GOF retinas with rhodopsin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Visually, photoreceptor OS above the ONL, which are labeled with rhodopsin, were larger in P7 cyto<italic>PFKB3-</italic>GOF retinas, as confirmed by a measurement of the OS area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether rod photoreceptor OSs similarly mature precociously in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas, we first examined the P0 transcriptomic data for OS-enriched genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Datta et al., 2015</xref>). We identified several OS genes that were up-regulated in P0 <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas, although not all, as several OS genes were also down-regulated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). To assess OS maturation morphologicaly, we immunostained P7 retinas with rhodopsin, revealing a similar increase in the rhodopsin-labeled OS area in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKOs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). Finally, to investigate the role of glucose metabolism in accelerating the rate of rod photoreceptor maturation, we inhibited glycolysis during the early postnatal window by <italic>in vivo</italic> administration of 2DG, which was administered daily from P0 to P7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H,I</xref>). Strikingly, 2DG treatment blocked the precocious maturation of rod photoreceptor OSs in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas, which returned to wild-type sizes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). Taken together, these data implicate glucose metabolism and glycolysis as an important driver of photoreceptor differentiation and OS maturation.</p>

<title>Reducing pHi phenocopies the inhibitory effects of a glycolytic block on RPC proliferation and differentiation</title>
<p>Glycolysis is not an energy-efficient metabolic pathway as cells produce 2 ATP/glucose molecule versus 30-38 ATP/glucose when using OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Touahri et al., 2024</xref>). However, cells rely on glycolysis for reasons other than energy expenditure. For instance, lactate is a metabolic byproduct that is shuttled out of the cell along with one H<sup>+</sup> ion by lactate/H<sup>+</sup> symporters (Slc16a group proteins) when glycolytic activity is high, effectively increasing intracellular pH (pHi) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably, glycolysis-driven increases in pHi are the central driver of cell fate choice selection in the chick neuromesodermal lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>). We found <italic>Slc16a</italic> family lactate/H<sup>+</sup> symporters are elevated in <italic>Pten</italic><sup>cKO</sup> retinas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that more protons may be extruded to increase pHi. To address whether lactate/H<sup>+</sup> symporters control RPC proliferation, we incubated wild-type P0 explants with 5mM α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CNCn), an inhibitor of monocarboxylate transporters, including the Slc16a-family symporters, for 24 hr (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The impact of CNCn should block the export of lactate into the extracellular space, effectively lowering pHi and further decreasing glycolysis. To determine whether RPC proliferation was impacted by CNCn treatment, explants were incubated with BrdU 30 min before harvesting. We observed a decrease in the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> proliferating RPCs in CNCn-treated retinal explants compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). This decline in RPC proliferation mirrored the effect of inhibiting glycolysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, Slc16a-family symporters play a role in regulating RPC proliferation in the retina.</p>

<p>In keeping with the idea that pH levels influence cell fate selection, a previous study found that neuromesodermal progenitors in chick tailbud explants cultured in low pH media undergo cell cycle exit and lineage selection is biased towards neural rather than mesodermal fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, PKM2 is the rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis, and at low pH, PKM2 aggregates in reversible amyloids that are inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cereghetti et al., 2024</xref>). To assess the role of altered pHi on cell fate selection in the retina, we grew retinal explants in media buffered at pH 6.5 (acidic), pH 7.4 (neutral), or pH 8.0 (basic). Increased glycolysis, leading to more H<sup>+</sup> extrusion from the cell and an increase in pHi was modeled by pH 8.0, while decreased glycolysis, leading to less H<sup>+</sup> extrusion and a lower pHi, was modeled by pH 6.5. To assess the impact of pHi changes on RPC proliferation, P0 retinal explants were cultured in media buffered to different pH levels, with BrdU added for 30 min and at the end of the 24-hr culture period. More RPCs were BrdU<sup>+</sup> in pH 8.0 media compared to neutral pH 7.4 media, consistent with the pro-proliferative effect of increased glycolysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Conversely, in media buffered to pH 6.5, the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> proliferating RPCs declined (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether pH changes alter the overall percentage of RPCs that continue to proliferate, we measured the p-fraction by exposing retinal explants to BrdU at the onset of pH adjustments, and then calculating the p-fraction as the ratio of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells that were BrdU<sup>+</sup>. We found a pH-dependent increase in the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> RPCs and in the p-fraction in retinal explants cultured in pH 8.0 compared to pH 7.4 (neutral pH control) media (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). We also observed a corresponding increase in VSX2<sup>+</sup> RPCs in pH 8.0 media (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), and more RPCs differentiated into CRX<sup>+</sup> photoreceptor precursors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). In contrast, in retinal explants cultured in pH 6.5 media, fewer RPCs entered S-phase as evidenced by the decline in BrdU<sup>+</sup> RPCs and lower p-fraction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). However, there were more VSX2<sup>+</sup> RPCs in retinal explants grown in pH 6.5 versus pH 7.4 media (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), with no effect on cell death evident as assessed by cleaved-caspase 3<sup>+</sup> cell counts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), likely because fewer of these RPCs differentiated into CRX<sup>+</sup> photoreceptor precursors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Thus, pH has a dramatic effect on the decision by RPCs to proliferate versus differentiate, with higher pH more conducive to rapid, self-renewing, asymmetric divisions (P/D) that generate an RPC and a neuron.</p>
<p>Tissues naturally have pHi and differentiation gradients – for instance, there is an anterior (low pHi, more differentiated cells) to posterior (high pHi, more neuromesodermal progenitor cells) gradient in neuromesodermal progenitors in the embryonic chick tailbud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>). Given the importance of pH to control RPC proliferation and differentiation dynamics, and since not all RPCs differentiate at any given time, we asked whether there was a dynamic representation of pH within RPCs within the developing retina. To test this assumption, we electroporated P3 retinal explants with pCAGG-pHluorin-IRES2-tdTomato, using tdTomato to label transfected cells and pHluorin, a ratiometric pH sensor with a 488-nm activation spectrum in neutral pH. As expected, the 488-nm signal was variable across RPCs that had similar tdTomato levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). Taken together, this data is consistent with the idea that pH varies within RPCs, correlating with the propensity of some RPCs to continue to proliferate while others to differentiate.</p>

<title>Canonical Wnt signaling is active in neurogenic RPCs and controlled by glycolysis</title>
<p>Our finding that glycolysis might be a central driver of RPC fate selection, in part through the control of pHi, prompted the question of how these biochemical processes might impact cell fate selection. To glean further insights, we revisited our bulk RNA-seq data set from P0 <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas and performed a PANTHER (protein analysis through evolutionary relationships) classification analysis of DEGs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-figure supplement 1). As expected, glycolysis was amongst the up-regulated pathways, but the most up-regulated pathway in P0 <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas was Wnt signaling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-figure supplement 1). Wnts bind to frizzled (Fz) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein receptors (LRPs), which induces β−catenin translocation to the nucleus, where it forms an active transcriptional complex with T-cell-specific transcription factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF) transcription factors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Prior studies had implicated canonical Wnt signaling in maintaining an undifferentiated RPC state, especially in the peripheral margin at early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ouchi et al., 2011</xref>). However, mining scRNA-seq data from E11 to P14 retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clark et al., 2019</xref>) revealed that Wnt signaling may be active throughout retinal development, with transcripts for <italic>Wnt7b</italic> and <italic>Lef1,</italic> which is transcribed in response to canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schmidt et al., 2000</xref>), detected in RPCs at all developmental stages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, we noted that <italic>Dkk</italic>, a Wnt inhibitor, is only expressed in pre-neurogenic RPCs, and not in RPCs in the early and late neurogenic periods, suggesting that Wnt signaling may not be active prior to the onset of neurogenesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). We thus explored whether Wnt signaling was regulated by glycolysis to play a role in RPC differentiation.</p>

<p>Components of the Wnt signaling pathway that were upregulated in P0 <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas included <italic>Dvl3</italic>, an inhibitor of the β-catenin destruction complex, <italic>Apc</italic> and <italic>Gsk3b</italic>, two components of the destruction complex, and <italic>Tcf4</italic> and <italic>Crebbp</italic>, a downstream effector of Wnt signaling and its co-activator, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These data were consistent with our previous demonstration that canonical Wnt signaling levels are elevated in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas, as assessed by increased expression of non-phosphorylated (active) b-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Touahri et al., 2024</xref>). However, unlike in the peripheral retina of <italic>Ctnnb1-</italic>cKOs (encoding for b-catenin), in which the neurogenic inhibitor <italic>Id3</italic> is activated by Wnt signaling in the periphery to maintain RPCs in an immature, undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ouchi et al., 2011</xref>), we found that <italic>Id3</italic> is down-regulated in P0 <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), potentially allowing differentiation to proceed unimpeded.</p>
<p>Finally, to establish whether Wnt signaling was indeed regulated by glycolytic activity, we investigated β-catenin levels in explants treated with 2DG or grown in different pH media. β-catenin levels declined upon glycolysis inhibition in 2DG treated explants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), and at pH 6.5, a proxy for low glycolysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, canonical Wnt signaling is elevated in P0 <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Touahri et al., 2024</xref>), in which glycolysis is elevated, and reduced in conditions in which glycolysis is inhibited.</p>

<title>Wnt signaling controls rod photoreceptor differentiation and maturation</title>
<p>We next asked whether inhibiting Wnt signaling would phenocopy the effects of reducing glycolysis on RPC proliferation and photoreceptor differentiation. For this purpose, we treated P0 wild-type CD1 retinal explants with 5 µM or 10 µM FH535, a pharmacological inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Handeli &amp; Simon, 2008</xref>), for 24 hr. To label proliferating RPCs, BrdU was added 30 min before harvesting similar to previous experiments.

<p>Finally, in chick neuromesodermal progenitors, high glycolytic activity or elevated pHi promotes the non-enzymatic acetylation of β-catenin, which promotes mesodermal at the expense of neural cell fate selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>). To force protein acetylation, including of β-catenin, cells can be grown in sodium acetate. We observed that the exposure of retinal explants to 5-, 10-, or 20 mM sodium acetate increased the percentage of BrdU<sup>+</sup> proliferating RPCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-figure supplement 1). Thus, the forced activation of β-catenin acetylation is sufficient to promote RPC proliferation, mimicking the early impact of <italic>Pten</italic> loss/high glycolytic activity in RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, our study identifies an unexplored pathway in which PTEN controls RPC proliferation and rod differentiation and maturation via modulating glycolysis. Glycolysis in turn controls proliferation and differentiation through modulating pHi that creates a favorable environment for Wnt signaling activation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The timing of RPC differentiation and neural subtype specification must be precisely coordinated so that the correct types of retinal neurons and glial cells are born at appropriate times and in their proper numbers during development. In <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas, RPCs proliferate and differentiate on an accelerated timeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sakagami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>), resulting in the precocious depletion of proliferating RPCs (this study). Ultimately, the changes in RPC proliferation dynamics culminate in the production of fewer amacrine cells and rod photoreceptors populating the P7 <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Touahri et al., 2024</xref>). To understand how <italic>Pten</italic> controls RPC fate decisions, we first used a transcriptomic approach, revealing an increase in glycolytic gene expression and activity in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas. Consistent with a role for glycolysis in controlling RPC proliferation and photoreceptor cell differentiation, both were inhibited by 2DG, a pharmacological inhibitor of glycolysis. Conversely, the promotion of glycolytic flux in RPCs using cyto<italic>PFKB3</italic> GOF transgenic mice accelerated photoreceptor differentiation, including the enhanced maturation of rod OSs, an effect phenocopied in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas. Since elevated glycolytic activity shuttles more lactate/H<sup>+</sup> out of the cell to increase intracellular pH (pHi), we cultured retinal explants in media buffered to higher pH levels, which promoted RPC proliferation and accelerated photoreceptor differentiation. Finally, we linked glycolysis and pHi changes to the activation of Wnt signaling, which we found is required to promote RPC proliferation, photoreceptor differentiation, and OS maturation. Taken together, we have uncovered a novel molecular axis controlling RPC fate decisions in the retina that begins with a <italic>Pten</italic> signal transduction molecule, the loss of which elevates glycolytic activity, pHi, and Wnt signaling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to our findings in mice, glycolysis is the predominant mode of ATP production in proliferating <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>). However, in contrast to the results of this study, treatment of Xenopus retinas with 2DG, a glucose inhibitor, does not impact ATP or lactate production, whereas GPI-mediated inhibition of access to glycogen stores reduces energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, Xenopus RPCs rely on glycogen storage to fuel glycolysis, whereas we found that in mouse retina, a constant glucose supply is required to fuel glycolysis and support RPC proliferation. Consistent with our data, in mice carrying mutations in <italic>Glut1,</italic> a glucose transporter, or <italic>Ldha</italic>, a glycolytic enzyme that converts pyruvate to lactate, RPC proliferation and expansion of the optic vesicle are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Human RPCs also use glycolysis as revealed by the conversion of <sup>13</sup>C-glucose to lactate, a glycolytic intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, the inhibition of glucose catabolism by 2DG blocked RPC proliferation and eye morphogenesis in human retinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Intriguingly, in this organoid study, RPC identity markers, including RAX, and SIX3, were also suppressed by 2DG, a phenotype attributed to lactate depletion, which indicates that glycolysis is also critical for progenitor cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). One possibility is that the “energy budget” of a cell, dictated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and precursor metabolite levels, controls levels of transcription of retinal cell identity genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carthew, 2021</xref>). Glycolytic metabolites can also impact gene transcription in other ways. For example, lactate, a metabolic byproduct of glycolysis, inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity to acetylate H3K27ac and activate eye development genes in retinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, the addition of lactate to retinal organoids induced broad transcriptional changes, including an upregulation of genes involved in eye morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Mechanistically, lactate effects on the transcription of eye field markers was attributed to the inhibition of HDACs, which normally inhibit gene expression via histone deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takata et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>A proxy measure for glycolytic activity are the levels of sentinel metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kochanowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peeters et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In chick embryonic tailbuds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>) and the murine presomitic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>), FBP was identified as a sentinel metabolite as its levels positively correlate with glycolytic activity. However, while FBP has been ascribed a major role in controlling mouse embryonic mesoderm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>), neuromesodermal fate selection in the chick embryonic tailbud is controlled by elevated pHi induced by high glycolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>). In the chick tailbud, high pHi creates an environment that activates Wnt signaling through non-enzymatic acetylation of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, in mouse embryos, Miyazawa et al., found that increasing glycolysis in the presomitic mesoderm inhibited Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the link between glycolysis and Wnt signaling may be species and lineage-specific. Consistent with the idea that there is some species specificity, in human retinal organoids, lactate itself was shown to alter optic vesicle bud gene expression, whereas pH did not appear to be an important driver of cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, in the mouse retina, the GPR81 receptor for lactate is expressed at the highest levels in ganglion cells in which it is required to promote axon growth, with only low, possibly background expression levels in RPCs and photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Laroche et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Our finding that Wnt signaling is required to maintain RPC proliferation and drive photoreceptor differentiation is contrary to prior studies that ascribed a role to <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> in maintaining RPCs in an immature, uncommitted state without affecting proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ouchi et al., 2011</xref>). A major difference is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ouchi et al. (2011)</xref> found that <italic>Id3</italic>, a neurogenic inhibitor, is upregulated in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> cKO retinas, whereas we found that <italic>Id3</italic> expression levels decline in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas in this study. It may therefore be that the precocious photoreceptor differentiation we observed in the absence of <italic>Pten</italic> occurs due to the reduction in inhibitory <italic>Id3</italic> levels. There may also be a biphasic role for Wnt signaling, as has been observed during neocortical development, where canonical Wnt signaling first induces the symmetric proliferative divisions of neural progenitor cells and later induces differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Harrison-Uy &amp; Pleasure, 2012</xref>). Finally, the ectopic expression of <italic>Wnt2b</italic> inhibits neuronal differentiation in the chick retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kubo et al., 2005</xref>), phenocopying the postnatal <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinal phenotype observed in this study, in which Wnt signaling is also elevated. However, while ectopic <italic>Wnt2b</italic> expression suppresses chick RPC differentiation by inhibiting the expression of proneural genes, we did not observe a significant impact on Notch signaling or proneural gene expression in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas (data not shown). Thus, the gain of Wnt signaling in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas impacts RPC proliferation and differentiation possibly in a proneural gene-independent manner.</p>
<p>Our finding that <italic>Pten</italic> loss drives photoreceptor differentiation and OS maturation was an unexpected fate bias given that during development, <italic>Pten</italic> is expressed in multipotent RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>) that give rise to all retinal cells in a defined temporal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Javed &amp; Cayouette, 2017</xref>). RPCs that are biased to a generic photoreceptor fate express the transcription factor (TF) Olig2; if these cells later express the TF Nrl, they become rods, if not, they become cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hafler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Javed &amp; Cayouette, 2017</xref>). In <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas, more RPCs become photoreceptors instead of differentiating into other retinal cell types at early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>), but this phenotype is not likely to be dependent on Olig2, since Olig2 is expressed at normal levels from the RNA-seq study performed herein. Nevertheless, the finding that <italic>Pten</italic> loss elicits a photoreceptor bias in early RPCs could have widespread applications in targeting uncurable retinal diseases. Notably, the pharmacological inhibition of PTEN has been used in pre-clinical studies in lung, muscle, and nervous systems for regenerative purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Borges et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Knafo &amp; Esteban, 2017</xref>), including in the retina, to promote ganglion cell axonogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Park et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we have revealed that elevated glycolysis is a key contributor to the RPC fate alterations observed in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas. In particular, we have found that glycolytic flux is elevated in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas, which modulates both pHi and Wnt signaling to control the timing of RPC proliferation and differentiation.</p>

<p>P0 <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO and wild-type control eyes were dissected in a clean petri dish containing Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS). A pair of super-fine tweezers (#5, Fine Scientific Tools, Canada) was used to remove the cornea, iris, sclera and retinal pigment epithelium. Retinas were homogenized using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific; #15596-026) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was then purified using an RNAeasy minikit (74104, Qiagen). Eluted RNA quality and concentration was assessed using a NanoDrop. Samples with the highest purity (260/280 ratio = 2.0) were used for RNA sequencing (RNAseq) experiments. Five <italic>Pten</italic> cKO and four wild-type samples were sent to the University of Lethbridge, Alberta for sequencing. Illumina NextSeq 500 performed sequencing using 75bp Single-End reads. A NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit was used to construct a library containing read counts, and was compared to a Mouse GRCM38 reference genome. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the DESeq1 1.28.1 package. An adjusted p-value (padj) less than 0.05 for any gene was considered a DEG (Wald test, Benjamini-Hickberg correction for multiple comparisons). DEGs were visualized by Volcano plot (R package: EnhancedVolcano 1.6.0) and heatmap (R package: gplots 3.0.3, function heatmap 2). Gene Ontology (GO) terms for Biological Processes and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways were assayed using the DEG up- and down-regulated DEGs (Pathview 1.28.0 package).</p>

<title>Tissue processing and immunostaining</title>
<p>Animals were sacrificed using CO<sub>2</sub> euthanasia. Eyes were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C. Fixed eyes were rinsed with PBS and incubated in 20% sucrose overnight. Eyes were then embedded in optical cutting temperature (O.C.T™) compound (Tissue-Tek®, Sakura Finetek U.S.A. Inc., Torrance, CA) and frozen on dry ice before being sectioned in a series of 10uM slices using a Leica CM3050s cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). Sections were mounted on Fisherbrand™ Superfrost™ Plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Markham, ON). Sections were blocked for 1 hour in 10% normal horse serum in 1X PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST). Primary antibodies were diluted in a blocking solution and incubated at 4°C overnight. Primary antibodies included: BrdU (1:400, ab6326, Abcam), VSX2 (1:200, sc-365519, Santa Cruz), Ki67 (1:400, ab16667, Abcam), cleaved caspase 3 (CC3; 1:400, ab2302, Abcam), Rhodopsin (1:400, MAB 5356, Millipore), PAX6 (1:400, #PRB-278P; Covance Research), PTEN (1:400, 9559S, Cell Signaling) and CRX (1:400, NBP2-15964. Novus Biologicals). Slides were washed 3 × 10 min in PBST and then incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in PBST for 1 hour. Secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa568 (1:500, Molecular Probes), Alexa488 (1:500, Molecular Probes), or Alexa647 (1:500, Molecular Probes). Sections were washed 3 × 10 min washes in PBST. Sections were counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Invitrogen, D1306) and coverslipped in Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences #18606).</p>

<title>Retinal explants</title>
<p>For retinal explants, P0 wild-type CD1 mice pups were sacrificed by decapitation. Eyes were dissected in ice-cold PBS. Corneas were removed first, followed by the removal of sclera, iris, and lens. Retinal cups were then mounted on Cytiva Whatman™ 90 mm Nuclepore™ Polycarbonate Track-Etched Membranes (Catalog Number 09920022, Cytiva, Canada). Four cuts were made to flatten cups on the membranes using TMS101 Gills-Vannas Scissors (SKU: TMS101, Titan Medical, Coral Gables, FL, USA). Retinal mounted membranes were then transferred to 24 well plates (Corning® Costar® TC-Treated Multiple Well Plates, Catalog Number: CLS3524, Millipore Sigma) filled with 1 mL of retinal explant media (50% DMEM, 25% HBSS, 25% heat-inactivated horse serum, 200 μM L-glutamine, 0.6 mM HEPES, 1% Pen-Strep). Retinas were then incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. At the experimental endpoint (as indicated), explants were fixed at room temperature with 4% PFA for 15 min, rinsed with DEPC-treated PBS and incubated in 20% DEPC-Sucrose overnight. Explants were then mounted in OCT on dry ice and cryosectioned at 10 μM as described above.</p>

<title>Retinal explant drug treatments</title>
<p>For BrdU labeling, 5 μL of 10 mg/mL BrdU was added to the retinal cell explant media for the time period described. All inhibitors were incubated with retinal explants for 24 hours. 2DG (D3179-1G, Sigma Aldrich, Canada) was diluted in PBS and added to retinal explant media to achieve 5 mM and 10 mM final concentrations. Glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor (GPI) (361515-1MG, Sigma Aldrich, Canada) was diluted in DMSO and added to the retinal explant media at a final concentration of 12.5 μM or 25 μM. α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cannamic acid (CNCn; C2020-10G; Sigma Aldrich, Canada) was diluted in explant media and added to explant media at a final concentration of 5 mM. For pH experiments, pH was adjusted after incubating the media in cell culture incubator for 1 hour using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide to reach a pH of 6.5 and 8.0, respectively. FH535 was diluted in DMSO and added to the retinal explant media at 5mM and 10mM concentrations for 24 hours (108409, Millipore Sigma, Canada). For acetate explants, retinas were incubated with sodium acetate at a concentration of 5 mM, 10 mM or 20 mM diluted in PBS for 48 hours (S2889, Millipore Sigma, Canada).</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>For western blot, retinal cups were dissected on ice and both retinas of the same animal were pooled together. Retinas were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (0.05 M Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.001 M EDTA) with protease (1X protease inhibitor complete, 1 mM PMSF), proteasome (MG132 at 0.05 mM) and phosphatase (50 mM NaF, 1 mM NaOV) inhibitors. Protein amounts were quantified with a Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, #23235) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 10 μg of lysate from whole cells or tissue was run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels for western blot analysis. Protein was transferred to PVDF membrane at 80V for 1 hour. PVDF membranes were then blocked in 5% skim milk powder in tris-buffered saline with 0.1% tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots were incubated overnight at 4°C in a blocking solution with non-phosphorylated β-Catenin (1:1000, 8814, Cell Signalling) followed by β-actin (1:5000, ab8227, Abcam). Blots were washed 3 × 10 min in TBST before incubating in secondary antibodies, including either Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L)-HRP Conjugate (1/50,000; Bio-Rad #1721019 or Cell Signaling #7074) or Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L)-HRP Conjugate (1/50,000; Bio-Rad #1721011). A chemiluminescent signal was obtained from the blots using (ECL Prime Luminor Enhancer Solution, Cytiva, Canada) and the blot was developed using a ChemiDoc System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Canada). Densitometries were calculated using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>), and normalized values (over ß-actin) were plotted.</p>

<title>scRNA-seq analysis</title>
<p>10x scRNA-seq data of mouse developing retina was obtained from GSE118614 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clark et al., 2019</xref>). Further processing and analyses were performed with the Seurat v.3.2.3 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Butler et al., 2018</xref>). Low-quality cells were excluded by filtering out cells with fewer than 500 detected genes and cells with mitochondrial RNA more than 5%. The data was then transformed by the SCTransform function while regressing out the variance due to mitochondrial RNAs. Clustering was performed by the RunPCA, FindNeighbors, and FindClusters functions using the first 30 principal components. The 2D projection of the clustering was carried out by the RunUMAP function. The annotation of cell type to each cluster was performed by using the same set of markers as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clark et al., 2019</xref>). Expression of selected genes was plotted using the FeaturePlot function.</p>

<title>Seahorse assay</title>
<p>P0 <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO and wild-type control pups were sacrificed, and retinal cups were dissected. Both retinas from the same animal were pooled together in one tube and dissociated using a Papain kit according to manufacture protocol (Papain Dissociation System, Worthington Biochemical Corporation, USA). Dissociated cells of each animal were then plated in a 6-well plate coated with Poly-D-Lysine (10 mg/mL) (Corning, 354210)/Laminin (Corning, 354232) (2.5 μg/mL) (Sarstedt, Germany). Cells were cultured for 5 days then transferred to Seahorse 96-well plate at a density of 40,000/well. A Seahorse Mito stress test was run according to the manufacture protocol. Seahorse basal media was supplemented with Oligomycin, FCCP, R/A at the indicated time points (Seahorse XF Mito Stress Test Kit, 103015-100, Agilent, USA). Readings were then normalized to protein concentration/well measured using the Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Kit.</p>

<sec id="s4n">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed on at least three different animals/explants (N; biological replicates). Cell counts were performed by counting cells in three different cross sections (n; technical replicates). For comparisons between two groups, Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was used (GraphPad Prism, USA). For comparisons involving more than two groups, one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey multiple comparisons of means was used (GraphPad Prism, USA). Results were plotted on graphs with standard error of the mean (SEM) error bars (GraphPad Prism, USA). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study advances our understanding of the role energy metabolism, specifically anaerobic glycolysis, plays during development. <bold>Convincing</bold> genetic and pharmacological evidence demonstrates that glycolytic flux is not only necessary during retinogenesis but also controls the rate of retinal progenitor cell proliferation and photoreceptor maturation. Interesting evidence suggests potential downstream roles for intracellular pH and Wnt/β-catenin signaling; however, more direct evidence is needed to show they are the key mediators of glycolysis. This work is expected to stimulate broad interest and possible future studies investigating the link between metabolism and development in other tissue systems.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper seeks to understand the upstream regulation and downstream effectors of glycolysis in retinal progenitor cells, using mouse retinal explants as the main model system. The paper presents evidence that high glycolysis in retinal progenitor cells is required for their proliferation and timely differentiation into photoreceptors. Retinal glycolysis increases after the deletion of Pten. The authors suggest that high glycolysis controls cell proliferation and differentiation by promoting intracellular alkalinization, beta-catenin acetylation and stabilization, and consequent activation of the canonical Wnt pathway.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The experiments showing that PFKFB3 overexpression is sufficient to increase the proliferation of retinal progenitors (which are already highly dividing cells) and photoreceptor differentiation are striking and the result is unanticipated. It suggests that glycolytic flux is normally limiting for proliferation in embryos.</p>
<p>(2) Likewise the result that an increase in pH from 7.4 to 8.0 is sufficient to increase proliferation implies that pH regulation may have instructive roles in setting the tempo of retinal development and embryonic cell proliferation. Similarly, the results show that acetate supplementation increases proliferation (I think this result should be moved to the main figures).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Epistatic experiments to test if changes in pH mediate the effects of glycolysis on photoreceptor differentiation, or if Wnt activation is the main downstream effector of glycolysis in controlling differentiation are not presented.</p>
<p>(2) It is likely that metabolism changes ex vivo vs in vivo, and therefore stable isotope tracing experiments in the explants may not reflect in vivo metabolism.</p>
<p>(3) The retina at P0 is composed of both progenitors and differentiated cells. It is not clear if the results of the RNA-seq and metabolic analysis reflect changes in the metabolism of progenitors, or of mature cells, or changes in cell type composition rather than direct metabolic changes in a specific cell type.</p>
<p>(4) The biochemical links between elevated glycolysis and pH and beta-catenin stability are unclear. White et al found that higher pH decreased beta-catenin stability (JCB 217: 3965) in contrast to the results here. Oginuma et al found that inhibition of glycolysis or beta-catenin acetylation does not affect beta-catenin stability (Nature 584:98), again in contrast to these results. Another paper showed that acidification inhibits Wnt signaling by promoting the expression of a transcriptional repressor and not via beta-catenin stability (Cell Discovery 4:37). There are also additional papers showing increased pH can promote cell proliferation via other mechanisms (e.g. Nat Metab 2:1212). It is possible that there is organ-specificity in these signaling pathways however some clarification of these divergent results is warranted.</p>
<p>(5) The gene expression analysis is not completely convincing. E.g. the expression of additional glycolytic genes should be shown in Figure 1. It is not clear why Hk1 and Pgk1 are specifically shown, and conclusions about changes in glycolysis are difficult to draw from the expression of these two genes. The increase in glycolytic gene expression in the Pten-deficient retina is generally small.</p>
<p>(6) Is it possible that glycolytic inhibition with 2DG slows down the development and production of most newly differentiated cells rather than specifically affecting photoreceptor differentiation?</p>
<p>(7) Are the prematurely-born cells caused by PFKFB3 overexpression photoreceptors as assessed by morphology or markers (in addition to position)?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Hanna et al., addresses the question of energy metabolism in the retina, a neuronal tissue with an inordinately high energy demand. Paradoxically, the retina appears to employ to a large extent glycolysis to satisfy its energetic needs, even though glycolysis is far less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The focus of the present study is on the early development of the retina and the retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that proliferate and differentiate to form the seven main classes of retinal neurons. The authors use different genetic and pharmacological manipulations to drive the metabolism of RPCs or the retina towards higher or lower glycolytic activity. The results obtained suggest that increased glycolytic activity in early retinal development produces a more rapid differentiation of RPCs, resulting in a more rapid maturation of photoreceptors and photoreceptor segment growth. The study is significant in that it shows how metabolic activity can determine cell fate decisions in retinal neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study provides important findings that are highly relevant to the understanding of how early metabolism governs the development of the retina. The outcomes of this study could be relevant also for human diseases that affect early retinal development, including retinopathy of maturity where an increased oxygenation likely causes a disturbance of energy metabolism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The restriction to only relatively early developmental time points makes it difficult to assess the consequences of the different manipulations on the (more) mature retina. Notably, it is conceivable that early developmental manipulations, while producing relevant effects in the young post-natal retina, may &quot;even out&quot; and may no longer be visible in the mature, adult retina.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines the metabolic regulation of progenitor proliferation and differentiation in the developing retina. The authors observe dynamic changes in glycolytic gene expression in retinal progenitors and use various strategies to test the role of glycolysis. They find that elevated glycolysis in Pten-cKO retinas results in alteration of RPC fate, while inhibition of glycolysis has converse effects. They specifically test the role of elevated glycolysis using dominant active cytoPFKB3, which demonstrates the selective effects of elevated glycolysis on progenitor proliferation and rod differentiation. They then show that elevated glycolysis modulates both pHi and Wnt signaling, and provide evidence that these pathways impact proliferation and differentiation of progenitors, particularly affecting rod photoreceptor differentiation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a compelling and rigorous study that provides an important advance in our understanding of metabolic regulation of retina development, addressing a major gap in knowledge. A key strength is that the study utilizes multiple genetic and pharmacological approaches to address how both increased or decreased glycolytic flux affect retinal progenitor proliferation and differentiation. They discover elevated Wnt signaling pathway genes in Pten cKO retina, revealing a potential link between glycolysis and Wnt pathway activation. Altogether the study is comprehensive and adds to the growing body of evidence that regulation of glycolysis plays a key role in tissue development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Following the expression of cytoPFKB3, which results in increased glycolytic flux, BrDU labeling was performed at e12.5 and increased labeled cells were detected in the outer nuclear layer. However whether these are cones or rods is not established. The rest of the analysis is focused on the precocious maturation of rhodopsin-labeled outer segments, and the major conclusions emphasize rod photoreceptor differentiation. Therefore it is unclear whether there is an effect on cone differentiation for either Pten cKO or cytoPFKB3 transgenic retina. It is also not established whether rods are born precociously. Presumably, this would be best detected by BrDU labeling at later embryonic stages.</p>
<p>(2) The authors find that there is upregulation of multiple Wnt pathway components in Pten cKO retina. They further show that inhibiting Wnt signaling phenocopies the effects of reducing glycolysis. However, they do not test whether pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling reverses the effects of high glycolytic activity in Pten cKO retinas. Thus the argument that Wnt is a key downstream effector pathway regulating rod photoreceptor differentiation is weak.</p>
<p>(3) The use of sodium acetate to force protein acetylation is quite non-specific and will have effects beyond beta-catenin acetylation (which the authors acknowledge). Thus it is a stretch to state that &quot;forced activation of beta-catenin acetylation&quot; mimics the impact of Pten loss/high glycolytic activity in RPCs since the effects could be due to acetylation of other proteins.</p>

<p>In our BrdU birthdating experiment, we showed that PFKB3 expression drives the precocious differentiation of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) into photoreceptors. However, we did not determine if there is an associated change in the number of dividing RPCs. To examine the proliferative status of PFKB3-overexpressing RPCs, we will perform short-term BrdU labeling to measure the number of RPCs in S-phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, we will count the number of RPCs expressing pHH3, a mitotic marker, and Ki67, a marker of cycling cells in all cell cycle phases.</p>

<p>Traditionally, epistasis is tested using double knock-out (DKO) studies with null mutant alleles. If two genes operate in the same pathway, the downstream phenotype prevails, whereas phenotypic worsening is observed if two genes act in parallel pathways. Our data suggests the following order of events: Pten¯®glycolysis­®intracellular pH­®Wnt signaling­®photoreceptor differentiation. In this model, Wnt signaling is the downstream-most effector. To test our epistatic model, we will assess RPC proliferation and the differentiation of Crx+ photoreceptor precursors with the following assays:</p>
<p>(1) To confirm that Wnt signaling acts downstream of Pten, we will generate DKOs of Pten and Ctnnb1, a downstream effector of Wnt signaling. We know that fewer photoreceptors are generated in single Pten-cKO and Ctnnb1-cKO retinas, with a disruption of the outer nuclear layer only in Ctnnb1-cKOs. If Pten and Wnt act in the same pathway, Pten;Ctnnb1 DKOs will resemble single Ctnnb1-cKOs.</p>
<p>(2) While epistasis is traditionally examined using genetic mutants, we will perform proxy experiments using pharmacological agents. To test whether Wnt activation acts downstream of a pH increase, we will activate Wnt signaling with recombinant Wnt3a at high and low pH. While low pH inhibits photoreceptor differentiation, if Wnt signaling is downstream, it should promote differentiation even at low pH. Conversely, we will alter pH in the presence of a Wnt inhibitor, FH535, which should block the positive effects of high pH on photoreceptor differentiation.</p>
<p>(3) To test whether Wnt activation acts downstream of glycolysis to increase photoreceptor differentiation, we will apply recombinant Wnt3a to retinal explants while simultaneously inhibiting glycolysis with 2DG.  While 2DG inhibits photoreceptor differentiation, if Wnt signaling is downstream, it should still be able to promote differentiation.</p>
<p>(4) To test whether pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling reverses the effects of high glycolytic activity in Pten cKO retinas, we will treat wild-type and Pten-cKO retinas with the Wnt inhibitor FH535 and/or the glycolytic inhibitor 2DG.</p>

<p>(2) It is likely that metabolism changes ex vivo vs in vivo, and therefore stable isotope tracing experiments in the explants may not reflect in vivo metabolism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that metabolism likely changes ex vivo compared to in vivo. However, we did not perform stable isotope tracing experiments to directly examine glycolytic flux in this study. While outside the scope of the current study, this type of analysis is an important future direction that we will bring up in the discussion.</p>

<p>(3) The retina at P0 is composed of both progenitors and differentiated cells. It is not clear if the results of the RNA-seq and metabolic analysis reflect changes in the metabolism of progenitors, or of mature cells, or changes in cell type composition rather than direct metabolic changes in a specific cell type.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We mined a scRNA-seq dataset to show that Pgk1, a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis, is specifically elevated in early-stage RPCs versus later stage. We have since analysed additional glycolytic pathway genes, and observed a similar enrichment of Pfkl, Eno1 and Slc16a3 transcripts in early RPCs, while other genes were equally expressed in both early and late RPCs.</p>
<p>To functionally demonstrate that there are differences in glycolysis between early and late RPCs, we will use CD133 to sort RPCs at E15 (early) and P0 (late). We will perform qPCR on sorted cells to validate the transcriptional differences in glycolytic gene expression. Additionally, we will perform two proxy measures of glycolysis: 1) We will measure lactate levels in sorted RPCs at both stages, and 2) We will use a Seahorse assay and assess ECAR in sorted RPCs at both stages.</p>

<p>(4) The biochemical links between elevated glycolysis and pH and beta-catenin stability are unclear. White et al found that higher pH decreased beta-catenin stability (JCB 217: 3965) in contrast to the results here. Oginuma et al found that inhibition of glycolysis or beta-catenin acetylation does not affect beta-catenin stability (Nature 584:98), again in contrast to these results. Another paper showed that acidification inhibits Wnt signaling by promoting the expression of a transcriptional repressor and not via beta-catenin stability (Cell Discovery 4:37). There are also additional papers showing increased pH can promote cell proliferation via other mechanisms (e.g. Nat Metab 2:1212). It is possible that there is organ-specificity in these signaling pathways however some clarification of these divergent results is warranted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The pleiotropic actions of Wnt signaling on cell proliferation and differentiation are well known, even shifting from pro-proliferative to anti-proliferative depending on tissue or cell type. It is thus not surprising that different studies found unique effects of pH and glycolysis on b-catenin modifications and the activation of downstream signaling. Thus, as suggested by the reviewer, the difference between our data and other studies could be attributed to tissue and organism. In our revision, we will more fully assess our findings in the context of published studies, as recommended by the reviewer.</p>
<p>To summarize our data, in the developing retina, we found that non-phosphorylated b-catenin protein levels increase in Pten-cKO retinas in vivo, while conversely, non-phosphorylated b-catenin protein levels decrease upon 2DG treatment and at low pH 6.5 in vitro.</p>
<p>The Oginuma et al. 2020 (Nature 584: 98-101) study was performed on the chick tailbud and investigated lineage decisions by neuromesodermal progenitors in the presomitic mesoderm. In this context, WNT activity, glycolysis and pHi all decline in tandem, complementary to our findings. However, Oginuma et al. found that while phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated b-catenin levels do not vary, K49 b -catenin acetylation is reduced at low pHi. In their system, K49 b -catenin acetylation is associated with a switch in cell fate choice from neural to mesodermal in the chick tailbud. We will now assess this modification.</p>
<p>Hauck et al. 2021 (Cell Death &amp; Differentiation 28:1398-1417) found that by mutating Pkm, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, b-catenin can more efficiently shuttle to the nucleus to activate Wnt-signaling and promote cardiomyocyte proliferation. This study highlights the importance of examining b-catenin protein levels in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. They also examined transcriptional targets of Wnt signaling, such as Axin2, Ccnd1, Myc, Sox2 and Tnnt3, which we will also now assess.</p>
<p>In a separate study in cancer cells, high pH leads to increased expression of Ccnd1, a b-catenin target gene, and promotes proliferation (Koch et al. 2020. Nat Metab. 2:1212-1222). These findings are consistent with our demonstration that b-catenin levels are stabilized at pH 8, and RPC proliferation is enhanced. A separate study by Melnik et al 2018 (Cell Discovery 4:37) performed in cancer cells found that acidification induced by metformin indirectly suppresses Wnt signaling by activating the DDIT3 transcriptional repressor, consistent with our data showing low pH suppresses b-catenin stability. Melnik et al also used Mcl inhibitors, as we did in our study, and showed that this treatment blocked Wnt signaling. While we did not look at the impact of CNCn on Wnt signaling, we did see a decline in proliferation, as expected if Wnt levels are low. The relationship between CNCn and Wnt activity will now be assessed.</p>
<p>The one study that fits less well is from Czowski and White (BioRxiv), where they found that higher pH levels decrease b-catenin levels in the cytoplasm, nucleus and junctional complexes in MDCK cells. In this study, the authors altered pH using inhibitors for a sodium-proton exchanger and a sodium bicarbonate transporter. The Oginuma paper instead used the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin to equilibrate intracellular pHi to media pH, which we will now incorporate into our study.</p>
<p>In summary, to more comprehensively examine the link between Pten loss, glycolytic activity, pHi and Wnt signaling, we will examine levels of phosphorylated, non-phosphorylated and K49 acetylated b-catenin after each manipulation (i.e., Pten loss, pH manipulations, CNCn treatment, glycolysis inhibition, acetate treatments). For pH manipulations, we will use nigericin and valinomycin to equilibrate pH. These studies will be performed on cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions from CD133+ MACS-enriched RPCs, to add cell type and stage specificity to our study. We will also use qPCR to examine Wnt signaling genes, such as Axin2, Ccnd1, Myc, Sox2 and Tnnt3.</p>

<p>(5) The gene expression analysis is not completely convincing. E.g. the expression of additional glycolytic genes should be shown in Figure 1. It is not clear why Hk1 and Pgk1 are specifically shown, and conclusions about changes in glycolysis are difficult to draw from the expression of these two genes. The increase in glycolytic gene expression in the Pten-deficient retina is generally small.</p>

<p>(6) Is it possible that glycolytic inhibition with 2DG slows down the development and production of most newly differentiated cells rather than specifically affecting photoreceptor differentiation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We will examine the impact of  2DG on the differentiation of other retinal cell types, including bipolar and amacrine cells and Muller glia. For technical reasons, we will exclude ganglion cells, which die in culture and are not possible to examine in explants, and horizontal cells, which are a rare cell type, and hence, difficult to accurately quantify.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Hanna et al., addresses the question of energy metabolism in the retina, a neuronal tissue with an inordinately high energy demand. Paradoxically, the retina appears to employ to a large extent glycolysis to satisfy its energetic needs, even though glycolysis is far less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The focus of the present study is on the early development of the retina and the retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that proliferate and differentiate to form the seven main classes of retinal neurons. The authors use different genetic and pharmacological manipulations to drive the metabolism of RPCs or the retina towards higher or lower glycolytic activity. The results obtained suggest that increased glycolytic activity in early retinal development produces a more rapid differentiation of RPCs, resulting in a more rapid maturation of photoreceptors and photoreceptor segment growth. The study is significant in that it shows how metabolic activity can determine cell fate decisions in retinal neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study provides important findings that are highly relevant to the understanding of how early metabolism governs the development of the retina. The outcomes of this study could be relevant also for human diseases that affect early retinal development, including retinopathy of maturity where an increased oxygenation likely causes a disturbance of energy metabolism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these positive comments on our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The restriction to only relatively early developmental time points makes it difficult to assess the consequences of the different manipulations on the (more) mature retina. Notably, it is conceivable that early developmental manipulations, while producing relevant effects in the young post-natal retina, may &quot;even out&quot; and may no longer be visible in the mature, adult retina.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree that it would be interesting to observe the long-term consequences of our manipulations, we are limited by our retinal explant model, which can at best be cultured for 2 weeks <italic>in vitro.</italic> Additional limitations include the lack of photoreceptor outer segment development in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model. However, we can perform more extensive analyses of our genetic models <italic>in vivo</italic> (i.e., Pten-cKO, cyto-PFKB3-GOF, Ctnnb1-cKO). For these lines, we will focus on more in-depth analyses of photoreceptor differentiation and outer segment maturation using additional markers and one later stage of development.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines the metabolic regulation of progenitor proliferation and differentiation in the developing retina. The authors observe dynamic changes in glycolytic gene expression in retinal progenitors and use various strategies to test the role of glycolysis. They find that elevated glycolysis in Pten-cKO retinas results in alteration of RPC fate, while inhibition of glycolysis has converse effects. They specifically test the role of elevated glycolysis using dominant active cytoPFKB3, which demonstrates the selective effects of elevated glycolysis on progenitor proliferation and rod differentiation. They then show that elevated glycolysis modulates both pHi and Wnt signaling, and provide evidence that these pathways impact proliferation and differentiation of progenitors, particularly affecting rod photoreceptor differentiation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a compelling and rigorous study that provides an important advance in our understanding of metabolic regulation of retina development, addressing a major gap in knowledge. A key strength is that the study utilizes multiple genetic and pharmacological approaches to address how both increased or decreased glycolytic flux affect retinal progenitor proliferation and differentiation. They discover elevated Wnt signaling pathway genes in Pten cKO retina, revealing a potential link between glycolysis and Wnt pathway activation. Altogether the study is comprehensive and adds to the growing body of evidence that regulation of glycolysis plays a key role in tissue development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these positive comments on our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Following the expression of cytoPFKB3, which results in increased glycolytic flux, BrDU labeling was performed at e12.5 and increased labeled cells were detected in the outer nuclear layer. However whether these are cones or rods is not established. The rest of the analysis is focused on the precocious maturation of rhodopsin-labeled outer segments, and the major conclusions emphasize rod photoreceptor differentiation. Therefore, it is unclear whether there is an effect on cone differentiation for either Pten cKO or cytoPFKB3 transgenic retina. It is also not established whether rods are born precociously. Presumably, this would be best detected by BrDU labeling at later embryonic stages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that we should expand our study to also examine cone differentiation and outer segment maturation, which we will now do by adding additional markers to our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors find that there is upregulation of multiple Wnt pathway components in Pten cKO retina. They further show that inhibiting Wnt signaling phenocopies the effects of reducing glycolysis. However, they do not test whether pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling reverses the effects of high glycolytic activity in Pten cKO retinas. Thus the argument that Wnt is a key downstream effector pathway regulating rod photoreceptor differentiation is weak.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The use of sodium acetate to force protein acetylation is quite non-specific and will have effects beyond beta-catenin acetylation (which the authors acknowledge). Thus it is a stretch to state that &quot;forced activation of beta-catenin acetylation&quot; mimics the impact of Pten loss/high glycolytic activity in RPCs since the effects could be due to acetylation of other proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As outlined in our response to Reviewer #1, point 4, we will now assess K49 b-catenin acetylation levels, as conducted by Oginuma et al. This analysis will allow us to determine whether b-catenin acetylation is altered with manipulations of Pten, glycolysis, pH or acetate treatments.</p>
