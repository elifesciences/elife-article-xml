<abstract>
<p>The class 1A phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) beta (PI3Kβ) is functionally unique in the ability to integrate signals derived from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and Rho-family GTPases. The mechanism by which PI3Kβ prioritizes interactions with various membrane tethered signaling inputs, however, remains unclear. Previous experiments have not been able to elucidate whether interactions with membrane-tethered proteins primarily control PI3Kβ localization versus directly modulate lipid kinase activity. To address this gap in our understanding of PI3Kβ regulation, we established an assay to directly visualize and decipher how three binding interactions regulate PI3Kβ when presented to the kinase in a biologically relevant configuration on supported lipid bilayers. Using single molecule Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy, we determined the mechanism controlling membrane localization of PI3Kβ, prioritization of signaling inputs, and lipid kinase activation. We find that auto-inhibited PI3Kβ must first cooperatively engage a single RTK-derived tyrosine phosphorylated (pY) peptide before it can engage either GβGγ or Rac1(GTP). Although pY peptides strongly localize PI3Kβ to membranes, they only modestly stimulate lipid kinase activity. In the presence of either pY/GβGγ or pY/Rac1(GTP), PI3Kβ activity is dramatically enhanced beyond what can be explained by the increase in membrane avidity for these complexes. Instead, PI3Kβ is synergistically activated by pY/GβGγ and pY/Rac1(GTP) through a mechanism of allosteric regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Critical for cellular organization, phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipids regulate the localization and activity of numerous proteins across intracellular membranes in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Di Paolo and De Camilli 2006</xref>). The interconversion between various PIP lipid species through the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of inositol head groups is regulated by lipid kinases and phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balla 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burke 2018</xref>). Serving a critical role in cell signaling, the class I family of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] to generate PI(3,4,5) P<sub>3</sub>. Although a low-abundance lipid (&lt; 0.05%) in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wenk et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nasuhoglu et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Stephens, Jackson, and Hawkins 1993</xref>), PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> can increase 40-fold following receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Stephens, Hughes, and Irvine 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Parent et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Insall and Weiner 2001</xref>). Although signal adaptation mechanisms typically restore PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to the basal level following receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Funamoto et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yip et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Auger et al. 1989</xref>), misregulation of the PI3K signaling pathway can result in constitutively high levels of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> that are detrimental to cell health. Since PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> lipids serve an instructive role in driving actin based membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Howard and Oresajo 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Weiner 2002</xref>;</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Graziano et al. 2017</xref>), sustained PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> signaling is known to drive cancer cell metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hanker et al. 2013</xref>). Elevated PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels also stimulates the AKT signaling pathway and Tec family kinases, which can drive cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Manning and Cantley 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fruman et al. 2017</xref>). While much work has been dedicated in determining the factors that participate in the PI3K signaling pathway, how these molecules collaborate to rapidly synthesize PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> remains an important open question. To decipher how amplification of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> arises from the relay of signals between cell surface receptors, lipids, and peripheral membrane proteins, we must understand how membrane localization and activity of PI3Ks is regulated by different signaling inputs. Determining how these biochemical reactions are orchestrated will provide new insight concerning the molecular basis of asymmetric cell division, cell migration, and tissue organization, which are critical for understanding development and tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>In the absence of a stimulatory input, the class IA family of PI3Ks (PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kδ) are thought to reside in the cytoplasm as auto-inhibited heterodimeric protein complexes composed of a catalytic (p110α, p110β, or p110δ) and regulatory subunit (p85α, p85β, p55γ, p50α, or p55α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burke 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Vadas et al. 2011</xref>). The catalytic subunits of class IA PI3Ks contain an N-terminal adaptor binding domain (ABD), a Ras/Rho binding domain (RBD), a C2 domain (C2), and an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Vadas et al. 2011</xref>). The inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain of the regulatory subunit tightly associates with the ABD of the catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yu et al. 1998</xref>), providing structural integrity, while limiting dynamic conformational changes. The nSH2 and cSH2 domains of the regulatory subunit form additional inhibitory contacts that limit the conformational dynamics of the catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mandelker et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burke et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carpenter et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yu et al. 1998</xref>). A clearer understanding of the how various proteins control PI3K localization and activity would help facilitate the development of drugs that perturb specific protein-protein binding interfaces that are critical for membrane targeting and lipid kinase activity. Among the class IA PI3Ks, PI3Kβ is uniquely capable of interacting with Rho-family GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fritsch et al. 2013a</xref>), Rab GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Christoforidis et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Heitz et al. 2019</xref>), heterotrimeric G-protein complexes (GβGγ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kurosu et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Maier, Babich, and Nürnberg 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Guillermet-Guibert et al. 2008</xref>), and phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carpenter et al. 1993</xref>). Like other class IA PI3Ks, interactions with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) derived phosphotyrosine peptides release nSH2 and cSH2-mediated inhibition of the catalytic subunit to stimulate PI3Kβ lipid kinase activity (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">H. A. Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>; Zhang et al. 2011b). GβGγ and Rac1(GTP) in solution have also been shown to stimulate PI3Kβ lipid kinase activity (Hashem A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fritsch et al. 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Maier, Babich, and Nürnberg 1999</xref>). Similarly, activation of Rho-family GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fritsch et al. 2013a</xref>) and G-protein coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Houslay et al. 2016</xref>) stimulate PI3Kβ lipid kinase activity in cells. However, it’s unclear how individual interactions with GβGγ or Rac1(GTP) can bypass autoinhibition of full-length PI3Kβ (p110β-p85α/β). Studies in neutrophils and <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemistry suggest that PI3Kβ is synergistically activated through coincidence detection of RTKs and GβGγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Houslay et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Hashem A. Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>). Similarly, Rac1(GTP) and GβGγ have been reported to synergistically activate PI3Kβ in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Erami et al. 2017</xref>). An enhanced membrane recruitment mechanism is the most prominent model used to explain synergistic activation of PI3Ks.</p>
<p>There is limited kinetic data examining how PI3Kβ is regulated by different membrane-tethered proteins. Previous biochemical studies of PI3Kβ have utilized solution-based assays to measure P(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production. As a result, the mechanisms that determine how PI3Kβ prioritizes interactions with RTKs, small GTPases, or GβGγ remains unclear. In the case of synergistic PI3Kβ activation, it’s unclear which protein-protein interactions regulate membrane localization versus stimulate lipid kinase activity. No studies have simultaneously measured PI3Kβ membrane association and lipid kinase activity to decipher potential mechanisms of allosteric regulation. Previous studies concerning the synergistic activation of PI3Ks are challenging to interpret because RTK derived peptides are always presented in solution alongside membrane anchored signaling inputs. However, all the common signaling inputs for PI3K activation (i.e. RTKs, GβGγ, Rac1/Cdc42) are membrane associated proteins. Activation of class 1A PI3Ks has never been reconstituted using solely membrane tethered activators conjugated to membranes in a biologically relevant configuration. As a result, we currently lack a comprehensive description of PI3Kβ membrane recruitment and catalysis.</p>
<p>To decipher the mechanisms controlling PI3Kβ membrane binding and activation, we established a biochemical reconstitution using supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). We used single molecule Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to quantify the relationship between PI3Kβ localization, lipid kinase activity, and the density of various membrane-tethered signaling inputs. This approach allowed us to measure the dwell time, binding frequency, and diffusion coefficients of single fluorescently labeled PI3Kβ in the presence of RTK derived peptides, Rac1(GTP), and GβGγ. Simultaneous measurements of PI3Kβ membrane recruitment and lipid kinase activity allowed us to define the relationship between PI3Kβ localization and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production in the presence of different regulators. Overall, we found that membrane docking of PI3Kβ first requires interactions with RTK-derived tyrosine phosphorylated (pY) peptides, while PI3Kβ localization is insensitive to membranes that contain either Rac1(GTP) or GβGγ alone. Following engagement with a pY peptide, PI3Kβ can associate with either GβGγ or Rac1(GTP). In the case of synergistic PI3Kβ localization mediated by pY/GβGγ, it’s essential for the nSH2 domain to move away from the GβGγ binding site. Although both the PI3Kβ-pY-Rac1(GTP) and PI3Kβ-pY-GβGγ complexes display a ∼2-fold increase in membrane localization, the corresponding increase in catalytic efficiency is much greater. Overall, our results indicate that synergistic activation of PI3Kβ depends on allosteric modulation of lipid kinase activity.</p>

<title>PI3Kβ prioritizes interactions with pY peptides over Rac1(GTP) and GβGγ</title>
<p>Previous biochemical analysis of p110β-p85α, referred to as PI3Kβ, established that receptor tyrosine kinases (Zhang et al. 2011b), Rho-type GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fritsch et al. 2013a</xref>), and heterotrimeric G-protein GβGγ (Hashem A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>) are capable of binding and stimulating lipid kinase activity. To decipher how PI3Kβ prioritizes interactions between these three membrane-tethered proteins we established a method to directly visualize PI3Kβ localization on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). For this assay, we covalently attached either a doubly tyrosine phosphorylated platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) peptide (pY) peptide or recombinantly purified Rac1 to supported membranes using cysteine reactive maleimide lipids. We confirmed membrane conjugation of the pY peptide and Rac1 by visualizing the localization of fluorescently labeled nSH2-Cy5 or Cy3-p67/phox (Rac1(GTP) sensor), respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Nucleotide exchange of membrane conjugated Rac1(GDP) was achieved by the addition of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, P-Rex1 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchanger 1 protein) diluted in GTP containing buffer (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rathinaswamy et al. 2021</xref>; 2023), AF488-SNAP dye labeled farnesyl GβGγ was directly visualized following passive absorption into supported membranes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 1</bold>). We confirmed that membrane bound GβGγ was functional by visualizing robust membrane recruitment of Dy647-PI3Kγ by TIRF-M (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). Overall, this assay functions as a mimetic to the cellular plasma membrane and allowed us to examine how different membrane tethered signaling inputs regulate PI3Kβ membrane localization in vitro.</p>

<p>We visualized both single molecule binding events and bulk membrane localization of Dy647-PI3Kβ by TIRF-M to determine which inputs can autonomously recruit autoinhibited Dy647-PI3Kβ from solution to a supported membrane (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). Comparing membrane localization of Dy647-PI3Kβ in the presence of pY, Rac1(GTP), and GβGγ revealed that only the tyrosine phosphorylated peptide (pY) could robustly localize Dy647-PI3Kβ to supported membranes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-1G</xref></bold>). This prioritization of interactions was consistently observed across a variety of membrane lipid compositions (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 2</bold>). Incorporation of up to 20% phosphatidylserine (PS) in supported membranes to increase the anionic charge did not facilitate complex formation between Dy647-PI3Kβ and Rac1(GTP) or GβGγ (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 2</bold>). Although we could detect some transient Dy647-PI3Kβ membrane binding events in the presence of GβGγ alone, the binding frequency was reduced 2000-fold compared our measurements on pY membranes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 2</bold>). In addition, localization of wild-type Dy647-PI3Kβ phenocopied the GβGγ binding mutant, Dy647-PI3Kβ (K532D, K533D), indicating that the low frequency binding events we observed are mostly mediated by lipid interactions rather than direct binding to GβGγ (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 2</bold>).</p>

<title>PI3Kβ cooperatively engages a single membrane tethered pY peptide</title>
<p>Previous biochemical analysis of PI3Kβ utilized pY peptides in solution to study the regulation of lipid kinase activity (Zhang et al. 2011b; Hashem A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>). Using membrane-tethered pY peptide, we quantitatively mapped the relationship between the pY membrane surface density and the membrane binding behavior of Dy647-PI3Kβ (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). To calculate the membrane surface density of conjugated pY, we incorporated a defined concentration of Alexa488-pY (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). We measured the relationship between the total solution concentration of pY peptide used for the membrane conjugation step and the corresponding final membrane surface density (pY per μm<sup>2</sup>). Over a range of pY peptide solution concentrations (0-10 μM), we observed a linear increase in the membrane conjugation efficiency based on the incorporation of fluorescent Alexa488-pY (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Bulk membrane localization of a nSH2-Cy3 sensor showed a corresponding linear increase in fluorescence as a function of pY peptide membrane density (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). By quantifying the average number of Alexa488-pY particles per unit area of supported membrane we calculated the absolute density of pY per μm<sup>2</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To determine how the membrane binding behavior of PI3Kβ is modulated by the membrane surface density of pY, we measured the bulk membrane absorption kinetics of Dy647-PI3Kβ. When Dy647-PI3Kβ was flowed over a membrane containing a low density of ≤ 500 pY/μm<sup>2</sup>, we observed rapid equilibration kinetics consistent with a 1:1 binding stoichiometry (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). When the membrane surface density of pY crossed a threshold density of ∼1000 pY/μm<sup>2</sup>, we observed slower equilibration kinetics consistent with Dy647-PI3Kβ either engaging two pY peptides or exhibiting membrane hopping. Single particle tracking of Dy647-PI3Kβ on membranes containing varying densities of pY peptide revealed that the dwell time was relatively insensitive to the pY peptide density (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>).

<p>The regulatory subunit of PI3Kβ (p85α) contains two SH2 domains that form inhibitory contacts with the catalytic domain (p110β) (Zhang et al. 2011b). The SH2 domains of class 1A PI3Ks have a conserved peptide motif, FLVR, that mediates the interaction with tyrosine phosphorylated peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bradshaw, Mitaxov, and Waksman 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Waksman et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rameh, Chen, and Cantley 1995</xref>). Mutating the arginine to alanine (FLVA mutant) prevents the interaction with pY peptides for both PI3Kα and PI3Kβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yu et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dornan et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nolte et al. 1996</xref>; Zhang et al. 2011b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Breeze et al. 1996</xref>). To determine how the membrane binding behavior of PI3Kβ is modulated by each SH2 domain, we individually mutated the FLVR amino acid sequence to FLVA. Compared to wild type Dy647-PI3Kβ, the nSH2(R358A) and cSH2(R649A) mutants showed a 60% and 75% reduction in membrane localization at equilibrium, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref></bold>). Single molecule dwell time analysis also showed a significant reduction in membrane affinity for Dy647-PI3Kβ nSH2(R358A) and cSH2(R649A) compared to wild type PI3Kβ (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Single molecule diffusion (or mobility) of membrane bound nSH2(R358A) and cSH2(R649A) mutants, however, were nearly identical to wild type Dy647-PI3Kβ (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Because the nSH2 and cSH2 mutants can only interact with a single phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the doubly phosphorylated pY peptide, this further supports a model in which the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3Kβ cooperatively engages one doubly phosphorylated pY peptide under our experimental conditions.</p>

<title>GβGγ dependent enhancement in PI3Kβ localization requires release of the nSH2</title>
<p>Having established that PI3Kβ engagement with a membrane tethered pY peptide is the critical first step for robust membrane localization, we examined the secondary role that GβGγ serves in controlling membrane localization of PI3Kβ bound to pY. To measure synergistic membrane localization mediated by the combination of pY and GβGγ, we covalently linked pY peptides to supported membrane at a surface density of ∼10,000 pY/μm<sup>2</sup> and then allowed farnesyl GβGγ to equilibrate into the membrane.

<p>Parallel to our experiments using membrane conjugated pY, we tested whether solution pY could promote Dy647-PI3Kβ localization to GβGγ-containing membranes. Based on the bulk membrane recruitment, solution pY did not strongly enhance membrane binding of Dy647-PI3Kβ on GβGγ-containing membranes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Single molecule dwell analysis revealed few transient Dy647-PI3Kβ membrane interactions (inset <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>) with a mean dwell time of 116 ms in the presence of GβGγ alone (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 1A</bold>). The presence of 10 μM solution pY modestly increased the mean dwell time of Dy647-PI3Kβ to 136 ms on GβGγ containing membranes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 1B</bold>). This suggests that the affinity between PI3Kβ and GβGγ is relatively weak, which is consistent with previous structural biochemistry studies (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Hashem A. Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>For PI3Kβ to engage GβGγ, it is hypothesized that the nSH2 domain must move out of the way from sterically occluding the GβGγ binding site. This model is supported by previous hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments that only detected interactions between GβGγ and PI3Kβ (p110β) when the nSH2 domain was either absent or disengaged by activation using a soluble RTK pY peptide (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">H. A. Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>). We examined the putative interface of GβGγ bound to the p110β catalytic domain using AlphaFold multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Jumper et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Evans et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Varadi et al. 2022</xref>) which defined hα1 in the helical domain as the binding site. This result was consistent with previous mutagenesis and HDX-MS analysis of GβGγ binding to p110β (Hashem A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>). Comparing our model to previous X-ray crystallographic data of SH2 binding to either p110α and p110β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mandelker et al. 2009</xref>) suggested that the nSH2 domain sterically obstructs the GβGγ binding interface (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 2</bold>), with GβGγ activation only possible when the p110β-nSH2 interface is disrupted. To test this hypothesis, we measured the membrane binding dynamics of Dy647-PI3Kβ nSH2(R358A) on membranes containing pY and GβGγ. Comparing the bulk membrane recruitment of these constructs revealed that the inability of the Dy647-PI3Kβ nSH2 domain to bind to pY peptides, made the kinase insensitive to synergistic membrane recruitment mediated by pY and GβGγ (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>). Similarly, the membrane association dynamics of Dy647-PI3Kβ nSH2(R358A), phenocopied a PI3Kβ (K532D, K533D) mutant that lacks the ability to engage GβGγ (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Rac1(GTP) and pY synergistically enhance PI3Kβ membrane localization</title>
<p>PI3Kβ is the only class IA PI3K that has been shown to interact with Rho-family GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42 (Fritsch et al. 2013b).

<p>Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements of PI3Kβ activity have shown that solution pY stimulates lipid kinase activity (Zhang et al. 2011b; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Hashem A.

Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>) or Rho-family GTPase (Fritsch et al. 2013b) synergistically enhance PI3Kβ activity by a mechanism that remains unclear. Similarly, RTK derived peptides and H-Ras(GTP) have been shown to synergistically activate PI3Kα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buckles et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Siempelkamp et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang et al. 2012</xref>). In the case of PI3Kβ, previous experiments have not determined whether synergistic activation by multiple signaling inputs results from an increase in membrane affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub>) or direct modulation of lipid kinase activity (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub>) through an allosteric mechanism. To determine how PI3Kβ lipid kinase activity is synergistically modulated by either GβGγ or Rho-family GTPases, in the presence of membrane tethered pY peptides, we used TIRF-M to simultaneously visualize Dy647-PI3Kβ membrane binding and monitor the production of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> lipids. To measure the kinetics of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> formation, we purified and fluorescently labeled the pleckstrin homology and Tec homology (PH-TH) domain derived from Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk). We used a form of Btk containing a mutation that disrupts the peripheral PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> lipid binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al. 2015</xref>). This Btk mutant was previously shown to associate with a single PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> head group and exhibits rapid membrane equilibration kinetics <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al. 2019</xref>). Consistent with previous observations, Btk fused to SNAP-AF488 displayed high specificity and rapid membrane equilibration kinetics on SLBs containing PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-5B</xref></bold>). Compared to the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> lipid sensor derived from the Cytohesin/ Grp1 PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">He et al. 2008</xref>; J. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Knight et al. 2010</xref>), the Btk mutant sensor had a faster association rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>ON</italic></sub>) and a more transient dwell time (1/<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>OFF</italic></sub>) making it ideal for kinetic analysis of PI3Kβ lipid kinase activity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> – figure supplement 1</bold>). Using Btk-SNAP-AF488, we measured the production of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> lipids on SLBs by quantifying the time dependent recruitment in the presence of PI3Kβ. The change in Btk-SNAP-AF488 membrane fluorescence could be converted to the absolute number of PI(3,4,5) P<sub>3</sub> lipids produced per μm<sup>2</sup> to determine the catalytic efficiency per membrane bound Dy647-PI3Kβ. While our findings provide a mechanism for enhanced PI3Kβ membrane localization in the presence of either pY-Rac1(GTP) or pY-GβGγ, these results did not reveal the mechanism controlling synergistic activation of lipid kinase activity. To probe if synergistic activation results from enhanced membrane localization or allosteric modulation of PI3Kβ, we first examined how well the pY peptide stimulates PI3Kβ lipid kinase activity on SLBs. In the absence of pY peptides, PI3Kβ did not catalyze the production of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> lipids, while the addition of 10 μM pY in solution resulted in a subtle but detectable increase in PI3Kβ lipid kinase activity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> – figure supplement 2</bold>). By contrast, covalent conjugation of pY peptides to supported lipid bilayers increased the rate of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production by 207-fold (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> – figure supplement 2</bold>). The observed difference in kinetics were consistent with robust membrane recruitment of Dy647-PI3Kβ requiring membrane tethered pY peptides.</p>

<p>Next, we sought to assess if the combination of pY and Rac1(GTP) could synergistically stimulate PI3Kβ activity beyond the expected increase due to the enhanced membrane localization of the PI3Kβ-pY-Rac1(GTP) complex. To decipher the mechanism of synergistic activation, we performed two-phase experiments that accounted for both the total amount of membrane localized Dy647-PI3Kβ and the corresponding kinetics of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> generation. In phase 1 of our experiments, Dy647-PI3Kβ was flowed over SLBs and allowed to equilibrate with either pY-Rac1(GDP) or pY-Rac1(GTP) in the absence of ATP (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-5D</xref></bold>). This resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in Dy647-PI3Kβ localization mediated by Rac1(GTP) on pY containing membranes. Following membrane equilibration of Dy647-PI3Kβ, phase 2 was initiated by adding 1 mM ATP to the reaction chamber to stimulate lipid kinase activity. We found that the addition of ATP did not alter the bulk localization of Dy647-PI3Kβ, though the kinase was in dynamic equilibrium between the solution and membrane. Conducting experiments in this manner allowed us to measure activation by inputs while removing uncertainty from differential Dy647-PI3Kβ association with various signaling inputs. After accounting for the 1.8-fold difference in Dy647-PI3Kβ membrane localization comparing pY-Rac1(GDP) and pY-Rac1(GTP) membranes, we calculated a 4.3-fold increase in PI3Kβ activity that was Rac1(GTP) dependent.</p>
<p>We next examined how pY and GβGγ synergistically activate PI3Kβ using the two-phase kinase assay described above (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). In our pilot experiments, we immediately observed more robust PI3Kβ activation in the presence of pY-GβGγ, compared to pY-Rac1(GTP). To accurately measure the rapid kinetics of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> generation on SLBs we had to use a 100-fold lower concentration of Dy647-PI3Kβ. Under these conditions, single membrane bound Dy647-PI3Kβ molecules could be spatially resolved, which allowed us to measure the catalytic efficiency per PI3Kβ (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></bold>). Comparing the activity of Dy647-PI3Kβ on membranes with either pY or pY-GβGγ, we observed a 22-fold increase in catalytic efficiency comparing the PI3Kβ-pY and PI3Kβ-pY-GβGγ complexes (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref></bold>). Based on membrane bound density of ∼0.2 Dy647-PI3Kβ per μm<sup>2</sup>, we calculate a <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> of 57 PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> lipids/sec•PI3Kβ on pY-GβGγ containing membranes. By contrast, the Dy647-PI3Kβ-pY complex had a <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> of ∼3 PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> lipids/sec•PI3Kβ.</p>

<title>Prioritization of signaling inputs</title>
<p>The exact mechanisms that regulate how PI3Kβ prioritizes interactions with signaling input, such as pY, Rac1(GTP), and GβGγ remains unclear. To fill this gap in knowledge, we directly visualized the membrane association and dissociation dynamics of fluorescently labeled PI3Kβ on supported lipid bilayers using single molecule TIRF microscopy. This is the first study to reconstitute membrane localization and activation of a class 1A PI3K using multiple signaling inputs that are all membrane tethered in a physiologically relevant configuration. Previous experiments have relied exclusively on phosphotyrosine peptides (pY) in solution to activate PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, or PI3Kδ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dornan et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Hashem A. Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>). However, pY peptides are derived from the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which reside in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lemmon and Schlessinger 2010</xref>). Although pY peptides in solution can disrupt the inhibitory contacts between the regulatory and catalytic subunits of class 1A PI3Ks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yu et al. 1998</xref>), they do not robustly localize PI3Ks to membranes. When conjugated to a SLB we find that pY peptides strongly localize auto-inhibited PI3Kβ, while membranes containing only Rac1(GTP) or GβGγ are unable to localize PI3Kβ. We observed this prioritization of signaling input interactions over a range of membrane compositions that contained physiologically relevant densities of anionic lipids, such as phosphatidylserine and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Although a small fraction of PI3Kβ may transiently adopt a conformation that is compatible with direct Rac1(GTP) or GβGγ association in the absence of pY, these events are rare and do not represent a probable path for initial membrane docking of PI3Kβ.</p>
<p>Based on our single molecule dwell time and diffusion analysis, Dy647-PI3Kβ can cooperatively bind to one doubly phosphorylated peptide derived from the PDGF receptor. Supporting this model, Dy647-PI3Kβ with a mutated nSH2 or cSH2 domain that eliminates pY binding, still displayed membrane diffusivity indistinguishable from wild-type PI3Kβ. The diffusion coefficient of membrane bound pY-PI3Kβ complexes also did not significantly change over a broad range of pY membrane surface densities that span 3 orders of magnitude. Given that diffusivity of peripheral membrane binding proteins is strongly correlated with the valency of membrane interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ziemba and Falke 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hansen et al. 2022</xref>), we expected to observe a decrease in Dy647-PI3Kβ diffusion with increasing membrane surface densities of pY. Instead, our data suggests that the vast majority of PI3Kβ molecules engage a single pY peptide, rather than binding one tyrosine phosphorylated residue on two separate pY peptides. While no structural studies have shown how exactly the tandem SH2 domains of PI3K (p85α) simultaneously bind to a doubly phosphorylated pY peptide, the interactions likely resemble the mechanism reported for ZAP-70 (β-chain of T-cell Receptor Associated Protein Kinase 70). The tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 can bind to a doubly phosphorylated β-chain derived from the TCR with only 11 amino acids spacing between the two tyrosine phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hatada et al. 1995</xref>). In the case of our PDGFR derived pY peptide that binds p85α, 10 amino acids separate the two tyrosine phosphorylated residues.</p>
<p>Following the engagement of a pY peptide, we find that PI3Kβ can then associate with membrane anchored Rac1(GTP) or GβGγ. We detected the formation of PI3Kβ-pY-Rac1(GTP) and PI3Kβ-pY-GβGγ complexes based on the following criteria: (1) increase in Dy647-PI3Kβ bulk membrane recruitment, (2) increase in single molecule dwell time, and (3) a decrease in membrane diffusivity. Consistent with Dy647-PI3Kβ having a weak affinity for GβGγ, pY peptides in solution were unable to strongly localize Dy647-PI3Kβ to SLBs containing membrane anchored GβGγ. This is in agreement with HDX-MS data showing that the p110β-GβGγ interaction can only be detected using a GβGγ-p85α(icSH2) chimeric fusion or pre-activating PI3Kβ with solution pY (Hashem A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>). Using AlphaFold Multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Evans et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Jumper et al. 2021</xref>), we created a model that illustrates how the p85α(nSH2) domain is predicted to sterically block GβGγ binding to p110β. This model was validated by comparing the AlphaFold Multimer model to previous reported HDX-MS (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">H. A. Dbouk et al. 2010</xref>) and X-ray crystallography data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang et al. 2011a</xref>). Further supporting this model, we found that the Dy647-PI3Kβ nSH2(R358A) mutant tethered to membrane conjugated pY peptide was unable to engage membrane anchored GβGγ. Membrane targeting of PI3Kβ by pY was required to relieve nSH2 mediated autoinhibition and expose the GβGγ binding site. Recruitment by membrane tethered pY also reduces the translational and rotational entropy of PI3Kβ, which facilitates PI3Kβ-pY-GβGγ complex formation. We observed a similar mechanism of synergistic PI3Kβ localization on SLBs containing pY and Rac1(GTP). However, we did not determine the role p85α inhibition serves in regulating the association between PI3Kβ and Rac1(GTP). In the case of PI3Kα, interactions with Ras(GTP) on vesicles or in solution have previously been shown to require pY peptide to relieve autoinhibition.</p>

<title>Mechanism of synergistic activation</title>
<p>Previous characterization of PI3Kβ lipid kinase activity has utilized solution-based assays to measure P(3,4,5) P<sub>3</sub> production. These solution-based measurements lack spatial information concerning the mechanism of PI3Kβ membrane recruitment and activation. Our ability to simultaneously visualize PI3Kβ membrane localization and P(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production is critical for determining which regulatory factors directly modulate the catalytic efficiency of PI3Kβ. In the case of PI3Kα, the enhanced membrane recruitment model has been used to explain the synergistic activation mediated by pY and Ras(GTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buckles et al. 2017</xref>). In other words, the PI3Kα-pY-Ras complex is more robustly localized to membranes compared to the PI3Kα-pY and PI3Kα-Ras complexes, which results in a larger total catalytic output for the system. Although the Ras binding domain (RBD) of PI3Kα and PI3Kβ are conserved, these kinases interact with distinct Ras superfamily GTPases (Fritsch et al. 2013b). Therefore, it’s possible that PI3Kα and PI3Kβ display different mechanisms of synergistic activation, which could explain their non-overlapping roles in cell signaling.</p>
<p>Studies of PI3Kβ mouse knock-in mutations in primary macrophages and neutrophils have shown that robust PI3Kβ activation requires coincident activation through the RTK and GPCR signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Houslay et al. 2016</xref>). This response most strongly depends on the ability of PI3Kβ to bind GβGγ and to a lesser extent Rac1/Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Houslay et al. 2016</xref>). Although these mutational studies have nicely demonstrated the modes of synergistic PI3Kβ activation in cells, signaling network crosstalk and redundancy limits our mechanistic understanding of how PI3Kβ prioritizes signaling inputs and the exact mechanism for driving PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production. Based on our single molecule membrane binding experiments, auto-inhibited PI3Kβ is unable to bind directly to either Rac1(GTP) or GβGγ in the absence of pY peptides. We found that PI3Kβ kinase activity is also relatively insensitive to either Rac1(GTP) or GβGγ alone. This is in contrast to previous reports that showed Rho-GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fritsch et al. 2013a</xref>) and GβGγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Katada et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Hashem A. Dbouk et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Maier, Babich, and Nürnberg 1999</xref>) can activate PI3Kβ, albeit modest, compared to synergistic activation with pY peptides plus Rac1(GTP) or GβGγ.</p>
<p>In our single molecule TIRF experiments, we find that the pY peptide is the only factor that robustly localizes PI3Kβ to supported membranes in an autonomous manner. However, the pY-PI3Kβ complex displays weak lipid kinase activity (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> = ∼3 PI(3,4,5) P<sub>3</sub> lipids/sec•PI3Kβ). This is consistent with cellular measurements showing that RTK activation by insulin (<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Z. A. Knight et al. 2006</xref>), PDGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Guillermet-Guibert et al. 2008</xref>), or EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ciraolo et al. 2008</xref>) show little PI3Kβ dependence for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production. Although the dominant role of PI3Kα in controlling PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production downstream of RTKs can mask the contribution from PI3Kβ in some cell types, these results highlight the need for PI3Kβ to be synergistically activated. When we measured the kinetics of lipid phosphorylation for PI3Kβ-pY-Rac1(GTP) and PI3Kβ-pY-GβGγ complexes we observed synergistic activation beyond simply enhancing PI3Kβ membrane localization. After accounting for the ∼1.8-fold increase in membrane localization between PI3Kβ-pY-Rac1(GTP) and PI3Kβ-pY-Rac1(GDP), we calculated a 4.3-fold increase in <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> that was dependent on engaging Rac1(GTP). Comparing the kinase activity of PI3Kβ-pY and PI3Kβ-pY-GβGγ complexes that are present at the same membrane surface density (∼0.2 PI3Kβ/μm<sup>2</sup>) revealed a 22-fold increase in <italic>k</italic> <sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> mediated by the GβGγ interaction. Together, these results indicate that PI3Kβ-pY complex association with either Rac1(GTP) or GβGγ allosterically modulates PI3Kβ, making it more catalytically efficient.</p>

<title>Mechanisms controlling cellular activation of PI3Kβ</title>
<p>Studies of PI3K activation by pY peptides have mostly been performed using peptides derived from the IRS-1 (Insulin Receptor Substrate 1) and the EGFR/PDGF receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Backer et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fantl, Martin, and Turck 1992</xref>). As a result, we still have not defined the broad specificity p85α has for tyrosine phosphorylated peptides. Biochemistry studies indicate that the nSH2 and cSH2 domains of p85α robustly bind pY residues with a methionine in the +3 position (pYXXM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Breeze et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nolte et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Backer et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fantl, Martin, and Turck 1992</xref>). The p85α subunit is also predicted to interact with the broad repertoire of receptors that contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) baring the pYXX(L/I) motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Reth 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Osman et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zenner et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Love and Hayes 2010</xref>). Based on RNA seq data, human neutrophils express at least six different Fc receptors (FcRs) that all contain phosphorylated ITAMs that can potentially facilitate membrane localization of class 1A PI3Ks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rincón, Rocha-Gregg, and Collins 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>A variety of human diseases result from the overexpression of RTKs, especially the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sauter et al. 1996</xref>). When the cellular plasma membrane contains densities of EGFR greater than 2000 receptors/μm<sup>2</sup>, trans-autophosphorylation and activation can occur in a EGF-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Endres et al. 2013</xref>). Receptor membrane surface densities above the threshold needed for spontaneous receptor trans-autophosphorylation have been observed in many cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Haigler et al. 1978</xref>). In these disease states, PI3K is expected to localize to the plasma membrane in the absence of ligand induced RTK or GPCR signaling. The slow rate of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production we measured for the membrane tethered pY-PI3Kβ complex suggests that PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels are not likely to rise above the global inhibition imposed by lipid phosphatases until synergistic activation of PI3Kβ by RTKs and GPCRs. However, loss of PTEN in some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jia et al. 2008</xref>) could produce an elevated level of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> due to PI3Kβ being constitutively membrane localized via ligand independent trans-autophosphorylation of RTKs.</p>

<title>BACMID and baculovirus production</title>
<p>We generated BACMID DNA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hansen et al. 2019</xref>). FASTBac1 plasmids containing our gene of interested were transformed into DH10 Bac cells and plated on LB agar media containing 50 μg/ mL kanamycin, 10 μg/mL tetracycline, 7 μg/mL gentamycin, 40 μg/mL X-GAL, and 40 μg/mL IPTG. Plated cells were incubated for 2-3 days at 37ºC before positive clones were isolated based on blue-white colony selection. White colonies were inoculated into 5mL of TPM containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin, 10 μg/mL tetracycline, 7 μg/ mL gentamycin and grown overnight at 37ºC. To purify the BACMID DNA, we first pelleted the cultures via centrifugation, then re-suspended the pellet in 300 μL of buffer containing 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 10 mM EDTA, 100 μg/mL RNase A. We lysed bacteria via addition of 300 μL of buffer containing 200 mM NaOH, 1% SDS before neutralization with 300 μL of 4.2 M Guanidine HCl, 0.9 M KOAc [pH 4.8]. We then centrifuged the sample at 23ºC for 10 minutes at 14,000 x g. Supernatant containing the BACMID DNA was combined with 700 μL 100% isopropanol and spun for 10-minute at 14,000 x g. The DNA pellets were washed twice with 70% ethanol (200 μL and 50 μL) and centrifuged. The ethanol was removed by vacuum aspiration and the final DNA pellet was dried in a biosafety hood. Finally, we solubilized the BACMID DNA in 50-100 μL of sterile filtered MilliQ water. A Nanodrop was used to quantify the total DNA concentration. BACMID DNA was be stored at -20ºC or used immediately for higher transfection efficiency. Baculovirus was generated as previously described. In brief, we incubated 5-7 μg of BACMID DNA with 4 μL Fugene (Thermo Fisher, Cat# 10362100) in 250 μL of Opti-MEM serum free media for 30 minutes at 23ºC. The DNA-Fugene mixture was then added to a Corning 6-well plastic dish (Cat# 07-200-80) containing 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (Sf9) insect cells in 2 mL of ESF 921 Serum-Free Insect Cell Culture media (Expression Systems, Cat# 96-001, Davis, CA.). 4-5 days following the initial transfection, we harvested and centrifuged the viral supernatant (called “P0”). P0 was used to generate a P1 titer by infecting 7 × 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>Sf9</italic> cells plated in a 10 cm tissue culture grade petri dish containing 10 mL of ESF 921 media and 2% Fetal Bovine serum (Seradigm, Cat# 1500-500, Lot# 176B14). We harvested and centrifuged the P1 titer after 4 days of transfection. The P1 titer was expanded at a concentration of 1% vol/vol of P1 titer into a 100 mL Sf9 cell culture grown to a density of 1.25-1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in a sterile 250 mL polycarbonate Erlenmeyer flask with vented cap (Corning, #431144). The P2 titer (viral supernatant) was harvested, centrifuged, and 0.22 μm filtered in 150 mL filter-top bottle (Corning, polyethersulfone (PES), Cat#431153). We used this P2 titer for protein expression in High 5 cells grown in ESF 921 Serum-Free Insect Cell Culture media (0% FBS) at a final baculovirus concentration of ∼2% vol/vol. All our media contained 1x concentration of Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco/Invitrogen, Cat#15240-062).</p>

Resin was washed with buffer containing 50 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> [pH 8.0], 30 mM imidazole, 400 mM NaCl, and 5 mM BME. Protein was eluted from NiNTA resin with wash buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The his6-TEV-PIK3CB/ybbr-PIK3R1 complex was then desalted on a G25 Sephadex column in buffer containing 20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. Peak fractions were pooled and loaded onto a Heparin anion exchange column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT buffer. Proteins were resolved over a 10-100% linear gradient (0.1-1 M NaCl) at 2 mL/min flow rate over 20 minutes. Peak fractions were pooled and supplemented with 10% glycerol, 0.05% CHAPS, and 200 μg/mL his6-TEV(S291V) protease. The his6-TEV-PIK3CB/ybbr-PIK3R1 complex was incubated overnight at 4ºC with TEV protease to remove the affinity tag. The TEV protease cleaved PIK3CB/ybbr-PIK3R1 complex was separated on a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare, Cat# 17-5174-01) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, 0.05% CHAPS. Peak fractions were concentrated in a 50 kDa MWCO Amicon centrifuge tube and snap frozen at a final concentration of 10 μM using liquid nitrogen. This protein is referred to as PI3Kβ throughout the manuscript. The same protocol was followed to purify mouse PI3Kγ (PIK3CG/ybbr-PIK3R5) and the various PI3Kβ mutants reported in this study.</p>

We report lipid mixtures as percentages equivalent to molar fractions. We dried a total of 2 μmoles lipids were combined with 2mL of chloroform in a 35 mL glass round bottom flask containing. This mixture was dried to a thin film via rotary evaporation where the glass round-bottom flask was kept in a 42ºC water bath. Following evaporation, we either flushed the lipid-containing flask with nitrogen gas or placed in it a vacuum desiccator for a minimum of 30 minutes. We obtained a concentration of 1 mM of lipids by resuspending the dried film in 2 mL of 1x PBS [pH 7.2]. We generated 30-50 nm SUVs from this 1 mM total lipid mixture via extrusion of the resuspended lipid mixture through 0.03 μm pore size 19 mm polycarbonate membrane (Avanti #610002) with filter supports (Avanti #610014) on both sides of the PC membrane. We prepared coverglass (25×75 mm, IBIDI, cat #10812) for depositing of SUV’s by first cleaning with heated (60-70ºC) 2% Hellmanex III (Fisher, Cat#14-385-864) in a glass coplin jar. We incubated hot Hellmanex III and coverglass for at least 30 minutes before rinsing with MilliQ water. The cleaned glass was then etched with Piranha solution (1:3, hydrogen peroxide:sulfuric acid) for 5-10 minutes. We rinsed and stored the etched coverglass in MilliQ. We rapidly dried our MilliQ-rinsed etched coverglass slides with nitrogen gas before adhering to a 6-well sticky-side chamber (IBIDI, Cat# 80608). We created SLBs by flowing 100-150μL of SUVs with a total lipid concentration of 0.25 mM in 1x PBS [pH 7.2] into the IBIDI chamber. Following 30 minutes of incubation, supported membranes were washed with 4 mL of 1x PBS [pH 7.2] to remove non-absorbed SUVs. To block membrane defects, we prepared 1 mg/mL beta casein (Thermo FisherSci, Cat# 37528) by clarifying with a centrifugation step at 4°C for 30 minutes at 21370 x <italic>g</italic> before passing through 0.22 μm syringe filtration unit (0.22 μm PES syringe filter (Foxx Life Sciences, Cat#381-2116-OEM). We then blocked membrane defects with 1 mg/mL beta casein (Thermo FisherSci, Cat# 37528) for 5-10 minutes.</p>

<title>Protein conjugation of maleimide lipid</title>
<p>After blocking SLBs with beta casein, membranes were washed with 2mL of 1x PBS and stored at room temperature for up to 2 hours before mounting on the TIRF microscope. Prior to single molecule imaging experiments, supported membranes were washed into TIRF imaging buffer. Supported membrane containing with MCC-PE lipids were used to covalently couple either H-Ras(GDP) or phosphotyrosine peptide (pY). For the pY peptide experiments we used a doubly phosphorylated peptide derived from the mouse platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) with the following sequence: CSDGG(pY)MDMSKDESID(pY)VPMLDMKGDIKYADIE (33aa). The Alexa488-pY contained the same sequence with the dye conjugated to the C-terminus of the peptide. For these SLBs, 100 μL of 30 μM H-Ras diluted in a 1x PBS [pH 7.2] and 0.1 mM TCEP buffer was added to the IBIDI chamber and incubated for 2 hours at 23ºC. Importantly, the addition of 0.1 mM TCEP significantly increases the coupling efficiency. SLBs with MCC-PE lipids were then washed with 2 mL of 1x PBS [pH 7.2] containing 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) and incubated for 15 minutes to neutralize the unreacted maleimide headgroups. SLBs were washed with 1mL of 1x PBS, followed by 1 mL of kinase buffer before starting smTIRF-M experiments.</p>

<title>Nucleotide exchange of Rac1</title>
<p>Membrane conjugated Rac1(GDP) was converted to Rac1(GTP) using either chemical activation (i.e. EDTA/ GTP/MgCl<sub>2</sub>) or the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), P-Rex1. Chemical activation was accomplished by washing supported membranes containing maleimide linked Rac1(GDP) with 1x PBS [pH 7.2] containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM GTP. Following a 15-minute incubation to exchange GDP for GTP, chambers were washed 1x PBS [pH 7.2] containing 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 50 μM GTP. A complementary approach that utilizes GEF-mediated activation of Rac1 was achieved by flowing 50 nM P-Rex1 DH-PH domain over Rac1(GDP) conjugated membranes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Nucleotide exchange was carried out in buffer containing 1x PBS, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 μM GTP. Both methods of activation yielded the same density of Rac1(GTP). Nucleotide exchange of membrane tethered Rac1 was assessed by visualizing the localization of the Cy3-p67/phox Rac1(GTP) sensor using TIRF-M.</p>

<title>Microscope hardware and imaging acquisition</title>
<p>Single molecule imaging experiments were performed at room temperature (23ºC) using an inverted Nikon Ti2 microscope using a 100x oil immersion Nikon TIRF objective (1.49 NA). We controlled the x-axis and y-axis position using a Nikon motorized stage, joystick, and Nikon’s NIS element software. We also controlled microscope hardware using Nikon NIS elements. Fluorescently labelled proteins were excited with one of three diode lasers: a 488 nm, a 561nm, or 637 nm (OBIS laser diode, Coherent Inc. Santa Clara, CA). The lasers were controlled with a Vortran laser launch and acousto-optic tuneable filters (AOTF) control. Excitation and emission light was transmitted through a multi-bandpass quad filter cube (C-TIRF ULTRA HI S/N QUAD 405/488/561/638; Semrock) containing a dichroic mirror. The laser power measured through the objective for single particle visualized was 1-3 mW. Fluorescence emission was captured on an iXion Life 897 EMCCD camera (Andor Technology Ltd., UK) after passing through one of the following 25 mm a Nikon Ti2 emission filters mounted in a Nikon emission filter wheel: ET525/50M, ET600/50M, and ET700/75M (Semrock).</p>

<title>Single particle tracking</title>
<p>Single fluorescent Dy647-PI3Kβ complexes bound to supported lipid bilayers were identified and tracked using the ImageJ/Fiji TrackMate plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jaqaman et al. 2008</xref>). Data was loaded into ImageJ/Fiji as .nd2 files. We used the LoG detector to identify particles based on their size (∼6 pixel diameter), brightness, and signal-to-noise ratio. We then used the LAP tracker to generate trajectories that followed particle displacement as a function of time. Particle trajectories were then filtered based on Track Start (remove particles at start of movie), Track End (remove particles at end of movie), Duration (particles track ≥ 2 frames), Track displacement, and X - Y location (removed particles near the edge of the movie). The output files from TrackMate were then analyzed using Prism 9 graphing software to calculate the dwell times. To calculate the dwell times of membrane bound proteins we generated cumulative distribution frequency (CDF) plots with the bin size set to image acquisition frame interval (e.g. 52 ms). The log<sub>10</sub>(1-CDF) was plotted as a function dwell time and fit to a single or double exponential curve. For the double exponential curve fits, the alpha value is the percentage of the fast-dissociating molecules characterized by the time constant, τ<sub>1</sub>. A typical data set contained dwell times measured for n ≥ 1000 trajectories repeated as n = 3 technical replicates.</p>

<p>The manuscript aims to provide mechanistic insight into the activation of PI3Kbeta by its known regulators tyrosine phosphorylated peptides, GTP-loaded Rac1 and G-protein beta-gamma subunits. To achieve this the authors have used supported lipid bilayers, engineered recombinant peptides and proteins (often tagged with fluorophores) and TIRF microscopy to enable bulk (averages of many molecules) and single molecule quantitation. The great strength of this approach is the precision and clarity of mechanistic insight. Although the study does not use &quot;in transfecto&quot; or in vivo models the experiments are performed using &quot;physiologically-based&quot; conditions and provide a powerful insight into core regulatory principles that will be relevant in vivo.</p>
<p>The results are beautiful, high quality, well controlled and internally consistent (and with other published work that overlaps on some points) and as a result are compelling. The primary conclusion is that the primary regulator of PI3Kbeta are tyrosine phosphorylated peptides (and by inference tyrosine phsophorylated receptors/adaptors) and that the other activators can synergise with that input but have relatively weak impacts on their own.</p>
<p>Although the methodology is not easily imported, for reasons of both cost and the experience needed to execute them well, the results have broad importance for the field and reverse an impression that had built in large parts of the broader signalling and PI3K communities that all of the inputs to PI3Kbeta were relatively equivalent, however, these conclusions were based on &quot;in cell&quot; or in vivo studies that were very difficult to interpret clearly.</p>

<p>The manuscript of Duewell et al has made critical observations that help to understand the mechanisms of activation of the class IA PI3Ks. By using single-molecule kinetic measurements, the authors have made outstanding progress toward understanding how PI3Kbeta is uniquely activated by phosphorylated tyrosine kinase receptors, Gbeta/gamma heterodimers and the small G protein Rac1. While previous studies have defined these as activators of PI3Kbeta, the current manuscript makes clear the quantitative limitations of these previous observations. Most previous quantitative in vitro studies of PI3Kbeta activation have used soluble peptides derived from bis-phosphorylated receptors to stimulate the enzyme. These soluble peptides stimulate the enzyme, and even stimulate membrane interaction. Although these previous studies showed that the release of p85-mediated autoinhibition unmasks an intrinsic affinity of the enzyme for lipid membranes, they ignored what would be the consequence of these peptide sequences being present in the context of intrinsic membrane proteins. The current manuscript shows that the effect of membrane-conjugated peptides on the enzyme activity is profound, in terms of recruiting the enzyme to membranes. In this context, the authors show that G proteins associated with the membranes have an important contribution to membrane recruitment, but they also have a profound allosteric effect on the activity on the membrane, These are observations that would not have been possible with bulk measurements, and they do not simply recapitulate observations that were made for other class IA PI3Ks.</p>
<p>An important observation that the authors have made is that Gbeta/gamma heterodimers and RAc1 alone have almost no ability to recruit PI3Kbeta to the membranes that they are using, and this is central to one of the most profoundly novel activation mechanisms offered by the manuscript. The authors propose that the nSH2- and Gbeta/gamma binding sites partially overlap, so that Gbeta/gamma can only bind once the nSH2 domain releases the p110beta subunit. This mechanism would mean that once the nSH2 is engaged by membrane-congugated pY, the Gbg heterodimer can bind and increase the association of the enzyme with membranes. Indeed, this increased membrane association is observed by the authors. However, the authors also show that this increased recruitment to membranes accounts for relatively little increase in activity, and that the far greater component of activation is due to an allosteric effect of the membrane association on the activity of the enzyme. The proposal for competition between Gbg binding and the nSH2 is consistent with the behavior of an nSH2 mutant that cannot bind to pY and which, consequently, does not vacate the Gbg-binding site. In addition to the outstanding contribution to understanding the kinetics of activation of PI3Kbeta, the authors have offered the first structural interpretation for the kinetics of Gbg activation in synergy with pY activation. The proposal for an overlapping nSH2/Gbg binding site is supported by predictions made by John Burke, using alphafold multimer. Although there is no experimental structure to support this structural model, it is consistent with HDX-MS analyses that were published previously.</p>
