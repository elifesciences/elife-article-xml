<abstract>
<p>Neuromodulators have major influences on the regulation of neural circuit activity across the nervous system. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to be a prominent neuromodulator in many circuits and has been extensively studied in the retina. Here, it has been associated with the regulation of light adaptation, gain control, and gap junctional coupling, but its effect on the retinal output, specifically on the different types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), is still poorly understood. In this study, we used two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings to measure light-evoked activity of RGCs in the ganglion cell layer in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> mouse retina. This approach allowed us to investigate the neuromodulatory effects of NO on a cell type-level. Our findings reveal that NO selectively modulates the suppression of temporal responses in a distinct subset of contrast-suppressed RGC types, increasing their activity without altering the spatial properties of their receptive fields. Given that NO release is triggered by quick changes in light levels under photopic conditions, we propose that these RGC types signal fast contrast changes to higher visual regions. Remarkably, we found that about one-third of the RGC types, recorded using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, exhibited consistent, cell type-specific adaptational response changes throughout an experiment, independent of NO. By employing a paired-recording paradigm, we could disentangle those additional adaptational response changes from drug-induced modulations. Taken together, our research highlights the selective neuromodulatory effects of NO on RGCs and emphasizes the need of considering non-pharmacological activity changes, like adaptation, in such study designs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The retina can be considered as a visual signal processor with a straightforward functional architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The photoreceptors convert the stream of photons from the environment into an electrical signal, which is relayed downstream by the bipolar cells (BCs) to the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the tissue’s output neurons. Along this vertical pathway, the visual signal is shaped by two lateral, inhibitory cell classes: horizontal cells in the outer and amacrine cells (ACs) in the inner retina. The resulting intricate networks allow sophisticated computations, reflected in the &gt;40 output channels that relay diverse visual feature representations as spike trains to higher brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Over the past decades, the retinal synaptic networks have been intensively studied, which greatly broadened our understanding of early visual signal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Specifically, the availability of connectome data for large parts of the retina helped in unprecedented ways, as can be seen from studies, for example, investigating direction-selective circuits and their precise wiring regarding starburst ACs and direction-selective RGCs (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)).</p>
<p>What is not well-captured by connectomic approaches are ‘wireless’ interactions mediated by neuromodulators, which comprise a broad variety of very different small molecules, including monoamines (e.g., dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>)), endocannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), gasotransmitters such as nitric oxide (NO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)), as well as a variety of neuropeptides (e.g., neuropeptide Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)). Only few of the &gt;20 neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) found in the retina are released from centrifugal fibers (e.g., histamine and serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>)), whereas most of them are released in addition to GABA or glycine by ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Neuromodulators have long been implicated in adapting the retina to different contextual states necessary to robustly perform in a highly dynamic visual environment (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>)). For instance, dopamine (DA) is released by a distinct type of AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), and has been shown to regulate light adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) via several cellular mechanisms, such as modulation of gap junctional coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) and intrinsic conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). More recently, histamine was proposed to shape the retinal code in a top-down modulatory manner related to the animal’s arousal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). For several neuromodulators, the retinal release sites and receptors are known and their effects on cellular properties have been described, however, a comprehensive, function-oriented, and cell-type view of these neuromodulators’ functional implications and contributions to visual signal processing is only slowly emerging (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>)).</p>
<p>One of the better-studied neuromodulators in the retina is NO. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is considered the dominant enzyme producing NO relevant for retinal signal processing, and – depending on species – was shown to be present in different retinal cell classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). In the mouse retina, nNOS was mainly found in specific AC types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). A few years ago, Jacoby et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) demonstrated that one of those types (nNOS2-AC) controls the light-dependent release of NO in the inner retina. NO can function via two main pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>): (<italic>i</italic>) it can bind to the NO guanylate cyclase (NO-GC; also referred to as soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)) receptor, triggering the production of the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which binds to downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), and (<italic>ii</italic>) via S-nitrosylation (cGMP-independent) by directly modifying certain receptor and channel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).</p>
<p>The effects of NO have been primarily linked with light adaptation and the transition between scotopic and photopic signaling pathways via several mechanisms, including uncoupling the gap junctions between AII ACs and Oncone BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>), increasing the gain of On-cone BCs in response to dim light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), and modulating the gain of Offcone BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). At the retina’s output level, increasing NO was found to decrease Onand Off-responses in RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). Notably, genetically knocking out nNOS also led to a reduced light sensitivity in RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>), which was also shown by inhibiting nNOS under light-adapted conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). Additionally, NO has been shown to modulate RGC responses via cGMP by altering their cGMP-gated conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). Taken together, NO can act on different levels and via different pathways in the retina. However, the function of NO at the cell type-level and its role in early visual processing is far from understood.</p>
<p>Here, we systematically studied the functional role of NO and its effects on all retinal output channels in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> mouse retina. Surprisingly, we observed highly reproducible, cell type-specific changes in the light responses of some RGCs already in the absence of pharmacological manipulation. To account for these adaptational response changes, we developed a recording paradigm to measure ‘paired’ RGC responses under control and drug conditions. We found that NO had a highly selective effect on a distinct set of three RGC types characterized by their suppressed response to temporal contrast, where NO strongly and differentially reduced this suppression, as well as caused them to respond faster. Yet, NO had no discernible effects on their spatial receptive field properties. Together, our data suggest that NO modulates the visual feature representation of the retinal output in a highly selective and type-specific manner.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To investigate NO effects systematically on the retinal output, we performed population imaging from somata in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of <italic>ex vivo</italic> mouse retina electroporated with the synthetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-c</xref>; Methods). In addition, we recorded a complementary dataset using multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings. To identify the different types of RGCs and detect potential NO-induced response changes, we presented a set of visual stimuli, including full-field chirps, moving bars (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), and binary dense noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) (see Methods).</p>

<title>A protocol for ‘paired’ control/drug recordings</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that retinal responses recorded with two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging can be systematically affected by experimental factors, such as excitation laser-induced activity, photoreceptor bleaching, and temporal filtering due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering by the fluorescent indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). These changes can be summarized by the umbrella term ‘batch effects’ (a term coined in the molecular genetics field), which can confound the biological signal and potentially cause erroneous interpretations of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). Such batch effects may play a role when, as in our study, data are recorded in a sequential manner to infer possible drug effects.</p>
<p>Because we wanted to detect potentially subtle NO effects, we devised a protocol to make experiments as comparable as possible (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). After placing the tissue into the recording chamber, it was allowed to recover from the electroporation for 15 min, before we light-adapted the retina for 10 min by presenting the dense noise stimulus. We then selected retinal recording fields, each of which was recorded twice for the complete stimulus set in an interlaced manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). The first field was recorded twice without perturbation (<italic>controlcontrol pair</italic>). For the next field, we added the drug to the perfusion medium and incubated the tissue for ∼15 min, before recording the field for the second time (<italic>control-drug pair</italic>).</p>
<p>Using this protocol, we recorded the following paired datasets: (<italic>i</italic>) a control dataset to test response stability, i.e., Ctrl 1 and Ctrl 2, (<italic>ii</italic>) a strychnine dataset to test the protocol for a drug with well-described effects, i.e., Ctrl 1 and Strychnine (1 µM), and <italic>(iii</italic>) a NO-dataset to infer NOinduced response changes, i.e., Ctrl 1 and NO (DETA/NO; 100 µM). The control dataset was leveraged to reveal NOinduced effects on the background of potential nonspecific response changes throughout the experiment. For the following analyses, we used 3,975 paired RGCs (n<sub><italic>Ctrl</italic></sub>=1,701; n<sub><italic>NO</italic></sub>=1,838, n<sub><italic>strychnine</italic></sub>=436) that fulfilled our response quality filtering (see Methods).</p>

<title>Identifying functional RGC types using a classifier</title>
<p>The mouse retina contains more than 40 RGC types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). As we wanted to investigate if the tested drugs differentially affect the different retinal output channels, we applied an RGC type classifier (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>), which had been trained and validated on a previously published RGC Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The classifier predicts a GCL cell’s functional type based on soma size and the responses to chirp and moving bar stimuli (see Methods). The classifier also distinguishes between RGCs and displaced ACs. Here, we focused our analysis on the RGCs. To match the conditions under which the classifier’s training data was acquired as closely as possible, we predicted types based on the responses from the first control recording (Ctrl 1). To minimize classification uncertainty, we additionally discarded cells with low confidence scores (<italic>&lt;</italic> 0.25, see Methods for details).</p>

<p>We found that the distributions of the predicted RGC types in our datasets matched that of the earlier dataset quite well (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-d</xref>). Also, the predicted mean traces for the individual RGC types were very similar to those in Baden et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), as indicated by the high correlations of their chirp and moving bar responses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> left and right, respectively). That the moving bar responses were more strongly correlated than the chirp responses is likely due to the lower complexity and shorter duration of the former stimulus. Nonetheless, we found the RGC classification overall to be robust and comparable to the original dataset (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1a,b</xref>).</p>

<p>To test our recording protocol, we used the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). In the mouse retina, glycine is released by small-field ACs and relays inhibition vertically across the inner plexiform layer (IPL; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>)). For instance, such cross-over inhibition mediated by AII ACs relays the signals from rod BCs to Off-cone BCs, which is why strychnine eliminates Off RGC responses in darkadapted retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>). In the light-adapted retina, On-cone BCs boost light-Off responses in Off-cone BCs through cross-over inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>) and hence, strychnine affects Off-response components in RGCs – in line with our observations (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>): Strychnine application revealed additional On-responses in Off (e.g., G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>) and On-Off RGCs (e.g., G<sub>12</sub>), as can be seen, for instance, in their leading-edge response to the moving bar (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>; left panel, middle column). In On RGCs, we did not detect substantial response changes with strychnine (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>; e.g., G<sub>17</sub>).</p>
<p>Together, the strychnine dataset showcases that we can resolve drug-related effects on light responses at cell typelevel.</p>

<title>Certain RGC types display adaptational response changes</title>
<p>To test if our recording conditions were stable and to exclude major batch effects, we first compared the responses of the control datasets (Ctrl 1 vs. Ctrl 2). To this end, we computed the difference between the Ctrl 1 and Ctrl 2 mean responses (Δ<italic>R</italic><sub>(<italic>Ctrl</italic>2<italic>−Ctrl</italic>1)</sub>) to chirp and moving bar stimuli for each cell of every RGC type. This allowed us to quantify if and how the responses changed over the time course of an experiment (cf. protocol in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Here, we only considered RGC types with &gt;10 paired cells (21/32).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, while the majority of RGC types featured stable responses (e.g., G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>21</sub>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), a substantial number of RGC types (∼34%) changed their responses to chirp and/or moving bar stimuli in the absence of any pharmacological perturbation in a highly reproducible manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). For instance, for Ctrl 2, G<sub>23</sub> showed reduced responses, whereas G<sub>31</sub> showed an increased response activity. Interestingly, cells assigned to the functional groups of ‘Off’ RGC types displayed stable responses, whereas ‘OnOff’, ‘Fast On’, ‘Slow On’, and ‘Uncertain RGCs’ included types with changing responses (50% (2/4), 34% (1/3), 67% (4/6), and 67% (2/3), respectively). This diversity argues against a systematic effect (such as, e.g., general run-down) and for a cell type-specific phenomenon, which in the following we refer to as ‘adaptational response changes’.</p>

<title>NO affects retinal output in a highly type-specific manner</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the effects of NO on the RGC responses. As with the control dataset, we computed the cell-wise response differences between Ctrl 1 and NO responses (Δ<italic>R</italic><sub>(<italic>NO−Ctrl</italic>1)</sub>). Similar to the control dataset, the majority of RGC types displayed stable responses (e.g., G<sub>2</sub>, G<sub>17</sub>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), while ∼43% changed their responses significantly (e.g., G<sub>28</sub>, G<sub>32</sub>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) following the NO perfusion. We found that the percentage of changing types per functional group was similar to that in the control dataset: ‘Off’ (0% (0/5)), ‘On-Off’ (50% (2/4)), ‘Fast On’ (34% (1/3)), ‘Slow On’ (66% (4/6)), and ‘Uncertain RGCs’ (66% (2/3)). This raised the question if the observed changes in the NO-dataset indeed reflected NO-induced modulations or mostly adaptational response changes (as observed in the control dataset). We, therefore, tested for each RGC type if the response changes observed for control (Δ<italic>R</italic><sub>(<italic>Ctrl</italic>2<italic>−Ctrl</italic>1)</sub>) and NO (Δ<italic>R</italic><sub>(<italic>NO−Ctrl</italic>1)</sub>) were significantly different (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). To our surprise, this was only the case for two types: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) G<sub>32</sub> (‘Off suppressed 2’) RGC, which is characterized by a high baseline activity that is strongly suppressed below baseline during light increments and displays increased activity during light decrements, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) G<sub>18</sub>, which is considered as being a ‘Fast On’ type having a response to light increments with a fast response kinetic. This suggests highly type-selective NO effects – at least for temporal responses to chirp and moving bar stimuli.</p>
<p>Next, we leveraged the control dataset to disentangle NOinduced from adaptational effects at the level of the response features. To this end, we subdivided the chirp stimulus into six feature segments ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) On, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) Off, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) low frequency, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) high frequency, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) low contrast, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) high contrast), and the moving bar into two ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) On, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) Off) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Then, for every cell type and every response feature, we computed the difference of the mean responses between the first and second recording separately for the control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; left panel) and NO-dataset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; middle panel). To isolate NO-induced effects, we computed the differences (Δ<italic>R</italic><sub>(<italic>NO−Ctrl</italic>1)</sub> <italic>−</italic>Δ<italic>R</italic><sub>(<italic>Ctrl</italic>2<italic>−Ctrl</italic>1)</sub>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; right panel), based on the assumption that the adaptational component of the changes would be similar for both datasets. Through this analysis, we found three response behaviors across the RGC types: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) not NO-affected/stable, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) showing adaptational cell type-specific changes, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) NO-affected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="572742v2_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>As before, we found that G<sub>32</sub> is strongly affected by NO; it showed barely any adaptational response changes, yet its activity increased during NO application (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>)). This increase in activity was statistically significant for the chirp’s On (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) and Off steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) and during both the frequency and contrast modulations ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>)-(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>)), as well as for the moving bars trailing edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) (for tests, see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> legend), suggesting that NO reduces the cell’s inhibition by temporal contrast.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a cell type from the same larger functional group that features analogous response properties, G<sub>31</sub> (‘Off suppressed 1’), displayed a similar behavior during the NO application (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). However, G<sub>31</sub> showed this response change for most features already in the control, suggesting that this effect was primarily adaptational (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; right panel). Still, our analysis suggests that NO had a significant effect, though different from what we observed for G<sub>32</sub>: in G<sub>31</sub> the response to the chirp’s Off step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) increased, whereas that to the moving bar’s leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) decreased. Note that it is possible that additional NO effects on G<sub>31</sub> may have been ‘masked’ by the strong adaptational response changes.</p>
<p>In the previous analysis, G<sub>18</sub> showed significant differences between the control and NO-dataset, but this effect was not mirrored by the feature-wise analysis, indicating that a potential effect may be much weaker compared to the effect NO has on G<sub>32</sub>. Notably, RGC types that were assigned to the group of the so-called ‘Slow On’ types (G<sub>21</sub>-G<sub>28</sub>), which exhibit strong and sustained responses during the frequency and contrast sequences of the chirp stimulus, showed a decrease in activity in both datasets (e.g., G<sub>24</sub>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>); bottom). Consequently, the changes in these response features ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>)-(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>)) are likely adaptational (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) – as the changes can be found in the control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; left panel) as well as in the NO-dataset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; middle panel), but not in the difference (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; right panel). Our conclusion that both adaptational and NO-mediated effects on RGC responses are highly cell type-selective is further supported by the fact that we also found several RGC types that showed stable responses during control and NO application (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)).</p>
<p>Taken together, our analysis revealed that the adaptational and NO-induced effects occurred on a feature-specific as well as cell type-specific level. On the one hand, several ‘Slow On’ types showed adaptational effects in response to temporal frequency and contrast features, while other features were not affected. On the other hand, at least one distinct RGC type (G<sub>32</sub>) displayed a significantly increased response modulation of most features during the NO application; hence hinting towards an effect of NO on response suppression, as in the case of G<sub>32</sub> is elicited by temporally changing stimulus contrast. Consequently, we focused on a more in-depth analysis of NO-induced effects on G<sub>32</sub>.</p>

<title>Clustering of G<sub>32</sub> responses reveals three functionally distinct RGC types with different NO-sensitivity</title>
<p>According to Baden et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), G<sub>32</sub> features a coverage factor of ∼4. As the average coverage factor of mouse RGCs was estimated to be ∼2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>), G<sub>32</sub> likely consists of several (functional) RGC types. This may be supported by the high variation of G<sub>32</sub> responses, which also supports the presence of several types (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). To test this, we performed Mixture of Gaussians clustering of RGCs assigned as G<sub>32</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-c</xref>) using the Ctrl 1 responses to chirp and moving bar stimuli from both datasets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>).

<p>All three G<sub>32</sub> clusters showed little adaptation for the control dataset, but displayed differential modulations in response to NO application, with cluster 1 exhibiting the strongest NO effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f,g</xref>; left) for both stimuli. The NO effect was statistically significant in clusters 1 (n=134) and 2 (n=126) – both for mean trace difference and correlation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>; left and right, respectively) – but only for trace correlation in cluster 3 (n=77).</p>
<p>Since the prominent feature of these RGC types is suppression by temporal stimulus contrast, we compared their suppression strength between the conditions using a suppression index (<italic>SI</italic>; see Methods). Here, we found that in cluster 1, <italic>SI</italic> marginally, yet significantly, changed between Ctrl 1 and Ctrl 2, but was strongly and significantly reduced by NO as Δ<italic>SI</italic> were significantly different (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>; top panel). Similar response behavior can be found in cluster 2, which displayed significant differences in <italic>SI</italic> and Δ<italic>SI</italic> in both control and NO-dataset (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>; middle panel). In fact, with NO, these cells lost their suppressive feature and were rather excited than suppressed by the stimuli. In contrast, cluster 3 showed no significant differences of the <italic>SI</italic> between Ctrl 1 and Ctrl 2, but a clear modulation by NO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>; bottom panel).</p>
<p>Taken together, our data indicate that G<sub>32</sub> may consist of three suppressed-by-contrast RGC types and that in at least two of them, the contrast suppression is strongly modulated by NO.</p>

<title>NO does not affect RGC receptive field properties</title>
<p>So far, we focused on effects in the temporal response domain, where we found that mainly G<sub>32</sub> types were affected by an increase in NO levels. However, NO has been shown to affect electrical coupling, e.g., by reducing conductance between AII ACs and On-cone BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>), and hence may alter receptive field (RF) properties. Therefore, we next investigated the effects of NO on the spatial RFs (sRFs) of the individual RGC types. To this end, following the same experimental paradigm as described earlier, we recorded RGC responses to binary dense noise. Next, we computed their sRFs for both recording conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>) using spiketriggered averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>), obtaining control and NO sRFs, and then fitted a Gaussian to each sRF’s center (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). We focused the following analysis on RGC types with reliable sRF estimates (see Methods). These included types in all five larger RGC groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>): G<sub>5</sub> for ‘Off’; G<sub>11</sub>, G<sub>12</sub>, and G<sub>14</sub> for ‘On-Off’; G<sub>17</sub> for ‘Fast On’; G<sub>23</sub>, G<sub>24</sub>, G<sub>26</sub>, and G<sub>27</sub> for ‘Slow On’; G<sub>31</sub> and G<sub>32</sub> for ‘Uncertain RGCs’. In these types, sRFs were very stable in both control and NO condition.</p>

<p>Using the difference in sRF center diameter between control and NO as a metric (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>), we did not find NO to cause any significant changes in sRF size in any of the analyzed RGC types. Next, we tested if the sRF surround was affected by NO, because a modulation of inhibitory synaptic input and/or electrical coupling may cause a change in surround strength. As a measure of surround strength, we computed a surround index (see Methods) of control and NO sRFs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Like with the sRF center diameter, we did not find significant differences for any of the analyzed RGC types. Surprisingly, also G<sub>32</sub> did not show NO-mediated differences in its sRF properties, implying that NO may only affect its temporal response, but not its RF organization.</p>
<p>Taken together, at least for the tested RGC types, we did not detect any significant NO effects neither on sRF center size nor surround strength.</p>

<title>NO affects the temporal response kinetics of G<sub>32</sub> subtypes</title>
<p>The high spatial resolution of two-photon imaging allowed us to record and identify individual RGCs. However, it is limited by having a low temporal resolution to capture subtle temporal response dynamics, which led us to record a complementary dataset using MEA recordings. Since we found that the temporal response domain of G<sub>32</sub> and its subtypes were affected by NO, MEA recordings enabled us to further investigate subtle neuromodulatory effects with a higher temporal resolution.</p>
<p>In particular, we recorded light-induced RGC responses (n=391) from four retinae under three consecutive conditions similar to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dataset: <italic>(i)</italic> control, <italic>(ii)</italic> NO-donor (DETA/NO; 100 µM) and <italic>(iii)</italic> wash-out. As for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>dataset, we used the chirp stimulus for type identification as well as a checkerboard stimulus to estimate receptive fields. To identify and compare RGC types across the Ca<sup>2+</sup>and MEA-dataset, we clustered the RGC responses across retinae (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a,b</xref>) and transformed their spike trains in response to the chirp stimulus into pseudo-calcium traces as described in Goldin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>; see Methods). Next, we matched the pseudo-calcium traces with the RGC types obtained from Baden et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). Overall, we were able to record responses from all known RGC types, yet the sampling fractions for most types differ between the datasets, which can be explained by the recording bias inherent in MEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>).</p>

<p>As we found NO-induced response modulations in G<sub>32</sub>, we focused on RGCs identified as such for the following analyses (n=42). We found that, similar to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), G<sub>32</sub> showed reduced suppression during NO-application (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>; top), which is not present during the wash-out recording anymore, indicating that the NO-induced effect may be reversible (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>; bottom). Since we found in our Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dataset that G<sub>32</sub> consists of three subtypes, we clustered these RGC types assigned as G<sub>32</sub> into three clusters (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref>). For all subtypes, we found NO-induced response modulations showing a spectrum of their modulation strength and that the effects were reversible in the wash-out condition (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref>). As two-photon imaging only allows relatively short light stimulations, estimating precise receptive fields (RFs) can be difficult; hence we estimated spatial RFs (sRFs) and temporal RFs (tRFs) for the subclusters recorded with the MEA since it allowed us to display the checkerboard stimulus longer and to record individual spikes. Here, consistent with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dataset, we did not find any NOinduced modulation of the sRF size in any of the clusters (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8d</xref>), yet the tRF kernels showed significantly faster response kinetics during NO-application for all three clusters (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8e</xref>). Also, the effects were reversible for two clusters (except for cluster 3). We did not find this effect in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dataset (data not shown), which may be due to the low temporal resolution.</p>

<p>Taken together, our MEA-dataset confirmed and was in line with our Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dataset that G<sub>32</sub> consists of three types that were differentially modulated by NO. Also, we showed that indeed sRFs of those types were not affected by NO, but their suppression to temporal contrast. Additionally, the MEA-dataset revealed that all three types showed faster response kinetics induced by NO, which was reversible.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and MEA recordings to measure RGC responses to various visual stimuli to investigate the neuromodulatory effects of elevated NO levels on signal processing across RGC types in the mouse retina. To our surprise, even without pharmacological perturbation, we found that about one-third of the RGC types displayed highly reproducible and cell type-specific response changes during the course of an experiment – a finding of potentially high relevance especially for pharmacological experiments in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> retina using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Accounting for these adaptational changes enabled us to isolate NO-related effects on RGC responses. Here, we revealed that mainly the RGCs assigned to G<sub>32</sub> (‘Off suppressed 2’) were affected by NO, which strongly reduced the response suppression and rendered the cells more active. Further, we demonstrated that G<sub>32</sub> likely consists of three types – consistent with its high coverage factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) – that were all differentially modulated by NO. Finally, for a representative subset of RGC types, we showed that elevating the NO-level had no discernible effect on sRF size or surround strength. In addition, we were able to confirm those results using MEA recordings and showed that NO caused faster temporal response kinetics of these three subtypes; these changes were reversible. Together, our data suggest that NO specifically modulates response suppression and kinetics in a group of contrast-suppressed RGC types. Additionally, our study demonstrates the need for recording paradigms that take adaptational, non-drug-related response changes into account when analyzing potentially subtle pharmacological effects.</p>

<title>Nitric oxide as a (neuro-)modulator in the retina</title>
<p>Neuronal nitric oxide synthesis (nNOS) has been detected in different retinal cell classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) and the main NO-sensor (NO-GC), which connects NO to intracellular cGMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>), is present in all retinal layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). This and earlier findings of NO modulating the response gain of BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>) and RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>) suggest that NO constitutes a neuromodulatory system within the retina involved in light adaptation. However, in the mouse retina, light-dependent NO production seems to mainly occur in specific AC types, with the nNOS2-AC being the main producer of endogenous NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). In particular, it releases NO in a fast manner, especially in response to light flicker (24, 36, 55, 60, 72). Thus, it has been suggested that this AC type is a suitable candidate to report fast contrast changes at photopic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Here, our results indicate that, in addition to serve for intrinsic light adaptation, NO also signals information about the visual environment, namely, fast-changing contrasts, from the retina to higher visual brain regions in a highly selective manner. Specifically, it modulates the functional response profile of a distinct group of likely three types of RGCs formerly amalgamated in G<sub>32</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>In particular, NO affected these types in a similar way, yet differentially by increasing their activity, partly eliminating their characteristic feature of being suppressed by temporal contrast and having faster response kinetics. Notably, the NO effect was only visible in their temporal responses; we did not detect changes in their sRF properties. This RGC type-selectivity of NO is reminiscent of a recent study, where the neuromodulator dopamine was found to modulate distinct response features of specific RGC subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>).</p>
<p>To ensure reliable RGC type classification, our set of visual stimuli was restricted to artificial ones (full-field chirps, moving bars, and dense noise). Such artificial stimuli probe the stimulus space in a rather selective and limited fashion. Hence, we cannot exclude that we missed NO effects that may have become apparent for other, more complex stimuli. Specifically, natural images or movies, stimuli that are closer to what the retina evolved to process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>), may be needed for a more complete picture of the functional implication of retinal neuromodulation. That natural stimuli can reveal novel nonlinear properties of retinal functions was demonstrated, for example, by Goldin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>), who showed that an RGC’s contrast selectivity can be contextdependent. Similarly, Höfling et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>) recorded natural movie-evoked RGC responses to train a convolutional neural network, which through <italic>in silico</italic> experiments allowed them to discover that transient suppressed-by-contrast RGC (G<sub>28</sub>) feature center color-opponent responses and may signal context changes. These studies highlight that future studies on retinal neuromodulators should also employ natural stimuli.</p>
<p>Another important aspect to consider when studying NO neuromodulation in the retina is the level of light adaptation. Several studies proposed that NO facilitates the transition across light levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>), especially to photopic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Since we employed two-photon imaging, which inevitably results in a certain level of background ‘illumination’ (see discussion in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>)), our experiments were performed in the low photopic range. Therefore, NO-mediated neuromodulation may serve additional light-level dependent functions: more globally during the transition from scotopic to mesopic/photopic, and more cell type-specific in the photopic regime – as we reported here.</p>

<title>Adaptational, cell type-specific response changes</title>
<p>Every recording method introduces technique-specific biases that have to be considered in the data analysis and interpretation. For two-photon imaging with fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, these potential biases include Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering, sensor bleaching by the excitation laser, and, in the case of bulkloading with synthetic dyes (as in our experiments; see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>)), slow leakage of the indicator from the cells. In retinal imaging, additional potentially confounding factors are an excitation laser-induced baseline activity and photoreceptor bleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>). These biases are expected to be systematic, e.g., causing a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio across (RGC) responses (i.e., run-down). To account for this, we established a recording paradigm that produced a control and a NO-dataset consisting of paired RGC responses.</p>
<p>When analyzing the control dataset, we were surprised by finding response changes between both control measurements in approximately a third of the RGC types in the absence of the NO donor. These changes were consistent for a particular type but differed between types. Typically, we did not observe a simple overall decrease or increase in activity, but rather selective changes of response features: For instance, in G<sub>24</sub> (‘Slow On’) only its response to high frequency and low contrast was reduced, while the remaining response features were not affected. Together, this strongly argues against a systematic, recording techniquerelated bias but rather for an adaptational effect. Currently, we can only speculate about the mechanism(s) underlying this type-specific adaptation. The most parsimonious explanation may be related to the <italic>ex vivo</italic> condition of the retina: While we allowed the tissue to settle and adapt to perfusion medium, light level, temperature, etc. for ∼25 min, extracellular signaling molecules, such as neuromodulators, may be depleted and washed out throughout the experiment, resulting in differential adaptation of various RGC types. In any case, as type-selective adaptations can confound the recorded responses in a complex manner, a paired recording paradigm as the one described here, is recommended – in particular for pharmacological experiments.</p>

<title>Combining large-scale population recordings, RGC classification, and paired recordings to study neuromodulation of retinal output</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the neuromodulatory effects of NO on the retinal output signal. To this end, we combined experimental and computational approaches to dissect NO-mediated effects at the RGC type-level. The latter is important for understanding neuromodulator function for early vision because the visual information is sent to the brain via parallel feature channels, represented by <italic>&gt;</italic>40 RGC types in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>). We demonstrated that our approach enabled us to distinguish adaptational from actual NO-induced effects using a rather simple and straightforward linear analysis (i.e., focusing on mean trace or RF size differences), which means that we may have missed potential nonlinear effects. The combination of two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and MEA recordings allowed us to confirm our findings and make use of two methods that complement one another. Finally, the presented pipeline for analyzing neuromodulation in neural circuits constitutes a framework that can be easily extended by applying more advanced analyses.</p>

<title>Animals and tissue preparation for two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title>
<p>All animals for the two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments were conducted at the University of Tübingen and were performed according to the laws governing animal experimentation issued by the German Government as well as approved by the institutional animal welfare committee of the University of Tübingen. For all experiments, we used retinae (n=26) from C57Bl/6J mice (n=14; JAX 000664) of either sex between the age of 4-16 weeks. All animals were kept in the local animal facility and housed under the standard 12h/12h day/night cycle at 22°C and a humidity of 55%.</p>
<p>The following procedures were carried out under very dim red (&gt; 650 nm) light. Before each imaging experiment, the animal was dark-adapted for &gt;1h, then anesthetized with isoflurane (CP-Pharma) and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Immediately after, the eyes were enucleated with a dorsal cut as orientation landmark and hemisected in carboxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) solution containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 glucose, and 0.5 L-glutamine at pH 7.4. Sulforhodamine-101 (SR101, 0.1 µM; Invitrogen) was added to the ACSF to reveal blood vessels and damaged ganglion cell layer (GCL) cells in the red fluorescence channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>). The carboxygenated ACSF was constantly perfused through the recording chamber at 4 ml/min and kept at ∼36°C throughout the entire experiment. After the dissection, retinae were bulkelectroporated with the synthetic fluorescent calcium indicator Oregon-Green 488 BAPTA-1 (OGB-1; hexapotassium salt; Life Technologies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>). To electroporate the GCL, the dissected retina was flat-mounted with the GCL facing up onto an AnodiscTM (#13, 0.1 µm pore size, 13 mm diameter, Cytiva), and then placed between two 4 mm horizontal platinum disk electrodes (CUY700P4E/L, Nepagene/Xceltis). The lower electrode was covered with 15 µl of ACSF, while a 10 µl drop of 5 mM OGB-1 dissolved in ACSF was suspended from the upper electrode and lowered onto the retina. Then, nine electrical pulses (∼9.2 V, 100 ms pulse width, at 1 Hz) from a pulse generator/wide-band amplifier combination (TGP110 and WA301, Thurlby handar/Farnell) were applied and then, the electroporated retina on the Anodisc was transferred into the recording chamber, whereby the dorsal edge of the retina pointed away from the experimenter. The retina was left there for ∼30 min to recover, as well as adapted to the light stimulation by displaying a binary dense noise stimulus (20 x 15 matrix, 40 x 40 µm<sup>2</sup> pixels, balanced random sequence) at 5 Hz before the recordings started.</p>

<title>Two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title>
<p>For the functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, a MOM-type two-photon microscope (designed by W. Denk, MPI, Heidelberg; purchased from Sutter Instruments/Science Products) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>) was employed. The microscope was equipped with a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser (MaiTai-HP DeepSee, Newport SpectraPhysics) tuned to 927 nm (ideal wavelength to excite OGB1), two photomultiplier tubes serving as fluorescence detection channels for OGB-1 (HQ 510/84, AHF/Chroma) and SR101 (HQ 630/60, AHF), and a water immersion objective (CF175 LWD×16/0.8W, DIC N2, Nikon, Germany). To acquire images, custom-made software (ScanM by M. Müller and T. Euler) running under IGOR Pro 6.3 for the operating system Microsoft Windows (Wavemetrics) was used and time-lapsed 64 x 64 pixel image scans (∼100 µm<sup>2</sup>) at 7.8125 Hz were taken. Routinely, the optic nerve position and the scan field position were recorded to reconstruct their retinal positions. High-resolution images (512 x 512 pixel images) were recorded to support semi-automatic ROI detection.</p>

<title>Light stimulation for two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title>
<p>For the light stimulation of the retinal tissue, a digital light processing (DLP) projector (lightcrafter (LCr), DPME4500UVBGMKII, EKB Technologies Ltd) was used to display the visual stimuli through the objective onto the retina, whereby the stimulus was focused on the photoreceptor layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>). The LCr was equipped with a light-guide port to couple in external, band-pass filtered green and UV lightemitting diode (LEDs; green: 576 BP 10, F37-576; UV: 387 BP 11, F39-387; both AHF/Chroma). The band-pass filter was used to optimize the spectral separation of mouse Mand Sopsins (390/576 Dualband, F59-003, AHF/Chroma). Both LEDs were synchronized with the scan retracing of the microscope. Stimulator intensity (as photoisomerization rate, 10<sup>3</sup> P<sup><italic>∗</italic></sup>s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> per cone) was calibrated to range from ∼0.5 (black image) to ∼20 for Mand S-opsins, respectively. Steady illumination of ∼10<sup>4</sup> P<sup><italic>∗</italic></sup>s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> per cone was present during the scan recordings due to the two-photon excitation of photopigments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>).</p>
<p>In total, three types of light stimuli were used for the imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the GCL: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) full-field chirp stimulus (700 µm JZ; see details here ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>)), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) bright moving bar (0.3 x 1 mm) at 1 mm s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> in eight directions to probe direction and orientation selectivity, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) random binary noise with a checkerboard grid of 20 x 15 checks and a check size of 40 µm at 5 Hz for 5 min to map receptive fields. Before each stimulus was presented, the baseline was recorded after the laser started scanning for at least 30 s to avoid immediate laser-induced effects on the retinal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>).</p>

The experiment was performed in accordance with the institutional animal care standards of Sorbonne Université. (Paris, France). The animals were housed in enriched cages with ad libitum food, and watering. The ambient temperature was between 22 and 25°C, the humidity was between 50 and 70%, and the light cycle was 12–14h of light, 10–12h of darkness. After killing the animal, the eye was enucleated and transferred rapidly into oxygenated Ames medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Dissection was made under dim light condition as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>).</p>

<title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>For the electrophysiological recordings, we mounted a piece of retina onto a membrane and then lowered it with the ganglion cell side against a 252-channel multi-electrode array (MEA) whose electrodes were spaced by 30 µm. During dissection and recordings, the tissue was perfused with oxygenated Ames solution and a peristaltic perfusion system with two independent pumps: PPS2 (Multichannel Systems GmbH). Mice retinae were kept at 35–37°C during the whole experiment. The data sampling rate was 20 kHz. The raw signal was acquired through MC Rack Multi-channel Systems software 4.6.2, it was high-pass filtered at 100 Hz, and the spikes were isolated using SpyKING CIRCUS 1.0.628 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>). Subsequent data analysis was done with customwritten Python codes. We extracted the activity of a total of 391 neurons. We kept cells with a low number of refractory period violations (&lt; 0.95%, with median &lt; 0.05% for all experiments, 2 ms refractory period) and whose template waveform could be well distinguished from the template waveforms of other cells. These constraints ensured a good quality of the reconstructed spike trains. In addition, we discarded neurons that showed no or almost no responses to chirp stimulus, preventing the correct cell classification.</p>

<title>Light stimulation for electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>A white-mounted LED (MCWHLP1, Thorlabs Inc.) was used as a light source, and the stimuli were displayed using a Digital Mirror Device (DLP9500, Texas Instruments) and focused on the photoreceptors using standard optics and an inverted microscope (Nikon). The light level corresponded to photopic vision: 4.9 × 10<sup>4</sup> and 1.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> isomerizations / (photoreceptor.s) for S-cones and M-cones, respectively. In total, we displayed two stimuli: <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)</italic> a random binary checkerboard with check size of 42 µm for 30-40 min at 30 Hz, and <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)</italic> a full field chirp stimulus as used for the twophoton Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments.

<title>Pharmacology</title>
<p>All used drugs were added to the carboxygenated, perfused ACSF solution 15 min prior to the second recording of the GCL scan fields. For the drugs, the respective concentrations were used (in µM): 100 (Z)1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1ium-1,2-diolate (DETA/NO) and 1 strychnine. The ACSF solution with and without drug application was always kept at ∼36°C.</p>

<title>Inclusion criterion</title>
<p>To include reliable cell responses for the performed analyses, two consecutive quality filtering steps were applied. At first, the r esponse q uality c riterion, also termed quality index (QI), was computed for the moving bar (QI<sub><italic>MB</italic></sub> &gt; 0.6) and full-field chirp ( QI<sub><italic>chirp</italic></sub> &gt; 0.45). Cells that passed either one of these two QIs in both recording conditions were included, otherwise they were discarded in the following analyses. As in Baden et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), the quality index is defined as follows:
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="572742v2_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

where <italic>C</italic> is the <italic>T</italic> by <italic>R</italic> response matrix (time samples by stimulus repetitions) and ⟨⟩<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and <italic>V ar</italic>[]<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> denote the mean and variance across the indicated dimension <italic>x</italic>, respectively. As a second step, cells were assigned to an RGC group using the RGC classifier, which returned the RGC group index and a confidence score (i.e., assignment probability to the predicted RGC group by the random forest classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>)). Only cells that were assigned to one of the RGC groups (i.e., RGC index 1 - 32) were included, whereas cells assigned to a displaced AC group (i.e., RGC index 33 - 46) were rejected.

<title>Classification of functional retinal ganglion cell types</title>
<p>For the functional classification of RGC types, we used a previously published RGC classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). The classifier, which uses a random forest classifier, was trained, validated, and tested on previously published RGC type responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). As input to the classifier, we used the responses to the standard set of stimuli, i.e., full-field chirp and moving bar, as well as soma sizes (separates alpha and non-alpha types) and the pvalues of the permutation test for direction selectivity (separates DS and Non-DS types). For every cell, the RGC classifier outputs its type index and the confidence scores for all 46 types. The confidence score, as described in ‘inclusion criterion’ was used as a quality criterion.</p>

<p>We mapped receptive fields (RFs) of RGCs using the RF python toolbox <italic>RFEst</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>), following the procedure in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) with few modifications. The binary dense noise stimulus (20 x 15 matrix, (40 µm)<sup>2</sup> pixels, balanced random sequence; 5 Hz) was centered on the recording field.

The mean and covariance matrices of the center and surround Gaussian fits were tied, except for a linear scaling of the covariance matrix. We defined the polarity <italic>p</italic> ∈ {<italic>−</italic>1, 1} of the spatial RF as the sign of the model fit at its mean. Next, we computed the center RF of the spatial RF as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="572742v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

<title>Functional clustering</title>
<p>The functional clustering was based on a similar approach as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The clustering was only applied on RGC types previously classified as G<sub>32</sub> and only recorded in Ctrl 1. First, visual features from the full-field chirp and moving bar Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were extracted using sparse principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>). After optimizing the alpha parameter for each stimulus, each cell’s dimensionality was reduced to 30 features, whereby the chirp covered 20 and the moving bar 10 features. Alpha was optimized in a way that every part of each stimulus was represented by one feature to increase interpretability. Each feature was standardized across cells before clustering. Then, the features were used to cluster the cells using a Mixture of Gaussian model. The ideal number of clusters was chosen based on the cross-validated Bayesian Information Criterion. Additionally, cluster coherence was computed and validated using intraand inter-cluster correlation, as well as the influence of potential batch effects, i.e., a single cluster originates from a single retina or scan field, but is found across several ones. Then, the model was used to predict cell type labels. Finally, cluster 3 showed a high signal-tonoise ratio, thus cells were re-clustered, which originated in three clusters, whereby two showed high variability in their chirp and moving bar responses. These cells were discarded in the further analysis to clean this cluster from potential contamination.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>

To determine <italic>α</italic>, Bonferroni correction was used, depending on the number of tests performed.

For the statistical comparison of the suppression index between conditions per cluster, the non-parametric KruskalWallis one-way analysis of variance and post-hoc Dunnett’s test and Bonferroni correction to determine the statistical significance between conditions were used.</p>

<title>Functional clustering</title>
<p>To cluster cells in different functional types, we based our analysis on the chirp and checkerboard stimulus responses and represented each RGC with a reduced vector. To obtain these vectors, first, we constructed peri-stimulus histograms (PSTH) from the spikes evoked from the chirp stimulus, using a binning of 100 ms, and spike-triggered averages (STA). Then, for each experiment, we z-scored all PSTHs and performed a principle component analysis (PCA) on them. We kept the number of components that were needed to explain 80% variance of the data (11-12 components for the PSTH). Second, we used the temporal profile (40 samples at 30 Hz) of each cell’s STA obtained using the checkerboard stimulus. We z-scored it and performed a PCA, keeping two components, which explains around 80% of the variance. This adds information about the classical STA polarity of the RGCs. Third, we used the area of the ellipse fitted to the classical STA, as the product value of their major and minor axis σ values. These areas were normalized from 0 to 1. In this way, we obtain a data vector of around 15 values, depending on the experiment, that describes each RGC according to their response to a chirp and a checkerboard. Then, we performed an agglomerative clustering, setting the threshold value in a way that all clusters looked homogeneous across PSTHs and STAs. This resulted in over-clustering producing between 12 and 44 RGC groups (from 29 to 149 cells in each experiment).</p>

<title>Receptive field estimation</title>
<p>To estimate spatial and temporal receptive fields, we displayed a random binary checkerboard with check size of 42 µm for 30-40 min at 30 Hz. A three-dimensional spike-triggered average (STA; x, y, and time) was sampled using 40 time samples. The spatial STA presented across all the figures was obtained as the 2-dimensional spatial slice at the maximum value after smoothing. The temporal STA is the one-dimensional time slice at that same value. A double Gaussian fit was performed on the resulting spatial STA, and the ellipse corresponding to a 2σ contour of the fit was plotted for all the figures.</p>

<title>Pseudo-calcium transformation</title>
<p>In the last step, we assigned each cluster group to one of the 32 types described in Baden et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). To do this, we used the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data to match it with the electrophysiological data. We based our analysis on their reported data in the Extended data from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, where the authors link electrophysiology and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging by means of a convolution between a Ca<sup>2+</sup> eventtriggered by a single spike. We transformed the PSTHs by convolving them with a decaying exponential (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>), in which we adjusted the temporal decay constant to maximize the correlation of the cluster groups and theirs (median maximum correlation of 0.78). RGC types that presented strong responses to the modulating frequencies and amplitude were assigned correctly, while other types, which mostly respond to ON/OFF steps, were assigned in a second round of correlation match after excluding the former groups. Besides the correlation of the chirp traces, we confirmed the correct assigning of groups by checking that the ellipses of each type form a proper mosaic (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a,b</xref>), that the spatial STAs look uniform, and the similarity of their spike waveforms. After doing this for every experiment, we grouped the cells of each type across animals where we found a clear homogeneity. Finally, we computed a correlation matrix between the average chirp response of each type to show that the groups are homogeneous (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>).</p>

From an initial set of 46 cells, we obtained three subgroups of 17, 10, and 15 cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref>), plus a nonhomogeneous subgroup of four cells that did not fit into any of them and was discarded.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated as a neuromodulator in the retina. Specific types of amacrine cells (ACs) produce and release NO in a light-dependent manner. NO diffuses freely through the retina and can modulate intracellular levels of cGMP, or directly modify and modulate proteins via S-nitrosylation, leading to changes in gap-junction coupling, synaptic gain, and adaptation. Although these system-wide effects have been documented, it is not well understood how the physiological function of specific neuronal types is affected by NO. This study aims to address this gap in our knowledge.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>NO was expected to produce small effects, and considerable effort was expended in validating the system to ensure that any effects of NO would not be confounded by changes in the state of the preparation. The authors used a paired stimulus protocol to control for changes in the sensitivity of the retina during the extended recording periods. The approach potentially increases the sensitivity of the measurements and allows more subtle effects to be observed.</p>
<p>Neural activity was initially measured by Ca-imaging. Responsive ganglion cells were grouped into 32 types using a clustering analysis. Initial control experiments demonstrated that the cell-types revealed here largely recapitulate those from their earlier landmark study using the same approach (Fig. 2).</p>
<p>Application of NO to the retina strongly modulated responses of a single cluster of cells, labeled G32, while having little effect on the remaining 31 clusters. This result is evident in Fig. 3e.</p>
<p>Separate experiments measured ganglion cell spiking activity on a multi-electrode array (MEA). Clustering analysis of the peri-stimulus spike-time histograms (PSTHs) obtained from the MEA data also revealed 32 clusters. The PSTHs for each cluster were aligned to the Ca-imaging data using a convolution approach. The higher temporal resolution of the MEA recordings indicated that NO increased the speed of sub-cluster 2 responses but had no effect on receptive field size. The physiological significance of the small change in kinetics remains unclear.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The G32 cluster was further divided into three sub-types using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) based on the temporal properties of the Ca-responses. This sub-clustering result seems questionable due to the small difference in the BIC parameter between 2 and 3 clusters. Three sub-clusters of the G32 cluster were also revealed for the PSTH data, however, the BIC analysis was not applied to further validate this result.</p>
<p>The alignment of sub-clusters 1, 2, and 3 identified in the Ca-imaging and the MEA recordings seemed questionable, because the temporal properties of clusters did not align well, nor did the effects of NO.</p>
<p>The title of the paper indicates that nitric oxide modulates contrast suppression in a subset of mouse retinal ganglion cells, however, this result appears to be inferred from previous results showing that G32 is identified as a &quot;suppressed-by-contrast&quot; cell. The present study does not explicitly evaluate the amount of contrast-suppression in G32 cells.</p>
<p>In its current form, the work is likely to have limited impact, since the morphological and functional properties of the affected sub-cluster remain unknown. The finding that there can be cell-specific adaptation effects during experiments on in vitro retina is important new information for the field.</p>

This study by Gonschorek and colleagues aims to determine the modulatory effect of nitric oxide on the response properties of retinal ganglion cells. The authors used two photon calcium imaging and multi-electrode arrays to classify and compare cell responses before and after applying a NO donor DETA-NO. The authors found that DETA-NO selectively increases activity in a subset of contrast-suppressed RGC types. In addition, the authors found cell-type specific changes in light response in the absence of pharmacological manipulation in their calcium imaging paradigm. While this study focuses on an important question and the results are interesting, the following issues need further clarification for better interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>(1) Design of the calcium imaging experiments: the control-control pair has a different time course from the control-drug pair (Fig 1e). First, the control-control pair has a 10 minute interval while the control-drug pair has a 25 minute interval. Second, Control 1 Field 2 was imaged 10 min later than Control 1 Field 1 since the start of the calcium imaging paradigm.</p>
<p>Given that the control dataset is used to control for time-dependent adaptational changes throughout the experiment, I wonder why the authors did not use the same absolute starting time of imaging and the same interval between the first and second round of imaging for both the control-control and the control-drug pairs. This can be readily done in one of the two ways: 1. In a set of experiment, add DETA/NO between &quot;Control 1 Field 1 and &quot;Control 2 Field 1&quot; in Fig. 1e as the drug group; or 2. Omit DETA/NO in the Fig. 1e protocol as the control group to monitor the time course of adaptational changes.</p>
<p>Related to the concern above, to determine NO-specific effect, the authors used the criterion that &quot;the response changes observed for control (ΔR(Ctrl2−Ctrl1)) and NO (ΔR(NO−Ctrl1)) were significantly different&quot;. This criterion assumes that without DETA-NO, imaging data obtained at the time points of &quot;Control 1 Field 2&quot; and &quot;DETA/NO Field 2&quot; would give the same value of ΔR as ΔR(Ctrl2−Ctrl1) for all RGC types. It is not obvious to me why this should be the case, because of the unknown time-dependent trajectory of the adaptational change for each RGC type. For example, a RGC type could show stable response in the first 30 min and then change significantly in the following 30 min. DETA/NO may counteract this adaptational change, leading to the same ΔR as the control condition (false negative). Alternatively, DETA/NO may have no effect, but the nonlinear time-dependent response drift can give false positive results.</p>
<p>I also wonder why washing-out, a standard protocol for pharmacological experiments, was not done for the calcium protocol since it was done in the MEA experiments. A reversible effect by washing in and out DETA/NO in the calcium protocol would provide a much stronger support that the observed NO modulation is due to NO and not to other adaptive changes.</p>
<p>(2) Effects of Strychnine: In lines 215-219, &quot; In the light-adapted retina, On-cone BCs boost light-Off responses in Off-cone BCs through cross-over inhibition (83, 84) and hence, strychnine affects Off-response components in RGCs - in line with our observations (Fig. S2)&quot; However, Fig. S2 doesn't seem to show a difference in the Off-response components. Rather, the On response is enhanced with strychnine. In addition, suppressed-by-contrast cells are known to receive glycinergic inhibition from VGluT3 amacrine cells (Tien et al., 2016). However, the G32 cluster in Fig. S2 doesn't seem to show a change with strychnine. More explanation on these discrepancies will be helpful.</p>
<p>(3) This study uses DETA-NO as an NO donor for enhancing NO release. However, a previous study by Thompson et al., Br J Pharmacol. 2009 reported that DETA-NO can rapidly and reversible induce a cation current independent of NO release at the 100 uM used in the current study, which could potentially cause the observed effect in G32 cluster such as reduced contrast suppression and increased activity. This potential caveat should at least be discussed, and ideally excluded by showing the absence of DETA-NO effects in nNOS knockout mice, and/or by using another pharmacological reagent such as the NO donor SNAP or the nNOS inhibitor l-NAME.</p>
<p>(4) Clarification of methods: In the Methods, lines 1119-1127, the authors describe the detrending, baseline subtraction, and averaging. Then, line 1129, &quot; the mean activity r(t) was computed and then traces were normalized such that: max t(|r(t)|) = 1. How is the normalization done? Is it over the entire recording (control and wash in) for each ROI? Or is it normalized based on the mean trace under each imaging session (i.e. twice for each imaging field)?</p>
<p>As for the clustering of RGC types, I assume that each ROI's cluster identity remains unchanged through the comparison. If so, it may be helpful to emphasize this in the text.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for appreciating our study and for providing valuable comments and recommendations.</p>
<p>We are convinced that by carefully addressing the reviewers' comments and questions, we will be able to improve the manuscript’s quality.</p>
<p>Specifically, we aim to provide further analysis to validate the subdivision of G32 RGCs into sub-clusters.</p>
<p>In that context, we will improve the alignment of the RGC sub-types between the calcium imaging and MEA datasets.</p>
<p>To give the reader all information about our analysis, we will improve the methods section and explain the normalization of the calcium traces and the clustering in more detail.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will also address the concerns regarding the design of the calcium imaging experiments, potential false-negative effects, and why we did not include a wash-out condition in our experimental protocol.</p>
<p>Finally, we will revise the discussion about potential NO mechanisms and expand it on how the effects we observed may relate to known or potentially novel mechanisms.</p>
<p>In particular, we will also deepen our discussion and interpretation of the strychnine dataset.</p>
<p>Again, we would like to thank the reviewers for their valuable comments.</p>
