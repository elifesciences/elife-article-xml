<title>Abstract</title><p>Haploinsufficiency for <italic>GATA6</italic> is associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) with variable comorbidity of pancreatic or diaphragm defects, although the etiology of disease is not well understood. Here, we used cardiac directed differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a platform to study GATA6 function during early cardiogenesis. GATA6 loss-of-function hESCs had a profound impairment in cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) specification and cardiomyocyte (CM) generation due to early defects during the mesendoderm and lateral mesoderm patterning stages. Profiling by RNA-seq and CUT&amp;RUN identified genes of the WNT and BMP programs regulated by GATA6 during early mesoderm patterning. Furthermore, interactome analysis detected GATA6 binding with developmental transcription factors and chromatin remodelers suggesting cooperative regulation of cardiac lineage gene accessibility. We show that modulating WNT and BMP inputs during the first 48 hours of cardiac differentiation is sufficient to partially rescue CPC and CM defects in <italic>GATA6</italic> heterozygous and homozygous mutant hESCs. This study provides evidence of the regulatory functions for GATA6 directing human precardiac mesoderm patterning during the earliest stages of cardiogenesis to further our understanding of haploinsufficiency causing CHD and the co-occurrence of cardiac and other organ defects caused by human <italic>GATA6</italic> mutations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common human birth defect, affecting nearly 1% of live births<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. CHD is generally understood to derive from dysfunction in the growth, morphogenesis, and/or differentiation of cardiac-fated progenitor cell derivatives; however, the genetic and molecular networks governing these processes remain under investigation. Treatment options are limited to surgical interventions that can save the life of the infant but do not correct the underlying genetics. The causative genetic variants may contribute to complications and morbidity in adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Research aimed to expand our understanding of the molecular genetics regulating normal human cardiogenesis is thus needed to advance therapeutic strategies in the detection and treatment of CHD.</p>
<p>Studies of cardiac development in model organisms have led to the discovery of key molecular drivers of heart organogenesis, including the GATA family of zinc-finger transcription factors. GATA factors, named by their ability to bind to the consensus sequence (<italic>A</italic>/<italic>T</italic>)<italic>GATA</italic>(<italic>A</italic>/<italic>G</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, represent six family members with GATA4/5/6 expressed in the developing heart of early stage embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. GATA4/5/6 transcription factors regulate multiple stages of heart development including the specification, proliferation, and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Notably, <italic>GATA6</italic> knockout (KO) mice exhibit early embryonic arrest during primitive streak formation due to defects in visceral endoderm, a phenotype that has complicated the study of the early developmental function of GATA6 <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Mice with conditional deletion of <italic>GATA6</italic> from early CPCs develop heart abnormalities including atrioventricular canal defects, ventricular septal defects, and partial loss of trabeculae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. While these <italic>GATA6</italic> conditional homozygous KO mice die at birth due to heart malformations, few cardiac phenotypes were reported in the <italic>GATA6</italic> heterozygous mutants, except for recent reports of bicuspid aortic valve and heart rhythm abnormalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In humans, heterozygous mutations in <italic>GATA6</italic> are associated with various forms of CHD including outflow tract (OFT) defects, septal defects, and Tetralogy of Fallot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. GATA6 is required for the development of multiple mesoderm and endoderm derived organs and some CHD patients with heterozygous <italic>GATA6</italic> mutations have comorbidities including pancreatic agenesis, neonatal diabetes, or congenital diaphragmatic hernia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The phenotypic diversity of birth defects in patients containing <italic>GATA6</italic> mutations illustrates the complexity of human haploinsufficiency; there is likely a combination of variants in modifying or interacting genes that converge to influence the disease phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Previous studies of the function of <italic>GATA6</italic> in model organisms have not sufficiently modeled the variety of cardiac (and non-cardiac) defects observed in humans and most describe phenotypes only after homozygous inactivation of the gene. This raises an important question; why do CHDs in humans associate with <italic>GATA6</italic> haploinsufficiency? Species-specific functions for GATA6 may differ between mouse and humans, for example, raising the question of how observations made in model organisms relate to human cardiac development. There is a clear need to investigate the function of GATA6 in the context of a human system to better understand the basis for haploinsufficiency.</p>
<p>Current <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiac-directed differentiation protocols for human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide powerful tools for studying the transcriptional regulatory networks relevant to CHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. A previous study using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with CRISPR-Cas9 induced <italic>GATA6</italic> mutations showed that GATA6 is required at the stages of CPC and cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. GATA6 is also required for definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation toward the pancreatic lineage as reported in several studies using hPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. However, the function of GATA6 during early mesoderm patterning of human cardiac differentiation has not been explored, and how <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiac and DE lineage phenotypes caused by GATA6 loss-of-function relate to one another is not understood.</p>
<p>To determine the function of GATA6 during the earliest stages of cardiac differentiation, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> CM directed differentiation using <italic>GATA6</italic> loss-of-function human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines and explored regulatory functions for GATA6 during precardiac mesoderm patterning that is ultimately required for CM generation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that <italic>GATA6</italic> mutations impaired expression of genes important for lateral and cardiac mesoderm patterning, and by integrating GATA6 CUT&amp;RUN sequencing with RNA-seq we identified GATA6-regulated targets including those of the WNT and BMP networks, key morphogenetic signaling pathways required to induce anterior primitive streak formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we found that GATA6 interacts with important developmental transcription factors and chromatin remodelers during early mesoderm patterning stages that may promote DNA accessibility required for cardiac lineage commitment. Taken together, these findings uncover multiple functions for GATA6 in regulating very early precardiac mesoderm patterning and the lineage specific gene networks required for human CM generation.</p>

<title>GATA6 loss-of-function impairs cardiac mesoderm lineage differentiation</title>
<p>A monolayer cytokine-based <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiac differentiation protocol for hPSCs was adapted from previously established methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>GATA6</italic> heterozygous mutant (<italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup>), homozygous mutant (<italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup>), and isogenic wildtype (WT) control (<italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/+</sup>) H1-hESC lines were previously generated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (Supplemental Figure 1A, B). These lines were differentiated in parallel to determine the impact of <italic>GATA6</italic> loss-of-function during human cardiogenesis. Western blotting at days 2 or 5 of cardiac differentiation confirmed the loss of GATA6 protein in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells and intermediate levels of protein in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells relative to WT controls (Supplemental Figure 1C). The percentage of cardiac troponin T positive (%cTnT<sup>+</sup>) CMs in individual differentiation assays remained stable starting around day 13 and thus CM differentiation efficiency was analyzed during a window of days 13 to 18 of cardiac differentiation. <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells failed to generate beating CMs and yielded close to 0% cTnT<sup>+</sup> CMs when examined by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, C). In contrast, <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> hESCs did generate beating CMs (∼25% cTnT<sup>+</sup>) but at a significantly reduced efficiency compared to WT cells (∼55% cTnT<sup>+</sup>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, C). <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> CMs obtained were comparable morphologically to WT CMs with no obvious sarcomere defects (Supplemental Figure 1D). No significant differences in %cTnT<sup>+</sup> were observed between clones of the same genotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), therefore data from lines with the same genotypes were combined in all subsequent comparisons.</p>

<p>We also generated an iPSC line derived from a CHD patient presenting with an atrial septal defect and congenital diaphragmatic hernia; this patient was found to have a heterozygous frameshift mutation in <italic>GATA6</italic> (c.1071delG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The mutant allele was corrected to WT sequence (<italic>GATA6</italic><sup>corr/+</sup>) using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing (Supplemental Figure 1E, F). The iPSC colonies expressed normal levels of the pluripotency markers NANOG and SOX2 demonstrating efficient reprogramming (Supplemental Figure 1G). We performed cardiac differentiation using the cytokine-based protocol for <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>corr/+</sup> and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>1071delG/+</sup> iPSCs to determine how the phenotype compared to the <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> H1-hESCs. To date, this is the first patient-derived iPSC line with a heterozygous <italic>GATA6</italic> mutation along with an isogenic mutation-corrected control to be evaluated for cardiac directed differentiation. <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>1071delG/+</sup> cells generated cTnT<sup>+</sup> CMs less efficiently than <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>corr/+</sup> cells, on average about 50% (Supplemental Figure 1H), indicating that the <italic>GATA6</italic> c.1071delG mutation similarly disrupts cardiac differentiation as observed in the hESC heterozygous mutant lines. Likewise, the CMs obtained by differentiation of either <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>1071delG/+</sup> or <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>corr/+</sup> iPSCs appeared morphologically normal (Supplemental Figure 1I). The fact that both types of heterozygous cells (patient-derived iPSCs and targeted H1-hESCs) generate similar defects in CM differentiation provides evidence supporting the use of the H1-hESCs and isogenic lines to study the genetic and cellular basis for CHD. The corrected iPSC line was shown to have a grossly normal karyotype and to restore higher levels of GATA6 protein as expected (Supplemental Figure 1J, K).</p>
<p>The impaired CM generation from <italic>GATA6</italic> mutant hESCs may be due to deficient CPC specification. Therefore, RT-qPCR assays were performed on <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and WT cells harvested at day 6 of cardiac differentiation to examine the expression levels of the CPC markers <italic>NKX2.5</italic>, <italic>TBX5</italic>, <italic>TBX20</italic>, and <italic>GATA4</italic>. CPC marker expression levels were significantly reduced in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells relative to WT controls, indicating a defect in CPC specification (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). At this time point here was a clear trend but not a statistically significant difference in the expression levels of CPC markers comparing the <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> genotypes. We also analyzed expression levels for markers of the first heart field (<italic>HAND1</italic> and <italic>SMARCD3</italic>) and the second heart field (<italic>ISL1</italic>). All were significantly depleted in the GATA6<sup>-/-</sup> cells, while both <italic>ISL1</italic> and <italic>SMARCD3</italic> (but not <italic>HAND1</italic>) levels were significantly lower in the GATA6+/- cells. We note that an RT-qPCR time course showed that CPC marker expression level was increased (although not to WT levels) in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells at later stages (days 8 to 11) while <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> CPC gene expression levels remained “flat” in comparison with no increase over time (Supplemental Figure 2A).</p>
<p><italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hESCs were differentiated toward the CM lineage using an alternative protocol based on chemical manipulation of the WNT pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (CHIR protocol, Supplemental Figure 2B-E) to confirm if the phenotype is consistent as observed using the cytokine-based protocol. <italic>In vitro</italic> cardiac differentiation protocols for hPSCs are known to sometimes require extensive optimization due to cell line variation and can require testing various cell seeding densities, media component concentrations, and batch variations for crucial reagents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The CHIR protocol was overall suboptimal for cardiac differentiation using the H1-hESCs due to substantial variation in CM differentiation efficiency and the occasional failure to generate CMs in WT H1-hESCs. We therefore committed to using the cytokine-based protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) for the bulk of experiments in this study because it proved to be a more consistent CM differentiation protocol for the H1-hESCs. Nevertheless, in successful experiments performed using the CHIR protocol we observed the same phenotype in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells using the CHIR protocol as with the cytokine-based protocol (data not shown), consistent with a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Bulk RNA-seq was performed at day 5 using the CHIR protocol (Supplemental Figure 2C-E). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the cells derived from each genotype were well separated from each other (Supplemental Figure 2C). Differential gene expression and gene ontology (GO) analyses revealed that <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells had strongly reduced expression levels of cardiac development related gene sets including “OFT septum morphogenesis” and “heart development” compared to WT controls (Supplemental Figure 2D). Furthermore, while <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells had relatively higher expression levels for many of these genes compared to <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells, numerous CPC regulatory genes showed decreased levels compared to WT controls (including <italic>NKX2.5</italic>, <italic>TBX20</italic>, <italic>TBX5</italic>, <italic>MEF2C</italic>, and <italic>HAND2</italic>; Supplemental Figure 2E) confirming an impairment of CPC development in differentiating <italic>GATA6</italic> mutant hESCs. GO analysis of genes with increased expression levels in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells relative to WT included gene sets such as “nervous system development” (Supplemental Figure 2D) suggesting a bias towards a non-cardiac genetic signature. Notably, gene sets related to retinoic acid (RA) signaling were significantly increased in GATA6<sup>-/-</sup> cells relative to WT (Supplemental Figure 2D), and <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> expression (the main enzyme that generates RA) was increased in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells relative to WT from days 4 to 6 using the cytokine-based protocol (Supplemental Figure 2F), consistent with a previous study of cardiac differentiation using <italic>GATA6</italic> loss-of-function hiPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Proper RA signaling is crucial for cardiogenesis including OFT development and cardiac chamber morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and inhibiting excessive RA signaling in <italic>GATA6</italic> mutant hiPSCs was shown to partially rescue CPC marker expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, upregulated RA signaling in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hESCs during the CPC developmental stage may partially underly the CM differentiation defects.</p>
<p>Examining protein expression at multiple stages during cardiac differentiation revealed the earliest (and highest) expression level for GATA6 at day 2 of differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The impaired CPC development in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells may therefore be due to defective cardiac mesoderm patterning during the early stages of cardiogenesis. We examined co-expression of the precardiac mesoderm markers KDR and PDGFRα (KP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> using flow cytometry from day 3 to 5 of cardiac differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). At day 3, there was no significant difference in the %K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> cells between genotypes (∼45% K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup>), but by day 5 the %K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> increased to ∼72% in WT and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells, while the %K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> was markedly reduced in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (∼22%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C). This is consistent with previous reports where sorting and reseeding K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> cells at day 3 of cardiac differentiation generated both mesenchymal cells and CMs but day 5 sorted K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> cells gave rise predominantly to CMs, indicating that day 5 KP expression is relatively enriched for precardiac mesoderm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells had a small but significant decrease in the %K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> cells at day 4 relative to WT (Supplemental Figure 3A, B) suggesting that the developing K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> cardiac mesoderm in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells is temporarily defective or delayed relative to WT controls. Notably, the decreased %K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> observed at day 4 (<italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells) and day 5 (<italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells) relative to WT cells was due to reduced KDR but not PDGFRα expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, E, Supplemental Figure 3A, B), indicating that KDR is (directly or indirectly) regulated by GATA6 during cardiac mesoderm patterning.</p>

<p>During gastrulation, sequentially lineage-restrictive mesodermal cell populations emerge along a developmental trajectory involving primitive streak to lateral mesoderm formation, followed by cardiac mesoderm patterning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.

<p><italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> samples also had reduced expression levels for genes associated with cardiac GO terms such as “cardiac muscle contraction” and “OFT septum morphogenesis” when comparing to WT controls at day 3 (Supplemental Figure 4C, D). Indeed, there was overlap for many of the decreased DEGs (dDEGs) observed in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells at day 2 or day 3 (relative to WT) including cardiac development genes such as <italic>ERBB4</italic> (important for endocardial cushion and ventricular trabeculae development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>), the second heart field (SHF) related transcription factor <italic>HAND2</italic>, and the cardiac mesoderm marker <italic>LRRC32</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>; although the decrease in expression levels for these genes relative to WT was not as severe in the <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> genotype as for <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (Supplemental Figure 4D, E, F).</p>
<p>We observed dysregulation of genes related to the WNT and BMP networks in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> samples relative to WT at day 2 (Supplemental Figure 4G) and GO and GSEA analyses revealed decreased levels of “positive regulation of the BMP pathway” and increased levels of “negative regulation of canonical WNT pathway” at days 2 or 3 relative to WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B, D, E). Several dDEGs identified in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells at day 2 or day 3 relative to WT samples included negative regulators of WNT signaling, including <italic>SFRP1</italic> and <italic>TLE1</italic> (Supplemental Figure 4E, G), and antagonists of the BMP pathway, such as <italic>BMPER</italic> and <italic>SMAD6</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, E, Supplemental Figure 4E, G), indicating that the overall transcriptional response induced by the WNT and BMP pathways is dysregulated. <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells also exhibited perturbed gene expression for several WNT- and BMP-related genes (at an intermediate level to those observed in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells) at days 2 or 3 relative to WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, Supplemental Figure 4G). Mesoderm patterning is controlled by the input of WNT, BMP, and TGFβ signaling and dysfunction in these pathways cause severe developmental defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore the cardiac defects caused by GATA6 loss-of-function may be caused by these alterations in WNT and BMP signaling.</p>
<p>We examined activity of the BMP, TGFβ and WNT pathways by analyzing the effector proteins SMAD1/5/9 (BMP activated), SMAD2/3 (TGFβ activated), and β-catenin (WNT activated) by western blotting at day 2. There was no change in the levels of active phospho-SMAD1/5/9, phospho-SMAD2/3, or non-phospho-β-catenin when comparing <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). These results indicate that GATA6 regulates the transcriptional response of genes activated by the BMP and WNT pathways downstream of canonical effector protein activation.</p>
<p>To further examine the impact of <italic>GATA6</italic> loss-of-function on early mesoderm patterning, we correlated RNA-seq data from a study examining hESC differentiation toward cardiac mesoderm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> to our day 2 or day 3 RNA-seq data. GSEA analysis using increased DEGs at day 2 (lateral mesoderm) or day 3 (precardiac mesoderm) from Koh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> revealed significantly reduced enrichment in our <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> samples (relative to WT) on days 2 or 3, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, H). Furthermore, <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells had partially reduced expression for these lateral and precardiac mesoderm genes relative to WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>), suggesting that the impaired CPC and CM differentiation observed for <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> hESCs originates as disrupted lateral and cardiac mesoderm patterning. We additionally compared the increased DEGs at day 2 from Koh et al. for paraxial mesoderm and our day 2 RNA-seq data and observed increased expression for these genes in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells relative to controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>), further supporting the notion that the <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hESCs are at biased toward a paraxial mesoderm-like genetic signature.</p>
<p>A previous study of GATA6 function during DE differentiation from hESCs reported an interaction between GATA6, EOMES, and SMAD2/3 to co-regulate genes important during mesendoderm and transition to DE development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. DE and cardiac mesoderm originate from a bipotent germlayer mesendoderm population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and likely share a gene expression signature at this early stage. We therefore performed GSEA analysis using the CHIP-seq dataset for triple-overlap of GATA6, EOMES, and SMAD2/3 during early DE differentiation from Chia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and found a significantly decreased enrichment in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells relative to WT at day 2 for putative direct GATA6 target genes (Supplemental Figure 4H). EOMES is an important transcriptional regulator of anterior mesoderm development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and as GATA6 was shown to interact with EOMES during early DE differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> we hypothesized that an interaction is similarly necessary during early lateral mesoderm patterning. We therefore performed GSEA using another published dataset of EOMES targets identified during mesoderm and DE (ME) differentiation in mouse ESCs (mESCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. GSEA analysis of our day 2 RNA-seq data with the “EOMES ME direct activation dataset” human gene equivalents revealed a significant decrease in enrichment in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells relative to WT (Supplemental Figure 4H), supporting the notion that GATA6 cooperates with EOMES to co-regulate genes required for lateral mesoderm patterning.</p>

<p>We next analyzed the GATA6 interactome using rapid immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins (RIME) on WT cells at day 2 or day 4 of cardiac differentiation to define the chromatin associated protein interactions. 99 significant interacting proteins at day 2 and 52 unique proteins at day 4 of cardiac differentiation were identified bound to GATA6 compared to IgG control samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

GATA6 protein interactions were also observed for other epigenetic and transcriptional regulators including those related to histone deacetylation (i.e., HDAC2) and mRNA splicing (i.e., SF1, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, D). Interestingly, WNT/β-catenin transcriptional regulators were identified bound to GATA6, particularly at day 2 of cardiac differentiation, including the β-catenin transcriptional co-activator EP300<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, and the TCF/LEF transcriptional co-repressors CTBP1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and TLE1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that GATA6 may directly modulate the transcriptional response induced by WNT signaling by binding to these proteins.</p>

<p>Proteins identified by GATA6-RIME only at day 2 included the transcription factors EOMES and MIXL1 (both transcription factors involved in primitive streak formation and mesoderm patterning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>) as well at TLE1, EP300 and SMARCA5, while the unique day 4 proteins were all RNA binding proteins such as TAF15 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The overlapping day 2 and day 4 GATA6-RIME results included many chromatin remodelers such as SMARCC1, SMARCA4 and KDM1A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), although the enrichment for these proteins was greater at day 2 compared to day 4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, Supplemental Table 1). As day 2 of differentiation had the highest level of GATA6 expression and enrichment for RIME identified proteins, we performed GATA6 immunoprecipitation (IP) on <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> samples at day 2 and confirmed a weak interaction with EOMES and SMARCC1 in the WT samples, with no observable bands in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). The EOMES and SMARCC1 protein bands identified in GATA6-IP samples were notably less than observed for the input controls, therefore it’s possible that the interaction between GATA6 and these proteins is indirect (i.e., GATA6 may be co-bound in a complex with EOMES and/or SMARCC1 among other proteins).</p>
<p>Previous studies performed GATA6-RIME at day 4 and EOMES-RIME at day 2 of DE differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, so we compared our day 2 and day 4 GATA6-RIME data to these previously published RIME datasets (Supplemental Figure 6B). 26 proteins were present in all 4 datasets (Supplemental Figure 6B, C), implying there is a common interaction between GATA6 and various remodeler proteins, the transcription factor SALL4, and the TCF/LEF co-repressors CTBP1/2 during mesendoderm patterning toward both cardiac mesoderm and DE lineages. Protein interactions unique to day 2 GATA6-and EOMES-RIME included MIXL1, SMARCC2, and ARID1B and may represent protein interactions specific to mesendoderm development (Supplemental Figure 6C). Notably, EOMES and the WNT-related proteins TLE1 and EP300 were not identified in our day 4 dataset but were present in our day 2 GATA6-RIME data and the published EOMES and GATA6-RIME datasets during early DE development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, an interaction between GATA6 and these proteins appears to be relinquished by the cardiac mesoderm stage (day 4) but persists during DE patterning. Cardiac differentiation requires a transient inhibition of the canonical WNT signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, and as day 4 of our cardiac differentiation protocol occurs after WNT inhibition these varying protein interactions may reflect the differing contributions of the WNT pathway during cardiac and DE differentiation.</p>

<p><italic>LGR5</italic>, a component of the WNT pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, was among the most significant dDEGs identified from day 2 or day 3 RNA-seq in GATA6<sup>-/-</sup> cells (relative to WT) and was also found significantly bound by GATA6 (and in a previous study, EOMES<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>) in WT cells (Supplemental Figure 5).

<p>As LGR5 is a single component of the complex WNT pathway, we tested a broader pharmacological approach by using the WNT agonist CHIR to determine if early WNT activation could more efficiently rescue the cardiac defects in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hESCs. We found that inclusion of CHIR (3μM) from days 0 to 2 in differentiating <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hESCs yielded by day 13 small clusters of beating CMs (Supplemental Video 1). When assessing quantitatively by flow cytometry the %cTnT<sup>+</sup> CMs in CHIR-treated <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells relative to vehicle treated controls, there was a variable trend for CM induction that was however not statistically significant (Supplemental Figure 7C). Similarly, while the %K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> cardiac mesoderm cells at day 5 was slightly increased upon CHIR treatment in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells, this was not a statistically significant improvement (Supplemental Figure 7D).</p>
<p>BMP-related gene expression was also dysregulated at day 2 in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells and thus manipulation of the BMP4 concentration in combination with CHIR treatment from days 0 to 2 was tested to further promote CM rescue. Interestingly, we found that decreasing the BMP4 concentration (5ng/mL) combined with CHIR treatment yielded small clusters of beating CMs (Supplemental Video 2) more consistently than increasing the BMP4 concentration (data not shown) or treatment with CHIR on its own. Quantification by flow cytometery for %cTnT<sup>+</sup> CMs in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells treated with CHIR and the lower BMP4 concentration (CHIR LB) showed a small but significant increase (∼4% cTnT<sup>+</sup>) relative to <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> controls indicating that CM differentiation is partially rescued upon CHIR LB treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Note that this treatment actually decreases efficiency for differentiation in the control WT cells. The %K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> and %K<sup>+</sup> day 5 cardiac mesoderm population was also significantly increased with CHIR LB treatment in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells relative to untreated controls and was not significantly different than WT controls indicating a rescue of day 5 K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> cardiac mesoderm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that modulating the early input of the WNT and BMP pathways in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells can rescue the cardiac mesoderm patterning defects and partially rescue subsequent CM differentiation.</p>
<p><italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells also exhibited partial dysregulated gene expression related to WNT signaling via day 2 RNA-seq relative to WT controls (Supplemental Figure 4G). We therefore hypothesized that the addition of CHIR from days 0 to 2 in differentiating <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> hESCs could rescue CM differentiation more potently than observed in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hESCs. Indeed, we found that the %cTnT<sup>+</sup> CMs was significantly increased in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells supplemented with CHIR relative to vehicle treated controls and was not significantly different from WT untreated controls, indicating an efficient rescue of CM differentiation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). CHIR addition to WT hESCs had a deleterious effect on CM differentiation efficiency, with the %cTnT<sup>+</sup> CMs reduced from ∼60% (DMSO treated) to ∼25% (CHIR treated, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that there is a threshold “window” for the degree of WNT pathway activation required during early primitive streak to mesoderm patterning stages and that reducing or exceeding this threshold has an adverse effect on later CM differentiation capacity. Furthermore, this data indicates that the rescue in CM differentiation efficiency in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells treated with CHIR was not due to an overall improvement in the general cardiac differentiation protocol, but rather related to correcting the consequence of loss of one <italic>GATA6</italic> allele.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that <italic>GATA6</italic> loss-of-function mutations severely disrupt CPC gene expression and impair CM differentiation, consistent with the results described by Sharma et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Here, we discovered that GATA6 is required very early in this process and that the later cardiac phenotypes observed in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hESCs originate from an early mesoderm patterning defect in which lateral and cardiac mesoderm genes fail to be expressed at normal levels. Gene networks induced by the WNT and BMP pathways that are normally required for primitive streak organization and subsequent anterior lateral mesoderm emergence are also mis-expressed when GATA6 is deficient. GATA6 CUT&amp;RUN analysis revealed binding at distal enhancer-like signatures nearby dDEGs identified by RNA-seq, and GATA6 binding was found to have a considerable overlap with previously published EOMES CHIP-seq data during early DE differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> nearby many of these genes. Day 2 GATA6 RIME analysis confirmed binding with EOMES and various chromatin remodelers including components of the SWI/SNF and NuRD remodeling complexes that are known to regulate chromatin accessibility of cardiac lineage-specific gene networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we found that early manipulation of the WNT pathway through CHIR treatment from days 0 to 2 rescued CM defects observed in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> hESCs while CHIR treatment and reduced BMP4 dosage rescued K<sup>+</sup>P<sup>+</sup> cardiac mesoderm and partially rescued CM differentiation in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hESCs. Together, these results present multiple novel functions for GATA6 in regulating early precardiac mesoderm patterning during human cardiac differentiation.</p>
<p>WNT and BMP related genes were dysregulated in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells at day 2 and day 3 of cardiac differentiation but β-catenin and SMAD protein activation was intact indicating that the transcriptional response of these pathways is defective rather than the upstream activation induced by morphogens. GATA6 RIME analysis revealed an interaction with several WNT transcriptional regulators including the β-catenin co-activator EP300 and the TCF/LEF transcriptional co-repressors TLE1 and CTBP1/2, and binding to these proteins could have positive or negative effects on their function. One potential mechanism is that GATA6 binds to these WNT regulators and prevents their repressive (or in the case for EP300, potentiating) function on TCF-mediated transcription, causing a net increase in the β-catenin transcriptional response. Indeed, there was an enrichment for negative regulation of the WNT signaling pathway at day 2 in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells according to RNA-seq data, suggesting that GATA6 loss-of-function increases feedback inhibition of TCF/LEF-mediated transcription. GATA6 CUT&amp;RUN analysis also revealed binding near many genes related to WNT and BMP signaling implying direct participation in modulating appropriate β-catenin/SMAD transcriptional responses. However, many WNT/BMP response genes dysregulated in <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells were not identified as targets by GATA6 CUT&amp;RUN, suggesting that another method for regulation is indirect, perhaps related to the interaction with chromatin remodelers affecting DNA accessibility.</p>
<p>RIME analysis revealed GATA6 bound to many chromatin remodelers including components of the SWI/SNF (e.g., SMARCA4) and NuRD (e.g., KDM1A) complexes at days 2 and 4 of cardiac differentiation. GATA6 is a pioneer transcription factor with specialized function to bind and promote accessibility of chromatin during CPC development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and GATA6, GATA4, and GATA3 have previously been shown to interact with various members of SWI/SNF complexes such as SMARCA4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. However, the molecular mechanism for how GATA6 modifies the accessibility of chromatin and mobilizes nucleosomes is unclear. The AP-1 pioneer factor interacts with SWI/SNF complexes to promote their localization to non-permissive regions of chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. GATA6 may function similarly, for example, by binding to SWI/SNF complex proteins and recruiting them to regions of closed chromatin containing lineage-specific enhancers where they then function to promote genomic accessibility. It is somewhat surprising that among all the SWI/SNF factors, the one that is known to be cardiac-specific (SMARCD3) was not found in the GATA6-RIME-enriched proteins. We note that SMARCD3 is expressed in the RNA-seq data as early as day 2. Although speculative, it may be that GATA6 primarily interacts with other SWI/SNF complexes prior to a subsequent role for SMARCD3 in cardiac specification.</p>
<p>The function of GATA6 during early mesoderm patterning presented in this study has unique implications toward understanding the pathogenesis of CHD and extra-cardiac phenotypes associated with human <italic>GATA6</italic> mutations. <italic>GATA6</italic> homozygous loss-of-function mutations have not been described in humans, most likely due to early embryonic lethality causing non-viable embryogenesis. This is consistent with the early mesoderm patterning defects of <italic>GATA6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hESCs described in this study, previous reports of DE defects in <italic>GATA6</italic>-null hPSC lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, as well as the early lethality reported in <italic>GATA6</italic> KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In the case of haploinsufficiency, CHD presenting as OFT or septal defects associated with heterozygous <italic>GATA6</italic> mutations may be due to defects that occur during early mesoderm patterning that diminish the later developmental pool of CPCs and CMs. Quite remarkably, profiles of cells at day 2 of differentiation already identify OFT morphogenesis as gene sets disturbed by loss of GATA6. Relatively minor changes in early mesoderm cell population numbers have recently been reported to associate with later heart defects in a mouse model of Cornelia de Lange syndrome using <italic>NPBL1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, and thus <italic>GATA6</italic> heterozygous mutations may similarly have a subtle negative effect on developing mesodermal cell populations to cause CHD. Human mutations in <italic>GATA6</italic> commonly associate with OFT defects, a primarily second heart field (SHF) derived structure, and recent work has established that SHF lineage progenitors are derived from early defined mesodermal subpopulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, <italic>GATA6</italic> mutations might impair specific heart field progenitor populations based on the timing and positioning of these developing mesodermal populations in the primitive streak, long before the progenitors are associated with SHF. <italic>GATA6</italic> haploinsufficiency in humans also associates with endoderm defects such as pancreatic agenesis, and DE and early mesoderm co-develop from a common mesendoderm population adjacent to one another in the anterior primitive streak during gastrulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Defects in the regulatory functions of GATA6 during mesendoderm patterning, such as interactions with EOMES and specific chromatin remodelers, may cause downstream organ defects in both mesoderm and endoderm derived organ systems in some patients with <italic>GATA6</italic> mutations. The data presented here focuses on early stages of mesoderm patterning and cardiac progenitor differentiation in the context of <italic>GATA6</italic> loss-of-function rather than CM profiling and is thus a limitation of our study. Future investigation of how heterozygous <italic>GATA6</italic> mutations impact CMs physiology such as cardiac chamber identity and CM function would be a worthwhile pursuit to expand our knowledge of how <italic>GATA6</italic> regulates CM differentiation in relation to human CHD.</p>

The hPSCs were plated at ∼4×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and allowed to grow for 2 days before changing with “Day 0 medium” consisting of the “base medium” plus 20 ng/mL BMP4 (R&amp;D Systems 314-BP-050), 30 ng/mL Activin A (R&amp;D Systems 338-AC-050), 5 ng/mL bFGF (R&amp;D Systems 233-FB-025), and 5 μL/mL Transferrin (Roche 10652202001). BMP4 was used at 10 ng/ml for iPSC differentiation. Approximately 55 hr later, the medium was changed with “Day 2 medium” consisting of “base medium” supplemented with 5 μM XAV-939 (Sigma-Aldrich X3004), 5 ng/mL VEGF (R&amp;D Systems 293-VE-050), and 5 μL/mL Transferrin. The culture medium was changed on days 4 and 6 of cardiac differentiation with “base medium” supplemented with 5 ng/mL VEGF. From day 9 and later the culture medium was changed with “base medium” every 2-3 days. For a subset of experiments, 3 μM CHIR99021 (Stem Cell Technologies 72054) was included in the “Day 0 medium” and/or the concentration of BMP4 was reduced to 5 ng/mL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-E</xref>, Supplemental Figure 7C, D). An alternative CM differentiation protocol based on chemical manipulation of the WNT pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> was used for a subset of experiments (CHIR protocol, Supplemental Figure B-E). For the CHIR protocol, hESCs were plated at ∼4×10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and allowed to grow for 2 days in mTESR Plus before changing medium to RPMI 1640 with 1x B27 minus insulin (Thermo Fisher Scientific A1895601) and 6 μM CHIR99021 (Stem Cell Technologies 72054) for 24 hr. Medium was then changed to RPMI 1640 with 1x B27 minus insulin for another 24 hr, before changing medium on day 3 to RPMI 1640 with 1x B27 minus insulin and 5 mM IWP2 (Tocris 3533). On day 5, culture medium was changed to RPMI 1640 with 1x B27 minus insulin once more and starting on day 7 medium was changed to RPMI with 1x B27 every other day. CMs were purified using a lactate-selection protocol to prepare for immunocytochemistry by changing the differentiation medium on day 15 of the cytokine-based protocol to a lactate-selection medium consisting of RPMI 1640 lacking glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific 11879020) supplemented with 5 mM Sodium L-lactate (Sigma-Aldrich L7022), 213 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid, and 500 μg/mL Human Albumin (Sigma-Aldrich A9731). Lactate-selection medium was refreshed on day 17 of differentiation, after which the medium was restored to “base medium” on day 19 and changed every 2 to 3 days prior to fixation.</p>

CUT&amp;RUN library preparation, sequencing, and SEACR-based analysis were peformed by the Weill Cornell Medicine Epigenomics and Genomics Core Facilities. The DNA libraries were prepared with approximately 5 ng of CUT&amp;RUN enriched DNA using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs E7645) and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (96 Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs) (New England Biolabs E6440); 14 PCR cycles were used to amplify the adaptor ligated target DNA. The libraries were clustered on a pair end flow cell and sequenced for 50 cycles on an Illumina NextSeq500 Sequencing System. FASTQ files were aligned to the GENCODE GRCh38 build of the human genome using bowtie2 with the –-dovetail parameter. The resulting BAM files were sorted and indexed using samtools and then converted to bedgraph format using bedtools.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive study that clearly and deeply investigates the function of GATA6 in human early cardiac development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study combines hESC engineering, differentiation, detailed gene expression, genome occupancy, and and pathway modulation to elucidate the role of GATA6 in early cardiac differentiation. The work is carefully executed and the results support the conclusions. The use of publicly available data is well integrated throughout the manuscript. The RIME experiments are excellent.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Much has been known about GATA6 in mesendoderm development, and this is acknowledged by the authors.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Bisson et al describes the role GATA6 to regulate cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) specification and cardiomyocyte (CM) generation using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The authors found that GATA6 loss-of-function hESC exhibit early defects in mesendoderm and lateral mesoderm patterning stages. Using RNA-seq and CUT&amp;RUN assays the genes of the Wnt and BMP programs were found to be affected by the loss of GATA6 expression. Modulating Wnt and BMP during early cardiac differentiation can partially rescue CPC and CM defects in GATA6 hetero- and homozygous mutant hESCs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The studies performed were rigorous and the rationale for the experimental designed were logical. The results obtained were clear and supports the conclusions that the authors made regarding the role of GATA6 on Wnt and BMP pathway gene expression.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given the wealth of studies that have been performed in this research area previously, the amount of new information provided in this study is relatively modest. Nevertheless, the results and quite clear and should make a strong contribution to the field.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed the prior request to assess genes expression representing each stage of development/differentiation from mesoderm to cardiac progenitor to cardiomyocytes and confirmed that the differentiation defect lies at the cardiac progenitor and cardiomyocyte stages and not in mesodermal differentiation. This work has significantly improved the robustness of the study.</p>

<p>In this study, Bison et al. analyzed the role of the GATA6 transcription factor in patterning the early mesoderm and generating cardiomyocytes, using human embryonic stem cell differentiation assays and patient-derived hiPSCs with heart defects associated with mutations in the GATA6 gene. They identified a novel role for GATA6 in regulating genes involved in the WNT and BMP pathways. Modulation of the WNT and BMP pathways partially rescue early cardiac mesoderm defects in GATA6 mutant hESCs. These results provide significant insights into how GATA6 loss-of-function and heterozygous mutations contribute to heart defects.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive study that clearly and deeply investigates the function of GATA6 in human early cardiac development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study combines hESC engineering, differentiation, detailed gene expression, genome occupancy, and pathway modulation to elucidate the role of GATA6 in early cardiac differentiation. The work is carefully executed and the results support the conclusions. The use of publicly available data is well integrated throughout the manuscript. The RIME experiments are excellent.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Much has been known about GATA6 in mesendoderm development, and this is acknowledged by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comments and have tried to highlight both the early role of GATA6 in cardiac progenitor biology as well as the haploinsufficiency for relevance to human congenital heart disease, which we believe adds value to other recent published work, among others Sharma et al. eLife 2020.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, Bison et al. analyzed the role of the GATA6 transcription factor in patterning the early mesoderm and generating cardiomyocytes, using human embryonic stem cell differentiation assays and patient-derived hiPSCs with heart defects associated with mutations in the GATA6 gene. They identified a novel role for GATA6 in regulating genes involved in the WNT and BMP pathways -findings not previously noted in earlier analyses of GATA6 mutant hiPSCs during early cardiac mesoderm specification (Sharma et al., 2020). Modulation of the WNT and BMP pathways may partially rescue early cardiac mesoderm defects in GATA6 mutant hESCs. These results provide significant insights into how GATA6 loss-of-function and heterozygous mutations contribute to heart defects.</p>
<p>I have the following comments:</p>
<p>(1) Throughout the manuscript, Bison et al. alternate between different protocols to generate cardiomyocytes, which creates some confusion (e.g., Figure 1 vs. Supplemental Figure 2A). The authors should provide a clear justification for using alternative protocols.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and clarified this issue in the revision (p. 6). The reviewer is correct that there are two widely used protocols for directed differentiation of PSCs to cardiac fate. One is a cytokine-based protocol (Fig. 1A) and the other uses small molecules to manipulate the WNT pathway (CHIR protocol, Supplemental Fig. 2B). In our study, we used the CHIR protocol only for experiments in Supplemental Figure 2B-E. Since our data implicated BMP and WNT as mediators of the GATA6-dependent program, we did this mainly to confirm that the phenotype we observed with the cytokine-based protocol was not biased by the differentiation protocol. However, we found the CHIR protocol to be overall relatively inefficient for cardiac differentiation using the parental H1 hESCs and the various isogenic lines. The <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiac differentiation protocols for hPSCs are known to be variable depending on lines and sometimes require extensive optimization for various media components and concentrations, cell seeding densities, and batch variations for crucial reagents. The cytokine-based protocol we optimized worked most efficiently with our hPSC lines to generate cardiomyocytes, therefore we committed to using it for the bulk of experiments in this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should characterise the mesodermal identity and cardiomyocyte subtypes generated with the activin/BMP-induction protocol thoroughly and clarify whether defects in the expression of BMP and WNTrelated gene affect the formation of specific cardiomyocyte subtypes in a chamber-specific manner. This analysis is important, as Sharma et al. suggested a role for GATA6 in orchestrating outflow tract formation, and Bison et al. similarly identified decreased expression of NRP1, a gene involved in outflow tract septation, in their GATA6 mutant cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree it is important that the mesodermal identities are quite thoroughly characterized.</p>
<p>For example, Fig. 2 (K+P+, Brachyury, EOMES), Fig. 3G&amp;H (lateral mesoderm, cardiac mesoderm RNAseq &amp; GSEA comparing datasets from Koh et al.). The capacity of the cytokine-based protocol to generate both FHF and SHF derived sub-types has been rigorously evaluated by Keller and colleagues, which we now cite (Yang et al. 2022). Since the null cells do not generate CMs, chamber specific subtypes cannot be evaluated; whether the GATA6 heterozygous mutants are biased is an interesting question. Indeed, the top GO term identified by CUT&amp;RUN analysis for GATA6 at day 2 of</p>
<p>differentiation is outflow tract morphogenesis, which is consistent with the interpretation by Sharma et al., but implicates this program at a much earlier developmental stage, long before cardiomyocyte differentiation. We think this is one of the most important findings of our study and appreciate the chance to highlight this in the revision (p. 9, 17). When we evaluated chamber-specificity for differentiated cardiomyocytes, we did not find significant differences, as indicated for the reviewer in the panel below (day 20 of differentiation). Since our study focuses on early stages of progenitor specification rather than cardiomyocyte differentiation, we agree that a more rigorous analysis would be of value, and indicated this as a limitation of our current study (p. 18).</p>

<p>(3) The authors developed an iPSC line derived from a congenital heart disease (CHD) patient with an atrial septal defect and observed that these cells generate cTnnT+ cells less efficiently. However, it remains unclear whether atrial cardiomyocytes (or those localised specifically at the septum) are being generated using the activin/BMP-induction protocol and the patient-derived iPSC line.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As indicated above, our study is focused on cardiac progenitor specification, and we found similar differences with the patient-derived iPSC-CMs compared to using hESC heterozygous targeted mutants. While we did not note any major differences in expression of cardiomyocyte markers, whether the mutants show any biases toward sub-types of cardiomyocytes is an interesting question to be pursued in subsequent work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should also justify the necessity of using the patient-derived line to further analyse GATA6 function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good point, and as suggested we provided the justification (p. 5-6). This is the first patient-derived iPSC line published with a heterozygous GATA6 mutation along with an isogenic mutation-corrected control generated for cardiac directed differentiation. Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) associated with GATA6 mutations are typically heterozygous (also true for many other CHD variants; presumably homozygous null embryos would not survive). It is important to query if phenotypes found using targeted mutations in hESCs (or iPSCs) model the human disease, since the patient cells (or the hESCs) likely have additional genetic variants that might interact with the GATA6 mutation. The fact that both types of heterozygous cells (patient-derived iPSCs and targeted hESCs) generate similar defects in CM differentiation provides evidence supporting the use of these human cellular models to study the genetic and cellular basis for congenital heart disease. This is particularly important, since other models, such as heterozygous mice, do not show such phenotypes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 3 suggests an enrichment of paraxial mesoderm genes in the context of GATA6 loss-of-function, which is intriguing given the well-established role of GATA6 in specifying cardiac versus pharyngeal mesoderm lineages in model organisms. Could the authors expand their analysis beyond GO term enrichment to explore which alternative fates GATA6 mutant cells may acquire? Additionally, how does the potential enrichment of paraxial mesoderm, rather than pharyngeal mesoderm, relate to the initial mesodermal induction from their differentiation protocol? Could the authors also rule out the possibility of increased neuronal cell fates?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We need to interpret our <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation data cautiously in relation to what has been shown <italic>in vivo</italic>, since we are unlikely to be reproducing all the complex signaling taking place in the embryo. Yet we do see modest increases in gene expression levels including signatures of paraxial mesoderm and ECM/mesenchymal at days 2 or 3 of differentiation in the GATA6 mutant cells. Therefore, we now include a heatmap showing enriched paraxial mesoderm gene expression in the mutant cells, new Fig. 3I (see page 10).</p>
<p>A caveat of this result is that the cells are being differentiated toward cardiac fate, so a bias for alternative fates might be suppressed. We modified the protocol to favor paraxial fate by adding CHIR at day 2 (rather than XAV) and performing qPCR assays at day 3. We found this successfully induced paraxial mesoderm gene expression, but equally comparing wildtype, heterozygous, or null cells, so do not feel it warrants highlighting further.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Incorporation of marker analysis for various stages of iPSC to CM differentiation (mesoderm, cardiac progenitor, CM subtypes) would increase the significance and support for the findings presented. Further data on the link (direct or indirect) between GATA6 and Wnt/BMP signalling would also add to the significance of this study. A number of textual changes/clarifications are also suggested to improve the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the feedback and provide responses for issues raised for markers, direct or indirect interactions, and textual changes/clarifications in the following sections. As indicated above, we did not find obvious alterations in cardiac subtypes, but since our study is focused on early progenitor specification, this is an interesting question that we think should be more rigorously evaluated in subsequent work.</p>

<p>Minor details:</p>
<p>(1) On p6 &quot;Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the cells derived from each genotype were well separated from each other (Supplemental Figure 2C)&quot;. All genotypes should be in one PCA plot to better evaluate the three genotypes.</p>

<p>We prepared the new plot as suggested, presented as new Supplemental Fig. 2C.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for catching this. Yes, the text was changed to indicate a “decreased enrichment in GATA6-/- cells relative to WT at day 2 for putative direct GATA6 target genes.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting study that addresses the early developmental roles of GATA6 on cardiac differentiation. While the identification of Wnt and BMP pathway genes to be involved in GATA6 regulation is not entirely unexpected, the authors do bring forth some useful knowledge that helps to further elucidate the mechanism of pre-cardiac mesoderm regulation. Some suggestions for improvement are included below -</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) Since the loss of Gata6 in this study is global (either as heterozygous or homozygous, it is likely that the very early requirement of Gata6 (e.g. mesodermal stage of differentiation) is responsible for the cardiac transcriptional phenotype observed and not due to specific role of Gata6 in the cardiac lineage which would need to be addressed using conditional knock out of Gata6 in hPSC model. The authors should be more explicit when discussing the results as disruption of mesodermal differentiation leading to loss of downstream cardiac lineage cells. For example, I would change the title &quot;GATA6 loss-of-function impairs CM differentiation&quot; to &quot;GATA6 loss-of-function impairs mesodermal (or mesodermal lineage) differentiation&quot; and show the changes in cardiac progenitor cells genes (Isl1, Tbx1, Hand1, and BAF50c/Smarcd3) in addition to cardiomyocyte genes but no change in mesodermal (e.g. Brachyury, T, Eomes, Mesp1/2, etc) genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s interpretation. The title for the section was changed as suggested. In Fig. 1, we show changes in cardiac progenitor cell genes (Isl1, Hand1, and BAF50c/Smarcd3) while not seeing changes in mesodermal genes in Fig. 2 (e.g. Brachyury, Eomes, Mesp1/2). We note that the defect may be specific to cardiac (or anterior lateral) mesoderm, as the ability to express paraxial mesoderm markers was not impaired.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The use of NKX2.5, TBX5, TBX20, and GATA4 as markers for CPC is not ideal. These markers are also expressed in differentiated cardiomycytes. ISL1 or TBX1 for second heart field progenitors and HAND1 or BAF60c/Smarcd3 for first heart field progenitors would be ideal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we included additional day 6 qPCR panel (new Fig. 1E) to evaluate the heart field progenitor markers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Much of the findings described in this study have been known in the field including the requirement of Wnt and BMP to induce mesodermal and subsequently cardiomyocyte differentiation. The key new information here is that Gata6 knockout disrupts Wnt and BMP signaling. It would help to further validate experimentally some of the Wnt and BMP genes as either direct or indirect targets of Gata6 using reporter assays.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While reporter assays are feasible and do provide relevant outputs, we feel that the use of any one or even several response elements in a reporter assay adds relatively little value compared to comprehensive analysis of bona fide network components. To address the reviewers concern we have included profiling heat maps for WNT and BMP pathway components to more rigorously and specifically evaluate the disruption in the signaling networks caused by loss of GATA6. Proving direct targets of endogenous genes is challenging, but we mapped many binding peaks for GATA6 to putative enhancers of WNT/BMP pathway genes (based on histone marks). We provide a list of these genes (new Fig. 4F) and distinguish these from WNT/BMP pathway genes that were not bound by GATA6 yet are down-regulated in the GATA6 mutant cells and are likely to be indirect targets (p. 12).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(1) Figures 1 and 2 - in the figure legend the labels w2, w4, m2, m5, m11, and m14 should be explained as the name of the clones of targeted hESC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The legends were edited to provide this information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Supplemental Figure 3A - the resolution of the FACS plot is suboptimal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize and have corrected the plot resolution in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Supplemental Table 1 - it's intriguing that amongst all the SWI/SNF factors, the one that is known to be cardiac-specific (SMARCD3) did not come up in the GATA6-RIME-enriched proteins. Is this a reflection of the early stage in which GATA6 plays a role in development (e.g. mesendoderm development but not precardiac mesoderm development when SMARCD3 is expressed)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have noted this feature in the revised manuscript (p. 17). We note that SMARCD3 is expressed in the RNA-seq data as early as day 2. Although speculative, it may be that GATA6 primarily interacts with SWI/SNF complexes prior to the role for SMARCD3 in cardiac specification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figures 3G and 3H, as well as others, have resolution issues. The gene names are unreadable, and higherresolution images should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the resolution issues and these have been fixed in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In their early manipulation of the WNT and BMP pathways (Figure 6A), it is unclear whether the activin/BMP protocol shown in Figure 1A was used. If this is the case, the authors should compare their results to a wild-type + DOX EV condition for consistency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified in the revision (Fig. 6A) that all the experiments in Fig. 6 use the cytokine protocol. In the revised figure, we included the wild-type + DOX EV condition as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figures 6C and 6D, the authors should include an analysis of a wild-type isogenic line under their new CHIR/LB condition for comparison.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we included the WT isogenic line in the comparison. For Fig. 6C these are shown on a separate graph because the Y-axis values are very different. Note that the CHIR/LB treatments that improve mutant cell differentiation impact the WT cells in the opposite manner.</p>
