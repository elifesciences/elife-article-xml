<title>Abstract</title><p>Integration of a large network of kinase signalling pathways co-ordinates changes in the transcription, translation and metabolic events required for T cell activation and differentiation. The present study explores the role of the Serine/Threonine kinases PIM1 and PIM2 in controlling murine CD8 T lymphocyte antigen receptor-mediated activation and differentiation in response to the cytokines Interleukin 2 (IL-2) or IL-15. We show that PIM kinases are dispensable for the differentiation programs controlled by the antigen-receptor and IL-15. There is however a selective role for the PIM kinases in the context of IL-2 regulation of CD8 T cell fate. One key insight was that the PIM kinases controlled the migratory capabilities of effector CD8 T cells, with <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficient CD8 T cells unable to fully switch off the naïve T cell chemokine and adhesion receptor program during effector differentiation. PIM kinases were also needed for IL-2 to sustain high expression of the glucose transporters SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 and to maintain activity of the nutrient sensing kinase mTORc1. Strikingly, PIM kinases did not have a dominant impact on IL-2-driven transcriptional programs but rather selectively modulated protein synthesis to shape cytotoxic T cell proteomes. This study reveals a selective role of PIM kinases in IL-2 control of CD8 T cells and highlights how regulated changes in protein synthesis can impact T cell phenotypes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>CD8 T lymphocytes are key effector cells for adaptive immune responses to viruses, intracellular pathogens and tumours. Their clonal expansion and differentiation to cytotoxic effector or memory CD8 T cells is controlled by signalling pathways initiated by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines. Receptor engagement by immune stimuli triggers the activation of cytosolic tyrosine kinases that then direct the activity of a diverse network of Serine/Threonine kinases, disseminating signals from plasma membrane to cell interior. The Src family and ZAP70 Tyrosine kinases initiate this process downstream of the TCR, with the Janus kinases (JAK) as the main signal transducer for important cytokine regulators of T cell differentiation, IL-2 and IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cantrell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Saravia et al., 2020</xref>). The subsequent network of Serine/Threonine kinases that is engaged beyond these initiating events coordinates phosphorylation of a diverse array of protein targets.</p>
<p>These protein targets include chromatin regulators, transcription factors, translation machinery, cytoskeletal proteins and metabolic enzymes, which then control the changes in transcriptional, translational and metabolic programs that drive effector and memory T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Locard-Paulet et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>CD8 T cells express ∼200 Serine/Threonine protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Navarro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howden et al., 2019</xref>). There is a good understanding of the roles of some Serine/Threonine kinases in CD8 T cells including the role of the diacylglycerol regulated kinases, MAP kinases ERK1 and 2, Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate-controlled kinases PDK1 and AKT, and the nutrient sensing kinases mammalian Target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORc1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Finlay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rolf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Blagih et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cantrell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howden et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Saravia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Damasio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Spinelli et al., 2021</xref>). However, beyond these core kinases there is much still to learn about how many of the ∼200 Serine/Threonine kinases expressed in CD8 T cells contribute to the control of T cell function. In this context, the PIM kinases are a family of Serine/Threonine kinases that are strongly and rapidly induced in T cells responding to immune stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Peperzak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jackson et al., 2012</xref>). The PIM family contains 3 Serine/Threonine kinases, PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3, of which T lymphocytes predominantly express PIM1 and PIM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mikkers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). As PIM kinases are constitutively active, their participation in signalling cascades is dictated by regulated changes in their protein expression levels (Warfel and Kraft, 2015). PIM1 and PIM2 have little to no expression in naïve T cells but are induced by T-cell receptor activation and costimulation (e.g. CD27) (Wingett et al., 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Peperzak et al., 2010</xref>). PIM kinases are also direct transcriptional targets of JAK/STAT signalling pathways and as such PIM1 and/or PIM2 are rapidly induced in T cells downstream of a diverse array of cytokines, including multiple common cytokine receptor γ-chain family cytokines, IL-6 and IL-12 (Matikainen et al., 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; Warfel and Kraft, 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Buchacher et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>There have been some analyses of how deletion of PIM kinases impacts CD8 T cell function. A mild reduction in <italic>Pim1/Pim2/Pim3</italic>-deficient CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation has been observed in response to sub-optimal TCR stimulation and IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mikkers et al., 2004</xref>) and there is evidence that PIM1 and PIM2 control survival pathways in naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells in concert with mTORc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Pim1/Pim2/Pim3</italic> deletion is reported to promote expression of stemness and memory-associated transcription factors including Bcl6 and Tcf7 (Chatterjee et al., 2019) and PIM kinase activity has been linked with maintenance of memory CD8 T cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Knudson et al., 2017</xref>). It has also been shown recently that <italic>Pim1/Pim2</italic> deficiency prevented mTORc1 activation and the proliferation of non-conventional intra-epithelial gut CD8 T lymphocytes (IEL) in response to the cytokine IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">James et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Elevated PIM kinase expression has been noted in patient T cells for a number of autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis and coeliac disease, and PIM kinase inhibition has been proposed as a possible intervention to dampen autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">James et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Maney et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2022</xref>). PIM kinase inhibitors have also entered clinical trials to treat some cancers and there is active interest in combining these with immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Clements and Warfel, 2022</xref>). Given the role of CD8 T cells in anti-cancer immunity, it is important to understand how these kinase control CD8 T cell function. However, there has not yet been a systematic analysis of the role of PIM kinases in conventional CD8 T cells as they activate and differentiate to form effector and memory cells. Accordingly, the current study, uses high resolution quantitative analysis of <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficient CD8 T cell proteomes and transcriptomes to obtain a comprehensive and unbiased understanding of how PIM kinases control CD8 T cell TCR-driven activation, and IL-2 or IL-15-driven proliferation, and differentiation. The study reveals a selective role for PIM kinases as mediators of IL-2 signalling to control CD8 T cell trafficking and effector functionality. We uncover that the dominant impact of PIM kinase loss was to shape effector CD8 T cell proteomes rather than transcriptomes, reflecting PIM kinase modulation of protein synthesis.</p>

<title>PIM1 and PIM2 are strongly induced by antigen receptor engagement but are dispensable for T cell activation</title>
<p>T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-driven activation of naïve T cells initiates their clonal expansion and differentiation into effector and memory cells. Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of naïve OT1 CD8 T cell stimulated with their cognate peptide over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Marchingo et al., 2020</xref>) showed that PIM1 protein was strongly induced within 3 hours of TCR engagement, which was sustained at a 24 hour time point (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). PIM2 expression was not detected until 9 hours post-stimulation but was also sustained at the 24 hour time point. 24 hour polyclonal activation of CD8 T cells with αCD3/αCD28 agonist antibodies similarly induced expression of PIM1 and PIM2 proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref><bold>, Table S1</bold>). These increases in PIM kinases expression at a protein level were underpinned by transcriptional reprograming, with both <italic>Pim1</italic> and P<italic>im2</italic> mRNA very lowly expressed in naïve CD8 T cells and strongly upregulated by immune activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Spinelli et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with previous reports of Pim1 and Pim2 being the major PIM kinases in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mikkers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fox et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>Pim3</italic> mRNA was only expressed at very low levels in naïve and activated CD8 T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), with PIM3 protein not detected at all by mass spectrometry (<bold>Table S1</bold>).</p>

<p>PIM1 and PIM2 have similar substrate selectivity and hence functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mikkers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bullock et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peng et al., 2007</xref>; Warfel and Kraft, 2015). Accordingly, to explore the role of the PIM kinases in T cells, mice with a whole body deletion of <italic>Pim1</italic> and <italic>Pim2</italic>, Pim1<sup>-/-</sup> (Pim1 KO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Laird et al., 1993</xref>) and Pim2<sup>-/-</sup> or Pim2<sup>-/Y</sup> (Pim2 KO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mikkers et al., 2004</xref>), were backcrossed for &gt;10 generations onto a C57BL/6 background and inter-crossed to generate <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic> double knockout (Pim dKO) mice.</p>
<p>There were normal proportions of peripheral T cells in spleens of Pim dKO mice, though the total number of splenocytes was lower than in age/sex matched wild-type (WT) mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A-C</xref>). However, Pim dKO T cells showed a normal increase in cell size in response to immune activation with αCD3/αCD28 agonist antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>) and 24 hour αCD3/αCD28 activated Pim dKO CD4 and CD8 T cells exhibited normal upregulation of established markers of T cell activation including CD25, CD44 and the transferrin receptor CD71 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). 24 hour TCR-activated Pim dKO CD8 T cells also produced normal levels of the key effector cytokine IFNγ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>) and there was no discernible difference in TCR-driven proliferation between WT and Pim dKO T cells over 3 days in culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F, J</xref>). To systematically explore in an unbiased way if <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency impacted TCR-driven activation phenotypes, we performed high-resolution mass spectrometry to measure the proteomes of 24 hour αCD3/αCD28 activated WT and Pim dKO CD4 and CD8 T cells. These experiments quantified expression of &gt;7000 proteins but found no substantial quantitative or qualitative differences in protein content or proteome composition in activated WT versus Pim dKO CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G-H</xref>) (<bold>Table S1</bold>), indicating a redundancy between PIM kinases and other signalling pathways downstream of TCR activation.</p>
<p>One prominent study has reported that <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic> deficiency sensitises T cells to the mTORc1 inhibitor rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fox et al., 2005</xref>), which suggests mTORc1 as a candidate for mediating this redundancy. This study showed naïve Pim dKO T cells cultured in IL-7 died in response to rapamycin treatment, whereas WT cells did not, and that rapamycin synergised with <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency to substantially reduce TCR-driven activation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). However, we found no impact of <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2-</italic>deficiency on the ability of naïve CD8 T cells cultured with IL-7 to survive in response to rapamycin treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1I</xref>). Furthermore, we found no difference in the effect of rapamycin on mean division number in Pim dKO versus WT CD8 T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1J</xref>). Collectively these data show that PIM 1 and PIM2 are rapidly and strongly expressed in response to immune activation, but they are dispensable for the antigen receptor-driven proteome remodeling that initiates T cell clonal expansion and differentiation. We also found no evidence that the <italic>Pim1</italic> and <italic>Pim2</italic> loss synergised with mTORC1 inhibition.</p>

<title>PIM kinases do not control IL-15-driven CD8 T cell memory differentiation</title>
<p>The proliferative expansion and differentiation programs of CD8 T cells are shaped by cytokines. In this context, PIM1 and PIM2 kinase expression is regulated by the cytokines IL-2 and IL-15 which are key to shaping CD8 T cell effector and memory cell differentiation respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Weninger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cornish et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Buck et al., 2016</xref>). Both IL-2 and IL-15 control PIM1 and PIM2 expression in antigen primed CD8 T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Accordingly, we assessed the contribution of PIM1 and PIM2 kinases to cytokine-driven expansion and differentiation of antigen activated CD8 T cells. In these experiments, antigen-primed CD8 T cells are expanded in IL-15 to generate memory phenotype CD8 T cells or expanded in IL-2 to generate effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Weninger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cornish et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Buck et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Previous work has shown that PIM1 and PIM2 mediate IL-15 induced proliferation of gut intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">James et al., 2021</xref>). However, their role in IL-15 responses in conventional antigen receptor activated CD8 T cells is not known. We therefore first examined the impact of <italic>Pim1/Pim2</italic>-deficiency on IL-15-driven conventional CD8 T cell expansion. Antigen experienced WT CD8 T cells show a robust proliferative response to IL-15 such that there is an ∼90-fold expansion of the CD8 T cells between days 2 and 6 of culture (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). There was no impact of <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency on the ability of IL-15 to sustain CD8 T cell viability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Immune activated Pim dKO CD8 T cells also proliferated strongly in response to IL-15, but showed a moderate proliferative disadvantage resulting in a ∼4-fold difference in total cell number by day 6 of the culture (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Antigen-primed CD8 T cells expand in IL-15 to generate memory phenotype CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Weninger et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We therefore examined whether <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency had any impact on the ability of IL-15 to induce memory differentiation. Accordingly, we performed parallel bulk RNAseq and high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyse the transcriptome and proteome of IL-15 expanded WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells. The RNAseq analysis quantified ∼14,000 RNA and using a cut off of &gt;1.5 fold-change and q-value &lt;0.05 we saw that the abundance of 381 RNA was modified by <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>) (<bold>Table S2A</bold>). Of the 381 RNA that were detected as differentially expressed (FC&gt;1.5, q&lt;0.05) only ∼30% were detected with an average expression over 10 transcripts per million (TPM), of these gene ∼36% were non-coding RNA, uncharacterised genes or pseudogenes, leaving only 72 substantially expressed protein coding mRNA that were differentially expressed in Pim dKO versus WT IL-15 expanded CD8 T cells (<bold>Table S2B</bold>). These data indicate that Pim1/Pim2-deficiency has very little effect on IL-15 induced protein-coding mRNA expression in differentiated T cells. We then specifically examined if Pim dKO T cells had any differences in mRNA that are known to be critical for memory cell differentiation. We found that <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency did not decrease expression of mRNA levels for critical memory T cell genes such as the adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors, <italic>Sell</italic> (CD62L), <italic>Ccr7</italic> and <italic>S1pr1</italic> that direct the trafficking of CD8 T cells to secondary lymphoid tissue. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). <italic>Pim1/Pim2</italic>-deficiency also did not reduce expression of mRNA for the key memory cell transcription factors <italic>Tcf7, Foxo1, Foxo3 Klf2 and Id3.</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). Indeed, if anything, there were small increases in expression of the <italic>Klf2</italic>, <italic>Id3</italic> and <italic>Ccr7</italic> mRNA in Pim dKO versus WT IL-15 expanded CD8 T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F-G</xref>).</p>
<p>Critically, when the proteomes of IL15 expanded WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells were analysed and expression of ∼6900 total proteins quantified, there were no major changes in the proteomes between WT and Pim dKO IL15 expanded CD8 T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref><bold>, Table S3</bold>). Of note, the mitochondrial proteome composition of IL15 expanded WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells were indistinguishable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I-J</xref>). This is pertinent because one key feature of how IL-15 controls memory T cells is via mitochondrial remodelling to support energy production via oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Buck et al., 2016</xref>) and it has been described that PIM kinases can control mitochondrial phenotypes in cancer cell lines and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Din et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chauhan et al., 2020</xref>). These data show that PIM1 and PIM2 do not drive IL-15-mediated metabolic or differentiation programs in antigen-primed CD8 T cells.</p>

<title>PIM kinases selectively modulate IL-2 controlled effector CD8 T cell differentiation</title>
<p>IL-2 controls the expression of PIM1 and PIM2 kinases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and in this context, we noted that the copy numbers per cell of PIM1 protein is considerably higher in actively expanding antigen-activated CD8 cells maintained with IL-2 compared to IL-15 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). We therefore examined the role of PIM1 and PIM2 in the IL-2 signalling pathways that control the differentiation of effector CTL. The data show that Pim dKO antigen activated CD8 T cells responded normally to IL-2 to induce STAT5 Y694 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). They also express normal levels of the IL-2-receptor alpha chain, CD25, (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>), which is sustained by STAT5, and together these data broadly indicate IL-2 receptor signal transduction is unaltered by <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency. Antigen activated WT CD8 T cells have a strong survival and proliferative response to IL-2 producing an ∼270-fold expansion between days 2 and 6 of culture in saturating IL-2 concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). There was no impact of <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency on the ability of IL-2 to maintain CD8 T cell viability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>) and Pim dKO cells CD8 T cells cultured in IL-2 proliferated robustly. They did however exhibit a very mild proliferative disadvantage resulting in a ∼2-fold difference in total cell number by day 6 of the culture (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). We then examined whether <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency had any impact on the differentiation of Pim dKO CD8 T cells into effector CTL. Expression of activation markers CD44 and CD71 in IL-2-expanded CTL were similar between WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells on days 3 and 6 of co-cultures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). However, one consistent difference between IL-2 maintained WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells is that WT CTL downregulated expression of CD62L (L-selectin, <italic>Sell</italic>), whereas the Pim dKO CTL sustained higher CD62L expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). We also noted that IL-2 maintained Pim dKO CTL had reduced forward and side scatter properties i.e were smaller and less granular than corresponding WT CTL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>).</p>

<p>To explore the apparent size change between Pim dKO and WT IL-2 expanded CTL, we used high resolution mass spectrometry to compare the proteomes of day 6 IL-2 cultured WT or Pim dKO CTL. These analyses quantified expression of ∼6,900 proteins and showed a small decrease in the total protein mass of IL-2 maintained Pim dKO CD8 T cells compared to WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, Table S4). The data showed down-regulation of the expression of 513 proteins (&gt;1.5 fold-change, q&lt;0.05) in Pim dKO CTL along with increased copy numbers of 33 proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, Table S4). The transcription factor profile of Pim dKO T cells was consistent with that of an effector CTL with high levels of TBX21 and low levels of TCF1 (<italic>Tcf7</italic>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Pim dKO T cells also exhibited an effector-like mitochondrial proteome profile (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>). However, there were salient differences in proteins important for effector functionality between WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells. These included lower levels of the glucose transporters, SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 (GLUT1 and GLUT3) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>) which are the major glucose transporters in CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>) and are key for enabling T cells to fuel high rates of glycolysis and protein O-GlcNAcylation required to support effector functions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Swamy et al., 2016</xref>). Pim dKO CTL also had decreased expression of a number of proteins involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis including SCD2, HMGCS1, MVK, IDI1, FDPS, FDFT1 and SQLE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). Another striking observation was that the Pim dKO CD8 cells had reduced levels of a number of key effector proteins including multiple granzymes, perforin, IFNγ and TNFα (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>). Orthogonal flow cytometric analysis of Granzyme B and IFNγ levels confirmed reduced levels of these effector molecule in IL-2 expanded Pim dKO CTL, though IFNγ protein is only lowly produced in IL2 maintained CTL. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). In parallel experiments we also examined the impact of an acute loss of PIM kinase activity on the proteomes of IL-2 maintained CTL to see if this could recapitulate key observations from Pim dKO T cells. When IL-2 maintained WT CTL were treated for 24 hours with the pan-PIM kinases inhibitors PIM447 or AZD1208 we saw reductions in cell proliferation, cell size, cell granularity, fatty acid biosynthesis proteins SCD1-3, glucose transporters SLC2A1, SLC2A3 and a reduction in Granzyme B expression (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3A-E</xref>, Table S5).

<p>To examine the molecular regulation underpinning PIM1 and PIM2 kinase control of key metabolic and effector proteins we also performed RNAseq on IL-2 differentiated WT and Pim dKO CTL samples collected in parallel with the proteomics analysis described in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>. In these experiments ∼14,000 mRNA were quantified and using a cut off &gt;1.5 fold-change, q&lt;0.05 we saw that the abundance of 223 mRNA were decreased and 155 increased by <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic> deficiency (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, Table S6). These data revealed that the reduced expression of perforin and Granzymes C-G and K protein corresponded to decreases in their mRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-C</xref>). However, there were striking examples where a clear decrease in protein levels did not correspond with an appreciable decrease in mRNA expression. These included the predominant cytolytic Granzymes B and A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C-D</xref>), as well as both glucose transporters SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>).

<p>These observations could reflect that the PIM kinases are required for IL-2 to maximally control protein synthesis in CD8 T cells. To examine this hypothesis we first interrogated our proteomics and transcriptomics data. Consistent with this hypothesis we observed a small reduction in ribosome protein content in Pim dKO CTL, which scaled with the reduction in total protein content (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5H</xref>). Moreover the translational repressor PDCD4 was increased in Pim dKO CTL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5I</xref>). This could be confirmed by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5J</xref>) and was underpinned at the mRNA level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Similarly, 24 hour inhibition with pan PIM kinases inhibitors was sufficient to substantially increase PDCD4 protein expression (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3F</xref>). We also noted that there was a small decrease in the expression of EIF4A1, a key component of the eIF4F translation initiation complex, in Pim dKO IL2 maintained CTL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5K</xref>). PDCD4 inhibits translation by binding EIF4A1 in a 2:1 ratio, preventing its interaction with the EIF4F complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>). Together the changes in both proteins equated to an approximate halving of the ratio between EIF4A1 and PDCD4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5L</xref>). These data all support that loss of PIM kinases could reduce protein synthesis in IL-2 maintained CTL. To test this hypothesis we used a single cell assay that quantifies the incorporation of an analogue of puromycin (OPP) into newly synthesized protein chains in the ribosome to assess cellular rates of protein synthesis. We found that 24 hours of treatment with pan-PIM kinase inhibitors PIM447 or AZD1208 caused a quantitative reduction in protein synthesis rates of IL-2 expanded CTL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5M</xref>). This data is consistent with PIM kinase effects on protein expression being via control of protein translation.</p>

<title>PIM1 and PIM2 regulate mTORc1 and sustain lymphoid homing in Pim1/Pim2-deficient effector CTL</title>
<p>The pattern of proteome remodelling in Pim dKO CTL had some phenotypic features in common with the previously reported changes that occur following inhibition of the Serine/Threonine kinase mTORc1 in CTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howden et al., 2019</xref>). These included: increased expression of PDCD4 and decreased expression of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes and effector molecules including granzymes, perforin, IFNγ and TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howden et al., 2019</xref>). In this respect, mTORc1 activity in CTL is acutely sensitive to reduced availability of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rolf et al., 2013</xref>) and the reduced expression of glucose transporters in Pim dKO T cells might predict that these cells would have lower activity of mTORc1. We therefore assessed if PIM kinases were required for IL-2 activation of mTORc1. In these experiments we compared the phosphorylation of S6K1 (p70 S6-kinase 1) on its mTORC1 substrate sequence T389 in WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells by western blot. These data show a modest reduction of mTORc1 activity in the Pim dKO T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). We also assessed the activity of S6K1 at a single cell level by quantifying the phosphorylation of its downstream target protein S6 ribosomal protein on S235/S236 by flow cytometry over the course of IL-2 driven CTL expansion. These data also show that <italic>Pim1/Pim2</italic>-deficiency reduced IL-2 induced mTORc1 dependent phosphorylation of S6 but did not compromise the ability of the Pim dKO cells to phosphorylate S6 in response to phorbol esters and calcium ionophores; pharmacological activators that induce RSK mediated S6 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>Previously, it has been shown that decreased glucose availability or inhibition of mTORc1 prevents the downregulation of CD62L that normally accompanies IL-2 induced CTL differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sinclair et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Finlay et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the reduced expression of glucose transporters and reduced activity of mTORc1 in Pim dKO IL-2 expanded CTL provides a potential explanation for the striking phenotype shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>, that IL-2 maintained Pim dKO CTL retain high levels of CD62L/L-selectin. The IL-2 CTL transcriptomics data showed there is increased expression of CD62L at the mRNA level in IL-2 maintained PimdKO CTL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref><bold>, 6C</bold>). The expression of <italic>Sell</italic> (CD62L) mRNA is controlled by the transcription factor KLF2 and the expression of <italic>Klf2</italic> mRNA is also increased in IL-2 maintained Pim dKO CTL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>) as are mRNA levels for other KLF2 targets: the chemokine receptors <italic>Ccr7</italic> and <italic>S1pr1 (</italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref><italic>)</italic>.</p>
<p>CD62L/L-selectin controls T cell adhesion to the endothelium of high endothelial venules and is essential for lymphocyte transit from blood into secondary lymphoid tissue such as lymph nodes. CCR7, and the S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor also direct migration by controlling T cell entry and egress respectively into secondary lymphoid tissue. In this context, the loss of CD62L, CCR7 and S1PR1 expression following immune activation reprograms the trafficking of effector T cells away from lymphoid tissue toward sites of inflammation in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sinclair et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nolz et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, the differences between Pim dKO and WT CTL in terms of CD62L expression could indicate that in addition to having reduced effector protein expression, Pim dKO CTL also do not switch their trafficking behaviour to that of a fully differentiated effector CTL and rather retain the capacity to home to lymphoid tissues. To test this possibility <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed adoptive transfer experiments comparing the ability of WT effector CTL and Pim dKO CTL to home to secondary lymphoid tissues. In these experiments, αCD3/αCD28 activated WT or Pim dKO T cells were differentiated in IL-2 and cells then were labelled with either CFSE or CTV dyes; mixed at a ratio of 1:1, and adoptively transferred into C57BL/6 hosts. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref> shows that Pim dKO CTL, but not WT CTL, retained substantial capacity to home to secondary lymphoid organs and, hence, accumulated in lymph nodes and spleen: PIM kinases are thus required for the normal reprogramming of CTL trafficking.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The objective of the present study was to use quantitative analysis of T cell proteomes and transcriptomes to explore how deletion of the Serine/Threonine kinases PIM1 and PIM2 impacts CD8 T cell activation and differentiation. The expression of PIM1 and PIM2 is induced during immune activation of CD8 T cells by antigen and co-stimulation and then sustained to varying degrees by the cytokines IL2 or IL-15. The loss of PIM1 and PIM2 was shown to have no effect on the CD8 T cell programs controlled by antigen receptor/co-stimulation and had very little impact on the IL-15-driven transcriptional and proteomic programs in memory differentiated CD8 T cells. However, PIM1 and PIM2 were required for IL-2 programming of effector CD8 T cell differentiation. IL-2 controls essential cytolytic effector and metabolic programs in CTL, is a key cytokine for CD8 T cell anti-viral immunity and is also used to produce cytotoxic T cells for anti-cancer immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kalia and Sarkar, 2018</xref>). The understanding that PIM kinases mediate IL-2 control of the expression of glucose transporters, lipid metabolic enzymes and key cytolytic proteins such as granzymes A and B in effector CD8 T cells is thus fundamental information about how this key cytokine controls T cells. It was also important to understand that PIM kinases did not control the transcriptional programs that direct expression of glucose transporters and effector enzymes and the hence the full consequences of PIM kinase deletion could only be assessed by in depth analysis of the proteomes of <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficient CTL and not from mRNA sequencing. The loss of PIM kinase activity reduced protein synthesis rates in CTL which explains the discordance between mRNA and protein reported herein. The reduction in protein synthesis was modest but previous studies have shown that modest reductions in protein synthesis and loss of mTORc1 activity impact CD8 T cell differentiation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cornish et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howden et al., 2019</xref>). PIM kinase regulation of protein translation has been reported previously in mouse B cell lymphoma and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schatz et al., 2011</xref>) and some of the key examples of proteins we found to be unaltered at the mRNA level but down-regulated at the protein level have prior reports of sensitivity to translational regulation in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fehniger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ricciardi et al., 2018</xref>). Reduced protein synthesis capacity in cells lacking PIM kinases could be caused by reduced mTORc1 activity combined with increased expression at the mRNA and protein level of the translational repressor PDCD4. Moreover, protein synthesis is highly energetically demanding and once CTL have reduced glucose transporter expression this would reduce glucose availability to fuel protein production. These data collectively point towards modulation of protein translation as an important target of PIM kinase activity downstream of IL-2 in CD8 T cells.</p>
<p>One other important insight from the current work is that PIM kinases are required for IL2 to fully repress expression of the adhesion molecule CD62L and the chemokine receptors CCR7 and S1PR1. These molecules play a key role in controlling T cell homing to secondary lymphoid tissue and are expressed at high levels in naïve and memory T cells. IL-2 induces down regulation of CD62L, CCR7 and S1PR1 expression as part of a program that causes effector cells to lose their capacity to home to secondary lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sinclair et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nolz et al., 2011</xref>). The present data show that PIM kinases can mediate this IL-2 repression of lymph node homing receptors and the ability of IL-2 to switch off the naïve T cell trafficking program. IL2 maintained Pim dKO CD8 effector T cells thus retain the capacity to home to secondary lymphoid tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>. This lymph-node homing pattern is also a memory CD8 T cell phenotype but here it is pertinent that the current in-depth analysis of the transcriptomes and proteomes of <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficient IL-2 differentiated CD8 T cells show that the loss of PIM kinases does not cause effector T cells to differentiate instead into memory cells. For example, IL-2 maintained Pim dKO CD8 T cells do not re-express key molecules that maintain the stem-like properties of memory cells such as the transcription factor TCF7 and IL-7 receptor (Table S2, S6). Nor do Pim dKO CTL cultured in IL-2 have the mitochondrial proteome of a memory T cell. Hence <italic>Pim1</italic>/<italic>Pim2</italic>-deficiency prevents optimal differentiation of effector CTL but does not cause these cells to fully switch to a memory phenotype. This is worth knowing as pan-PIM kinase inhibitors are in development as anti-cancer drugs and it has been suggested that PIM inhibitors might be used as a strategy to generate more stem-memory-like CD8 T cells in combination with cancer immunotherapy treatments (Chatterjee et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Clements and Warfel, 2022</xref>). Information about how the loss of PIM kinases will impact CD8 T cells is very relevant to informed usage of such drugs.</p>
<p>Finally, the selectivity of PIM kinases for IL-2 control of conventional CD8 T cell differentiation with no evidence that PIMs were important for IL-15 responses beyond a modest effect on cell proliferation was interesting. This failure to see a role for PIM signalling in conventional peripheral CD8 T cell differentiation is in contrast to observations that PIM1 and PIM2 direct IL15 control of the metabolic programming of intestinal IEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">James et al., 2021</xref>). A notable difference between these scenarios was that in IEL, IL15 was being used individually to drive immune activation and was sufficient to strongly induce PIM1 and PIM2 expression. In contrast, in our conventional CD8 T cell system we uncovered that that IL-15 does not sustain high levels of PIM kinases, which could possibly explain this discrepancy. However, high levels of PIM expression alone are not inevitably predictive of their importance. In this study we observed very high levels of both PIM1 and PIM2 in antigen activated CD8 T cells yet loss of PIM kinases there had no functional impact. There are thus clearly redundant kinase pathways that can substitute for the PIM kinases in the immediate response of CD8 T cells to immune activation. Previously it was suggested that mTORc1 may be one of these pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fox et al., 2005</xref>), however we found no evidence for that here, and in fact observed that PIM kinase deficiency was upstream of a reduction in mTORc1 activity in IL2 expanded CTL. Thus, this examination of the role of PIM kinases in multiple signalling situations reveal cell context dependent regulatory roles for PIM kinases rather than hard wired functions that apply to every stimulatory situation in T cells.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>Pim1<sup>-/-</sup> (Pim1 KO)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Laird et al., 1993</xref>) and Pim2<sup>-/-</sup> or Pim2<sup>-/Y</sup> (Pim2 KO) mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mikkers et al., 2004</xref>) on the FVB/N background were backcrossed for &gt;10 generations onto a C57BL/6 background and were a generous gift from Prof Victor Tybulewicz. Pim1 KO and Pim2 KO mice were inter-crossed to generate the Pim1/Pim2 double KO (Pim dKO) strain. Pim dKO, C57BL/6, Ly5.1, P14 and OT1 mice were bred and maintained in the WTB/RUTG, University of Dundee in compliance with UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 guidelines. Mice used for proteomics and RNAseq studies were male and 12-15 weeks of age. Age/sex matched mice were used for all other experiments between 5–52 weeks of age, with most being between 10 – 20 weeks.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Single cell suspensions were generated by mashing mouse lymph nodes (brachial, axial, inguinal, superficial cervical, deep cervical, lumbar) or spleens through a 70 µm strainer. Red blood cells were lysed with Ack buffer (150 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl 10 mM KHCO<sub>3</sub>110 µM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA pH 7.8). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing glutamine (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>For 24 hour TCR activation WT and Pim dKO proteomics and phenotyping, lymph node suspension from 2 mice per biological replicate were activated with 0.5 µg/mL anti-mouse CD3 (Biolegend) and 0.5 µg/mL anti-mouse CD28 (eBioscience) in 2 × 10 mL complete culture medium in six well plates. Proteomics samples were generated in biological triplicate.</p>
<p>For generation of memory-like or effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from mice with polyclonal T cell repertoires, LN or spleen single cell suspensions were activated with 0.5 µg/mL anti-mouse CD3 (Biolegend) and 0.5 µg/mL anti-mouse CD28 (eBioscience) and recombinant human IL-15 (20 ng/mL, Peprotech) or recombinant human IL-2 (20 ng/mL, Proleukin, Novartis) in 10 mL complete culture medium per organ per mouse. After 2 days of activation (∼40 hours) cells were washed out of activation medium and resuspended at 0.3 million T cells/mL in fresh culture medium and cytokine 20 ng/mL of IL-15 or IL-2 for memory-like and effector T cells respectively. T cells were subsequently split into fresh medium and cytokine daily at a density of 0.5 million/ mL and 0.3 million/mL for memory-like and effector T cells respectively until analysis timepoint.</p>
<p>For generation of effector CTL from TCR-transgenic P14 mice LN single cell suspensions were activated with 100 ng/mL gp33 peptide, recombinant human IL-2 (20 ng/mL) and recombinant mouse IL12 (2 ng/mL) (Peprotech) for 2 days, before washing out of activation media and splitting cells daily into fresh media containing IL-2 (20 ng/mL) at a density of 0.3 million/mL.</p>
<p>For co-culture experiments Ly5.1+ WT and Pim dKO (Ly5.2+) cell suspensions were mixed in a 50:50 ratio based on total T cell numbers before activation. A portion of the mixed naïve T cells maintained in recombinant mouse IL-7 (5 ng/mL, Peprotech) to verify baseline T cell ratios over time in culture.</p>
<p>For experiments where a pure CD8+ CTL population were required from non-TCR transgenic mice (adoptive transfer, proteomics and RNAseq experiments), CD4 T cells were depleted on day 3 of CTL cultures (i.e. 24 hours after being washed out of initial activation conditions) by negative magnetic selection. T cells were resuspended in MACS buffer (PBS, 1mM EDTA, 2%FBS) at 10<sup>8</sup>/mL, blocked with 50 µL/mL Rat Serum, incubated for 10 min with anti-CD4 biotin antibody (5 µg/mL, Biolegend), incubated for 5 min with 125 µL/mL RapidSphere beads (StemCell Technologies), then volume topped up to 2.5 mL and placed in EasySep magnet for 2.5 min. Supernatant containing CD8 T cells was collected and returned to culture as per CTL protocol above. CD4 T cell depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry, with CD4+ cells making up &lt;0.4% of live cells.</p>
<p>In experiments where cytokine was withdrawn T cells were washed at least twice with warm complete medium. Where indicated CTL were treated with 100 nM Tofacitinib (Selleckchem), 20 nM of rapamycin (Merck), 20 ng/mL PDBu (Cell Signaling Technologies) and ionomycin 500 ng/mL (Merck) or the pan PIM kinase inhibitors PIM447 (1 or 5 µM as indicated) and AZD1208 (1 or 10 µM as indicated) (both Medchemexpress).</p>

<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Flow cytometry data was acquired on a FACSVerse using FACSuite software, FACSCanto, or LSR II Fortessa with FACS DIVA software (BD Biosciences) or Novocyte (Acea Biosciences Inc.) with NovoExpress software (Agilent). Data was analysed using Flowjo software version 9.9.6 or version 10.6.1 and above (Treestar).</p>
<p>Cell surface staining antibodies conjugated to BV421, BV510, V500, FITC, PE, PerCPCy5.5, PECy7, APC, A647 and APCeF780 were obtained from BD Biosciences, eBioscience or Biolegend. Fc receptors were blocked using Fc block (BD Biosciences). Antibody staining for surface markers was performed at 1:200 in PBS 1%FBS. Antibody clones were as follows: CD4 (RM4-5), CD8 (53–6.7), CD25 (7D4 or PC61), CD44 (IM7), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104), CD62L (MEL-14), CD69 (H1.2F), CD71 (RI7217), TCRbeta (H57-597).</p>
<p>For IFNγ and Granzyme B intracellular staining cells were fixed and permeabilised using eBioscience Intracellular Fixation and Permeabilisation kit (eBioscience) as per manufacturer instructions. Cells were stained with anti-IFNγ (XMG1.2) and anti-Granzyme B (NGZB) at 1:100 and 1:200 respectively. For intracellular IFNγ staining GolgiPlug (BD) was added to the culture 4 hours prior to analysis.</p>
<p>For intracellular phospho S6 staining cells were fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C and permeabilised with ice cold 90% methanol. Cells were stained at 1:100 with anti-phospho S6 ribosomal protein (Ser235/236) Alexa Fluor 647 (D57.2.2E, Cell Signaling Technologies cat#4851S).</p>
<p>For intracellular phospho-STAT5 staining cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and permeabilised with ice cold 90% methanol. Cells were stained at 1:200 with rabbit anti-phospho STAT5 (Y694) (C11C5, Cell Signaling Technologies cat#9359S) followed by anti-rabbit IgG Fab2 Alexa Fluor 647 (Cell Signaling Technologies cat#4414S).</p>
<p>For intracellular PDCD4 staining cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and permeabilised with Perm Buffer (eBioscience, cat# 00-8333-56). Cells were stained at 1:100 with rabbit anti-PDCD4 (D29C6, Cell Signaling Technologies cat#9535S) followed by anti-rabbit IgG Fab2 Alexa Fluor 647 (Cell Signaling Technologies cat#4414S).</p>

<title>Cell sorting</title>
<p>Cell sorting was performed on a Sony SH800S cell sorter (Sony Biotechnology). Staining was performed in PBS 1% FBS and sorting and collection of cells for proteomics analysis was performed in RPMI 1640 containing glutamine, supplemented with 1% FBS. 24 hour TCR activated WT and Pim dKO CD4 and CD8 T cells were sorted as: DAPI-CD69+ CD8+ or CD4+. Cells were washed twice with HBSS (no calcium, no magnesium, no phenol red, GIBCO) before being snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further processing.</p>

<title>CTL number estimation and viability</title>
<p>Absolute CD8 T cell number per well/flask and % live cells was assessed in CTL cultures by volumetric measurement of cell number from 50 µL culture medium. Cells were transferred into 450 µL PBS containing low concentration anti-CD8, anti-CD4 antibody (both 1:1500) and DAPI (1 µg/mL, Thermofisher Scientific) or propidium iodide (0.2 µg/mL, Sigma) and cell number and viability assessed on either FACSVerse or Novocyte flow cytometers. Estimated live cell counts were corrected for assay dilution ratio, total culture volume and splitting ratios for each time point. Proportions of CD8 T cells that were Ly5.1+ or Ly5.2+ from parallel surface staining were used to calculate WT and Pim dKO numbers respectively in co-culture experiments.</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>CTV proliferation assay</title>
<p>For CTV proliferation assay, lymph node suspensions at 10<sup>7</sup> cells per mL in PBS 0.5%FCS were labelled with 5 µM CTV (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37°C before reaction was quenched and cells washed with cold medium. 10<sup>5</sup> live cells were activated with αCD3/αCD28 (both 0.5 µg/mL) or maintained in IL-7 (5 ng/mL) +/-rapamycin (20 nM) in 200 µL total volume in 96 well flat-bottomed plates. Propidium iodide (0.2 µg/mL), low dose αCD4, αCD8 antibody (both 1:3200 final concentration) and 10,000 sphero rainbow beads (BD) were added to wells prior to analysis of beads number, cell number, cell viability, CD4 and CD8 T cell composition and CTV profile of samples by flow cytometry. The ratio between the known number of beads added to the number of beads measured per well was multiplied with the number of cells measured to calculate the absolute cell number per well. Cell number per division was then corrected for the effect of expansion by dividing cell number per division by 2^division number and the arithmetic mean division number calculated from these values.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>Protein synthesis assay</title>
<p>To assess protein synthesis cells were cultured with 20 µM O-propargyl puromycin (OPP, Jena Bioscience) for 10 min. Control cells were cultured with cycloheximide (100 µg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min prior to addition of OPP to assess background staining level when cytosolic protein synthesis is completely inhibited. Cells were washed, fixed with 1% PFA, permeabilised with 0.5% Triton x-100 and OPP incorporation into newly synthesised peptides was measured by conjugating with Alexa647-azide via a Click-IT chemistry reaction (2 µM Alexa-647-azide, 2 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM ascorbic acid in PBS) (Invitrogen) and assessing fluorescence by flow cytometry.</p>

<sec id="s4h">
<title>Adoptive Transfer</title>
<p>WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells were activated and expanded in IL-2 as described above. On day 6 of culture WT and Pim dKO CTL were labelled with either CTV, or 5 µM CFSE (Invitrogen) as per CTV assay protocol described above, with the exception that labelling was performed in RPMI 1640 and CFSE labelling was for 10 min. CTV and CFSE labelling was alternated between genotypes across biological replicates to prevent any potential introduction of bias due to possible differences in dye toxicity. Labelled WT and Pim dKO CD8 T cells were mixed in a 50:50 ratio and 5 million cells/mouse were adoptively transferred via intravenous tail injection into C57BL/6 recipient mice. Recipient mice were sacrificed and blood, spleen and lymph nodes (axillary, brachial and inguinal) removed 4 and 23 hours post-transfer and the ratio of CTV to CFSE cells assessed by flow cytometry.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM TCEP, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche)) at 20 million T cells/mL at 4 °C. Lysates were sonicated, centrifuged 12 min, 13,000 rpm, 4°C. Supernatant was transferred to fresh tube and NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (1×) (Life Technologies) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 25mM, Thermofisher) was added before boiling samples at 100°C for 3 min. Samples were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 4-12% gradient precast gels (ThermoFisher) or 12% polyacrylamide running gel), and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman). Equal cell numbers (∼140,000 cells) were loaded per lane. Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies: S6K (5G10, Cell Signaling Technology, cat# 2217S), S6K p-T389 (108D2, Cell Signaling Technology, cat# 9234S), STAT5 p-Y694 (C11C5, Cell Signalling Technology, cat# 9359S), Pim1 (12H8, Santa Cruz, cat# SC-13513 ), Pim2 (1D12, Santa Cruz, cat# SC-13514). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies were used to assess protein signal (Thermo Scientific, Cell Signaling Technologies). Chemiluminescence was measured using an Odyssey Fc Imaging System (Licor) and Image Studio Software (LI-COR) was used to quantify chemiluminescence.</p>

For chromatography buffers were as follows: HPLC buffer A (0.1% formic acid), HPLC buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.08% formic acid) and HPLC buffer C (0.1% formic acid). Peptides were loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap100 nanoViper C18 trap column (100 µm inner diameter, 2 cm; Thermo Scientific) in HPLC buffer C with a constant flow of 10 µl/min. After trap enrichment, peptides were eluted onto an EASY-Spray PepMap RSLC nanoViper, C18, 2 µm, 100 Å column (75 µm, 50 cm; Thermo Scientific) using the buffer gradient: 2% B (0 to 6 min), 2% to 35% B (6 to 130 min), 35% to 98% B (130 to 132 min), 98% B (132 to 152 min), 98% to 2% B (152 to 153 min), and equilibrated in 2% B (153 to 170 min) at a flow rate of 0.3 µl/min. The eluting peptide solution was automatically electrosprayed using an EASY-Spray nanoelectrospray ion source at 50° and a source voltage of 1.9 kV (Thermo Scientific) into the Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro; Thermo Scientific). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode. Full-scan MS survey spectra (mass/charge ratio, 335 to 1800) in profile mode were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000. Data were collected using data-dependent acquisition: the 15 most intense peptide ions from the preview scan in the Orbitrap were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (normalized collision energy, 35%; activation Q, 0.250; activation time, 10 ms) in the LTQ after the accumulation of 5000 ions. Precursor ion charge state screening was enabled, and all unassigned charge states as well as singly charged species were rejected. The lock mass option was enabled for survey scans to improve mass accuracy. (Using Lock Mass of 445.120024)”.</p>

Peptides were injected onto a nanoscale C18 reverse-phase chromatography system (UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano, Thermo Scientific) then electrosprayed into an Orbitrap Exploris 480 Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). For liquid chromatography buffers were as follows: buffer A (0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v). Sample were loaded at 10 μL/min onto a trap column (100 μm × 2 cm, PepMap nanoViper C18 column, 5 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The trap column was washed for 3 min at the same flow rate with 0.1% TFA then switched in-line with a Thermo Scientific, resolving C18 column (75 μm × 50 cm, PepMap RSLC C18 column, 2 μm, 100 Å). The peptides were eluted from the column at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min with a linear gradient from 3% buffer B to 6% buffer B in 5 min, then from 6% buffer B to 35% buffer B in 115 min, and finally to 80% buffer B within 7 min. The column was then washed with 80% buffer B for 4 min and re-equilibrated in 3% buffer B for 15 min. Two blanks were run between each sample to reduce carry-over. The column was kept at a constant temperature of 40°C.</p>

For the protein and peptide searches we generated a hybrid database consisting of all manually annotated mouse SwissProt entries, combined with mouse TrEMBL entries with protein level evidence available and a manually annotated homologue within the human SwissProt database as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Marchingo et al., 2020</xref>). For the 24 hour TCR activated data this was from the Uniprot release 2020_06, for the 24 hour PIM kinase inhibitor data this was from the Uniprot release 2019_08. Search parameters were as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Marchingo et al., 2020</xref>): “The following MaxQuant search parameters were used: protein N-terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation, glutamine to pyroglutamate, and glutamine and asparagine deamidation were set as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was selected as a fixed modification; Trypsin and LysC were selected as the enzymes with up to two missed cleavages permitted; the protein and PSM false discovery rate was set to 1%; matching of peptides between runs was switched off”.</p>
<p>Data filtering and protein copy number quantification was performed in the Perseus software package, version 1.6.6.0.

A maximum of two missed cleavages and minimum peptide length of 7 amino acids was selected. Carbamidomethyl of cysteine was selected as a fixed modification while protein n-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were selected as variable modifications. Manufacturer default settings were used for identification, with protein and precursor q-value set to 0.01 using default decoy strategy. For quantification settings, the MS-Level quantity was set to ‘MS2’, major group Top N and minor group Top N were set as ‘False’ and profiling was set as ‘False’.

RNAseq data was first combined with proteomics data based on UniProt ID. Proteins that didn’t receive an initial match, were then combined by matching MGI ID values, then if still unmatched by MGI symbol. Data combinations were manually checked for obvious mis-annotations. Proteins with no corresponding mRNA identified or vice versa were excluded from the combined data file. In a few instances multiple proteins aligned to a single mRNA measurement or multiple mRNA aligned to a single protein measurement. For the purposes of this broad examination of how differences in expression at the protein or mRNA level these results were also excluded from the combined data table and subsequent analysis.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study, as PIM1/2 control of protein synthesis in differentiated cells has implications beyond T cells. The evidence is <bold>convincing</bold> in that it makes extensive use of the mouse knockout model and validation in mouse T cells with inhibitors. A rescue experiment in mouse KO T cells would be even stronger than the inhibitor studies to validate the KO phenotype and the evidence would be truly impressive if the results from the rescue experiment support the working model.

<p>Summary and Strengths:</p>
<p>The study focuses on PIM1 and 2 in CD8 T cell activation and differentiation. These two serine/threonine kinases belong to a large network of Serine/Threonine kinases that acts following engagement of the TCR and of cytokine receptors and phosphorylates proteins that control transcriptional, translational and metabolic programs that result in effector and memory T cell differentiation. The expression of PIM1 and PIM2 is induced by the T-cell receptor and several cytokine receptors. The present study capitalized on high-resolution quantitative analysis of the proteomes and transcriptomes of Pim1/Pim2-deficient CD8 T cells to decipher how the PIM1/2 kinases control TCR-driven activation and IL-2/IL-15-driven proliferation, and differentiation into effector T cells.</p>
<p>
Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of naïve OT1 CD8 T cell stimulated with their cognate peptide showed that the PIM1 protein was induced within 3 hours of TCR engagement and its expression was sustained at least up to 24 hours. The kinetics of PIM2 expression was protracted as compared to that of PIM1. Such TCR-dependent expression of PIM1/2 correlated with the analysis of both Pim1 and Pim2 mRNA. In contrast, Pim3 mRNA was only expressed at very low levels and the PIM3 protein was not detected by mass spectrometry. Therefore, PIM1 and 2 are the major PIM kinases in recently activated T cells. Pim1/Pim2 double knockout (Pim dKO) mice were generated on a B6 background and found to express a lower number of splenocytes. No difference in TCR/CD28-driven proliferation was observed between WT and Pim dKO T cells over 3 days in culture. Quantitative proteomics of &gt;7000 proteins further revealed no substantial quantitative or qualitative differences in protein content or proteome composition. Therefore, other signaling pathways can compensate for the lack of PIM kinases downstream of TCR activation.</p>
<p>Considering that PIM1 and PIM2 kinase expression is regulated by IL-2 and IL-15, antigen-primed CD8 T cells were expanded in IL-15 to generate memory phenotype CD8 T cells or expanded in IL-2 to generate effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Analysis of the survival, proliferation, proteome, and transcriptome of Pim dKO CD8 T cells kept for 6 days in IL-15 showed that PIM1 and PIM2 are dispensable to drive the IL-15-mediated metabolic or differentiation programs of antigen-primed CD8 T cells. Moreover, Pim1/Pim2-deficiency had no impact on the ability of IL-2 to maintain CD8 T cell viability and proliferation. However, WT CTL downregulated the expression of CD62L whereas the Pim dKO CTL sustained higher CD62L expression. Pim dKO CTL was also smaller and less granular than WT CTL. Comparison of the proteome of day 6 IL-2 cultured WT and Pim dKO CTL showed that the latter expressed lower levels of the glucose transporters, SLC2A1 and SLC2A3, of a number of proteins involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, and CTL effector proteins such as granzymes, perforin, IFNg, and TNFa. Parallel transcriptomics analysis showed that the reduced expression of perforin and some granzymes correlated with a decrease in their mRNA whereas the decreased protein levels of granzymes B and A, and the glucose transporters SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 did not correspond with decreased mRNA expression. Therefore, PIM kinases are likely required for IL-2 to maximally control protein synthesis in CD8 CTL. Along that line, the translational repressor PDCD4 was increased in Pim dKO CTL and pan-PIM kinase inhibitors caused a reduction in protein synthesis rates in IL-2-expanded CTL. Finally, the differences between Pim dKO and WT CTL in terms of CD62L expression resulted in Pim dKO CTL but not WT CTL retained the capacity to home to secondary lymphoid organs. In conclusion, this thorough and solid study showed that the PIM1/2 kinases shape the effector CD8 T cell proteomes rather than transcriptomes and are important mediators of IL2-signalling and CD8 T cell trafficking.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using a suite of techniques (e.g., RNA seq, proteomics, and functional experiments ex vivo) this paper extensively focuses on the role of PIM1/2 kinases during CD8 T-cell activation and cytokine-driven (i.e., IL-2 or IL-15) differentiation. The authors' key finding is that PIM1/2 enhances protein synthesis in response to IL-2 stimulation, but not IL-15, in CD8+ T cells. Loss of PIM1/2 made T cells less 'effector-like', with lower granzyme and cytokine production, and a surface profile that maintained homing towards secondary lymphoid tissue. The cytokines the authors focus on are IL-15 and Il-2, which drive naïve CD8 T cells towards memory or effector states, respectively. Although PIM1/2 are upregulated in response to T-cell activation and cytokine stimulation (e.g., IL-15, and to a greater extent, IL-2), using T cells isolated from a global mouse genetic knockout background of PIM1/2, the authors find that PIM1/2 did not significantly influence T-cell activation, proliferation, or expression of anything in the proteome under anti-CD3/CD28 driven activation with/without cytokine (i.e., IL-15) stimulation ex vivo. This is perhaps somewhat surprising given PIM1/2 is upregulated, albeit to a small degree, in response to IL-15, and yet PIM1/2 did not seem to influence CD8+ T cell differentiation towards a memory state. Even more surprising is that IL-15 was previously shown to influence the metabolic programming of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, suggesting cell-type specific effects from PIM kinases. What the authors went on to show, however, is that PIM1/2 KO altered CD8 T cell proteomes in response to IL-2. Using proteomics, they saw increased expression of homing receptors (i.e., L-selectin, CCR7), but reduced expression of metabolism-related proteins (e.g., GLUT1/3 &amp; cholesterol biosynthesis) and effector-function related proteins (e.g., IFNy and granzymes). Rather neatly, by performing both RNA-seq and proteomics on the same IL-2 stimulated WT vs. PIM1/2 KO cells, the authors found that changes at the proteome level were not corroborated by differences in RNA uncovering that PIM1/2 predominantly influence protein synthesis/translation. Effectively, PIM1/2 knockout reduced the differentiation of CD8+ T cells towards an effector state. In vivo adoptive transfer experiments showed that PIM1/2KO cells homed better to secondary lymphoid tissue, presumably owing to their heightened L-selectin expression (although this was not directly examined).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, I think the paper is scientifically good, and I have no major qualms with the paper. The paper as it stands is solid, and while the experimental aim of this paper was quite specific/niche, it is overall a nice addition to our understanding of how serine/threonine kinases impact T cell state, tissue homing, and functionality. Of note, they hint towards a more general finding that kinases may have distinct behaviour in different T-cell subtypes/states. I particularly liked their use of matched RNA-seq and proteomics to first suggest that PIM1/2 kinases may predominantly influence translation (then going on to verify this via their protein translation experiment - although I must add this was only done using PIM kinase inhibitors, not the PIM1/2KO cells). I also liked that they used small molecule inhibitors to acutely reduce PIM1/2 activity, which corroborated some of their mouse knockout findings - this experiment helps resolve any findings resulting from potential adaptation issues from the PIM1/2 global knockout in mice but also gives it a more translational link given the potential use of PIM kinase inhibitors in the clinic. The proteomics and RNA seq dataset may be of general use to the community, particularly for analysis of IL-15 or IL-2 stimulated CD8+ T cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It would be good to perform some experiments in human T cells too, given the ease of e.g., the small molecule inhibitor experiment. Would also be good for the authors to include a few experiments where PIM1/2 have been transduced back into the PIM1/2 KO T cells, to see if this reverts any differences observed in response to IL-2 - although the reviewer notes that the timeline for altering primary T cells via lentivirus/CRISPR may be on the cusp of being practical such that functional experiments can be performed on day 6 after first stimulating T cells. Other experiments could also look at how PIM1/2 KO influences the differentiation of T cell populations/states during ex vivo stimulation of PBMCs or in vivo infection models using (high-dimensional) flow cytometry (rather than using bulk proteomics/RNA seq which only provide an overview of all cell combined). Alongside this, performing a PCA of bulk RNA seq/proteomes or Untreated vs. IL-2 vs. IL-15 of WT and PIM1/2 knockout T cells would help cement their argument in the discussion about PIM1/2 knockout cells being distinct from a memory phenotype.</p>
