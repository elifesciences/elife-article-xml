<title>Abstract</title><p>An animal’s survival hinges on its ability to integrate past information to modify future behavior. The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> adapts its behavior based on prior experiences with pathogen exposure, transitioning from attraction to avoidance of the pathogen. A systematic screen for the neural circuits that integrate the information of previous pathogen exposure to modify behavior has not been feasible because of the lack of tools for neuron type specific perturbations. We overcame this challenge using methods based on compressed sensing to efficiently determine the roles of individual neuron types in learned avoidance behavior. Our screen revealed that distinct sets of neurons drive exit from lawns of pathogenic bacteria and prevent lawn re-entry. Using calcium imaging of freely behaving animals and optogenetic perturbations, we determined the neural dynamics that regulate one key behavioral transition after infection: stalled re-entry into bacterial lawns. We find that key neuron types govern pathogen lawn specific stalling but allow the animal to enter nonpathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> lawns. Our study shows that learned pathogen avoidance requires coordinated transitions in discrete neural circuits and reveals the modular structure of this complex adaptive behavioral response to infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Animals use past experiences to modify future behavior, and this behavioral plasticity is essential for an animal’s fitness and survival. Previous studies suggest that small sets of neurons, such as those in the mushroom bodies of flies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> or in the human hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, can play pivotal roles in integrating information from prior experiences and using it to influence subsequent behavior. Identification of these key neurons represents a crucial step towards understanding both the neural and molecular mechanisms responsible for encoding experiences and modulating behavior.</p>
<p>Despite its small nervous system, the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> displays a robust capacity to modify its behavior based on experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. One example of this is learned pathogen avoidance. Worms are initially attracted to pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (strain PA14). However, after several hours of exposure, animals associate infection with PA14 specific cues and change their behavior to avoid these bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This behavioral transition reduces the chance of infection and thus increases the worm’s odds of survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. How does the worm’s nervous system encode this pathogen experience and use this information to change behavior? Previous studies uncovered a range of sensory cues that govern the worm’s behavioral transition, ranging from chemosensory cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and the worm’s innate immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> to mechanosensory inputs arising from the bacteria’s biofilm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Olfactory stimuli have also been implicated in learned pathogen avoidance through serotonin modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The underlying neural circuits that encode information about past experiences and their dynamics remain unknown despite this. One strategy to find such neurons would be to carry out a comprehensive screen of the nervous system. However, such a screen is technically challenging due to the lack of neuron subtype-specific promoters and the necessity of systematic timed perturbations of neural activity during pathogen exposure to disrupt the animal’s ability to learn to avoid pathogens in the future.</p>
<p>To discover neurons whose activity patterns governed experience-dependent pathogen avoidance, we performed a comprehensive screen of the nervous system using a compressed sensing based approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> that overcomes these technical challenges. Through this screen, we discovered that the behavioral transition from attraction to avoidance of PA14 involves transitions in two subbehaviors - exit from the bacterial lawn and lawn re-entry. We found that distinct sets of neurons regulate each subbehavior. In particular, the aversion to re-entry is controlled by two neuronal types, AIY and SIA, which encode pathogen exposure through sustained downregulation of neural activity. Our data further indicated that AIY regulates PA14 specific aversion, and drives stalling at the edge of the pathogenic lawn. Finally, we used the identification of neural substrates of learned pathogen avoidance to explore how long-term changes in neural dynamics might be mediated by neuropeptide signaling between critical neurons that govern transitions in this behavior.</p>

<title>Prior pathogen exposure alters two behavioral modules to generate learned pathogen avoidance</title>
<p>Infection of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> by pathogenic bacteria elicits learned pathogen avoidance behavior.

To obtain high-resolution measurements of learned pathogen avoidance behavior, we monitored animals that had been placed on a lawn of pathogenic PA14 for 18 hours. We counted the fraction of animals that remained on the lawn over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) at 30min intervals. Within eight hours, half of the animals changed their foraging behavior and left the lawn of pathogenic bacteria. By contrast, nearly all the animals placed on a control lawn of non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (OP50) bacteria remained on the lawn during 18 hours of monitoring (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>The fractional occupancy of worms on a bacterial lawn is affected in principle by two processes - lawn exit and lawn re-entry. We determined how PA14 exposure affected each of these processes. After four hours in the presence of pathogen, the rate constant for the lawn exit (exits per animal per hour) increased dramatically from zero and reached a plateau of roughly 1 exit event per worm-hour after ten hours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We observed that worms that left lawns of pathogen after 10-16 hours of exposure repeatedly attempted to return to the lawn but stalled for long periods upon contact with the lawn edge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We quantified this re-entry defect by measuring the latency to re-entry, <italic>i.e.,</italic> the delay between first contact with the lawn and re-entry of the animal into the lawn. Animals that had been exposed to pathogen for short periods rapidly re-entered the lawn after an exit with latencies of only a few seconds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). After five hours of exposure to pathogen, the latency of re-entry began to increase and after twelve hours of exposure the mean latency to re-entry was 36.7±3.5 mins(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Increases in lawn-leaving rates and latency to re-entry were correlated and coincided with the observed evacuation of the lawn of pathogenic bacteria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>To demonstrate that the experience of pathogen exposure was driving the observed changes in behavior, as opposed to some change in the bacterial lawn caused by foraging animals, we exposed animals to pathogenic PA14 for 15 hours, collected those that had left the lawn, and then compared the latency of lawn entry of this cohort to the latencies of a cohort of naive animals that had not experienced pathogen. Naive worms rapidly entered a fresh lawn of pathogen whereas experienced worms displayed increased latency of entry into such fresh lawns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-G</xref>). These results indicated that pathogen exposure changed the internal state of the worm to drive the observed behavioral transition from re-entering the law rapidly to stalled re-entry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p>

<title>A compressed sensing based optogenetic screen to identify neurons that function in learned pathogen avoidance</title>
<p>We next sought to identify neurons that regulate interactions of <italic>C. elegans</italic> with lawns of pathogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Conventional approaches to identifying neurons required for a <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior involve targeting individual neuron types by microablation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> or optogenetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. These approaches are time-consuming and can require the generation of large numbers of transgenic lines to individually interrogate specific neuron types for their role in a given behavior.</p>
<p>We previously showed that an optogenetic screen for neurons that drive a behavior can be performed more efficiently using multiplexed optogenetic manipulations of neurons followed by a compressed sensing analysis to infer individual key neuron types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We performed a compressed sensing based screen using a panel of 29 transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic> lines, each expressing the light-gated ion channel Archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch3) under a different promoter (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The panel used for this study, focused on inter neurons, and covered 54 classes of interneuron, 25 classes of sensory neuron, and 8 classes of motor neuron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. We optically inhibited neurons during the early stages of pathogen exposure when animals presumably associate pathogen-specific cues with sickness. We then monitored the subsequent dynamics of lawn leaving and re-entry. Animals were transferred to pathogenic lawns, given 1 hour to settle, and then illuminated for two hours with pulses of 525 nm green light (1sec on/off, 5mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) to inhibit neurons expressing Arch3 in that line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The behavior of these animals was then recorded for a total of 18 hours at 3min intervals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We performed the same measurements of matched controls that had not been fed the opsin cofactor all-trans retinal and were thus insensitive to photoinhibition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To quantify the effect of optogenetic inhibition on behavior, we calculated for each strain a differential retention index - the difference in the area between the temporal lawn occupancy curves of transgenic animals exposed to inhibitory light and a paired no-ATR control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Six strains showed significant changes in differential retention index after neural silencing compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Silencing neurons in these strains during the first two hours of pathogen exposure augmented lawn-leaving over the next 18 hours (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). These results indicated the existence of a neural mechanism that inhibits the association of pathogenicity with microbe-specific cues during the early stages (first two hours) of pathogen exposure.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Experimental protocol used to identify neurons that modulate long term changes in PA14 lawn evacuation dynamics. In each experiment, animals of one transgenic line expressing archaerhodopsin were placed onto a lawn of PA14 and allowed to settle for 1 hour (blue segment, in schematic).

<p>We next asked whether the accelerated pathogen avoidance observed upon neural silencing resulted from increased lawn exits, increased latency to re-entry, or both. Two Archaerhodopsin lines (P<italic>dop-2::Arch3</italic> and P<italic>mpz-1::Arch3</italic>) showed increased exit rates, while four lines (P<italic>flp-4::Arch3</italic>, P<italic>sams-5::Arch3</italic>, P<italic>ttx-3::Arch3</italic>, and P<italic>npr-4::Arch3</italic>,) did not show changes in exit rates upon inhibition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). Neural inhibition that increased lawn exit rates dramatically increased the number of tracks outside of the lawn (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). We next measured the effects of the early neural silencing on lawn re-entry. We found that four lines (P<italic>dop-2::Arch3</italic>, P<italic>npr-4::Arch3</italic>, P<italic>sams-5::Arch3</italic> and P<italic>ttx-3::Arch3</italic>) showed significant increases in latency to re-entry in response to activation of Archaerhodopsin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F,G</xref>). For example, the inhibition of the P<italic>npr-4::Arch3</italic> line over the first two hours of the experiment dramatically decreased lawn re-entry over the entire time course, resulting in worm trajectories stalling at the lawn edge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). These results indicated that inhibition of neurons during an early phase of learned pathogen avoidance could cause long-term changes in aversion to pathogenic bacteria through modulating distinct behaviors.</p>

<title>A small set of neurons influences the encoding of the memory of pathogen exposure</title>
<p>We next sought to identify specific neurons that influence learned pathogen avoidance. To identify neurons that control specific behaviors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), one usually thinks of perturbing <italic>N</italic> neurons of the nervous system one at a time. These measurements can be visualized as an <italic>N</italic> × <italic>N</italic> set of equations, which can be easily solved to give the relative contribution of each neuron to the phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). This approach requires as many measurements as the number of neurons being characterized. Utilizing a compressed sensing based approach, we can instead formulate our optogenetic screen results as an underdetermined set of equations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="588911v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

<p>We evaluated the phenotype vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="588911v1_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for the two behaviors of interest by quantifying the changes to the dynamics of re-entry and exit from the lawns of pathogen. For both exit and re-entry, we calculated differences between optogenetically inhibited and non-inhibited worms for each transgenic line that showed statistically significant effects of inhibition. For lawn exit, the phenotype was the increase in the rate constant of exit due to neural inhibition. For re-entry, the phenotype was the difference between the latency in re-entry caused by neural inhibition. Lines that did not show significant behavioral changes in response to inhibition were assigned a phenotype value of zero.</p>
<p>We inferred neural weights <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="588911v1_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> from our matrix equation using Lasso regression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, which allowed us to solve the underdetermined set of linear equations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="588911v1_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> while simultaneously imposing sparsity constraints on the weight vector by minimizing the sum of the mean squared error <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="588911v1_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and the L1 norm of the solutions, thus minimizing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="588911v1_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> where <italic>λ</italic> is the sparsity parameter. Using this approach, we inferred a set of candidate neurons for lawn exit and lawn re-entry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,E</xref>). We focused primarily on neurons governing lawn re-entry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). For lawn re-entry, 4 key neurons were inferred over a wide range of sparsity parameters: AVK, SIA, AIY and MI. Some neurons were assigned negative weights by this analysis (suggesting that their inhibition promotes lawn re-entry). However, the contributions of these neurons decreased as the sparsity parameter increased, suggesting that these neurons were less important (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Compressed-sensing analysis of lawn-exit behavior identified contributions from six neuron classes to this behavior: CEPs, HSNs, RIAs, RIDs, and SIAs. Some of these neurons have previously been implicated in lawn retention or dwelling. RIAs are required for learned avoidance of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> lawns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. CEPs and HSNs are also known to promote dwelling on bacterial lawns through release of dopamine and serotonin, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Notably, this analysis suggested that the neural circuit governing lawn-exits is distinct from the neural circuit governing re-entry.</p>
<p>We next performed several tests to determine the robustness of our solutions, focusing on lawn re-entry behavior. To determine whether variation in archaerhodopsin expression might affect identification of neurons that govern this behavior, we tested the solutions to corrupted versions of the measurement matrix. The four neurons AVK, SIA, AIY, and MI were robustly identified regardless of matrix corruption (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). We next tested whether random removal of promoters would alter our solutions, <italic>i.e.,</italic> whether a small subset of strains was driving the identification of neurons. Neuron identification was robust to removal of up to 5 of the 29 promoters (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Finally, we determine false-positive and false-negative rates for compressed sensing based inference (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>), as well as the recovery rate and true positive rate for each of the four neurons (AVK, SIA, AIY and MI) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B-E</xref>). While all 4 neurons identified have high recovery rates, MI, SIA and AVK can have true recovery rates below 50%. Thus, we would expect at least one of these neurons to be a false positive. To directly test and determine the roles of the neurons implicated by compressed sensing, we next focused on measuring the activities from these neuron types in freely moving animals.</p>

<p>We tracked neurons in transgenic animals expressing the calcium sensor GCaMP6s in AVK, SIA, or AIY interneurons. Naive animals (pre-pathogen exposure) were imaged on an empty agar plate for approximately 40 minutes. These worms were then placed onto a PA14 lawn for 24 hours, recovered to an empty assay plate and imaged for approximately 40 minutes to determine how pathogen exposure affected neural activity. P<italic>npr-4::GCaMP6s</italic> was utilized to measure the activity of AVKs and SIAs, and P<italic>ttx-3::GCaMP6s</italic> was used to measure the activity of AIYs. We found that AIY (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref>), AVK (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F, G</xref>), and SIA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I, J</xref>) all showed reduced neural activity after pathogen exposure. These results were evident both in analyses of populations of animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, F, I</xref>), but were also clearly observed in individual worms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, F, I inset and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, G, J</xref>). Pathogen exposure had different effects on different interneurons. AIY neurons of naive animals showed a significant increase in calcium approximately 30 minutes after transfer to assay plates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). By contrast, AIY neurons of animals that had been exposed to pathogen remained quiescent. AVK and SIA neurons of naive animals displayed continuous high-frequency calcium signals. Post-exposure, AVKs and SIAs displayed long periods of quiescence. This data indicated that the activity of neurons that regulate a behavior critical for learned pathogen avoidance is strongly affected by exposure to pathogen. These neurons thus appear to encode the history of exposure to pathogenic bacteria in their neural activity state.</p>

<title>Modulation of candidate neurons validates their role in inhibition of pathogen lawn re-entry</title>
<p>We next tested how manipulating the activity of neurons identified by compressed sensing as regulators of lawn re-entry affects how naïve animals interact with bacterial lawns. We inhibited each of the three candidate neuron types using Archaerhodopsin and measured how acute neuronal inhibitions affected re-entry into a lawn of pathogen. We performed parallel measurements of a control set of worms that had not been treated with the opsin cofactor ATR. To target specific neurons, we used a DLP mirror array to restrict illumination to cells of interest as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We found that acute inhibition of AIY in naive animals increased the latency of re-entry onto pathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, mimicking the effect of prior pathogen exposure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). This effect was not the result of a general defect in locomotion or lawn-entry behavior; entry into lawns of non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> was not affected by AIY inhibition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Inhibition of AVK failed to produce any effect on re-entry behavior (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Inhibition of <italic>npr-4</italic>-expressing neurons also increased latency to lawn entry on PA14(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). To validate that this effect was due to SIA, we projected patterned light onto P<italic>npr-4:Arch3</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>) to selectively inhibit SIA/SIB. Inhibition of SIA using this method deterred entry of worms onto PA14 lawns (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>), resulting in increased latency in entry (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Overall, our results show that two out of the three key neurons identified by compressed sensing were able to elicit a change in lawn entry dynamics through inhibition. Together, our neural imaging and selective inhibition suggested that reduced activity of AIY, SIA, and SIB drive the reduction in lawn occupancy triggered by pathogen exposure.</p>

Animals that re-entered the lawn also rapidly exited the lawn. Thus, the increased re-entry rate did not result in sustained increases in lawn occupancy (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>After experiencing pathogenic bacteria, worms switch their foraging behavior and evacuate the bacterial lawn. We found that this learned pathogen avoidance behavior is driven in part by changes to lawn re-entry behavior. Unlike naive animals, which rapidly re-enter a lawn of pathogen after they exit, animals previously exposed to pathogen dramatically delay re-entry upon encountering the pathogenic bacteria lawn. Such contact-dependent pathogen aversion depends in a graded manner on the extent of pathogen exposure; the latency to lawn re-entry increases with increased time of pathogen exposure. Contact-dependent inhibition of lawn re-entry is a previously unappreciated behavioral response to pathogen exposure revealed by our study. This behavior is distinct from associative olfactory learning and modulation of chemotactic behaviors reported by other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In our study, continuous monitoring of worms exposed to pathogen revealed that animals that leave the pathogen lawn are capable of chemotaxis back to the lawn but stall upon contacting the lawn and do not re-enter. We further found that neurons previously identified as being important in aversive olfactory learning, e.g. AIB, RIA, AIZ and RIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, were not essential for control of lawn re-entry. Our study indicated that the transition in pathogen lawn re-entry behavior occurs through modulation of two key neurons, AIY and SIA, which both decrease their neural activity in response to pathogen exposure.</p>
<p>If contact-dependent lawn aversion represents a modality of pathogen aversion distinct from aversive olfactory learning, what sensory system governs this behavior? While we have yet to establish the signals involved in this process, some hints as to what might be responsible for this aversion can be inferred from looking at synaptic inputs to the neurons that we identified as key for this behavior. SIAs are connected to two sensory neurons that might play a role in driving neural activity changes following pathogen exposure – URX and CEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. URX is a potent regulator of foraging behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, is one of the few neurons with contact with the pseudocoelomic fluid of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and has been previously linked to regulation of metabolic signals and innate immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. CEPs mediate mechanosensory detection of bacteria and potently inhibit locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. By being downstream of these two neurons, SIA might integrate chemosensory and mechanosensory stimuli, two signals known to be important in modulating lawn evacuation from prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Other neurons that we identified-the AIYs - are part of the olfactory learning circuit and may thus represent a chemotactic component of this contact dependent pathogen aversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In addition, AIY acts as a central hub neuron that is downstream of multiple sensory neurons and may thus also act as an integrator for multiple sensory modalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Interestingly, investigation of molecular modulators of this aversion behavior by looking at neuropeptides that are highly and uniquely expressed in our neurons of interest reveals a candidate neuropeptide PDF-2 which is highly expressed in AIY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Knocking out PDF-2 increases contact dependent lawn avoidance (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B, C</xref>). PDF-2 has been implicated in gut to neuron signaling through the Rictor/TORC2 pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, suggesting a potential mechanism through which pathogen infection data could be communicated to AIY to influence PDF-2 signaling to modulate behavior.</p>
<p>One remarkable aspect of the neurons that control lawn aversion is the fact that early perturbation of these neurons (within the first one to three hours of the animal’s deposition on the pathogenic lawn) produce long term changes in pathogen avoidance behavior. Effects of this early neural inhibition could be seen in differences in lawn occupancy 15 hours later, suggesting that early suppression of neural activity patterns have long term consequences of behavior. How could SIA and AIY produce such long-term effects? One possible explanation is that reduction in AIY and SIA neural activity might serve as an internal cue. The reduction in activity could drive a bistable circuit including AIY and SIA, causing extended suppression of their activity and a long-term change in their neural activity patterns. This bistability could be accomplished through positive autoregulatory feedback. PDF-2, which appears to be involved in bacteria re-entry, might provide such a mechanism to provide this feedback mechanism. Both PDF-2 and its receptor PDFR-1 are expressed in AIY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, providing a potential feedback loop for bistability.</p>
<p>While contact dependent re-entry represents a novel form of pathogen aversion, it is not the only behavioral transition driving lawn evacuation. Using our compressed sensing based approach, we were able to rapidly assay the nervous system to not only discover the key neurons controlling entry, but also exit from the pathogen lawn. We find there is little overlap between the sets of neurons controlling these two subbehaviors. Consistent with this we were able to modulate the subbehavior independently. Together, these results suggest that neural control of lawn evacuation is highly modular, with different sets of neurons governing the individual behavioral transitions needed for lawn evacuation. This high degree of modularity in control over net pathogen aversion is similar to that seen in several forms of aversive olfactory learning of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in response to pathogenic bacteria. For example, imprinting of a memory of pathogenic bacteria in larvae stage worms requires distinct sets of neurons for the establishment of the memory and the expression of that memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, while aversive learning in adult worms carry distinct neural circuits for naïve versus learnt olfactory preference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Lawn evacuation assays</title>
<p>PA14 lawn evacuation assay plates were prepared as follows. PA14 was inoculated into LB media and allowed to grow for 15 hours without shaking at 37°C until culture reached an OD of 0.1 to 0.2. 5uL of this culture was then pipetted onto NGM Agar plates and the colonies were allowed to grow for 18 hours at room temperature. Each colony was surrounded by a ring of filter paper to prevent worms from escaping to the edges of the plate. OP50 lawn evacuation plates were prepared in the same manner as PA14 evacuation plates, however, OP50 bacteria was grown for 18 hours at 37°C with shaking. This longer growth period was used to roughly match the thickness of the PA14 and OP50 colonies.</p>

<p>Lawn exit rate was calculated by evaluating the number of exit events during the 2 hour timeframe of neural inhibition. Lawn evacuation movies were analyzed in 1 minute intervals and any exit events occurring (as defined by a worm completely leaving contact with the bacteria) were noted. The exit events per hour were calculated from this. Lawn entry timescale was also evaluated by measuring the time from first contact of the worm to the bacteria lawn to time of full entry of the worm onto the lawn.</p>

<title>GCAMP imaging and analysis</title>
<p>Calcium imaging was performed using a custom built microscope as previously described in past work at 15.625 frames per second. Worms were first imaged on an empty NGM plate for 40 minutes. Imaged worms were then transferred onto a colony of PA14 bacteria as used for the lawn evacuation assay and allowed to remain there for 24 hours. Following this, infected worms were imaged again for another 40 minutes.</p>
<p>GCaMP intensity information was extracted using custom software written in MATLAB to extract intensity data given segments encapsulating the neurons of interest. GCaMP imaging data was compiled for all imaged worms. Worm to worm variability in GCAMP expression was normalized by dividing all data by the bottom 5 percentile of fluorescence intensity in healthy worms. GCaMP data was smoothed over a 6 sec window.</p>

<title>Re-entry with neural activation</title>
<p>PA14 lawn evacuation plates were prepared as described above, and 10 ATR treated worms expressing channelrhodopsin-2 under the relevant promoters were seeded onto each colony. Channelrhodopsin was activated using 1mW/mm<sup>2</sup> blue light for 1 hour. Re-entry rate (defined as the rate at which worms fully entered the lawn) and contact rate were evaluated and quantified over this time.</p>

<title>Promoter removal and additions</title>
<p>The robustness of the solutions to removal of promoters was tested as follows. 1 to 5 promoters were removed from the measurement matrix at random. The resulting measurement matrix and phenotype vector were used to infer neuronal weights for the re-entry phenotype. This process was repeated 200 times for each of the 1 to 5 promoters, or 1000 times in total for 1 to 5 promoters. Our results demonstrated robustness of AIY, AVK, SIA and MI to these removals.</p>

<title>Robustness of solutions to corruption of measurement matrix</title>
<p>The robustness of the solutions to corruption of the measurement matrix was tested by randomly altering a small fraction of the measurement matrix and re-inferring the neural contributions. 10% of the non-zero entries in the measurement matrix were altered to a value between 0 and 0.5. 1000 such corrupted measurement matrices were generated and solutions to each corrupted matrix were inferred via Lasso regression. Our results demonstrated that corruption generally did not result in alteration of the inferred neurons, with AIY, AVK, MI and SIA robustly being inferred even with matrix corruption.</p>

<title>Calculation of inverse participation ratio and relative expression</title>
<p>Single cell RNA seq data from S. R. Taylor et al. was used to calculate the average expression of each neuropeptide within each neuron type. The relative expression of each of the neuropeptides in each neuron was calculated by dividing expression in each neuron by the maximum expression over all neurons. Inverse participation ratio (IPR) was calculated as:

<p>This study identifies two behavioral processes that underlie learned pathogen avoidance behavior in C. elegans: exiting and re-entry of pathogenic bacterial lawns. Long-term behavioral tracking indicates that animals increase the prevalence of both behaviors over long-term exposure to the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using an optogenetic silencing screen, the authors identify groups of neurons, whose activity regulates lawn occupancy. Surprisingly, they find that optogenetic inhibition of neurons during only the first two hours of pathogen exposure can establish subsequent long-term changes in pathogen aversion. By leveraging a compressed sensing approach, the authors define a set of neurons involved in either lawn exit or lawn re-entry behavior using a constrained set of transgenic lines that drive Arch-3 expression in overlapping groups of neurons. They then measure the calcium activity of the candidate neurons involved in lawn re-entry in freely moving animals using GCaMP, and observe a reduction in their neural activity after exposure to a pathogen. Optogenetic inhibition of AIY and SIA neurons during acute pathogen exposure in naïve animals delays lawn entry whereas activating these neurons in animals previously exposed to pathogen enhances lawn entry, albeit transiently.</p>
<p>This work is missing several controls that are necessary to substantiate their claims. My most important concern is that the optogenetic screen for neurons that alter pathogenic lawn occupancy does not have an accompanying control on non-pathogenic OP50 bacteria. Hence, it remains unclear whether these neuronal inhibition experiments lead to pathogen-specific or generalized lawn-leaving alterations. For strains that show statistical differences between - and + ATR conditions, the authors should perform follow-up validation experiments on non-pathogenic OP50 lawns to ensure that the observed effect is PA14-specific. Similarly, neuronal inhibition experiments in Figures 5E and H are only performed with naïve animals on PA14 - we need to see the latency to re-entry on OP50 as well, to make general conclusions about these neurons' role in pathogen-specific avoidance.</p>
<p>My second major concern is regarding the calcium imaging experiments of candidate neurons involved in lawn re-entry behavior. Although the data shows that AIY, AVK, and SIA/SIB neurons all show reduced activity following pathogen exposure, the authors do not relate these activity changes to changes in behavior. Given the well-established links between these cells and forward locomotion, it is essential to not only report differences in activity but also in the relationship between this activity and locomotory behavior. If animals are paused outside of the pathogen lawn, these neurons may show low activity simply because the animals are not moving forward. Other forward-modulated neurons may also show this pattern of reduced activity if the animals remain paused. Given that the authors have recorded neural activity before and after contact with pathogenic bacteria in freely moving animals, they should also provide an analysis of the relationship between proximity to the lawn and the activity of these neurons.</p>
<p>This work is missing methodological descriptions that are necessary for the correct interpretation of the results shown here. Figure 2 suggests that the determination of statistical significance across the optogenetic inhibition screen will be found in the Methods, but this information is not to be found there. At various points in the text, authors refer to &quot;exit rate&quot;, &quot;rate constant&quot;, and &quot;entry rate&quot;. These metrics seem derived from an averaged measurement across many individual animals in one lawn evacuation assay plate. However &quot;latency to re-entry&quot; is only defined on a per-animal basis in the lawn re-exposure assay. These differences should be clearly stated in the methods section to avoid confusion and to ensure that statistics are computed correctly.</p>
<p>This work also contains mislabeled graphs and incorrect correspondence with the text, which make it difficult to follow the authors 'claims. The text suggests that Pdop-2::Arch3 and Pmpz-1::Arch3 show increased exit rates, whereas Figure 2 shows that Pflp-4::Arch3 but not Pmpz-1::Arch3 has increased exit rate. The authors should also make a greater effort to correctly and clearly label which type of behavioral experiment is used to generate each figure and describe the differences in experimental design in the main text, figure legends, and methods. Figure 2E depicts trajectories of animals leaving a lawn over a 2.5-minute interval but it is unclear when this time window occurs within the 18-hour lawn leaving assay. Likewise, Figure 2H depicts a 30-minute time window which has an unclear relationship to the overall time course of lawn leaving. This figure legend is also mislabeled as &quot;Infected/Healthy&quot;, whereas it should be labeled &quot;-/+ ATR&quot;.</p>
<p>This work raises the interesting possibility that different sets of neurons control lawn exit and lawn re-entry behaviors following pathogen exposure. However, the authors never directly test this claim. To rigorously show this, the authors would need to show that lawn-exit-promoting neurons (CEPs, HSNs, RIAs, RIDs, SIAs) are dispensable for lawn re-entry behavior and that lawn re-entry promoting neurons (AVK, SIA, AIY, MI) are dispensable for lawn exit behavior in pathogen-exposed animals. The authors identify AVK neurons as important for modulating lawn re-entry behavior by brief inhibition at the start of pathogen exposure but fail to find that these neurons are required for increased latency to re-entry in naïve animals (Figure 5D). Recent work from Marquina-Solis et al (2024) shows that chronic silencing of these neurons delays pathogen lawn leaving, due to impaired release of flp-1 neuropeptide. Authors may wish to connect their work more closely with the existing literature by investigating the behavioral process by which AVK contributes to lawn evacuation.</p>
<p>If the authors work through these criticisms, this work can become an important contribution to the field of pathogen learning in C. elegans. However, in its current form, this work remains incomplete.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Hallacy et al. used a compressed sensing-based optogenetic screening method to investigate the crucial neurons that regulate pathogenic avoidance behavior in C. elegans. They further substantiate their findings using complementary optogenetic activation and imaging techniques to confirm the roles of the key neurons identified through extensive screening efforts. Notably, they identified AIY and SIA as pivotal neurons in the dynamic process of pathogenic avoidance. Their significant discovery is the delayed or stalled reentry process, which drives avoidance behavior; to my knowledge, this dynamic has not been previously documented. Additionally, the successful integration of quantitative optogenetic tools and compressed sensing algorithms is noteworthy, demonstrating the potential for obtaining highly quantitative data from the C. elegans nervous system. This approach is quite rare in this field, yet it represents a promising direction for studying this simple nervous system.</p>
<p>However, the paper's main weakness lies in its lack of a detailed mechanism explaining how the delayed reentry process directly influences the actual locomotor output that results in avoidance. The term 'delayed reentry' is used as a dynamic metric for quantifying the screening, yet the causal link between this metric and the mechanistic output remains unclear. Despite this, the study is well-structured, with comprehensive control experiments, and is very well constructed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using a compressed sensing-based approach applied previously by the author's group, the authors conducted an initial screen for neurons that when optogenetically down-regulated, influenced learned pathogen avoidance consisting of two component behaviors, exit from the bacterial lawn and lawn re-entry. Authors found that 4 classes of neurons AVK, SIA, AIY, and MI were inferred over a wide range of sparsity parameters, thereby indicating the importance of lawn re-entry. They found six classes of neurons required for lawn exit. The authors then went on to further analyze the neurons for the re-entry behavior, and conducted calcium imaging of those neurons in the freely behaving animals. They found that the activities of AIY and SIA neurons decreased after the animals that had been exposed to the pathogenic bacteria tried to re-enter the bacterial lawn. They also found that when those neurons of the animals that had not been exposed to pathogenic bacteria were downregulated by optogenetics, those operated animals increased the latency of the re-entry, which is a similar behavioral modification to that of the animals that had been exposed to the pathogen. Conversely, those neurons of the animals that were exposed to pathogenic bacteria were up-regulated by optogenetics, those animals showed a shortened latency of the re-entry, which is similar to the behavior observed in the animals not exposed to pathogen.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is overall a very nice piece of work. Most importantly, an initial screening of neurons was conducted by a compressed sensing-based approach previously applied by the same group. It is also worth emphasizing that this compressed analysis is applicable when the behavior of interest involves a small number of neurons, as the authors pointed out in the Introduction Session. Therefore, the readers should keep in mind that the validation and significance of this work heavily depend on the justification of scarcity parameters that the authors chose. Nevertheless, this work is well justified because neurons identified by the initial screening were thoroughly analyzed by various methods including calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulation of neuronal activities and behavioral analyses using an animal-tracking system.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My only concern is that the authors should be more careful about describing their &quot;compressed sensing-based approach&quot;. Authors often cite their previous Nature Methods paper, but should explain more because this method is critical for this manuscript. Also, this analysis is based on the hypothesis that only a small number of neurons are responsible for a given behavior. Authors should explain more about how to determine scarcity parameters, for example.</p>
