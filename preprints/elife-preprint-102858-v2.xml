<abstract>
<p>Microorganisms constantly transition between environments with dramatically different external osmolarities. However, theories of microbial osmoresponse integrating physical constraints and biological regulations are lacking. Here, we propose such a theory, utilizing the separation of timescales for passive responses and active regulations. We demonstrate that regulations of osmolyte production and cell-wall synthesis assist cells in coping with intracellular crowding effects and adapting to a broad range of external osmolarity. Furthermore, we predict a threshold value above which cells cannot grow, ubiquitous across bacteria and yeast. Intriguingly, the theory predicts a dramatic speedup of cell growth after an abrupt decrease in external osmolarity due to cell-wall synthesis regulation. Our theory rationalizes the unusually fast growth observed in fission yeast after an oscillatory osmotic perturbation, and the predicted growth rate peaks match quantitatively with experimental measurements. Our study reveals the physical basis of osmoresponse, yielding farreaching implications for microbial physiology.</p>

<body>
<p>Microbes constantly transition between environments with dramatically different osmolarities, a hallmark of microbial life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. One of the most essential features of walled microbial cells is the turgor pressure — the elastic stress stretching the cell wall due to osmotic imbalance. Upon a hypoosmotic shock (i.e., a sudden decrease of the external osmolarity), the turgor pressure increases immediately due to the sudden water influx. To relax the turgor pressure, the cell up-regulates the cell-wall synthesis rate, adds more materials to the peptidoglycan network, and eventually adapts to the lower external osmolarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Upon a hyperosmotic shock (i.e., a sudden increase of the external osmolarity), the cell volume of a microbial cell shrinks within milliseconds due to water efflux, leading to a decreased turgor pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. To increase the internal osmotic pressure, microorganisms increase their intracellular solute pool by amassing osmolyte molecules (i.e., osmoregulation), e.g., through <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The cell volume then restores progressively over time, and eventually, the cell adapts to the higher osmolarity. Intracellular crowding may act as a cell volume sensor to trigger osmoregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Meanwhile, intracellular crowding due to volume reduction inevitably affects the cellular physiology globally, e.g., slowing down protein diffusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] and reducing the elongation speed of translating ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Despite extensive knowledge regarding the molecular details of osmotic response pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], how intracellular crowding interferes with gene expression regulation and affects osmotic adaption remains an open question.</p>
<p>Interestingly, many features of microbial osmoresponses appear general across different organisms, suggesting a universal underlying mechanism. For example, it is widely observed that microbial cells can adapt to a broad range of external osmolarity, with the external osmotic pressure varying over an order of magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the growth rate in the steady state decreases as the external osmolarity increases and a complete arrest of cell growth occurs above a critical osmolarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Moreover, upon an osmotic shock, the growth rate usually does not approach the new steady-state value monotonically, e.g., an overshoot of growth rate often occurs upon a hypoosmotic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], and a damped oscillation of growth rate can happen after a hyperosmotic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. In recent experiments of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], an oscillatory osmotic shock was applied to cells during which cell volume growth was dramatically slowed down while biomass was still actively produced. Surprisingly, a supergrowth phase happened after removing the oscillatory osmotic shock, during which cells grew much faster than the steady state before the shocks.</p>
<p>In this work, we unify all these phenomena by a theory capturing the essential elements of osmoresponses: physical constraints (e.g., the crowding effects and osmotic imbalance) and biological regulation, including osmoregulation (i.e., regulation of the osmolyte-producing protein) and cell-wall synthesis regulation. Our model assumes the following phenomenological rules: (1) the change in free water volume within the cell is driven by osmotic imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], while the remaining volume changes in proportion to protein production; (2) osmoregulation influences the production of osmolyte-producing protein, governed by intracellular protein density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]; (3) cell-wall synthesis is regulated through a feedback mechanism, wherein turgor pressure modulates the efficiency of cell-wall synthesis, enabling the cell to maintain a relatively stable turgor pressure; and (4) intracellular crowding slows down biochemical reactions as cytoplasmic density increases, with reactions ceasing entirely when protein density reaches a critical threshold. Upon a hyperosmotic shock, cell volume reduction due to water efflux increases the protein density, inducing the up-regulation of osmolyte-producing protein but slowing down the translation speed due to crowding. Upon a hypoosmotic shock, the dramatic water influx stretches the cell wall, and the increased turgor pressure induces cell-wall synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>
<p>We remark that our model is coarse-grained, without including detailed molecular mechanisms, and is therefore applicable across diverse microbial species. Notably, the predicted steady-state growth rate as a function of internal osmotic pressure from our model aligns well with experimental data from diverse organisms. This alignment allows us to quantify the sensitivities of translation speed and regulation of osmolyte-producing protein in response to intracellular density. Additionally, we demonstrate that osmoregulation and cell-wall synthesis regulation enable cells to adapt to a wide range of external osmolarities and prevent plasmolysis. Our model also predicts a non-monotonic time dependence of growth rate and protein density as they approach steady-state values following a constant osmotic shock, in concert with experimental observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Moreover, we show that a supergrowth phase can arise following a sudden decrease in external osmolarity, driven by cell-wall synthesis regulation, either through the direct application of a hypoosmotic shock or the withdrawal of an oscillatory stimulus. Remarkably, the predicted amplitudes of supergrowth (i.e., growth rate peaks) quantitatively agree with multiple independent experimental measurements.</p>
<p>In the following “Results” section, we begin by outlining the primary assumptions and equations of our model in the subsection “Model Description,” which includes four parts, each addressing one of the four phenomenological rules. Additional details can be found in Methods. We then proceed to the subsection “Steady states in constant environments”, where we employ our theoretical framework to analyze steady-state growth and examine how the growth rate varies with external osmolarity. In the “Transient dynamics after a constant osmotic shock” subsection, we investigate the time-dependent osmoresponse after a constant hyperosmotic and hypoosmotic shock. Finally, in “Comparison with experiments: supergrowth phenomena after osmotic oscillation”, we address the supergrowth phenomena observed in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, utilizing our model to elucidate these experimental observations.</p>

<p>In the limit of an extreme hyperosmotic shock, the remaining cytoplasmic volume is comparable to the volume of expelled water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Thus, the total cytoplasmic volume must be divided into a free volume and a bound volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>],

<p>The free volume comes from the free water that is osmotically active, and the bound volume includes the bound water <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>bw</italic></sub> (i.e., water of macromolecular hydration) and the volume of dry mass <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>bd</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Because the fraction of protein mass in the total dry mass is typically constant and the volume of bound water is proportional to the dry mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], the bound volume is proportional to the total protein mass <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> through <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> = <italic>αm</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>. Here, <italic>α</italic> is a constant, and its values for some model organisms are included in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and its detailed calculations from experimental data are in Section B of Supplementary Material.</p>

<p>(A) The total cytoplasmic volume includes the free and bound volumes.

We model osmoregulation through the change of ribosome translation strategy. When the protein density increases, the fraction of ribosomes translating the osmolyte-producing protein <italic>χ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> is up-regulated, leading to the subsequent increase in the mass fraction of the osmolyte-producing protein <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>. The cell-wall synthesis process is controlled by the turgor pressure <italic>σ</italic>, which is proportional to the cell-wall strain <italic>ϵ</italic> = (<italic>V</italic> −<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub>)<italic>/V</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> .

where Π<sub><italic>in</italic></sub>, Π<sub><italic>out</italic></sub> are the internal (i.e., cytoplasmic) and external osmotic pressures, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Π<sub><italic>in</italic></sub> is proportional to the concentration of osmolyte molecules in the free volume: Π<sub><italic>in</italic></sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>TN</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub><italic>/V</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> where <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> is the number of osmolyte molecules, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> is the Boltzmann constant, and <italic>T</italic> is the temperature. For simplicity, we assume that the production speed of osmolyte molecules is proportional to the mass of osmolyte-producing protein (Methods). Here, we have replaced the difference of the hydrostatic pressures across the cell membrane with the turgor pressure <italic>σ</italic>, assuming that mechanical equilibrium is always satisfied. <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> is the filtration coefficient quantifying the water permeability of the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>
<p>The species of osmolytes involved in osmoregulation are diverse across different microorganisms and conditions; nevertheless, they are primarily small organic molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. In this work, we simplify the problem by considering a single species of osmolyte that dominates the internal osmotic pressure, e.g., glycerol in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] and glycine betaine in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], with the production speed proportional to the mass of the osmolyte-producing protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Methods).</p>
<p>To model gene expression regulation, we introduce <italic>χ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> and <italic>χ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> as the fractions of ribosomes translating the osmolyte-producing protein and ribosomal proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and Methods). In steady states, <italic>χ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> and <italic>χ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> are equal to the mass fractions of osmolyte-producing protein and ribosomal proteins in the total proteome, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> = <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>p</italic>,<italic>a</italic></sub><italic>/m</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> and <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>p</italic>,<italic>r</italic></sub><italic>/m</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. In this work, we assume that the dry-mass growth rate is proportional to the fraction of ribosomal proteins within the total proteome for simplicity, <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub><italic>m</italic><sub><italic>p</italic>,<italic>r</italic></sub><italic>/m</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub><italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>. This assumption leverages the fact that ribosomes are responsible for producing all proteins. The proportionality coefficient <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> encapsulates the efficiency of ribosomal activity, being proportional to the elongation speed of the ribosome. We remark that <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> is influenced by the crowding effect, which we address later. The growth rate of the cytoplasmic volume, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is a weighted average of the free-volume growth rate <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> and the dry-mass growth rate <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>.

</p>
<p>Here, <italic>f</italic> is the free volume fraction in the total cytoplasmic volume: <italic>f</italic> = <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> <italic>/V</italic> . In this work, we refer to the growth rate as the growth rate of cytoplasmic volume <italic>µ</italic> unless otherwise mentioned.</p>

<title>Osmoregulation</title>
<p>Experiments found that the reduction of growth rate as the external osmolarity increases is dominated by the reduction of the translation speed <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> instead of the ribosomal fraction <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Therefore, we assume that the fraction of ribosomes translating themselves <italic>χ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> is constant for simplicity. To model osmoregulation, we introduce a coupling between the fraction of ribosomes translating the osmolyte-producing protein <italic>χ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> and the degree of intracellular crowding. We quantify the crowding effects by the protein density, defined as <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub><italic>/V</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub>, which serves as a good proxy for the dry-mass density measured in the experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and the detailed discussion on the relations between the two densities in Section A of Supplementary Material) and propose the following relation:

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Here, the parameter <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> quantifies the sensitivity of osmoregulation to intracellular crowding. <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is the critical protein density above which intracellular processes are frozen, which we introduce later in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Eq. (8)</xref>. Therefore, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> represents the largest possible <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> since all intracellular dynamics is frozen when <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> <italic>&gt; ρ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>.

<p>Here, <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> is a coarse-grained parameter modeling the active regulation of cell-wall synthesis, which we refer to as the cell-wall synthesis efficiency in the following.</p>
<p>Experiments suggested that the turgor pressure induce cell-wall synthesis, e.g., through mechanosensors on cell membrane in <italic>S. pombe</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], by increasing the pore size of the peptidoglycan network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], and by accelerating the moving velocity of the cell-wall synthesis machinery in <italic>E. coi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Guided by these ideas, we model the effects of turgor pressure on the time-dependence of the cell-wall synthesis efficiency as

In the extreme case of plasmolysis, the insertion of newly synthesized cell wall materials is interrupted immediately due to the separation of the cell membrane and cell wall. Meanwhile, the up-regulation of cell-wall synthesis rate presumably takes a longer time. For example, in fungi, where polarized growth is generally adopted, the up-regulation of the cell-wall synthesis rate involves reorienting the polarisome complex to the growing tip, directing actin polarization, and delivering cell-wall synthesis machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>].

<title>Steady states in constant environments</title>
<p>When cell growth reaches a steady state, the proportions of all components, including free water volume, cell mass, and cell wall volume, must be constant relative to the total cell volume to ensure homeostasis. Therefore, all growth rates in steady states of cell growth must be the same: <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> = <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub>. The consequence of cell-wall synthesis regulation can be seen directly from <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> = <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>: the turgor pressure at steady states is constant, <italic>σ</italic> = <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>. Experimentally, the cell-wall strain was measured by applying an acute hyperosmotic shock to induce plasmolysis, and it is approximately constant as the external osmolarity increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], suggesting a constant turgor pressure independent of external osmolarity, in concert with our model assumptions. The internal osmotic pressure at steady states is related to the external osmotic pressure through <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref>,
<disp-formula id="eqn9">

</p>
<p>Here, we have neglected the term <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> <italic>/k</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub>. Experimentally, an abrupt water flux occurs within hundreds of milliseconds after an osmotic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], from which we can estimate the water permeability as <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> ∼ 100 min<sup>−1</sup>atm<sup>−1</sup> considering an osmotic shock with an amplitude ΔΠ<sub><italic>out</italic></sub> = 1 atm. Because the typical doubling times of microorganisms are from about 20 minutes to several hours, we estimate <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> <italic>/k</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> ∼ 10 −100 Pa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], negligible compared with the typical cytoplasmic osmotic pressures, which can be several atmospheric pressures.</p>
<p>In steady states, the internal osmotic pressure is independent of time. Combining <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq.

</p>
<p>The right-hand side of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10a">Eq. (10a)</xref> is a constant independent of external osmolarity (see its detailed expression in Section C of Supplementary Material). In deriving <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10b">Eq.

Intriguingly, the relationship between the normalized growth rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and the normalized cytoplasmic osmotic pressure (Π<sub><italic>in</italic></sub><italic>/</italic>Π<sub><italic>in</italic>,<italic>c</italic></sub>), which we refer to as the growth curve in the following, has only one parameter <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub><italic>/</italic>(<italic>H</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> + 1). Therefore, the growth curves of different organisms can be unified by a single formula, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10b">Eq. (10b)</xref>, and different organisms may have different values of <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub><italic>/</italic>(<italic>H</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> + 1). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10b">Eq.

<p>We test the validity of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10b">Eq. (10b)</xref> by fitting it to the experimental growth curves (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To do this, we calculate the internal osmotic pressure using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Eq. (9)</xref> given the values of the external osmotic pressure and the turgor pressure (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Intriguingly, the growth curves of multiple species can be well fitted by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10b">Eq.

Further, budding yeast cells demonstrate a higher value of <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub><italic>/</italic>(<italic>H</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> + 1), indicating a reduced susceptibility to growth rate reduction when exposed to mild increases in the external osmolarity. Meanwhile, the osmoadaptation capability of <italic>E. coli</italic> depends on the growth media, presumably arising from variations in metabolic fluxes and gene expressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>

<graphic xlink:href="601668v3_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To further reveal the biological functions of biological regulations, we study the steady-state properties of mutant cells in which either osmoregulation or cell-wall synthesis regulation is depleted. For mutant cells with-out osmoregulation, <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> = 0 in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. (4)</xref>. In this case, the fraction of osmolyte-producing protein is constant with time, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.Comparing the dynamics of osmolyte and total protein mass, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>,one finds that the ratio of the number of osmolyte molecule and the total protein mass remains constant over time, irrespective of variations in external osmolarity (see the detailed derivation in Section C of Supplementary Material). As the external osmolarity increases, the protein density of mutant cells quickly reaches the critical value <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10a">Eq. (10a)</xref> with <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> = 0. Therefore, the steady-state growth curve of the mutant cells terminates at an external osmolarity much smaller than wild-type (WT) cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), in agreement with previous experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>].</p>
<p>For mutant cells without the cell-wall synthesis regulation, <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> = 0; therefore, the cell-wall synthesis efficiency <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> equals 1 independent of time. Thus, the growth rate of the relaxed cell-wall volume is always equal to the growth rate of total protein mass [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Eqs. (6</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">7</xref>)]. Interestingly, in this case, the turgor pressure at steady states decreases with the increase of external osmolarity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and see the detailed proof in Section C of Supplementary Material). The decreased turgor pressure lowers the internal osmotic pressure given the same Π<sub><italic>out</italic></sub> according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Eq. (9)</xref>, leading to a lower protein density of mutant cells than WT cells according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn10a">Eq. (10a)</xref>. Therefore, mutant cells grow faster than WT cells under the same external osmolarity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Nevertheless, the mutant cells are prone to plasmolysis at a threshold external osmolarity where the WT cells can maintain constant turgor pressure (see the vertical line in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> around 2 M extra external osmolarity). Reduced turgor pressure is detrimental to multiple biological processes, e.g., cytokinesis in fission yeast requires the participation of turgor pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>].</p>
<p>To summarize, osmoregulation allows cells to grow in a wide range of external osmolarity conditions with a mild change in protein density. The cell-wall synthesis regulation allows cells to maintain a stable turgor pressure and avoid plasmolysis. Both regulatory mechanisms expand the range of external osmolarities that cells can adapt to.</p>

<title>Transient dynamics after a constant osmotic shock</title>
<p>Next, we study the dynamical behaviors of cellular properties in response to a constant osmotic shock: the external osmolarity changes abruptly and keeps its value for an infinitely long time. Intriguingly, we find that the dynamics of osmoresponse can be split into shock and adaptation periods (see insets of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref>). The immediate water flow due to osmotic imbalance occurs in the shock period, during which the mass and osmolyte productions are negligible. Therefore, the ratio of the internal osmotic pressure and the protein density is invariant right before and after a shock period: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> where the upper index <italic>i</italic> (<italic>f</italic>) means the state right before (after) the shock period.

From the above equations, it is clear that the timescale of osmoregulation is set by the doubling time: it takes about the doubling time for the protein density and the fraction of osmolyte-producing protein to adapt to the new steady-state values. For walled cells, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline22.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> depend on the time since Π<sub><italic>in</italic></sub> = Π<sub><italic>out</italic></sub> + <italic>σ</italic> and the turgor pressure <italic>σ</italic> is time-dependent during osmoresponse processes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B). For unwalled cells, such as mammalian cells and microbial cells with cell walls removed (i.e., protoplasts), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline23.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is constant in a fixed environment (see detailed discussion on the transient dynamics of unwalled cells in Section D of Supplementary Material).</p>
<p>Upon a constant hyperosmotic shock, the immediate water efflux leads to an instantaneous drop in turgor pressure and a rise in protein density (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The internal state of the cell, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline24.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> evolves towards to the new equilibrium point, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline25.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> One should note that the equilibrium point is time-dependent initially but eventually becomes fixed as the turgor pressure relaxes to the steady-state value (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and Movie S1). Interestingly, the protein density increases initially and then decreases after the shock (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The decrease in protein density is because of the osmoregulation process, which is set by the doubling time [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn12a">Eqs. (12a</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn12b">12b</xref>)]. Meanwhile, we find that the initial increase of protein density is because of the suppressed growth of the relaxed cell-wall volume due to the low turgor pressure. Indeed, for unwalled cells, the protein density <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> decreases immediately after the shock (Figure S2B). We note that the growth rate approaches the new steady-state value non-monotonically (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) because of the spiral trajectory in the space of the internal state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), consistent with experimental observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
<p>The phenomena are essentially the opposite for a constant hypoosmotic shock (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, D</xref> and Movie S2). However, we find an extremely fast cell growth after the hypoosmotic shock, with a growth rate peak occurring about 25 minutes after applying the shock, which we call the supergrowth phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. One should note that 25 minutes is much shorter than the doubling time (about two hours) but comparable to the timescale of cell-wall synthesis regulation, which we set as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline26.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> min in the simulations in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> (we will explain why we choose <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline27.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> min in the next section). Furthermore, applying a hypoosmotic shock to an unwalled cell does not induce a significant supergrowth phase compared with walled cells (Figure S2D).</p>
<p>We propose that supergrowth comes from the high turgor pressure caused by the hypoosmotic shock, which leads to a fast cell-wall synthesis according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq. (7)</xref>. Rapid insertion of materials into the cell wall relaxes the turgor pressure and allows the cells to grow faster [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eqs. (2</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">3</xref>)]. This idea is consistent with the observation that the growth rate and the growth rate of the relaxed cell-wall volume <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> reach their peaks simultaneously (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This observation also suggests that the timescale of supergrowth, i.e., the timing of growth rate peak, is set by the time scale of cell-wall synthesis regulation [<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline28.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq.

Notably, in the initial stage of the adaptation period, <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> approaches its target from below and reaches its target value at the growth rate peak (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline29.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>) (the third panel of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), after which <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> sticks to its target value and decreases accordingly because of the short relaxation time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline30.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq. (7)</xref>]. A detailed proof of the conditions for supergrowth, including the necessity of a cell wall and the regulation of cell-wall synthesis, is provided in Section E of the Supplementary Material.</p>
<p>Following the discussion above, we obtain an analytical expression of the growth rate peak after a hypoosmotic shock (see the detailed derivations in Section F of Supplementary Material)
<disp-formula id="eqn13">

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Here, all the variables on the right side are at the growth rate peak. Because the timescale of the osmoresponse process, which is around hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), is much longer than the timescale of the supergrowth phase, which is about 20 minutes for <italic>S. pombe</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], the turgor pressure at the growth rate peak can be well approximated by its immediate value after the shock. Therefore, the growth rate peak must increase as the amplitude of the hypoosmotic shock increases, which we confirm numerically (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparison with experiments: supergrowth phenomena after osmotic oscillation</title>
<p>Next, we quantitatively compare our theoretical predictions regarding the supergrowth phase with experimental data. In Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], Knapp et al. applied an osmotic oscillation to fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic> during which the external osmolarity alternated between two values.</p>
<p>They found cell growth was almost inhibited during the perturbation, while the protein and dry-mass densities increased. Surprisingly, cells grew unusually fast after the osmotic oscillation was removed and reached their maximum growth rate about 20 minutes after the end of the osmotic oscillation. The maximum growth rate can be twice the growth rate in the reference growth medium, and the elevation in growth rate can persist for 2-3 cell cycles. These observations are very similar to our results for a constant hypoosmotic shock (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>To test if our osmoresponse model captures the supergrowth phase for a periodic perturbation, we simulate a wide-type <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells with the same protocols as the experiments (see details of simulations in Methods). Intriguingly, our model successfully recapitulates the supergrowth phase and the gradually increasing protein density and dry-mass density during the perturbation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We confirm that the cell-wall synthesis regulation is crucial for the emergence of the supergrowth phase since unwalled cells do not exhibit supergrowth under the same conditions (Figure S3B). Interestingly, we find that an infinitely long periodic osmotic shock can be equivalently mapped to a constant osmotic shock (see the detailed discussions and proof in Section D of Supplementary Material), which means that they have the same time-averaged growth rate and protein density in the steady states (Figure S2F).</p>

<p>In Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], the authors measured the growth rate peaks vs. three different parameters of the osmotic oscillations: amplitude, period length, and number of periods. We first fit the growth rate peaks vs. the amplitudes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), from which we obtain <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> = 1.7, the sensitivity of the cell-wall synthesis efficiency to turgor pressure [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq. (7)</xref>], and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline31.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> min, the timescale in the up-regulation of cell-wall synthesis efficiency (which is why we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline32.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> min in the previous section). Other model parameters are inferred from independent steady-state measurements, and we set the timescale in the down-regulation of cell-wall synthesis efficiency as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline33.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> min for simplicity (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We next fix the values of <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="601668v3_inline34.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and plot the predicted growth rate peaks vs. the period length (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and number of periods (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). As a strong support of our model, our predictions quantitatively match the experimental data without any further fitting.</p>
<p>Two interesting features of the curve <italic>µ</italic><sup><italic>sg</italic></sup> v.s amplitude catch our attention: the non-monotonic behavior and the kink point at which the derivative is discontinuous (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), which are conserved regardless of the number of periods (Figure S7). Therefore, we study the case of a single oscillation for simplicity, which is equivalent to a hyperosmotic shock of finite duration. For a mild hyperosmotic shock, during the period of hyperosmotic shock, the turgor pressure has almost recovered to the steady-state value <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, switching from a long hyperosmotic period to the reference growth medium is equivalent to a constant hypoosmotic shock, where we have shown that the growth rate peak increases with the amplitude (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). However, the crowding effect becomes more pronounced as the amplitude increases. Beyond the critical amplitude at the kink point, the cytoplasm is completely jammed during the hyperosmotic shock such that the cell states are precisely the same before and after the hyperosmotic shock, which means no supergrowth phase beyond this critical amplitude. Therefore, the curve <italic>µ</italic><sup><italic>sg</italic></sup> vs. amplitude must be non-monotonic (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Notably, for a very large <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, cells can feel the crowding effect only when the cytoplasm is close enough to the critical protein density, shown as the abrupt decline of <italic>µ</italic><sup><italic>sg</italic></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we remark that the significance of supergrowth is intimately related to the amount of recovered turgor pressure during the hyperosmotic shock <italic>δσ</italic>. We prove that the overshoot of turgor pressure after the removal of hyperosmotic shock (<italic>σ</italic><sup><italic>f</italic></sup>− <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>), which sets the growth rate peak, is mainly set by the recovered turgor pressure during the hyperosmotic shock (see the detailed discussions in Section G of Supplementary Material). Indeed, <italic>µ</italic><sup><italic>sg</italic></sup>, <italic>σ</italic><sup><italic>f</italic></sup> −<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, and <italic>δσ</italic> are highly correlated as we change the amplitude (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study presents a theory of microbial osmoresponses based on a physical foundation and simplified biological regulation strategies. Our theory captures the steady-state properties of constant turgor pressure and reduced growth rate with increasing external osmolarity. We remark that the growth rate reduction is due to the loss of free water and subsequent intracellular crowding as the external osmolarity increases. In particular, we predict a critical external osmolarity above which cell growth is completely inhibited and a universal relationship between the normalized growth rate and the normalized internal osmotic pressure, fitting the data of bacteria and yeast. We also demonstrate the biological functions of osmoregulation and cell-wall synthesis regulation. Cells defective in osmoregulation cannot grow even if the external osmolarity is only mildly higher than the reference value. Cells defective in cell-wall synthesis regulation cannot maintain turgor pressure as the external osmolarity increases even though they grow faster than WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), which will be a strong support of our theory if confirmed by experiments.</p>
<p>Regarding dynamic behaviors, our model predicts a non-monotonic time dependence of protein density after a constant hyperosmotic shock. We also unveil the supergrowth phase after a hypoosmotic shock, initially discovered in fission yeast after an osmotic oscillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. As a strong support of our theory, the predicted growth rate peaks quantitatively agree with the experimental data without additional fitting. We demonstrate the critical role of cell-wall synthesis regulation in the supergrowth phenomenon (Section E of Supplementary Material). In Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], the authors observed the rapid repolarization of the cell-wall glucan synthase Bgs4 to the cell tip following the removal of osmotic oscillations in fission yeast, in agreement with the dynamics of the cell-wall synthesis efficiency predicted from our model (compare Figure S11 in this work and Figure S4H in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]). To test our theories, we propose applying a hyperosmotic shock with a finite duration and measuring the growth rate after removing the hyperosmotic shock. We predict that the growth rate peak during the supergrowth phase is a nonmonotonic function of shock amplitude, initially rising because of the increased excess turgor pressure and later declining because the protein density reaches the critical value <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> during the shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>We remark that our model is intrinsically a coarsegrained model with many molecular details regarding gene expression regulation neglected, which allows us to gain more analytical insights. In Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>], the authors studied the responses to osmotic stress in glucose-limited environments and found that cells exhibited stronger osmotic gene expression response under glucose-limited conditions than under glucose-rich conditions. Using a computational model based on molecular mechanisms combined with experimental measurements, the authors demonstrated that in a glucose-limited environment, glycolysis intermediates were limited, which required cells to express more glycerol-production enzymes for stress adaptation. In the current version of our model, we do not account for the interaction between cell growth and osmolyte production; instead, we assume a constant fraction of ribosomes dedicated to translating ribosomal proteins. Our model can be further generalized to include the more complex interactions, including the coupling between biomass and osmolyte production, e.g., by allowing the fraction of ribosomes translating (<italic>χ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>) to depend on the translation strategy of the osmolyte-producing enzyme (<italic>χ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>).</p>
<p>Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] showed that the expansion of <italic>E. coli</italic> cell wall is not directly regulated by turgor pressure, and this scenario is also included in our model as the case of <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> = 0. According to our model, the supergrowth phase is absent if <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>cw</italic></sub> = 0 (Figure S8), consistent with the absence of a growth rate peak after a hypoosmotic shock in the experiments of <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Meanwhile, our predictions are consistent with the growth rate peak after a hypoosmotic shock observed for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>We remark several limitations of our current coarsegrained model. First, the high membrane tension that inhibits transmembrane flux of peptidoglycan precursors, leading to a growth inhibition before the supergrowth peak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] is beyond our model. Second, in our current framework, the osmoregulation and cell-wall synthesis regulation rely on the instantaneous cellular states. However, microorganisms can exhibit memory effects to external stimuli by adapting to their temporal order of appearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Notably, in the osmoregulation of yeast, a short-term memory, facilitated by post-translational regulation of the trehalose metabolism pathway, and a longterm memory, orchestrated by transcription factors and mRNP granules, have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Besides, our model does not account for the role of osmolyte export in osmoregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] and the interaction between biomass and osmolyte production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Extending our model to include more realistic biological processes will be interesting.</p>
<p>In this work, we construct a systems-level and coarsegrained model capable of elucidating the complex processes underlying microbial osmoresponse. By leveraging the separation of timescales associated with mechanical equilibrium, cell-wall synthesis regulation, and osmoregulation, our model facilitates in-depth analytical and numerical analysis of how these various processes interact during cellular adaptation. In particular, we demonstrate the key physiological functions of osmoregulation and cell-wall synthesis regulation. We then apply this model to interpret the unusual phenomenon of supergrowth observed in fission yeast. This application addresses an essential challenge in experimental studies: exclusive knockout experiments can be difficult, and mechanistic interpretations of experimental observations are often lacking. Our theoretical framework offers a valuable tool for understanding such phenomena, contributing to the fundamental knowledge of microbial physiology and developing predictive models for microbial behavior under osmotic stress.</p>

<p>This manuscript develops a theoretical model of osmotic pressure adaptation in microbes by osmolyte production and wall synthesis. The prediction of a rapid increase in growth rate on osmotic shock is experimentally validated using fission yeast. By using phenomenological rules rather than detailed molecular mechanisms, the model can potentially apply to a wide range of microbes, providing <bold>important</bold> insights that would be of interest to the wider community studying the regulation of cell size and mechanics. The level of coarse-graining and the assumptions and limitations of the model have been well described, providing a <bold>convincing</bold> foundation for making predictions. However, further experimental work on the validity of the core assumptions across a range of microbial organisms is needed to assess the universality of the model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A theoretical model for microbial osmoresponse was proposed. The model assumes simple phenomenological rules: (i) the change of free water volume in the cell due to osmotic imbalance based on pressure balance, (ii) Osmoregulation that assumes change of the proteome partitioning depending on the osmotic pressure that affects the osmolyte-producing protein production, (iii) The cell-wall synthesis regulation where the change of the turgor pressure to the cell-wall synthesis efficiency to go back to the target turgor pressure, (iv) Effect of Intracellular crowding assuming that the biochemical reactions slows down for more crowding and stops when the protein density (protein mass divided by free water volume) reaches a critical value. The parameter values were found in the literature or obtained by fitting to the experimental data. The authors compare the model behavior with various microorganismcs (E. coli, B. subtils, S. Cerevisiae, S. pombe), and successfully reproduced the overall trend (steady state behavior for many of them, dynamics for S. pombe). In addition, the model predicts non-trivial behavior such as the fast cell growth just after the hypoosmotic shock, which is consistent with experimental observation. The authors further make experimentally testable predictions regarding mutant behavior and transient dynamics.</p>
<p>The theory assumes simple mechanistic dependence between core variables without going into specific molecular mechanisms of regulations. The simplicity allows the theory to apply to different organisms by adjusting the time scales with parameters, and the model successfully explains broad classes of observed behaviours. Mathematically, the model provides analytical expressions of the parameter dependencies and an understanding of the dynamics through the phase space without being buried in the detail. This theory can serve as a base to discuss the universality and diversity of microbial osmoresponse.</p>
<p>The coarse-grained nature of the model is the strength of the model in terms of its generality. However, it does not consider various regulations at the molecular level. Hence, certain adaptation features are not considered in the current version of the model. The updated manuscript discusses the pros and cons of the current approach.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A theoretical model for microbial osmoresponse was proposed. The model assumes simple phenomenological rules: (i) the change of free water volume in the cell due to osmotic imbalance based on pressure balance, (ii) osmoregulation that assumes change of the proteome partitioning depending on the osmotic pressure that affects the osmolyte-producing protein production, (iii) the cell-wall synthesis regulation where the change of the turgor pressure to the cell-wall synthesis efficiency to go back to the target turgor pressure, (iv) effect of Intracellular crowding assuming that the biochemical reactions slow down for more crowding and stops when the protein density (protein mass divided by free water volume) reaches a critical value. The parameter values were found in the literature or obtained by fitting to the experimental data. The authors compare the model behavior with various microorganisms (<italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>B. subtils</italic>, <italic>S. Cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>S. pombe</italic>), and successfully reproduced the overall trend (steady state behavior for many of them, dynamics for <italic>S. pombe</italic>). In addition, the model predicts non-trivial behavior such as the fast cell growth just after the hypoosmotic shock, which is consistent with experimental observation. The authors further make experimentally testable predictions regarding mutant behavior and transient dynamics.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The theory assumes simple mechanistic dependence between core variables without going into specific molecular mechanisms of regulations. The simplicity allows the theory to apply to different organisms by adjusting the time scales with parameters, and the model successfully explains broad classes of observed behaviors. Mathematically, the model provides analytical expressions of the parameter dependences and an understanding of the dynamics through the phase space without being buried in the detail. This theory can serve as a base to discuss the universality and diversity of microbial osmoresponse.</p>

<p>We would like to thank Reviewer 1 for thoroughly reading our work and appreciating our theoretical approach to investigating microbial osmotic response.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>The core part of this model is that everything is coupled with growth physiology, and, as far as I understand, the assumption (iv) (Eq. 8) that imposes the global reaction rate dependence on crowding plays a crucial role. I would think this is a strong and interesting assumption. However, the abstract or discussion does not discuss the importance of this assumption. In addition, the paper does not discuss gene regulation explicitly, and some comparison with a molecular mechanismoriented model may be beneficial to highlight the pros and cons of the current approach</p>

<p>We thank Reviewer 1 for their very helpful feedback. We have significantly revised the manuscript as suggested by Reviewer 1. See the detailed answers in the following.</p>

<p>(1) Explicitly stating the assumption (iv) in the abstract and discussing its role would help readers understand.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have significantly rewritten the third paragraph of the Introduction section to emphasize our key assumptions as suggested by Reviewer 1, including the relationship between global reaction rate and crowding:</p>
<p>“Our model assumes the following phenomenological rules: (1) the change in free water volume within the cell is driven by osmotic imbalance (Cadart et al., Nature Physics, 2019; Rollin et al., Elife, 2023), while the remaining volume changes in proportion to protein production; (2) osmoregulation influences the production of osmolyte-producing protein, governed by intracellular protein density (Scott et al., Science, 2010); (3) cell-wall synthesis is regulated through a feedback mechanism, wherein turgor pressure modulates the efficiency of cell-wall synthesis, enabling the cell to maintain a relatively stable turgor pressure; and (4) intracellular crowding slows down biochemical reactions as cytoplasmic density increases, with reactions ceasing entirely when protein density reaches a critical threshold.”</p>
<p>We have also modified the abstract to mention the crowding effects explicitly. Additionally, we have added a few sentences in the first and second paragraphs of the Discussion section to emphasize the importance of crowding effects to our conclusions regarding the growth rate reduction in steady states and the non-monotonic dependence of the growth rate peak on the shock amplitude after a hyperosmotic shock.</p>

<p>(2) I found [Shen W , Gao Z, Chen K, Zhao A, Ouyang Q, Luo C. The regulatory mechanism of the yeast osmoresponse under different glucose concentrations. <italic>Iscience</italic>. 2023 Jan 20;26(1)], which discusses the medium glucose concentration dependence of the response, focused on the gene regulatory circuit and the metabolic flux. As far as I understood, this paper considers the effect of the reallocation of resources but not the mechanical part of the osmoresponse such as pressure explicitly. It will be interesting to discuss the pros and cons in comparison with such a model. In principle, I will not be surprised if the current model does not differentiate the different glucose concentrations much since it is a more coarse-grained model, and I don't think it is a problem, but it will be good to have an explicit discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate Reviewer 1's insightful comment regarding the work by Shen et al. (iScience, 2023), which elucidates the two distinct osmoresponse strategies in yeast. By quantifying Hog1 nuclear translocation dynamics and downstream protein expression, the study reveals that in a rich medium, cells can leverage surplus glycolytic products as defensive reserves, reallocating metabolic flux to facilitate rapid adaptation to osmotic changes. Conversely, limited glycolytic intermediates in low-glucose environments necessitate increased enzyme synthesis for osmotic adaptation.</p>
<p>The paper highlighted by Reviewer 1 studies yeast's adaptive strategies under two stresses— nutrient limitation and osmotic pressure and provides an important complement to our study.</p>
<p>In our simplified model, we did not include the interaction between cell growth and osmolyte production, assuming a constant fraction of ribosomes translating ribosomal proteins, supported by the experiments of <italic>E. coli</italic> (Dai et al., mBio, 2018). We remark that incorporating competitive dynamics for translational resources into our framework can be achieved by modifying the proportion of ribosomes translating themselves (<italic>X<sub>r</sub></italic>), from a constant to a function related to the translation strategy of the osmolyte-producing enzyme ((<italic>X<sub>a</sub></italic>).</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have included a new discussion in the third paragraph of the Discussion section to compare our approach with the molecular mechanism-oriented model:</p>
<p>“We remark that our model is intrinsically a coarse-grained model with many molecular details regarding gene expression regulation neglected, which allows us to gain more analytical insights. In [Shen et al., iScience, 2023], the authors studied the responses to osmotic stress in glucose-limited environments and found that cells exhibited stronger osmotic gene expression response under glucose-limited conditions than under glucose-rich conditions. Using a computational model based on molecular mechanisms combined with experimental measurements, the authors demonstrated that in a glucose-limited environment, glycolysis intermediates were limited, which required cells to express more glycerol-production enzymes for stress adaptation. In the current version of our model, we do not account for the interaction between cell growth and osmolyte production; instead, we assume a constant fraction of ribosomes dedicated to translating ribosomal proteins. Our model can be further generalized to include the more complex interactions, including the coupling between biomass and osmolyte production, e.g., by allowing the fraction of ribosomes translating ((<italic>X<sub>r</sub></italic>) to depend on the translation strategy of the osmolyte-producing enzyme ((<italic>X<sub>a</sub></italic>).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) A minor comment: The authors call assumption (iii) (eq. 7) &quot;positive feedback from turgor pressure to the cell-wall synthesis efficiency&quot; (line 204). I have a hard time seeing this as positive feedback. It regulates the cell wall synthesis so that turgor pressure returns to the desired value; hence, isn't it negative feedback?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this confusion. We have removed the term &quot;positive feedback&quot; in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Ye et al. have developed a theoretical model of osmotic pressure adaptation by osmolyte production and wall synthesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They validate their model predictions of a rapid increase in growth rate on osmotic shock experimentally using fission yeast. The study has several interesting insights which are of interest to the wider community of cell size and mechanics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Multiple aspects of this manuscript require addressing, in terms of clarity and consistency with previous literature. The specifics are listed as major and minor comments.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The motivation for the work is weak and needs more clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 2 for this very helpful comment, which we believe has significantly improved our manuscript. We would like to clarify the two major motivations of our study.</p>
<p>First, we aim to construct a systems-level and coarse-grained model capable of elucidating the complex processes underlying microbial osmoresponse. By leveraging the separation of timescales associated with mechanical equilibrium, cell-wall synthesis regulation, and osmoregulation, our model facilitates in-depth analytical and numerical analysis of how these various processes interact during cellular adaptation. In particular, we demonstrate the key physiological functions of osmoregulation and cell-wall synthesis regulation.</p>
<p>Second, we seek to apply this model to interpret the phenomenon of supergrowth observed in fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (Knapp et al., Cell Systems, 2019). This application addresses an essential challenge in experimental studies: exclusive knockout experiments can be difficult, and mechanistic interpretations of experimental observations are often lacking. Our theoretical framework offers a valuable tool for understanding such phenomena, contributing to the fundamental knowledge of microbial physiology and developing predictive models for microbial behavior under osmotic stress.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have included a new paragraph at the end of the Discussion section to emphasize our motivations better:</p>

<p>(2) The link between sections is very frequently missing. The authors directly address the problem that they are trying to solve without any motivation in the results section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful to Reviewer 2 for their valuable feedback. In the revised manuscript, we have included a new paragraph at the end of the Introduction section to outline the main content of each subsection in Results and the logical connections between them:</p>
<p>“In the following “Results” section, we begin by outlining the primary assumptions and equations of our model in the subsection &quot;Model Description,&quot; which includes four parts, each addressing one of the four phenomenological rules. Additional details can be found in Methods. We then proceed to the subsection “Steady states in constant environments”, where we employ our theoretical framework to analyze steady-state growth and examine how the growth rate varies with external osmolarity. In the “Transient dynamics after a constant osmotic shock” subsection, we investigate the time-dependent osmoresponse after a constant hyperosmotic and hypoosmotic shock. Finally, in “Comparison with experiments: supergrowth phenomena after osmotic oscillation”, we address the supergrowth phenomena observed in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, utilizing our model to elucidate these experimental observations.”</p>

<p>(3) The parameters used in the models (symbols) need to be explained better to make the paper more readable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this confusion. In the revised Supplementary Material, we have included an additional table (Table S2) to explain the meanings of the symbols employed in the model to help the reader better understand.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Throughout the paper, the authors keep switching between organisms that they are modelling. There needs to be some consistency in this aspect where they mention what organism they are trying to model, since some assumptions that they make may not be valid for both yeast as well as bacteria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 2 for this very helpful comment. We would like to clarify that our model is coarse-grained without including detailed molecular mechanisms; therefore, it presumably applies to various species of microorganisms. Indeed, the predicted steady-state growth curves derived from our model and the experimental data obtained from various organisms agree reasonably well (Figure 2A of the main text).</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have explicitly emphasized the nature of our phenomenological model and its broad applicability in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction section:</p>
<p>“We remark that our model is coarse-grained, without including detailed molecular mechanisms, and is therefore applicable across diverse microbial species. Notably, the predicted steady-state growth rate as a function of internal osmotic pressure from our model aligns well with experimental data from diverse organisms. This alignment allows us to quantify the sensitivities of translation speed and regulation of osmolyte-producing protein in response to intracellular density. Additionally, we demonstrate that osmoregulation and cellwall synthesis regulation enable cells to adapt to a wide range of external osmolarities and prevent plasmolysis. Our model also predicts a non-monotonic time dependence of growth rate and protein density as they approach steady-state values following a constant osmotic shock, in concert with experimental observations (Rojas et al., PNAS, 2014; Rojas et al., Cell systems, 2017). Moreover, we show that a supergrowth phase can arise following a sudden decrease in external osmolarity, driven by cell-wall synthesis regulation, either through the direct application of a hypoosmotic shock or the withdrawal of an oscillatory stimulus. Remarkably, the predicted amplitudes of supergrowth (i.e., growth rate peaks) quantitatively agree with multiple independent experimental measurements.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have also included a comparison with a detailed molecular mechanism model in the third paragraph of the Discussion section:</p>
<p>“We remark that our model is intrinsically a coarse-grained model with many molecular details regarding gene expression regulation neglected, which allows us to gain more analytical insights. In [Shen et al., iScience, 2023], the authors studied the responses to osmotic stress in glucose-limited environments and found that cells exhibited stronger osmotic gene expression response under glucose-limited conditions than under glucose-rich conditions. Using a computational model based on molecular mechanisms combined with experimental measurements, the authors demonstrated that in a glucose-limited environment, glycolysis intermediates were limited, which required cells to express more glycerol-production enzymes for stress adaptation. In the current version of our model, we do not account for the interaction between cell growth and osmolyte production; instead, we assume a constant fraction of ribosomes dedicated to translating ribosomal proteins. Our model can be further generalized to include the more complex interactions, including the coupling between biomass and osmolyte production, e.g., by allowing the fraction of ribosomes translating ((<italic>X<sub>r&lt;/supb</sub></italic>) to depend on the translation strategy of the osmolyte-producing enzyme ((<italic>X<sub>a</sub></italic>).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The extent of universality of osmoregulation i.e the limitations are not very well highlighted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The osmoregulation mechanism described in our model primarily addresses changes in cytoplasmic osmolarity through the de-novo synthesis of compatible solutes, widely observed across bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotic microorganisms. This review article (GundeCimerman et al., FEMS microbiology reviews, 2018) provides an extensive summary and exploration of the primary compatible solutes utilized by organisms from all three domains of life, underscoring the prevalence of this osmoregulatory strategy. Furthermore, our model can be directly generalized to scenarios involving the direct uptake of osmolytes from the environment. One only needs to change the interpretation of the parameter, <italic>𝑘<sub>𝑎</sub></italic> in the production of osmolyte molecule, <inline-formula id="sa3equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-102858-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, from the synthesis rate to the uptake rate, and all the results are equally applicable. In the revised manuscript, we have briefly discussed this point in the subsection “Osmoregulation.”</p>
<p>We agree with Reviewer 2 that our model's coarse-grained nature makes it broadly applicable to diverse microbial taxa; however, more specialized adaptations are beyond our model. In the revised manuscript, we have included a more detailed examination of the limitations inherent in our modeling approach in the second last paragraph of the Discussion section:</p>
<p>“We remark several limitations of our current coarse-grained model. First, the high membrane tension that inhibits transmembrane flux of peptidoglycan precursors, leading to a growth inhibition before the supergrowth peak (Rojas et al., Cell systems 2017) is beyond our model. Second, in our current framework, the osmoregulation and cell-wall synthesis regulation rely on the instantaneous cellular states. However, microorganisms can exhibit memory effects to external stimuli by adapting to their temporal order of appearance (Mitchell et al., Nature 2009). Notably, in the osmoregulation of yeast, a short-term memory, facilitated by post-translational regulation of the trehalose metabolism pathway, and a long-term memory, orchestrated by transcription factors and mRNP granules, have been identified (Jiang et al., Science signaling 2020). Besides, our model does not account for the role of osmolyte export in osmoregulation (Tamas et al., Molecular microbiology, 1999) and the interaction between biomass and osmolyte production (Shen et al., Iscience 2023). Extending our model to include more realistic biological processes will be interesting.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Line 198-200: It is not clear in the text what organisms the authors are writing about here. &quot;Experiments suggested that the turgor pressure induce cell-wall synthesis, e.g., through mechanosensors on cell membrane [45, 46], by increasing the pore size of the peptidoglycan network [5], and by accelerating the moving velocity of the cell-wall synthesis machinery [31]&quot;. This however is untrue for bacteria as shown by the study (reference 22 is this paper: E. Rojas, J. A. Theriot, and K. C. Huang, Response of escherichia coli growth rate to osmotic shock, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 111, 7807 (2014).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 2 for pointing out this very important issue and apologize for the confusion. References 45 and 46 (Dupres et al., Nature Chemical Biology 2009; Neeli-Venkata et al., Developmental Cell 2021) discuss how Wsc1 acts as a mechanosensor in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, detecting turgor pressure and activating pathways that reinforce the cell wall. Reference 5 (Typas et al., Cell 2010) explains the role of LpoA and LpoB, the two outer membrane lipoprotein regulators in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which modulate peptidoglycan synthesis in an extracellular manner. Reference 31 (Amir and Nelson, PNAS 2012) is a theoretical paper showing that turgor pressure may accelerate the moving velocity of the cell wall synthesis machinery in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In the revised manuscript, we have been more explicit about the organisms we refer to in the subsection “Cell-wall synthesis regulation.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we agree with Reviewer 2 that cell wall synthesis may not be directly regulated by turgor pressure in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Rojas et al., PNAS 2014). We would like to clarify that this scenario is also included in our model corresponding to <italic>H<sub>cw</sub></italic> = 0 (Eq. (7) in the main text): the turgor pressure does not affect the cell-wall synthesis. Therefore, the supergrowth phenomenon observed in <italic>S. pombe</italic> does not manifest under hypotonic stimulation in <italic>E. coli.</italic></p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we have emphasized this point more explicitly in the third last paragraph of the Discussion section:</p>
<p>“Reference 22 (Rojas et al., PNAS, 2014) showed that the expansion of E. <italic>coli</italic> cell wall is not directly regulated by turgor pressure, and this scenario is also included in our model as the case of <italic>H<sub>cw</sub></italic> = 0. According to our model, the supergrowth phase is absent if <italic>H<sub>cw</sub></italic> = 0 (Figure S8), consistent with the absence of a growth rate peak after a hypoosmotic shock in the experiments of <italic>E. coli</italic> (Rojas et al., PNAS, 2014). Meanwhile, our predictions are consistent with the growth rate peak after a hypoosmotic shock observed for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Rojas et al., Cell systems, 2017).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The time scale of reactions to hyperosmotic shocks does not agree with previous literature (reference 22). Therefore defining which organism you are looking at is important. Hence the statement &quot; Because the timescale of the osmoresponse process, which is around hours (Figure 3B), is much longer than the timescale of the supergrowth phase, which is about 20 minutes, the turgor pressure at the growth rate peak can be well approximated by its immediate value after the shock.&quot; from line 447 does not seem to make sense. The authors need to address this.</p>

<p>“When cell growth reaches a steady state, the proportions of all components, including free water volume, cell mass, and cell wall volume, must be constant relative to the total cell volume to ensure homeostasis.

<p>Here, the typical value of <italic>𝜇<sub>𝑓</sub></italic> (which equals to <italic>𝜇<sub>r</sub></italic> in steady state) is approximated by the inverse of the cell cycle, which is around hours.

<p>Here, <italic>𝑚<sub>𝑝,𝑟</sub></italic> is the total mass of ribosomal proteins and 𝑘𝑘𝑟𝑟 is a constant proportional to the elongation speed of ribosome. The expression of <italic>𝜇<sub>𝑟</sub></italic> is a direct consequence of ribosomes being responsible for producing all proteins. In the revised manuscript, we have added more details in the introduction of the variable <italic>𝜇<sub>𝑟</sub></italic> in the last paragraph of the subsection “Cell growth”:</p>
<p>“In this work, we assume that the dry-mass growth rate is proportional to the fraction of ribosomal proteins within the total proteome for simplicity, <italic>𝜇<sub>𝑟</sub></italic> = <italic>𝑘<sub>r</sub>𝑚<sub>𝑝,𝑟</sub></italic>/<italic>𝑚<sub>𝑝</sub></italic> = <italic>𝑘<sub>r</sub>𝜙<sub>𝑟</sub></italic>. This assumption leverages the fact that ribosomes are responsible for producing all proteins. The proportionality coefficient <italic>𝑘<sub>𝑟</sub></italic> encapsulates the efficiency of ribosomal activity, being proportional to the elongation speed of the ribosome. We remark that 𝑘𝑘𝑟𝑟 is influenced by the crowding effect, which we address later.”</p>
