<title>Abstract</title><p>Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are membraneless electron-dense structures rich in RNAs and proteins, and involved in various cellular processes. Two RNP granules in male germ cells, intermitochondrial cement and the chromatoid body (CB), are associated with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and are required for transposon silencing and spermatogenesis. Other RNP granules in male germ cells, the reticulated body and CB remnants, are also essential for spermiogenesis. In this study, we disrupted FBXO24, a testis-enriched F-box protein, in mice and found numerous membraneless electron-dense granules accumulated in sperm flagella. <italic>Fbxo24</italic> knockout (KO) mice exhibited malformed flagellar structures, impaired sperm motility, and male infertility, likely due to the accumulation of abnormal granules. The amount and localization of known RNP granule-related proteins were not disrupted in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, suggesting that the accumulated granules were distinct from known RNP granules. Further studies revealed that RNAs and two importins, IPO5 and KPNB1, abnormally accumulated in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa and that FBXO24 could ubiquitinate IPO5. In addition, IPO5 and KPNB1 were recruited to stress granules, RNP complexes, when cells were treated with oxidative stress or a proteasome inhibitor. These results suggest that FBXO24 is involved in the degradation of IPO5, disruption of which may lead to the accumulation of abnormal RNP granules in sperm flagella.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis is a specialized process by which spermatogonia differentiate into spermatocytes, round spermatids, elongating spermatids, and spermatozoa by undergoing meiosis and subsequent spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, round spermatids undergo dramatic morphological changes such as nuclear condensation, acrosome formation, flagellum formation, and cytoplasmic removal, leading to the formation of spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Leblond and Clermont, 1952</xref>). To fertilize eggs, spermatozoa then travel a long distance to reach eggs and pass through the cumulus-cell layer and zona pellucida that encase eggs. The motility apparatus of spermatozoa is the flagellum which is divided into three parts, a midpiece, a principal piece, and an endpiece, in order from proximal to distal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Eddy et al., 2003</xref>). The midpiece contains accessory structures called the mitochondrial sheath and outer dense fibers (ODF) that surround the axoneme, a 9+2 arrangement of microtubules, while the principal piece contains a different accessory structure called the fibrous sheath and ODFs surrounding the axoneme. In contrast, the endpiece contains no accessory structures but the axoneme. Abnormal formation of these flagellar structures could lead to male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nsota Mbango et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are membraneless electron-dense structures that assemble through liquidâliquid phase separation and play critical roles in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Eddy, 1974</xref>). Among the RNP granules, intermitochondrial cement (IMC) observed in late spermatocytes and the chromatoid body (CB) found in round spermatids are involved in the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meikar et al., 2011</xref>). After meiosis, IMCs are no longer detectable because of mitochondrial dispersion, and CBs become gradually larger in round spermatids. In elongating spermatids, the CBs containing MIWI, the main effector protein of the piRNA pathway, disappear and two other RNP structures called a reticulated body and a CB remnant that contain TSKS, TSSK1, and TSSK2 appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shang et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, we found that <italic>Tsks</italic> knockout (KO) mice failed to generate reticulated bodies and CB remnants, and were infertile with impaired cytoplasmic removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shimada et al., 2023</xref>), indicating that the formation and disassembly of RNP granules is highly regulated and important for spermiogenesis.</p>
<p>During spermiogenesis, post-translational modifications of proteins are critical since gene transcription is thought to cease with nuclear condensation. Ubiquitination is one of the post- translational modifications in which a small protein called ubiquitin is attached to target proteins. Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by a ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is involved in various physiological phenomena in cells, such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ciechanover and Schwartz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mani and Gelmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Protein ubiquitination is carried out by a cascade of enzymatic reactions, including ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-binding enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3), and target proteins ubiquitinated by E3 ligase are degraded by a large protein complex called the 26S proteasome. Among the approximately 600 E3 ligase genes estimated to be present in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2008</xref>), the mechanism and functions of ubiquitination mediated by the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) complex has been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>). The SCF complex consists of several proteins such as SKP1, a cullin protein, an F-box protein, and RBX1, and can ubiquitinate various substrates by using different F-box proteins that recognize distinct substrates. In humans, at least 38 F-box proteins have been identified, but the functions of most F-box proteins remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kipreos and Pagano, 2000</xref>). In this study, we analyzed the function of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> (F-box protein 24), predominantly expressed in testes, and found that FXBO24 is essential for sperm flagellar formation and male fertility.</p>

<title><italic>Fbxo24</italic> is expressed predominantly in male germ cells after meiosis and interacts with SKP1</title>
<p>We performed RT-PCR using cDNAs obtained from multiple mouse tissues and found a specific band for <italic>Fbxo24</italic> in testes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To identify stages in which <italic>Fbxo24</italic> was expressed in spermatogenesis, we performed RT-PCR using postnatal mouse testes over time. <italic>Fbxo24</italic> signals increased after birth, with solid signals observed around postnatal day 21 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) when round spermatids appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kluin et al., 1982</xref>). Consistent with the RT-PCR results, single- cell transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>) indicates that mouse <italic>Fbxo24</italic> and its human orthologue, <italic>FBXO24</italic>, are expressed during the post-meiotic stages (Figures S1A and B).</p>

<p>Pairwise sequence alignment of amino acids sequences revealed that FBXO24 is highly conserved between mice and humans (88% amino acid identity) (Figure S1C) with the F-box domains located near the N-terminus (Figure S1D). Because it has been reported that F-box proteins bind to SKP1 via the F-box domain to form the SCF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schulman et al., 2000</xref>), we investigated the interaction of FBXO24 with SKP1 by co-immunoprecipitation using HEK293T cells. We constructed vectors that express FBXO24 tagged with 3ÃFLAG with (wild-type, WT) or without (ÎF) the F-box domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). When SKP1-1D4 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-1D4 antibody, WT FBXO24-FLAG was co-immunoprecipitated, whereas ÎF FBXO24-FLAG was not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> left). Conversely, when an anti-FLAG antibody was used to immunoprecipitate WT or ÎF FBXO24-FLAG, SKP1-1D4 was co-immunoprecipitated only with WT FBXO24-FLAG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> right). These results suggest that FBXO24 could function as a component of the SCF complex in mouse testis, during the post meiotic stages of spermatogenesis.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Lack of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> causes male sterility in mice</title>
<p>To examine the role of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> in spermatogenesis, we generated <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Two gRNAs were designed to delete the majority of the coding region of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). One hundred fertilized eggs were electroporated, and the resulting 89 two- cell stage embryos were transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant ICR mice. One out of 18 born pups contained the large deletion of the coding region and subsequent mating was performed to obtain <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice. We found no overt gross defects in development, behavior, or survival in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice. We performed genomic PCR using the primers described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) and confirmed that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice had a deletion of 11,575 bp by Sanger sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO male mice were then mated with three WT females for three months to analyze fertility. Although 20 vaginal plugs were detected, no pups were born from the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO male mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> is indispensable for male fertility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Disruption of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> results in impaired spermiation and abnormal sperm morphology</title>
<p>We first examined spermatogenesis to determine the cause of male infertility in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice. No apparent differences in gross testicular morphology (Figure S2A) or weights (Figure S2B) were found between controls and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice. We then performed He-PAS staining of testicular and epididymis sections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and S2C). Although elongating spermatids can be found in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes, step 16 spermatids were still present in Stage IX seminiferous tubules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that spermiation was impaired in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes. In contrast, we could not find apparent differences in the cross sections of the cauda epididymis between the two genotypes (Figure S2C). Next, we observed mature spermatozoa collected from the cauda epididymis. While KO spermatozoa showed comparable head morphology to the controls, KO spermatozoa exhibited abnormal tail structures such as bent or coiled flagella (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B and C</xref>). Further analyses of sperm head morphology with immunostaining showed no overt abnormalities in the acrosome or nucleus (Figure S2D). Since abnormal flagellar morphology could result in decreased motility, we performed computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) after 10 and 120 minutes of incubation in capacitating medium. CASA revealed that the percentages of motile spermatozoa were significantly reduced in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice compared to the controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and Movies S1 and S2). Furthermore, all velocity parameters such as average path velocity (VAP), straight-line velocity (VSL), and curvilinear velocity (VCL) were lower in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E-G</xref>). These results indicate that FBXO24 is critical in sperm flagellum formation during spermiogenesis.</p>

<title><italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa cannot fertilize eggs <italic>in vitro</italic> and fail to migrate from the uterus into the oviduct</title>
<p>To further evaluate the fertilizing ability of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa, we performed in vitro fertilization (IVF). Consistent with male sterility observed in vivo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa could not fertilize eggs in vitro (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, removing cumulus cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) or both cumulus cells and the zona pellucida (ZP) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) could not rescue the fertilization rates, suggesting that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa may have defects in not only sperm motility but also the acrosome reaction, which is a prerequisite for spermatozoa to pass through the ZP and fuse with eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Morohoshi et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we crossed <italic>Fbxo24</italic> mutant mice with transgenic (Tg) mice which express EGFP in the acrosome and DsRed2 in the mitochondria (Red Body Green Sperm, RBGS, mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hasuwa et al., 2010</xref>) and analyzed the acrosome reaction rates. RBGS spermatozoa lose EGFP fluorescent signal when the spermatozoa undergo the acrosome reaction. First, to test whether <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa were viable, we performed propidium iodide (PI) staining and found that the percentages of dead spermatozoa were significantly higher in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice (Figure S3A). We then analyzed the acrosome reaction rates of PI-negative live spermatozoa. While the control spermatozoa underwent the acrosome reaction after 120 minutes of incubation in a capacitation medium and with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore (A23187) treatment, <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa rarely underwent the acrosome reaction even after adding A23187 (Figure S3B). Since the SNARE complex is considered critical for the acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hutt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Katafuchi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Schulz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tomes et al., 2002</xref>), we examined the amounts of SNARE-related proteins in mature spermatozoa using mass spectrometry and immunoblotting (Figure S3C and D), but no notable differences were found in SNARE-related proteins between the control and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa. Further, no significant differences were found in PLCD4 that has been reported to be important for the acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fukami et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we observed sperm migration in the female reproductive tract using RBGS mice. Although the control spermatozoa migrate through the uterotubal junction (UTJ) four hours after mating, <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa hardly passed through the UTJ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Since the processing of sperm membrane protein, ADAM3, is necessary for sperm migration through the UTJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fujihara et al., 2019</xref>, 2018a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yamaguchi et al., 2006</xref>), we performed immunoblotting analyses and found that ADAM3 was processed correctly even in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). We further performed immunoblotting of LY6K because <italic>Ly6k</italic> KO spermatozoa cannot migrate through the UTJ even with normal ADAM3 processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fujihara et al., 2014</xref>). However, we did not detect significant differences in the amounts of LY6K (Figure S3E). Considering that the acrosome reaction is not essential for sperm migration in the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Morohoshi et al., 2023</xref>) and defects in sperm motility could cause impaired migration through the UTJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; Fujihara et al., 2018a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Miyata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Shimada et al., 2019</xref>), these results suggest that lower viability and decreased sperm motility can be the cause of abnormal sperm migration and male sterility in vivo.</p>
<p>Next, we performed intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to examine whether nuclei of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa have the potential to generate the next generation. We injected <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO sperm heads into 91 WT oocytes, and obtained 48 two-cell stage embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).

<p>We then used a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to observe the formation of mitochondrial sheaths. During the early step of mitochondrial sheath formation, mitochondria wrap around the axoneme. In both control and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatids, spherical mitochondria were aligned correctly at this step (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, left panels). In the next step, mitochondria became crescent- shaped and were interlocked in the control spermatids, whereas irregular interlocking was observed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, middle panels). Subsequently, elongating mitochondria remain irregularly arranged in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, right panels).</p>
<p>To further investigate the morphological abnormality of the midpiece in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice, we observed the ultrastructure of the cauda epididymal spermatozoa using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Consistent with the SEM results, we found that mitochondria were irregularly arranged in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C and D</xref>). The frequency of abnormal mitochondria was significantly higher in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition, the axoneme (AX) and outer dense fiber (ODF) were disrupted in both midpieces and principal pieces of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa (Figures S4B-E). Furthermore, we frequently observed numerous membraneless electron-dense granules in the midpieces of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref>, D, and F). We found these granules even in the axoneme (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure. 4C</xref>). Despite the low frequency, we also found membraneless electron-dense granules in the principal pieces of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa (Figures S4F and G).</p>
<p>Because membraneless electron-dense granules accumulated in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa, we examined RNP granule-related proteins in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice. We performed immunoblotting analyses for ADAD1, ADAD2, MILI, MIWI, RNF-17, YTHDC2, TSKS, and TSSK1, which localized in germ-cell RNP granules and are essential for spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meikar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shimada et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Snyder et al., 2020</xref>), but we did not see any differences in the amounts of these proteins between <italic>Fbxo24</italic> heterozygous and KO testes (Figure S5A).

MIWI was localized in the IMCs of late spermatocytes and CBs of round spermatids and disappeared in elongating spermatids (Figure S5B).

<title>IPO5 and KPNB1 amounts increase in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO flagella</title>

Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the amounts of several proteins significantly increased in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mature spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Among the significantly increased proteins, we focused on IPO5 (importin 5, also known as KPNB3 and RanBP5) and KPNB1 (karyopherin subunit beta 1, also known as importin Î²1) because the fold changes (KO/WT) are the highest in these two proteins. Both IPO5 and KPNB1 are members of the karyopherin-Î² (KPNB) family of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), which play a crucial role in nucleocytoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chook and Blobel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chook and SÃ¼el, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Conti and Izaurralde, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kimura and Imamoto, 2014</xref>).

<title>FBXO24 could interact with IPO5</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the proteins that interacted with FBXO24. Because we could not obtain anti-FBXO24 antibodies that worked for immunoprecipitation, we generated Tg mice expressing 3ÃFLAG-tagged <italic>Fbxo24</italic> under a testis-specific <italic>Prm1</italic> promoter (Figures S6A and B). This transgene could not rescue <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO sperm morphology (Figure S6C). By looking for long non- coding RNAs, we found <italic>Gm36266</italic> that is located around Exon 9 and 10 of <italic>Fbxo24</italic>, which is deleted in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>); however, a partial deletion of Exon 2 and 3 of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> showed the same defects in sperm morphology (Figures S6DâG) as mice lacking Exon 3-10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Fbxo24</italic>, not <italic>Gm36266</italic>, is responsible for the phenotypes observed in this study. Abnormal sperm morphology was not rescued by the transgene, likely due to lower expression of FBXO24 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D</xref> and S6B) and/or FLAG-tag interfering with FBXO24 function. Using Tg mice, we could immunoprecipitate FBXO24-FLAG with an anti-FLAG antibody, and subsequent mass spectrometry analyses detected not only FBXO24 but also IPO5 with the highest quantitative values (Figure S6H), indicating that these proteins interact in vivo. We also found SKP1 in this analysis, consistent with the in vitro study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We confirmed that IPO5 co-immunoprecipitated with FBXO24-FLAG in mouse testes using immunoblotting analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Further, we transiently expressed 3ÃFLAG-tagged <italic>Fbxo24</italic> in HEK293T cells, performed immunoprecipitation analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody, and found that FBXO24 could interact with endogenous IPO5 but not with endogenous KPNB1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). To examine if FBXO24 can ubiquitinate IPO5, we performed a ubiquitination assay using HEK293T cells and revealed that ubiquitination of IPO5 was upregulated when cells were transfected with WT FBXO24, but not with ÎF FBXO24 that lacks the F-box domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). These results suggest that FBXO24 recognizes and ubiquitinates IPO5 for subsequent protein degradation.</p>

<title>IPO5 is recruited into RNP granules under stress conditions</title>
<p>The amounts of known RNP granule-related proteins were not upregulated in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO testes (Figure S5A) and spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, the total amount of RNAs was significantly increased in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A and B</xref>) although the contamination of somatic cells or immature spermatogenic cells were rarely found (Figure S7). Previous studies showed that various stresses, such as heat shock, arsenite treatment, or proteasome inhibition, trigger the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), membraneless granules composed of RNPs. Further, it has been shown that SGs could contain KPNB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chang and Tarn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mahboubi et al., 2013</xref>). Increased amounts of KPNB1 and RNAs suggest that RNP granules may be formed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa. We analyzed whether IPO5 can localize to SGs under stress conditions to explore this possibility. We examined the subcellular localization of endogenous IPO5 and KPNB1 in COS7 cells treated with arsenite, an oxidative stress inducer. Immunostaining analyses revealed that IPO5 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm without the stress inducer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>); however, when cells were treated with arsenite, IPO5 was detected not only in the cytoplasm but also in cytoplasmic granules that were colocalized with KPNB1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). We then analyzed if the stress of proteasome inhibition could cause a similar response. We performed immunostaining of IPO5 and KPNB1 in COS7 cells using a proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Consistent with arsenite, MG132 caused the accumulation of cytoplasmic granules that contained IPO5 and KPNB1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). These results support the idea that RNP granules that contain KPNB1 and IPO5 are formed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Spermiogenesis is the late stage of spermatogenesis in which round spermatids differentiate into spermatozoa accompanied by drastic morphological changes such as flagellum formation, chromatin remodeling, and cytoplasmic removal. Protein ubiquitination of target proteins for degradation by the UPS is crucial to maintain functional spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Richburg et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we focused on testis-enriched F-box protein FBXO24. We confirmed that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> was predominantly expressed in the testis, and its expression level increased in the late stage of spermatogenesis. The analyses using cultured cells and Tg testes suggested that FBXO24 could interact with SKP1 to form the SCF complex. Further, we deleted <italic>Fxbo24</italic> using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and found that <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice exhibited abnormal flagellar structures and male infertility. <italic>Fxbo24</italic> KO spermatozoa failed to fertilize eggs even with IVF, while ICSI gave offspring.</p>
<p>More detailed observation of the midpiece of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa using electron microscopy revealed abnormalities in mitochondria coiling, which occurred in the late stages of spermatogenesis and was consistent with the <italic>Fbxo24</italic> expression timing. Furthermore, <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa showed markedly reduced motility. These results suggest that the primary cause of infertility is impaired sperm migration in the female reproductive tract due to reduced sperm motility. In addition to the abnormal flagellar morphology, <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa could not undergo the acrosome reaction even after the A23187 treatment. We analyzed the amounts of SNARE-related proteins and PLCD4; however, no overt differences were found between the control and <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa. Recently, we found that FER1L5 is important for Ca<sup>2+</sup>- dependent acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Morohoshi et al., 2023</xref>), but no antibodies are available to analyze the amount of FER1L5. It is possible that FER1L5 or unknown proteins involved in the acrosome reaction deteriorated in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa. Alternatively, it is possible that acrosome reaction failure may be caused by impaired sperm capacitation associated with abnormal flagellar structures.</p>
<p>The TEM analyses observed numerous membraneless electron-dense granules in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO sperm flagella. Although the irregular arrangement of sperm mitochondria has been reported in KO mice of some mitochondria-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shimada et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">2019</xref>), numerous granules have not been observed in these KO spermatozoa. Proteomic analyses revealed that IPO5 and KPNB1 accumulated in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa without significant elevation of mitochondria-associated proteins. The lack of accumulation of KPNA2, which is part of the importin family, also suggests that there is selectivity in the accumulated proteins. Abnormal accumulation of proteins, including IPO5 and KPNB1, may lead to morphological abnormalities in sperm flagella since the SCF complex is critical for protein degradation and consequently regulate various cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>). FBXO24 likely plays a role in catalyzing protein degradation during spermiogenesis. Because we found that FBXO24 could interact with IPO5 in testes and catalyze ubiquitination of IPO5, FBXO24 may degrade IPO5 in the testis.</p>
<p>Recently, mice lacking both PSME4 and ECPAS, proteasome-associated proteins, were shown to exhibit impaired male fertility with disorganized mitochondrial sheath, but numerous membraneless granules were not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sato et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that the accumulation of the granules is specific to <italic>Fbxo24</italic> deletion rather than simply caused by proteasome defects.</p>
<p>In addition to proteins, the total RNA amount increased in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa, suggesting that the abnormal granules observed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO flagella may consist of RNPs. In germ cells, RNP granules have been well studied and shown to be essential for spermatogeneses, such as IMCs, CBs, reticulated bodies, and CB remnants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chuma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meikar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shimada et al., 2023</xref>). RNP granules are membraneless electron-dense structures that are similar to the abnormal granules in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO; however, the localization of MIWI, an IMC and CB marker, and TSKS, a reticulated body and CB remnant marker, was not disrupted in the KO. These results suggest that electron-dense granules accumulated in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa are different from well-studied RNP granules. SGs are also membraneless electron-dense granules that contain RNPs, which assemble through liquidâliquid phase separation in response to cellular stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Buchan and Parker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>). While transient SGs formed in response to oxidative stress or heat shock play roles in translational arrest to ensure cell survival, chronic SGs are relevant to neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Marcelo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Reineke and Neilson, 2019</xref>). It has been shown that, under arsenite-induced oxidative stress, KPNB1 relocates to SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chang and Tarn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mahboubi et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Because we found that not only KPNB1 but also IPO5 can be recruited to SGs after arsenite or proteasome inhibitor treatment, electron-dense granules observed in <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO spermatozoa may be RNP granules consisting of IPO5 and KPNB1. Our results suggest that FBXO24 is responsible for degrading proteins such as IPO5, which may prevent the accumulation of abnormal RNP granules. While this paper was under review, another group reported analyses of <italic>Fbxo24</italic> KO mice that exhibit not only disorganized mitochondrial coiling but also abnormal head morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al., 2024</xref>). The differences from our study may be due to different mouse genetic backgrounds. The other group showed that FBXO24 mediates the degradation of MIWI via K48-linked polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al., 2024</xref>). FBXO24 may be involved in the degradation of multiple proteins including IPO5 to support proper spermiogenesis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we reveal that numerous RNP granules accumulated in sperm flagella when FBXO24, which is related to the UPS was depleted. Small numbers of the RNP granules were found even in the control, suggesting that the ability to generate the granules is present in WT testes but may be suppressed by FBXO24. FBXO24 can be a key molecule for understanding the formation and function of the aberrant RNP granules in male fertility. Because amino acid sequences and expression patterns of FBXO24 are conserved, FBXO24 may also play similar roles in human testes. Our research may lead to development of new approaches to infertility treatment and nonhormonal male contraceptives.</p>

<p>We appreciate the positive comment of reviewer #1.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The lack of specific antibodies against FBXO24. Some of the experiments showing a specific phenotype are descriptive and lack of logical explanation about the possible mechanism (i.e. AR or the tail structure).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because we could not obtain specific antibodies against FBXO24, we generated Fbxo24-FLAG transgenic mice, which can be used to show the interaction between FBXO24 and IPO5. For the mechanism of impaired acrosome reaction, we added some results and discussion as written in the response to the question (1) of reviewer #1 (public review). For the mechanism of abnormal flagellar structure, we added new results and fixed the manuscript as written in the response to the major comments of reviewer #3 (recommendations for the authors).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>The paper is excellent and employs a wide variety of methods to substantiate the conclusions. I have very few questions to ask:</p>
<p>(1) KO mice cannot undergo acrosome reaction (AR) even spontaneously. How do you account for this, given that no visible defects were observed in the acrosome?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One possibility is that Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa cannot undergo capacitation; however, it is difficult to analyze the capacitation status such as tyrosine phosphorylation because most Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa are not alive (Figure S3A). Other possibility is that AR-related proteins are affected in Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa. Therefore, we analyzed the amounts of AR-related proteins with mass spectrometry (Figure S3C). Although previous studies indicate that the assembly of the SNARE complex is a key event prior to AR [Hutt et al., 2005 (PMID: 15774481); Katafuchi et al., 2000 (PMID: 11066067); Schulz et al., 1997 (PMID: 9356173); Tomes et al., 2002 (PMID: 11884041)], no clear differences were detected for SNARE proteins (Figure S3C and D). PLCD4 that is important for AR [Fukami et al., 2001 (PMID: 11340203)) was also detected in Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa (Figure S3C). Although we could not find differences in the amounts of AR-related proteins, it is still possible that FER1L5, another AR-related protein [Morohoshi et al., 2023 (PMID: 36696506)] not detected in the mass spectrometry analyses, or AR-related proteins not yet identified are affected in Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa. We added these results and discussion (line 160-166 and 305-312).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) KO sperm are unable to migrate in the female tract, and, more intriguingly, they do not pass through the utero-tubal junction (UTJ). The levels of ADAM3 are normal, suggesting that the phenotype is influenced by other factors. The authors should investigate the levels of Ly6K since mice also exhibit the same phenotype but with normal levels of ADAM3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We detected LY6K in Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa with immunoblotting, but no difference was found.</p>
<p>We added the results (Figure S3E and line 172â175).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 4A, the authors assert that &quot;RBGS Tg mice revealed that mitochondria were abnormally segmented in Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa.&quot; I am unable to discern this from the picture shown in that panel. Could you please provide a more detailed explanation or display the information more explicitly?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the ambiguous explanation on the morphology of sperm mitochondria sheath. Fbxo24 KO cauda epidydimal spermatozoa shows disorganized mitochondria sheath rather than âsegmentedâ. We fixed the sentence (line 190-192) and added white arrowheads that indicate the disorganized regions (Figure 4A).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Kaneda et al &quot;FBXO24 ensures male fertility by preventing abnormal accumulation of membraneless granules in sperm flagella&quot; is a significant paper on the role of FBXO24 in murine male germ cell development and sperm ultrastructure and function. The body of experimental evidence that the authors present is extraordinarily strong in both breadth and depth. The authors investigate the protein's functions in male germ cells and sperm using a wide variety of approaches but focusing predominantly on their novel mouse model featuring deletion of the Fbxo24 gene and its product. Using this mouse, and a cross of it with another model that expresses reporters in the head and midpiece, they logically build from one experiment to the next. Together, their data show that this protein is involved in the regulation of membraneless electron-dense structures; loss of FBXO24 led to an accumulation of these materials and defects in the sperm flagellum and fertilizing ability. Interestingly, the authors found that several of the best-known components of electron-dense ribonucleoprotein granules that are found in the intermitochondrial cement and chromatoid body were not disrupted in the Fbxo24 knockout, suggesting that the electron-dense material and these structures are not all the same, and the biology is more complicated than some might have thought. They found evidence for the most changes in IPO5 and KPNB1, and biochemical evidence that FBXO24 and IPO5 could interact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the summary comment of reviewer #2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors are to be commended for the thoroughness of their experimental approaches and the extent to which they investigated impacts on sperm function and potential biochemical mechanisms. Very briefly, they start by showing that the Fbxo24 message is present in spermatids and that the protein can interact with SKP1, in a way that is dependent on its F-box domain. This points toward a potential function in protein degradation. To test this, they next made the knockout mouse, validated it, and found the males to be sterile, although capable of plugging a female. Looking at the sperm, they identified a number of ultrastructural and morphological abnormalities, which they looked at in high resolution using TEM. They also cross their model with RBGS mice so that they have reporters in both the acrosome and mitochondria. The authors test a variety of sperm functions, including motility parameters, ability to fertilize by IVF, cumulus-free IVF, zona-free-IVF, and ICSI. They found that ICSI could rescue the knockout but not other assisted reproductive technologies. Defects in male fertility likely resulted from motility disruption and failure to get through the utero-tubal junction but defects in acrosome exocytosis also were noted. The authors performed thorough investigations including both targeted and unbiased approaches such as mass spectrometry. These enabled them to show that although the loss of the FBXO24 protein led to more RNA and elevated levels of some proteins, it did not change others that were previously identified in the electron-dense RNP material.</p>
<p>The manuscript will be highly significant in the field because the exact functions of the electron-dense RNP materials have remained somewhat elusive for decades. Much progress has been made in the past 15 years but this work shows that the situation is more complex than previously recognized. The results show critical impacts of protein degradation in the differentiation process that enables sperm to change from non-descript round cells into highly polarized and compartmentalized mature sperm, with an equally highly compartmentalized flagellum. This manuscript also sets a high bar for the field in terms of how thorough it is, which reveals wide-ranging impacts on processes such as mitochondrial compaction and arrangement in the midpiece, the correct building of the major cytoskeletal elements in the flagellum, etc.</p>

<p>We appreciate the positive comment of reviewer #2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are no real weaknesses in the manuscript that result from anything in the control of the authors. They attempted to rescue the knockout by expressing a FLAG-tagged Fbxo24 transgene, but that did not rescue the phenotype, either because of inappropriate levels/timing/location of expression, or because of interference by the tag. They also could not make anti-FBXO24 that worked for coimmunoprecipitation experiments, so relied on the FLAG epitope, an approach that successfully showed co-IP with IPO5 and SKP1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We could not rescue the phenotype with Fbxo24-FLAG transgene, but different Fbxo24 mutant mice show the same phenotypes (Figure S6G). Further, another group showed that Fbxo24 KO mice exhibited abnormal mitochondrial coiling [Li et al., 2024 (PMID: 38470475)], confirming that</p>
<p>FBXO24 is involved in the mitochondrial sheath formation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors found that FBXO24, a testis-enriched F-box protein, is indispensable for male fertility. Fbxo24 KO mice exhibited malformed sperm flagellar and compromised sperm motility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the summary comment of reviewer #3.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The phenotype of Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa was well analyzed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the positive comment of reviewer #3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors observed numerous membraneless electron-dense granules in the Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa. They also showed abnormal accumulation of two importins, IPO5 and KPNB1, in the Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa. However, the data presented in the manuscript do not support the conclusion that FBXO24 ensures male fertility by preventing the abnormal accumulation of membraneless granules in sperm flagella, as indicated in the manuscript title.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fbxo24 KO mice showed abnormal accumulation of membraneless granules in sperm flagella and male infertility, suggesting that FBXO24 is involved in these processes, but there are no results that show the direct relationship as reviewer #3 mentioned. Therefore, we fixed the title.</p>

<p>On page 4, lines 152-154, the authors introduce the RBGS mouse model and use it in their experiments.</p>
<p>However, they left out an obvious but helpful sentence that tells the reader that they crossed the Fbxo24-null mouse with the RBGS. As one continues reading it is clear, but best to avoid even slight confusion.</p>

<p>We revised the explanation in the result section (line 150-153).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors found that FBXO24, a testis-enriched F-box protein, is indispensable for male fertility. Fbxo24 KO mice exhibited malformed sperm flagellar and compromised sperm motility. The phenotype of Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa was well analyzed.</p>
<p>The authors observed numerous membraneless electron-dense granules in the Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa. They also showed abnormal accumulation of two importins, IPO5 and KPNB1, in the Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa. However, the data presented in the manuscript do not support the conclusion that FBXO24 ensures male fertility by preventing the abnormal accumulation of membraneless granules in sperm flagella, as indicated in the manuscript title.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fbxo24 KO mice showed abnormal accumulation of membraneless granules in sperm flagella and male infertility, suggesting that FBXO24 is involved in these processes, but there are no results that show the direct relationship as reviewer #3 mentioned. Therefore, we fixed the title.</p>

<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>In the title, abstract, introduction, and some sections such as lines 275-276, the authors conclude that FBXO24 prevents the accumulation of importins and RNP granules during spermiogenesis. However, the provided data do not substantiate this claim. To provide conclusive evidence to support the current title, the authors need to present evidence supporting: 1) direct degradation of IPO5 and KPNB1 by FBXO24; 2) the direct requirement of IPO5 for the formation of the membraneless granules, and 3) infertility resulting from the presence of membraneless granules, rather than other issues such as abnormal ODF and AX.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) direct degradation of IPO5 and KPNB1 by FBXO24.</p>
<p>To examine if IPO5 can be degraded by FBXO24, we performed a ubiquitination assay using HEK293T cells. Ubiquitination of IPO5 was upregulated in the presence of WT FBXO24 but not with the mutant ÎF-box FBXO24, suggesting that IPO5 can be ubiquitinated by FBXO24. We did not examine the ubiquitination of KPNB1 because we failed to construct a plasmid vector expressing mouse KPNB1. We think that KPNB1 is not the substrate because we did not detect the interaction between FBXO24 and KPNB1 (Figure 5E). We added the results of the ubiquitination assay (Figure</p>
<p>5F and line 261-265) and mentioned it in the abstract (line 35).</p>
<p>(2) the direct requirement of IPO5 for the formation of the membraneless granules.</p>
<p>(3) infertility resulting from the presence of membraneless granules, rather than other issues such as abnormal ODF and AX.</p>
<p>We revealed that IPO5 aggregate under stress condition in COS7 cells (Figure 6C and D); however, we did not examine whether IPO5 is required for the formation of the membraneless granules. We consider that protein degradation systems such as PROTAC or Trim-Away to knockdown IPO5 at the protein level in Fbxo24 KO mice could be a good way to see if the membraneless granules are diminished and male fertility is rescued. However, it takes time to apply the degradation systems in vivo. Therefore, we would like to leave this rescue experiment for future studies. We fixed the title and  abstract (line 37-38), and removed the last sentence of the introduction.</p>
<p>Also, the other group reported the analyses of Fbxo24 KO mice [Li et al., 2024 (PMID: 38470475)] right after we submitted our manuscript to the eLife. They reported not only disorganized flagellar structures but also abnormal head morphology, which may lead to male infertility. The differences from our study may be due to different mouse genetic backgrounds. We mentioned it in the discussion section (line 348-353).</p>

<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) The authors claimed a significant increase in the total amount of RNAs in Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa (lines 259-261), suggesting that the ...contain RNAs. More direct evidence supporting this claim should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We show that the amounts of IPO5 and KBNB1 increased in Fbxo24 KO spermatozoa (Figure 5A and B), both of which could be incorporated into RNP granules in COS7 cells (Figure 6C and D), supporting the idea that membraneless electron-dense structures may be RNP granules. However, because we did not show direct evidence that electron-dense structures contain RNAs, we removed the sentences (line 259-261 of the 1st submission manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The author should provide an explanation for the absence of a FLAG band in the input Tg in Figure 5D and the larger size of the IPO5 band in the FLAG-IP group compared to the input. Similar observations are also noted in Figure 5E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The FLAG band is weak because the protein amount is low. When we increase the contrast, we can see the FLAG band. We added an image with high contrast (Figure 5D). Sometimes, proteins run differently with SDS-PAGE after immunoprecipitation, likely due to varying protein composition in the sample. We explained it in the figure legend (line 868-869).</p>

<p>(3) In Line 526, clarify the procedure for sperm purification, and determine the potential for contamination from somatic cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not perform sperm purification, but when we observed spermatozoa obtained from cauda epididymis, we rarely observed either somatic cells or immature spermatogenic cells. We added  pictures in Figure S7. Further, we added detailed explanation about how to collect spermatozoa from the epididymis (line 549-550).</p>
