<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In skeletal muscle, muscle stem cells (MuSC) are the main cells responsible for regeneration upon injury. In diseased skeletal muscle, it would be therapeutically advantageous to replace defective MuSCs, or rejuvenate them with drugs to enhance their self-renewal and ensure longterm regenerative potential. One limitation of the replacement approach has been the inability to efficiently expand MuSCs <italic>ex vivo</italic>, while maintaining their stemness and engraftment abilities. Herein, we show that inhibition of type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) with MS023 increases the proliferative capacity of <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultured MuSCs. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultured MuSCs revealed the emergence of novel subpopulations in MS023-treated cells which are defined by elevated Pax7 expression and markers of MuSC quiescence, both features of enhanced self-renewal. Furthermore, the scRNAseq identified MS023-specific subpopulations to be metabolically reprogrammed with upregulated glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Transplantation of MuSCs treated with MS023 had a better ability to repopulate the MuSC niche and contributed more robustly to muscle regeneration following injury. Interestingly, the preclinical mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy had increased bilateral grip strength 10 days after a single intraperitoneal dose of MS023. These findings suggest that type I PRMT inhibition metabolically reprograms MuSCs resulting in improved self-renewal and muscle regeneration fitness.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) reside on the periphery of muscle fibers in skeletal muscle and are activated following injury to drive muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lepper <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Relaix &amp; Zammit, 2012</xref>). Major challenges arise when attempting to manipulate MuSCs <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Purified MuSCs spontaneously differentiate upon <italic>ex vivo</italic> expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fu <italic>et al</italic>, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sacco <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), limiting the potential of CRISPR-based applications and stem cell engraftment therapy. It is known that <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultured MuSCs are vastly inferior at engrafting and contributing to muscle regeneration compared to freshly isolated MuSCs, indicating the importance of retaining stemness for MuSC engraftment and muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Montarras <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sakai <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Cell-intrinsic defects in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) prevent MuSCs from maintaining a proper balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, ultimately leading to depletion of regeneration-competent MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bentzinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dumont <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>MuSCs have metabolic flexibility that allows them to adapt to demands presented by their changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Relaix <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Indeed, metabolic signatures are strong contributors to the heterogeneity observed in isolated MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cho &amp; Doles, 2017</xref>). Several findings have indicated that the metabolic state of MuSCs is inextricably tied to their function and fate. Quiescent MuSCs predominantly rely on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Machado <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ryall <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). While glycolysis remains low in quiescent cells, it is upregulated as MuSCs begin to proliferate following activation, representing a metabolic shift in activated MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">L’Honore <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ryall <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). The dynamic regulation of metabolic state during the transition from MuSC quiescence to proliferation therefore presents a unique avenue to regulate MuSC regenerative capacity. There is growing evidence to suggest a role for the post-translational modification arginine methylation in muscle cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blanc &amp; Richard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Saber &amp; Rudnicki, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">vanLieshout &amp; Ljubicic, 2019</xref>). Arginine methylation is carried out by 9 protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Xu &amp; Richard, 2021</xref>). PRMTs are classified according to their catalytic activity: type I enzymes (ex: PRMT1, PRMT2, PRMT3, CARM1, PRMT6 and PRMT8) catalyze arginine asymmetrical dimethylation (ADMA), type II enzymes (ex: PRMT5, PRMT9) catalyze arginine symmetrical dimethylation (SDMA), and the unique type III enzyme PRMT7 catalyzes arginine monomethylation (MMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bedford &amp; Clarke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jain &amp; Clarke, 2019</xref>). PRMTs methylate many cellular proteins including histones and are known epigenetic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Xu &amp; Richard, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>PRMTs are known regulators of MuSCs. PRMT1-null mouse MuSCs are highly proliferative and can be expanded in culture, but are unable to terminate differentiation, leading to a severe muscle regeneration defect <italic>in vivo</italic> following muscle injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanc <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). CARM1 is a well-known transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors and p300/CPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bedford &amp; Clarke, 2009</xref>) and it is a mediator of skeletal muscle plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Saber &amp; Rudnicki, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">vanLieshout &amp; Ljubicic, 2019</xref>). CARM1 methylates the myogenic transcription factor, PAX7, to complex with histone methyltransferase complex to allow the expression of myogenic transcription factor Myf5 during asymmetric stem cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kawabe <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). CARM1 regulates MuSCs metabolism by methylating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Stouth <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). PRMT5 regulates MuSC proliferation by epigenetically downregulating expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and deletion of PRMT5 in MuSCs blocks their expansion <italic>ex vivo</italic> and causes defects in muscle regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). PRMT7 functions in the myogenic process and is required for MuSC self-renewal and muscle regeneration, as deletion of PRMT7 in MuSCs leads to persistent p21 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blanc <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the importance in maintaining MuSC stemness and the enhanced MuSC proliferation observed with PRMT1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanc <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), we aimed to determine whether the reversible inhibition of type I PRMTs using the MS023 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eram <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>) would affect cellular metabolism and fulfil the requirements of generating a stem-like MuSC in culture with subsequent regenerative capabilities. Small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic regulators are a promising avenue to pursue in the treatment of muscle wasting diseases. Indeed, an inhibitor of Setd7-mediated lysine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Judson <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), was shown to have beneficial effects on self-renewal and regeneration.</p>
<p>Herein, we show that MS023, an inhibitor of type I PRMTs, fulfils the requirements of a reversible inhibitor which maintains the stemness of cultured MuSCs, while allowing for engraftment and regenerative capabilities. Although type I PRMTs have well-known indications as epigenetic modulators, we demonstrate that targeting type I PRMTs alters the metabolic profile of dividing MuSCs to favour self-renewal and improve regeneration.</p>

<title>Type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 enhances self-renewal and <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion of MuSCs</title>
<p>We isolated single muscle fibers from 6 to 8 week old C57BL/6 wild type mice, cultured them in vitro with MS023 or vehicle (DMSO) for 48 h, and stained them for the myogenic transcription factor Pax7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Seale <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Soleimani <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>), and the proliferation marker ki67. The number of Pax7/ki67 double-positive cells increased significantly in the presence of MS023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eram <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) for 48 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>). We observed a significant increase in the number of clusters with 3 or more cells with MS023 treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), as observed for PRMT1-deficient MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanc <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Treatment with a specific CARM1 inhibitor TP-064 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nakayama <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>) over the course of 6 days did not increase MuSC cell number, ruling out that MS023 increased proliferation is mediated by CARM1 (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S1A</xref>). These data show that type I PRMT inhibition causes <italic>in vitro</italic> MuSC expansion and is likely by the inhibition of PRMT1. To determine the activation state of these fiber-associated MuSCs, we examined fibers after 48 h in culture for the expression of Pax7 and the myogenic regulator transcription factor, MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rudnicki <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Troy <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, MS023 treatment restricted the proportion of committed Pax7<sup>neg</sup>/MyoD<sup>pos</sup> cells, while expanding the proportion of activated and cycling cells (Pax7<sup>pos</sup>/MyoD<sup>pos</sup>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>).</p>

<p>MuSCs spontaneously differentiate into non-cycling myoblasts and lose their stemness <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Montarras <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ryall <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sacco <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The enhanced proliferation of MuSCs observed with type I PRMT inhibition on muscle fibers prompted us to examine whether similar effects could be achieved with FACS-purified MuSCs cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>. MuSCs incubated with MS023 for 48 h had reduced ADMA containing proteins, as visualized by immunoblotting (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S1B</xref>), and had increased proliferative capacity of MuSCs, as determined by ki67 immunofluorescence (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S1C</xref>) and by FACS analysis of ki67-PE intracellularly-stained MuSCs (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S1D</xref>). These data are consistent with what was observed in muscle fiber-associated MuSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>). Importantly, immunofluorescence analysis of myogenic markers in cultured MuSCs revealed that MS023 treatment prevented initiation of differentiation, as indicated by the significantly reduced sub-population of committed Pax7<sup>neg</sup>/MyoD<sup>pos</sup> cells compared to control DMSO culture (13% versus 31%, respectively) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Additionally, there was an increase in the proportion of cells that have retained their stemness by delaying expression of MyoD (Pax7<sup>pos</sup>/MyoD<sup>neg</sup>) in the MS023-treated samples compared to DMSO (40% versus 9%, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Similar proportions were observed with fiber-associated MuSCs (34% versus 14%, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that the impediment of precocious differentiation observed by treatment with MS023 led to enhanced long-term culture capabilities of MuSCs up to the 14<sup>th</sup> passage (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S1E</xref>). Altogether, these findings indicate that treatment with MS023 maintained cultured MuSCs in a stem-like state.</p>

<title>Transcriptionally distinct MuSC sub-populations emerge under type I PRMT inhibition</title>
<p>To identify subpopulations of MuSCs generated by MS023, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). MuSCs were purified from 8 week-old wild type C57BL/6 mice in biological duplicates immediately after 1) isolation (termed d0; sample day 0), and 2) culture in growth medium for 4 days with 0.033% DMSO as control (sample d4) or with 1μM MS023 (sample d4MS023), and 3) grown in growth media for 6 days with 0.033% DMSO removed at day 4 (sample d6), or 6 days in culture with 1μM MS023 removed at day 4 (sample d6MS023rd4). Cells were collected at these time points and processed on the 10x Genomics Chromium platform for scRNAseq. Data filtering and analysis was performed using the Seurat package for scRNAseq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Butler <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). After filtering out low-quality cells, approximately 4,000 cells (average, 3,887 ± 44 cells) from each sample were retained for subsequent analysis (Supplemental Table S2). A Pearson correlation of &gt;0.98 (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2A</xref>) was obtained between replicates and we chose to include a replicate for each time point for analysis.</p>
<p>Dimensionality reduction was performed using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) on pooled cells from all samples, resulting in 10 distinct subpopulations of myogenic cells (labelled 0-9, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2B</xref>). We then visualized the distribution of individual samples within the UMAP embedding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2C</xref>). To determine the identity of the 10 subpopulations, we examined the expression of <italic>Pax7</italic> and the bHLH transcription factors <italic>Myod1, Myf5 and Myog</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Two populations of <italic>Pax7</italic> and <italic>Myf5</italic> expressing cells were observed which we called quiescence 1 and 2 (Q1 and Q2), while the two populations that expressed both <italic>Myod1</italic> and <italic>Myog</italic> were called differentiated myoblasts 1 and 2 (DM1 and DM2, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The remaining <italic>Myod1</italic> populations we named myoblast clusters 1 to 5 (M1-M5), and the last one C1 for committed 1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The freshly isolated MuSCs of day 0 (d0) segregated into Q1 and Q2 (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2D</xref>, Supplemental Table S3), which in addition to <italic>Pax7</italic> and <italic>Myf5</italic>, expressed markers of MuSC quiescence (<italic>Fos, Egr1, Jun</italic>), and early activation markers (<italic>MyoD1, Mt1, Mt2</italic>, Supplemental Table S1). Our Q1 and Q2 populations are similar to quiescence and early activation populations reported recently from freshly isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Micheli <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dell’Orso <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">van Velthoven <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). The two <italic>Myog</italic> expressing clusters expressed other markers of early differentiation (<italic>Acta2</italic>; DM1), and late differentiation (<italic>Tnnt3, Myl1, Acta1</italic>; DM2) (Supplemental Table S1). An enrichment for cell cycle and proliferation markers was found throughout the remaining 5 undifferentiated myoblast clusters (<italic>Cdk1, Ccnd1, Mki67, Top2a, Birc5</italic>, and <italic>Cenpa</italic>; M1-M5) (Supplemental Table S1).</p>
<p>The control DMSO day 4 (d4) sample was distributed among 3 subpopulations of myoblasts (M1, M2, and M4), while two additional days in culture day 6 (d6) contained M1, M2, and M4, but also had differentiated clusters DM1 and DM2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, 2D</xref>; <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2E</xref>, Supplemental Table S3). In comparison, day 4 with MS023 (d4MS023) was distributed uniquely among clusters M3 and M5. Day 6 MS023 removed at day 4 (d6MS023rd4) had clusters of day 4 MS023 treatment, as well as DM1 and DM2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, 2D</xref> <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2E</xref>, Supplemental Table S3). Notably, d6MS023rd4 had nearly twice as many cells in DM1 (20.8%) as d6 (11.5%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that MS023 inhibition was reversible and cells enter the differentiation program more efficiently. In addition, all samples had in common a small subpopulation of cells (&lt;200 cells) in cluster C1 (Supplemental Table S3).</p>
<p>Analysis of the top 100 enriched genes in each cluster revealed distinct transcriptional profiles (Supplemental Table S1). For example, the d4MS023-occupied cluster M5 was enriched for cell cycle markers (<italic>Cdk1, Cdk4, Ccnd3</italic>) and other markers of proliferation (<italic>Mki67, Birc5, Top2a</italic>) (Supplemental Table S1). The other d4MS023-occupied cluster M3 retained some markers of proliferation (<italic>Ccnd1</italic>), however also expressed the cell cycle inhibitor <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> and the structural muscle gene <italic>Myl6</italic>, in addition to a strong enrichment for ribosomal genes (over 20% of the top100 markers belonged to the ribosomal protein family, a feature that is unique to cluster M3). Therefore, clusters M3 and M5 are unique to MS023-treated MuSCs and represent robust proliferation clusters with extensive ribosomal protein expression.</p>
<p>The top 100 enriched genes in each sample were also investigated (Supplemental Table S2, Heatmap in <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2J</xref>). Interestingly, d4MS023 genes were strongly enriched for the reactome pathways of respiratory electron transport, the citric acid cycle, and formation of ATP. In contrast, d4 was enriched for the reactome pathways of RNA metabolism, translation, and mRNA splicing (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2H, S2I</xref>).</p>
<p>The d4 cluster M2 shared many of the same gene enrichments as cluster M5 (<italic>Cdk1, Mki67, Birc5, Top2a)</italic> (Supplemental Table S1). Conversely, the other d4 cluster M4 down-regulated these genes while maintaining expression of replication-dependent transcripts such as <italic>Ube2c</italic> and <italic>Dut</italic>, indicating increased heterogeneity in cycling cells compared to d4MS023 (Supplemental Table S1). The final d4 cluster M1 resembled the transitional d4MS023 cluster M3 in that it expressed a mix of cell cycle (<italic>Ccnd1</italic>) and differentiation (<italic>Myl6</italic>) markers, however lacked the enrichment of ribosomal genes observed in M3 (Supplemental Table S1).</p>
<p>It was important to note is the stark difference in the pathway enrichment signatures of the transitional clusters M1 (d4) and M3 (d4MS023). The genes which were uniquely enriched in cluster M3 were strongly associated with protein synthesis (e.g., <italic>Rps9, Eef1g, Uba52</italic>) (Supplemental Table S1, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2H, S2I</xref>). In contrast, the enriched genes unique to cluster M1 were associated with cellular response to toxic substance and cellular detoxification (<italic>Anxa1, Txn1, Hmox1, Prdx5</italic>) (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2H</xref>, S2I).</p>
<p>We further investigated the distribution of expression levels for <italic>Pax7, Myf5, Myod1</italic>, and <italic>Myog</italic> across clusters and samples (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2F, S2G</xref>). We observed a unique expression pattern for <italic>Pax7</italic> in d4MS023 and d6MS023rd4 samples (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2G</xref>). In d4 MuSCs, cells were divided into two populations, Pax7-negative (expression level 0) and Pax7-positive (standard distribution around expression level 1). In d6 myoblasts, Pax7-positive cells maintain the same level of <italic>Pax7</italic> expression, but a higher proportion of cells became Pax7-negative, consistent with canonical <italic>Pax7</italic> expression during MuSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yin <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Meanwhile, with MS023 treatment, three subpopulations emerged, a Pax7-negative (expression level 0) and two Pax7-positive (standard distribution around expression level 1) populations. The Pax7-positive populations in d4MS023 and d4MS023rd4 had higher <italic>Pax7</italic> expression levels than their untreated counterparts and were more comparable with day 0 (quiescent) MuSC <italic>Pax7</italic> expression levels (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2G</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest that the MuSC subpopulations generated by MS023 treatment possess several unique features. Day 4 MS023 cells had proliferating signatures, less heterogeneity and were localized mainly within one cluster (cluster M5), unlike day 4 DMSO proliferating cells which were divided into two clusters (clusters M2 and M4), each with different expression profiles of cell cycle regulators. Cluster M5 had a striking enrichment for genes involved in cellular metabolism that was unique to M5. Furthermore, the day 4 MS023 transitional cluster M3 had a strong enrichment for genes involved in mRNA translation which was not observed in the day 4 DMSO transitional cluster M1. Analysis of expression level patterns in d4MS023 cells indicated a subpopulation of MuSCs with elevated <italic>Pax7</italic> expression compared to day 4 DMSO control cells. Therefore, through repression of type I PRMTs with MS023, we have reprogramed MuSCs to acquire a unique and previously uncharacterized identity.</p>

<title>Trajectory analysis reveals temporally distinct expression patterns in MuSCs treated with MS023 with unique enrichment for energy metabolism</title>
<p>Using the Monocle v2.16.0 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Trapnell <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), we conducted trajectory analysis on 3 groups of samples to obtain hierarchical links between clusters: (1) all samples; (2) d0, d4, d6; (3) d0, d4MS023, d6MS023rd4. Monocle analysis placed each cell from the 9 clusters (Q1/Q2, M1-5, and DM1/2) onto a pseudotime axis based on differential gene expression patterns. The trajectory analysis of all samples pooled produced a pseudotime axis with a single branchpoint and 3 cell states which we labelled Q for quiescence, M for myoblast, and DM for differentiating myoblast (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Cells from the Q1 and Q2 clusters were found at the beginning of pseudotime, cells from the M1-5 clusters populated the area around the branchpoint, and cells from DM1/2 mainly populated the upward-oriented branch, following an overall trajectory of Q1/2®M1-5®DM1/2 (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Day 0 cells populated the beginning of pseudotime, with d4 and d4MS023 cells appearing shortly after. d6 and d6MS023rd4 cells had a similar distribution as d4 and d4MS023, with the exception of having increased density around the terminus of the upward-oriented branch (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S3A</xref>). Interestingly, d4MS023 and d6MS023rd4 cells emerge later along the pseudotime axis than d4 and d6 cells and appeared closer to the branchpoint (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S3A</xref>).</p>
<p>We examined the genes which were significantly differentially regulated across the branchpoint of the pooled sample trajectory to confirm whether this split is representative of the molecular events which determine whether MuSCs will commit to differentiation or continue to proliferate. As expected, genes involved in the myogenic process were highly upregulated along the branch that diverges upwards along the trajectory (eg. <italic>Tnnt1, Tnnt2, Acta1, Myog</italic>), while genes involved in cell cycle and proliferation were upregulated along the branch that diverges downwards along the trajectory (eg. <italic>Mki67, Cdca8, Top2a, Birc5</italic>) (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S3B, S3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Trajectory analysis was also performed on a subset of samples (d0®d4®d6; DMSO trajectory and d0®d4MS023®d4MS023rd4; MS023 trajectory) to identify treatment-specific alterations in the molecular events which drive fate-determining decisions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, 3C, 3E, 3F</xref>). Both the DMSO and MS023 trajectories retained a single branch point indicating that the overall lineage patterns were conserved.</p>
<p>Closer inspection of genes which were significantly differentially regulated across the branchpoint in the DMSO and MS023 trajectories revealed a unique signature in the MS023-trajectory. The list of genes which changed significantly across the branchpoint for both trajectories (7094 for the DMSO trajectory, 7616 for the MS023 trajectory) were filtered for genes which were unique to each condition. The DMSO trajectory had 1,517 unique genes, while the MS023 trajectory had 2037 unique genes (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S3D</xref>). Interestingly, the MS023 trajectory-unique genes revealed an enrichment for oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial ATP synthesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F, 3G</xref>), consistent with cluster marker analysis for MS023-specific clusters (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2H, S2I</xref>: <italic>electron transport, ATP synthesis</italic>). Expression of select genes involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (<italic>Ndua2, Ndufa4, Uqcr10, Cox4I1, Cox5b, Cox8a, Atp5c1, AtpIf1, Atp5j2</italic>) were further examined for expression level within the scRNAseq UMAP plot, and it was confirmed that they were elevated in MS023-specific clusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, RT-qPCR analysis of a subset of these genes confirmed they were upregulated in d4MS023 MuSCs compared to d4 MuSCs (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S4A</xref>). Therefore, these pathways both define the unique identity of MS023-treated MuSCs, and serve as driving forces in their fate-determination. MS023-treated proliferating MuSCs retain oxidative phosphorylation and have elevated glycolysis</p>

<p>The transition of MuSC from quiescence to proliferation is accompanied by a sharp reduction in oxidative metabolism and a shift towards glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">L’Honore <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ryall <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the retention of a transcriptional signature indicating high levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in MS023-treated cells was unexpected. We sought validate these findings in <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultured MuSCs by performing metabolic analysis with Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent). We isolated MuSCs from C57BL/6 wild type mice and seeded them onto matrigel-coated 96-well plates and treated with 1μM MS023 or DMSO for 48 hours (n= 3 mice per treatment condition). Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was first measured to characterize mitochondrial bioenergetics (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). As predicted, MS023-treated MuSCs displayed increased OCR measurements at nearly all timepoints (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>p</italic>= 0.000001 - 0.02), with significantly elevated basal respiration (<italic>p</italic>= 0.006) and maximal respiration (<italic>p</italic>= 0.04), and a trend of increased ATP production (approaching statistical significance, <italic>p</italic>=0.1). To confirm an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, d4 and d4MS034 MuSCs were stained with MitoTracker CMXRos (ThermoFisher Scientific). The average intensity of the MitoTracker signal was significantly increased in d4MS023 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, 4D</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.0001)</p>
<p>We next determined whether markers of glycolysis were also differentially regulated in MS023-treated MuSCs. Indeed, several of the marker genes for MS023-specific clusters were components of glycolysis which displayed increased expression compared to clusters of DMSO-treated cells (<italic>Hk1, Eno1, Pfkm, Gapdh, Pkm, Slc2a1</italic>; <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S4B</xref>). We next performed extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) analysis as an indicator of glycolysis again using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer. MS023-treated cells were strikingly more glycolytic than DMSO-treated cells (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S4C</xref>). Glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, and glycolytic reserve were all significantly increased (<italic>p</italic>= 0.02, <italic>p</italic>= 0.004 and <italic>p</italic>= 0.001, respectively) (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S4C</xref>). As further indicators of glycolysis, the growth media supernatant of d4 and d4MS023 cultured cells was analyzed using a Nova Biomedical Bioprofile 400 analyzer (Cambridge Scientific). As expected, d4MS023 cells had significantly higher levels of glucose uptake (measured as grams/liter per 10,000 cells, <italic>p</italic>= 0.004). Additionally, the glycolytic byproduct lactate was present in higher concentrations d4MS023 media and was undetectable in the d4 media (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S4D</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that MS023-treated MuSCs utilize both OxPhos and glycolysis at elevated levels compared to untreated control cells to boost cellular metabolism, suggesting a possible mechanism through which enhanced proliferation is supported.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> expanded MS023-treated MuSCs retain the potential to become mature myoblasts</title>
<p>We next wanted to validate that removal of MS023 created conditions which are permissive to terminal differentiation. Primary MuSCs were cultured under four conditions before switching to differentiation media: (1) for four days with DMSO, (2) washout for additional two days without DMSO (DMSOwo), (3) for four days with MS023, and (4) washout for additional two days without MS023 (MS023wo). Cells treated for four days were switched to differentiation media with the continued presence of DMSO or MS023. Washout cells were switched to differentiation media without DMSO or MS023. Expectedly, cells differentiated in the presence of MS023 had an impaired ability to form multinucleated myotubes and had a poor fusion index of 19% compared to the 77% fusion index observed with DMSO treated MuSCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, 5B</xref>). Interestingly, MS023wo cells had completely restored their ability to terminate differentiation, with their fusion index of 76% being comparable to that of DMSOwo cells (78%) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, 5D</xref>). Together, these experiments define MS023 as a reversible inhibitor of type I PRMT activity which enhances MuSC proliferation and self-renewal while still allowing for full differentiation capabilities upon removal of the compound.</p>

Primary MuSCs were isolated from a β-actin-GFP reporter mouse (C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)10sb/J, Jackson Laboratory 003291, FACS gating strategy in <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S5B, S5C</xref>), and treated with MS023 or DMSO <italic>in vitro</italic> for 6 days to allow for expansion. Following culture, 15,000 GFP<sup>+</sup> myoblasts from each group were injected into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of wild type mice.

After 3 weeks, mice were sacrificed and GFP<sup>+</sup> differentiated muscle fibers were quantified following cross-sectional staining of the injured TA muscle (n=3 mice per condition) (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S5A</xref>). Interestingly, the mice which received MS023-treated MuSCs had more GFP<sup>+</sup> mature muscle fibers than the mice which received DMSO-treated MuSCs (88 fibers/section ± 32 for MS023 versus 31 fibers/section ± 14 for DMSO, <italic>p</italic>= 0.02) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E, 5F</xref>).

<title>MS023 injection increases muscle strength in <italic>mdx</italic> mice</title>
<p>Patients with DMD lack functional dystrophin, a structural protein required to connect mature myofibers to the extracellular matrix.

<p>To determine whether MS023 could provide any therapeutic benefits in a dystrophic context, we delivered 80 mg/kg of MS023 or vehicle via intraperitoneal injection to <italic>mdx</italic> mice once a day for 3 days. Tail pieces were collected 48 h after the final injection and whole tissue lysate was analyzed for ADMA- and SDMA-containing proteins using immunoblotting. We observed reduced ADMA proteins and a subsequent increase in SDMA proteins in MS023-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S6A</xref>). At 10 days following the final injection, 2-paw and 4-paw grip strength measurements were taken. Additionally, endurance was tested by placing mice on a wire grid and inverting them so that the amount of time spent hanging could be recorded (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> for schematic). We observed a 50% increase in 2-paw grip strength (<italic>p</italic>= 0.0113) and a 45% increase (<italic>p</italic>= 0.0089) in 4-paw grip strength in the MS023-treated mice versus those that received vehicle at the 10-day time point (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).

A final measurement was performed at the 32-day endpoint, during which mice were placed under terminal anesthesia and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) hindlimb muscle was isolated, incubated ex vivo, and used to generate a force/frequency curve.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present manuscript, we show that inhibition of type I PRMTs promoted the <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation of Pax7-positive MuSCs, as visualized by ki67 staining. scRNAseq analysis of MS023 treated MuSCs identified new transitional clusters. MS023-specific subpopulations harboured unique transcriptional signatures of stemness and energy metabolism. The MS023 treated MuSCs exhibited elevation of both glycolysis and OxPhos. Engrafted MuSCs treated with MS023 were better at regenerating injured muscle and at repopulating the niche. A single treatment of the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse model of DMD with MS023 resulted in enhanced grip strength and force generation. Therefore, repression of type I PRMTs reforms the metabolic state of cultured MuSCs to enhance their capacity for self-renewal <italic>ex vivo</italic> and maintain their ability to robustly participate in muscle regeneration. These finding demonstrate that type I PRMT inhibitors may serve as viable treatment options for skeletal muscle diseases.</p>
<p>The ability to tailor energy metabolism to the specific demands of cell proliferation and differentiation is known as metabolic plasticity, and is required for maintaining tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Folmes <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). The transition from quiescence to proliferation is regulated by a shift from OxPhos to glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pala <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ryall <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). During MuSC quiescence, high levels of NAD+ are generated by oxidative metabolism which in turn activates Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) to deacetylate and repress expression of differentiation genes required for the myogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ryall <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). The shift from OxPhos to glycolysis upon exit from quiescence results in reduced NAD+ levels and subsequent activation of differentiation genes. Furthermore, it has been shown that entry to the process of terminal differentiation is mediated by the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), marking a switch from glycolysis to OxPhos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hori <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Another key player in metabolic plasticity in MuSCs is AMP kinase, a major energy sensor in the cell, regulating energy balance and metabolic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hardie <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Herzig &amp; Shaw, 2018</xref>). Null alleles of AMPK have contributed to the understanding of its role in MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fu <italic>et al</italic>, 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Theret <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Activated AMPK stimulates autophagy, mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis, thus maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Herzig &amp; Shaw, 2018</xref>). Our data shows that in inhibition of type I PRMTs in MuSCs stimulates expression of autophagic markers (<italic>Atg5, Lamp1, Lamp2, Sqstm1</italic>) downstream targets of AMPK, however it remains to be determined whether AMPK is involved in MS023 treated cells.</p>
<p>Treatment of MuSCs with MS023 resulted in metabolic reprogramming of MuSCs, supporting a role for PRMT1 as a metabolic coactivator. PRMT1 has been shown to interact with AMPK in skeletal muscle during the early stages of muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Stouth <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Moreover, CARM1 directly methylates AMPK to regulate its activity during muscle response to denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Stouth <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). PRMT1 has also been shown to play a signaling role to regulate thermogenesis. PRMT1 acts through the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α in human and mouse adipocytes to regulate thermogenic fat activation, and PRMT1-deficient mice were unable to induce the thermogenic program following cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Qiao <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Methylation of PGC-1α by PRMT1 was also shown to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and may regulate nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Teyssier <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Additionally, PRMT1-mediated methylation positively regulates the insulin receptor (IR)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway which is required for glucose transport in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Iwasaki &amp; Yada, 2007</xref>). Overexpression of PRMT1 in the liver under hypoxic conditions causes hypermethylation of FoxO1 and increased translocation to the nucleus, resulting in reduced glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bayen <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Therefore, these findings indicate that PRMT1 methylates key regulators of cellular metabolism and highlight a crosstalk between metabolic effectors and type I PRMTs.</p>
<p>scRNAseq analysis of MS023 treated MuSCs identified new transitional clusters which harboured unique transcriptional signatures of stemness and energy metabolism. DMSO clusters M1/M2/M4 and MS023 clusters M3/M5 were both enriched for proliferation markers (<italic>Cdk1, Mki67</italic>), and M3/M5 also uniquely harboured elevated metabolic genes including components of the ETC (<italic>Atp5k, Cox5a, Ndufa2</italic>) and components of glycolysis (<italic>Eno1, Gapdh</italic>). The simultaneous elevation of both glycolytic and OxPhos components in MS023 subpopulations likely contributes to the enhanced proliferation phenotype. MuSC subpopulations have been characterized at the single-cell level during muscle regeneration, revealing regulatory mechanisms that guide the transition from quiescence to activation, proliferation, and differentiation. A general progressive elevation of metabolic enzyme expression has been noted from low levels in MuSCs isolated from uninjured muscle, to slightly elevated levels in MuSCs isolated from acutely injured muscle (60h after injury), to the highest levels in cultured proliferating MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dell’Orso <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). A more in-depth analysis of MuSC subpopulations throughout muscle regeneration investigated additional time points after injury (2, 5, and 7 days) and generated a hierarchical continuum model of MuSCs throughout the regeneration process, with a focus on ligand-receptor cell communication networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Micheli <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Additionally, analysis of young and aged MuSCs revealed that, while they have similar transcriptional signatures, aged MuSCs display delayed activation state dynamics when exiting quiescence, thus preventing them from entering the differentiation program as efficiently as young MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kimmel <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). It has been previously reported that the quiescent MuSCs captured by scRNAseq exist in two groups, one ‘quiescent’ and one ‘early activation’, wherein the early activation group highly expresses Fos and Jun while down-regulating <italic>Hox</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">van den Brink <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Our Q1 and Q2 clusters are in alignment with these two states (Q1 - quiescence; Q2 - early activation), and bare transcriptional similarities to our MS023-specific clusters M3 and M5, such as upregulated <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Jun</italic>, as well as high levels of <italic>Pax7</italic>. Notably, capture of rare transient MuSC states remains difficult due to poor sampling or limited cell number. To overcome these issues, one study evaluated 365,000 single cells/nuclei from over 100 combined datasets, allowing for the characterization of short-lived MuSC subpopulations that emerge throughout the myogenic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McKellar <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). We show that MS023 treatment generates unique subpopulations of self-renewing MuSCs that have not been previously identified, suggesting that transient cell states may be also amplified through treatment with epigenetic inhibitors, thus facilitating a more in-depth understanding of their function and contributions to muscle regeneration.</p>
<p>PRMTs are known as epigenetic regulators by methylating histones directly and by serving as coactivators/repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Xu &amp; Richard, 2021</xref>). We now show that type I PRMT inhibition induces metabolic reprogramming favouring proliferation and self-renewal, however, the mechanism whether epigenetic, regulating of mRNA splicing or a signaling cascade remains to be defined. It has been shown that inhibition of the epigenetic modulator <italic>Setd7</italic> enhances the proliferation of cultured MuSCs, while retaining their stemness by preventing transport of β-catenin into the nucleus, thereby failing to activate the differentiation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Judson <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibiting methyltransferases can affect MuSC fate.</p>
<p>We report heightened engraftment capabilities of MS023-treated MuSCs accompanied by high Pax7 expression levels. It has been shown that freshly isolated MuSCs retain high Pax7 expression levels and are superior at engrafting compared to cultured MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Montarras <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sacco <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Generating stable Pax7 expression in myogenic precursor cells with lentiviral delivery of transgenes is a strategy for enhancing engraftment potential following <italic>ex vivo</italic> expansion of MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), although this approach may be hampered by safety concerns. Therefore, we have identified an additional strategy for increasing Pax7 expression and improving engraftment efficiency and self-renewal of <italic>ex vivo</italic> expanded MuSCs through inhibition of type I PRMTs. Furthermore, our findings show that injection of MS023 in the dystrophic mouse model <italic>mdx</italic> led to enhanced muscle strength with effects lasting up to 30 days, suggesting that the transient increase in MuSC proliferation and self-renewal afforded by MS023 treatment has lasting effects that could benefit patients with muscle wasting disease.</p>
<p>In sum, we report that inhibition of type I PRMTs elevates cellular metabolism in MuSCs, stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and increases OxPhos, generating a more stem-like MuSC with enhanced self-renewal and engraftment capabilities.</p>

<title>scRNAseq sample preparation and computational analysis</title>
<p>Each biological replicate for the scRNAseq corresponded to one wild type C57BL/6 mouse. The purified MuSCs were cultured in Ham’s F10 (Gibco) with 20% FBS (HyClone), 2.5 ng/mL human recombinant bFGF (Gibco), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Wisent Inc.) with 0.033% DMSO or 1 μM MS023 in 0.033% DMSO. The medium was changed on day 2 and day 4 of culturing. The purified MuSCs from each replicate were stained for viability with calcein-AM and ethidium-homodimer1 (P/ N L3224 Thermo Fisher Scientific). scRNA libraries were generated using the GemCode Single-Cell Instrument (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and Single Cell 3’ Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v2 and Chip Kit (P/N 120236 P/N 120237 10x Genomics). The sequencing ready libraries were purified with SPRIselect, quality controlled for sized distribution and yield (LabChip GX Perkin Elmer), and quantified using qPCR (KAPA Biosystems Library Quantification Kit for Illumina platforms P/N KK4824) as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Couturier <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Libraries were subsequently shipped and sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq6000 at IGM Genomics Center, UCSD, San Diego, CA. Cell barcodes and UMI (unique molecular identifiers) barcodes were demultiplexed and paired-end reads were first aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using the Cell Ranger software v3.1.0 (10X Genomics, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger">https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger</ext-link>). Pre-processing was then carried out with the Seurat v3.2.0 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Butler et al., 2018</xref>). Genes detected in less than 3 cells as well as cells containing less than 200 genes detected were removed. Cells were further filtered out for each sample based on the distribution of genes detected as well as the percentage of mitochondrial counts to balance the number of cells per sample to ∼4000, and the raw count matrices of all samples were merged. Read counts for each cell were then normalized by the cell total, multiplied by 10000 and natural-log transformed. The expression of the 2000 genes with highest cell-to-cell variation was standardized and the heterogeneity associated with mitochondrial contamination was regressed out. Principal component analysis was performed on the scaled data and the top 10 principal components were used to construct a K-nearest neighbor cell graph. Clustering of cells was carried out through the Louvain algorithm with the granularity parameter set to 0.4 and visualized with the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (Becht et al., 2019) dimensional reduction technique using the Scanpy v1.5.2 python module (Wolf et al., 2018). Cluster biomarkers were identified using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Cell trajectories across pseudotime were analyzed by the Monocle v2.16.0 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). Cell progress was defined by differentially expressed genes based on the clusters identified by Seurat. The dimensionality of the data was reduced through the Discriminative Dimensionality Reduction with Trees (DDRTree) algorithm to two dimensions and the cells were ordered along the trajectory according to pseudotime. Genes with branch-dependent expression were identified through the branched expression analysis modeling (BEAM) test. RNA velocity analysis was performed by the scVelo v0.2.2 python module (Bergen et al., 2020). Spliced and unspliced mRNAs were first distinguished through the velocyto v0.17.17 python module (La Manno et al., 2018).

<p>In this study, Dominici et. al. show that small molecule inhibition of Type I PRMTs in muscle stem cells (MSCs) can result in the expansion of this cell type in vitro, solving a major limitation in the field. Importantly, once the inhibitor is removed these stem cell differentiate &quot;normally&quot;. This advance will likely facilitate CRISPR-based screening approaches and stem cell engraftment therapy. Furthermore, they show that when a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is treated with these same inhibitors these mice rather rapidly gain grip strength, demonstrating the therapeutic value of these findings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Previous studies from the same group have shown that the conditional ablation of PRMT1 in MSCs results in the expansion of this cell type, but this expanded PRMT1-null MSC pool cannot terminate the myogenic differentiation program. This raises the question of whether PRMT1 small molecule inhibition of MSCs will also facilitate the expansion of these cells, and if the removal of the inhibitor after expansion will result in a large functional pool of MSCs, which could then be used for both in vitro and in vivo studies.</p>
<p>- Using a combination of muscle fiber culture, myoblast culture and single cell RNA-seq, this is indeed what they show.</p>
<p>- They also perform two types of in vivo experiments to validate their cell culture findings; 1) MSCs expanded under the treatment of MS023 were washed clean of the inhibitor and engrafted into the tibialis anterior muscle. These cells were marked with GFP to allow efficient tracking. Mice receiving the MS023-treated MSCs produced more than double the mature GFP+ muscle fibers than cells treated with DMSO. 2) A mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy displayed grip strength improvement after just one treatment of MS023.</p>
<p>- MS023 is a Type I PRMT inhibitor and thus can also target CARM1. CARM1 has been implicated in MSC function by the Rudnicki group. Importantly, they exclude a role for CARM1 in the expansion of MSC cell number by treatment with a very specific CARM1 inhibitor, TP064. Thus, indicating that PRMT1 inhibition is likely the main driver of this expansion phenotype.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Very few weaknesses.</p>
<p>- The in vivo efficacy of MS023 does not seem to be very great. The mice treated with MS023 display a very small reduction in ADMA levels and a small increase in SDMA levels (Fig S6A).</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Dominici et al. aim to determine whether the reversible inhibition of the type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) would maintain the stemness of muscle stem cells in culture and enable subsequent regenerative capacities. They demonstrate that the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 enhances self-renewal and in vitro expansion of muscle stemm cells isolated from mice. Using a very rigorous single cell RNA-sequencing approach, they further demonstrate that a distinct sub-populations of cells emerge under type I PRMT inhibition and that these cells entered the differentiation program more efficiently. Moreover, they revealed a shift in metabolism in these cells, which they confirmed in vitro. Finally, they demonstrate that MS023 enhances muscle stem cells engraftment in vivo and that the direct injection of MS023 increases muscle strength in a mice model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p>
This study will have a great impact in the field of stem cells and offer potential therapeutic avenues for diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p>Two weaknesses are noted which lie in overstatements of the findings. There are six type I PRMTs (PRMT1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and CARM1), all of which are inhibited by MS023. While the authors demonstrate that their observations are not due to the inhibition of CARM1, they do not demonstrate that it is due to the inhibition of PRMT1, as they suggest.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this study suggests that the switch and elevated cellular metabolism in muscle stem cells due to MS023 enhanced self-renewal and engraftment capabilities but does not demonstrate this fact directly as stated.</p>

<p>Dominici et al studied the effects of the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 on skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and on muscle strength in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The authors observed an enhanced proliferative capacity of cultured MuSCs with an increase of Pax7+/MyoD- cells. The observations are more or less in line with previous studies of the same group, describing reduced differentiation but enhanced proliferation of MuSCs after genetic inactivation of Prmt1. scRNA-seq identified different subpopulations of MuSCs, showing a shift to increased Pax7 expression and elevated oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis after treatment with MS023. Treatment of MuSC with MS023 during expansion in vitro enhanced engraftment of MuSCs and treatment of dystrophic mdx mice increased muscle strength.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript provides new insights into the beneficial effects of the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 for skeletal muscle regeneration. The description of the MS023-induced transcriptional and metabolic changes in MuSC is interesting and the effects on MuSC transplantation and muscle strength are stunning. However, the proposed underlying mechanism, which is claimed to rely on the expansion of MuSC and 'reprograming' of MuSCs towards a &quot;unique and previously uncharacterized identity&quot; is not sufficiently supported. The extent of the description of scRNA-seq data is inappropriate. Some conclusions from the scRNA-seq data appear to be overinterpreted or are rather trivial. It remains completely unclear whether the MS023-stimulated increase of metabolic pathway activity (OXPHOS, glycolysis) plays any role for preserving stem cell properties of MuSC during expansion and improves engraftment. Additional functional and mechanistic studies are required to explore the underlying molecular processes. Furthermore, it remains completely unclear whether the acclaimed increase in grip and tetanic strength of mdx mice after MS023 treatment relies on enhanced expansion of MuSC mediated by PRMT1 inhibition.</p>

<p>1. The in vivo efficacy of MS023 does not seem to be very great. The mice treated with MS023 display a very small reduction in ADMA levels and a small increase in SDMA levels (Fig S6A).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>REPLY: We have quantified proteins with ADMA and SDMA by Western blotting tail clippings from mice treated with vehicle (n=6) and MS023 (n=6). These were normalized for equal loading to b-actin levels. The average ADMA relative expression was 0.92 for vehicle treated mice and 0.86 for MS023 treated mice <italic>(p</italic> &lt; 0.044). The average SDMA relative expression was 0.89 for vehicle treated mice and 0.98 for MS023 treated mice <italic>(p</italic> &lt; 0.000019). These whole-body measurements show MS023 promotes the decrease of proteins with ADMA and increasing proteins with SDMA, as observed before with inhibition of PRMT1 (Dhar <italic>et al</italic>, 2013).</p>

<p>1. Two weaknesses are noted which lie in overstatements of the findings. There are six type I PRMTs (PRMT1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and CARM1), all of which are inhibited by MS023. While the authors demonstrate that their observations are not due to the inhibition of CARM1, they do not demonstrate that it is due to the inhibition of PRMT1, as they suggest.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>REPLY: MS023 has been shown to have <italic>in vitro</italic> activity for several type I enzymes (Eram <italic>et al</italic>, 2016) and the same goes for GSK3368712 (Fedoriw <italic>et al</italic>, 2019). MS023 IC50 <italic>in vitro</italic> 30nM PRMT1, 119 nM PRMT3, 83 nM CARM1, 4 nM PRMT6, and 5 nM PRMT8 (Eram <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016).  It was documented early that PRMT1 is the major cellular type I enzyme (Pawlak <italic>et al</italic>, 2000) and this is why PRMT1 and PRMT5, major type II, are embryonic lethal in mice (Guccione &amp; Richard, 2019). <italic>In vivo</italic> data using MS023 is paralleled by using siPRMT1 (Gao <italic>et al</italic>, 2019; Plotnikov <italic>et al</italic>, 2020; Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2022; Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2019). Thus <italic>in vivo</italic>, MS023 targets the main type I PRMT, PRMT1. Further, in support of our claim that MS023 targets PRMT1 in MuSCs is our previous observation that deleting PRMT1 stimulates MuSC proliferation. Since this effect was irreversible (Blanc <italic>et al</italic>, 2016) we pursued studies with the reversible MS023, the only compound to have significant activity towards PRMT1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. For these reasons, we are convinced that the effect of MS023 is mainly mediated by inhibiting PRMT1 in the MuSC.</p>
<p>To be thorough we should test all other type I PRMT inhibitors as they become available. CARM1 was shown to be a player in MuSC (Kawabe <italic>et al</italic>, 2012), but we excluded it using a CARM1 inhibitor TP-064 (Nakayama <italic>et al</italic>, 2018). PRMT6 mice that we generated are perfectly viable without overt phenotypes, suggesting PRMT6 is not involved (Neault <italic>et al</italic>, 2012), and PRMT8 is brain specific (Taneda <italic>et al</italic>, 2007).</p>

The extent of the description of scRNA-seq data is inappropriate. Some conclusions from the scRNA-seq data appear to be overinterpreted or are rather trivial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>REPLY: We presented the top marker genes for each subpopulation that was identified in our scRNAseq to aid the reader in establishing a broad view of whether a given subpopulation was quiescent-like, proliferating, or differentiating. M1-M5 clusters were all enriched for cell cycle markers (Mki67, Cdk1, etc), indicating a proliferative identity. The unique finding in our data is that treatment with MS023 resulted in a shift in identity as compared to the DMSO-treated proliferating MuSCs (M1, M2 and M4), creating transcriptionally distinct M3 and M5 clusters. M3 and M5 had elevated markers for metabolism (E.g. Eno1, Atp5k, etc) and early activation (E.g. Fos, Jun), while the untreated MuSCs in clusters M1, M2 and M4 did not. Furthermore, M3 and M5 had higher baseline levels of Pax7 expression when compared to untreated cells. Together, these findings describe a transitional subpopulation of MuSCs unique to MS023 treatment which not only harbour stem like/early activation markers Pax7, Fos and Jun, but also elevated proliferative markers related to cell cycle and energy metabolism. This particular combination of characteristics is unique to the MS023-treated MuSCs, thus identifying a novel subtype of MuSC identity. In accordance with our scRNAseq data, we validated experimentally that MS023-treated cells have higher energy metabolism and increased self-renewal potential, thereby confirming that the unique transcriptomic signature of these cells also lead to a different cell fate decision.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>REPLY: Agreed. We cannot exclude if the effect is mediated by an expansion of the MuSC pool or by an effect on other cell types, such as a direct impact on the myofibers. The goal of this figure was to provide a therapeutic perspective for the use of type I PRMT inhibitor for the treatment of DMD. Muscle wasting/weakness in DMD is a complex and multifactorial process (e.g., myofiber fragility, MuSC defects, chronic inflammation, fibrofatty accumulation). If MS023 can target multiple aspects of the physiopathology of the disease it would increase its therapeutic applicability. Further studies will be needed to determine the exact mechanism by which MS023 mediate its beneficial effect. The manuscript will be modified to reflect this.</p>
