<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The amino acid cysteine is critical for many aspects of life, yet excess cysteine is toxic. Therefore, animals require pathways to maintain cysteine homeostasis. In mammals, high cysteine activates cysteine dioxygenase, a key enzyme in cysteine catabolism. The mechanism by which cysteine dioxygenase is regulated remains largely unknown. We discovered that <italic>C. elegans</italic> cysteine dioxygenase (<italic>cdo-1</italic>) is transcriptionally activated by high cysteine and the hypoxia inducible transcription factor (<italic>hif-1</italic>). <italic>hif-1-</italic> dependent activation of <italic>cdo-1</italic> occurs downstream of an H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway that includes <italic>rhy-1, cysl-1</italic>, and <italic>egl-9. cdo-1</italic> transcription is primarily activated in the hypodermis where it is sufficient to drive sulfur amino acid metabolism. EGL-9 and HIF-1 are core members of the cellular hypoxia response. However, we demonstrate that the mechanism of HIF-1-mediated induction of <italic>cdo-1</italic> functions largely independent of EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylation and the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase; classical hypoxia signaling pathway components. We propose that the intersection of <italic>hif-1</italic> and <italic>cdo-1</italic> reveals a negative feedback loop for maintaining cysteine homeostasis. High cysteine stimulates the production of an H<sub>2</sub>S signal. H<sub>2</sub>S then activates the <italic>rhy-1/cysl-1/egl-9</italic> signaling pathway, increasing HIF-1-mediated transcription of <italic>cdo-1</italic>, promoting degradation of cysteine via CDO-1.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that mediates many oxidation/reduction reactions of proteins, is a substrate in the production of iron-sulfur clusters and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), a volatile signaling molecule, and a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Cysteine residues in close proximity in the primary or folded protein sequence are oxidized in the endoplasmic reticulum to form intra- and interprotein disulfide linkages, most commonly in secreted proteins which mediate intercellular signaling and defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). In many enzymes, the reactivity of the cysteine sulfur is key for the coordination of metals such as zinc or iron, which support protein structure and catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). In contrast to its essential function, excess cysteine is also toxic. High cysteine impairs mitochondrial respiration by disrupting iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), acts as a neural excitotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), and promotes the formation of toxic levels of hydrogen sulfide gas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Given this balance between essential and toxic, cysteine homeostasis is key for the health of cells and organisms.</p>
<p>Cysteine is oxidized to cysteinesulfinate by cysteine dioxygenase (CDO-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, CDO1 in mammals) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). CDO1-mediated oxidation is the primary pathway of cysteine catabolism when sulfur amino acid (methionine or cysteine) availability is normal or high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). As a critical player in cysteine homeostasis, CDO1 is a highly regulated enzyme: the activity and abundance of CDO1 increase dramatically in cells and animals fed excess cysteine and methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). CDO1 activation is governed both transcriptionally and post-translationally via the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). However, the molecular players that sense high cysteine and promote CDO1 activation remain incompletely defined.</p>

<p>CDO1 dysfunction is also implicated in disease. CDO1 is a tumor suppressor whose activity is silenced in diverse cancers via promoter methylation, a potential biomarker of tumor grade and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Decreased CDO1 activity may support tumor cell growth by reducing reactive oxygen species and decreasing drug susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we have shown that CDO-1 is a key player in the pathophysiology of 2 fatal inborn errors of metabolism; molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) and isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (ISOD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is an essential 520 Dalton prosthetic group synthesized from GTP by a conserved multistep biosynthetic pathway that is present in about 2/3 of bacterial genomes and nearly all eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> can either retrieve Moco synthesized by the bacteria it consumes or can synthesize Moco <italic>de novo</italic> using its own Moco biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains carrying mutations in genes encoding Moco biosynthetic enzymes (<italic>moc</italic>) and feeding on wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> develop normally. Yet, these same <italic>moc-</italic>mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic> fed Moco-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic> are completely inviable. A genetic selection for mutations that suppress this inviability identified mutations in <italic>cth-2</italic> (cystathionase) and <italic>cdo-1</italic> (cysteine dioxygenase), enzymes in the cysteine biosynthetic and degradation pathway. Using the dipeptide cystathionine as a substrate, CTH-2 produces α-ketobutyrate and cysteine. Cysteine is further oxidized by CDO-1, generating highly toxic sulfites. These sulfites are normally oxidized to more benign sulfate by Moco-requiring sulfite oxidase, SUOX-1, an essential enzyme in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and humans (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Therefore, loss of <italic>cdo-1</italic> or <italic>cth-2</italic> suppresses the lethality caused by Moco deficiency in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by not producing sulfites which are toxic when SUOX-1 is inactive due to Moco deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Thus, understanding the fundamental mechanisms that govern the levels and activity of CDO-1 is critical to generating new therapeutic hypotheses to treat these diseases.</p>
<p>To define genes that regulate <italic>cdo-1</italic> levels and activity, we performed an unbiased genetic screen in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> to identify mutations that increase the expression or abundance of CDO-1. We identified loss-of-function mutations in 2 genes, <italic>egl-9</italic> and <italic>rhy-1</italic>, that dramatically increase expression of a P<italic>cdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic> reporter transgene. These enzymes act in the hypoxia and H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway, and we demonstrate that the conserved hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-1) activates <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription in this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). We further show that high cysteine promotes <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription, and that <italic>hif-1</italic> and <italic>cysl-1</italic> (another component of the H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway) are required for viability under high cysteine conditions. We demonstrate that transcriptional activation of <italic>cdo-1</italic> via HIF-1 promotes CDO-1 activity and establish the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hypodermis as a key tissue of CDO-1 activation and function. Unexpectedly, we find that <italic>cdo-1</italic> regulation is governed by a HIF-1 pathway largely independent of EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylase activity and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL-1), the canonical oxygen-sensing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). These data establish a new connection between the HIF-1/H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway and sulfur amino acid catabolism governed by CDO-1.</p>

<title><italic>egl-9</italic> and <italic>rhy-1</italic> negatively regulate <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription</title>
<p>To identify regulators of CDO-1 levels, we engineered a transgene expressing a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged version of full-length CDO-1 protein driven by the native <italic>cdo-1</italic> promoter (<italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Transgenic animals were generated by integrating the <italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic> construct into the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). This transgene was functional and rescued a <italic>cdo-1</italic> loss of function mutation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). The <italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic> transgene reverses the suppression of Moco-deficient lethality caused by <italic>cdo-1</italic> loss of function (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). The reanimation of Moco-deficient lethality by the transgene depends on CDO-1 enzymatic activity because a transgene expressing an active-site mutant <italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1[C85Y]::GFP</italic> does not rescue the <italic>cdo-1</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). These data demonstrate that the <italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic> reporter transgene is functional and suggests its expression pattern reflects endogenous protein expression, localization, and levels.</p>
<p>We performed a mutagenesis screen to identify genes that control the expression or accumulation of CDO-1 protein. Specifically, we performed an EMS chemical mutagenesis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and screened for mutations that caused increased GFP accumulation by the <italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic> reporter transgene. New mutants were isolated two generations post mutagenesis to allow novel mutations to become homozygous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Using whole-genome sequencing, we determined that 2 independently isolated mutants carried distinct mutations in <italic>egl-9</italic> and four other independently isolated mutants had unique mutations in <italic>rhy-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The presence of multiple independent alleles suggests these mutations in <italic>egl-9</italic> or <italic>rhy-1</italic> are causative for the increased <italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic> expression or accumulation phenotype. <italic>egl-9</italic> encodes the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase and orthologue of mammalian EGLN1. <italic>rhy-1</italic> encodes the regulator of <underline>hy</underline>poxia inducible transcription factor, an enzyme with homology to membrane-bound O-acyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). The genetic screen produced nonsense alleles of both <italic>egl-9</italic> and <italic>rhy-1</italic> suggesting the increased <italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic> expression or accumulation phenotype is caused by loss of <italic>egl-9</italic> or <italic>rhy-1</italic> function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Inactivation of <italic>egl-9</italic> or <italic>rhy-1</italic> activates a transcriptional program mediated by the hypoxia inducible transcription factor, HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). To determine if <italic>egl-9</italic> or <italic>rhy-1</italic> regulate <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription, we engineered a separate reporter construct where only GFP is transcribed by the <italic>cdo-1</italic> promoter (<italic>Pcdo-1::GFP</italic>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). This <italic>Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> transgene was introduced into strains with independently isolated <italic>egl-9(sa307)</italic> and <italic>rhy-1(ok1402)</italic> null reference alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). The <italic>egl-9(sa307)</italic> and <italic>rhy-1(ok1402)</italic> mutations dramatically induce GFP driven by the <italic>Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> transgene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). The activation of <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription by independently isolated <italic>egl-9</italic> or <italic>rhy-1</italic> mutations demonstrates that the <italic>egl-9</italic> and <italic>rhy-1</italic> mutations isolated in our screen for the induction or accumulation of <italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic> are the causative genetic lesions. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that <italic>egl-9</italic> and <italic>rhy-1</italic> are necessary for the normal transcriptional repression of <italic>cdo-1</italic>.</p>

<title>HIF-1 directly activates <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription downstream of the <italic>rhy-1, cysl-1, egl-9</italic> genetic pathway</title>
<p><italic>rhy-1</italic> and <italic>egl-9</italic> act in a pathway that regulates the abundance and activity of the HIF-1 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The activity of <italic>rhy-1</italic> is most upstream in the pathway and negatively regulates the activity of <italic>cysl-1</italic>, which encodes a cysteine synthase-like enzyme likely of algal origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). CYSL-1 directly binds to and inhibits EGL-9 in an H<sub>2</sub>S-modulated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). EGL-9 uses molecular oxygen as well as an α-ketoglutarate cofactor to directly inhibit HIF-1 via prolyl hydroxylation, which recruits the VHL-1 ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate HIF-1, targeting it for degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Given that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>rhy-1</italic> or <italic>egl-9</italic> activate <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription, we tested if <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription is activated by HIF-1 as an output of this hypoxia/H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway. We performed epistasis studies using null mutations that inhibit the activity of <italic>hif-1</italic> (<italic>cysl-1(ok762)</italic> and <italic>hif-1(ia4)</italic>) or activate <italic>hif-1</italic> (<italic>rhy-1(ok1402)</italic> and <italic>egl-9(sa307)</italic>). The induction of <italic>Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> by <italic>egl-9</italic> inactivation was dependent upon the activity of <italic>hif-1</italic>, but not on the activity of <italic>cysl-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). In contrast, induction of <italic>Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> by <italic>rhy-1</italic> inactivation was dependent upon the activity of both <italic>hif-1</italic> and <italic>cysl-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,C</xref>). These results reveal a genetic pathway whereby <italic>rhy-1, cysl-1</italic>, and <italic>egl-9</italic> function in a negative-regulatory cascade to control the activity of HIF-1 which transcriptionally activates <italic>cdo-1.</italic> Our epistasis studies of <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcriptional regulation by HIF-1 align well with previous analyses of this genetic pathway in the context of transcription of <italic>cysl-2</italic> (a paralog of <italic>cysl-1</italic>) and the “O<sub>2</sub>-ON response” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>

<p>We hypothesized that cysteine might activate <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription through the RHY-1/CYSL-1/EGL-9/HIF-1 pathway. In this pathway, <italic>cysl-1</italic> and <italic>hif-1</italic> act to promote <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription. We tested whether <italic>cysl-1</italic> or <italic>hif-1</italic> were necessary for the induction of <italic>Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> by high cysteine. However, this experiment was not possible as we observed 100% lethality in <italic>cysl-1(-); Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> (<italic>n</italic>=174 individuals) and <italic>hif-1(-); Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> (<italic>n</italic>=139 individuals) animals when exposed to 100μM supplemental cysteine. In contrast, 100% of <italic>cysl-1(-); Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> (<italic>n</italic>=143 individuals) and 99% <italic>hif-1(-); Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> (n=110 individuals) animals were alive under control conditions without supplemental cysteine. Wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> carrying the <italic>Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> reporter transgene were healthy under control (100% alive, <italic>n</italic>=134 individuals) and high-cysteine (100% alive, <italic>n</italic>=140 individuals) conditions. These data demonstrate that <italic>cysl-1</italic> and <italic>hif-1</italic> are necessary for survival under high cysteine conditions.</p>
<p>Given the established role of CDO-1 in cysteine catabolism, we tested whether <italic>cdo-1(-)</italic> mutants were also sensitive to high cysteine. 98% of <italic>cdo-1(-)</italic> mutants were alive after exposure to 100μM supplemental cysteine (<italic>n=</italic>141 individuals). 100% of <italic>cdo-1(-)</italic> mutant animals were alive in the control group not exposed to high cysteine (<italic>n=</italic>142 individuals). Similarly, wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> were healthy under control (100% alive, <italic>n</italic>=131 individuals) and high-cysteine (100% alive, <italic>n</italic>=153 individuals) conditions. Thus, <italic>cdo-1</italic> is not necessary for survival under high cysteine conditions. This suggests the existence of alternate pathways that promote cysteine homeostasis. Given the requirement of <italic>cysl-1</italic> and <italic>hif-1</italic> for survival in high cysteine, we propose that HIF-1 activates pathways (in addition to <italic>cdo-1</italic>) that promote survival under high cysteine conditions.</p>

<p>When wild-type animals expressing CDO-1::GFP were grown under standard culture conditions, we observed CDO-1::GFP expression in multiple tissues including prominent expression in the hypodermis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). We tested if CDO-1::GFP levels would be affected by inactivation of <italic>egl-9</italic> or <italic>rhy-1.</italic> We generated <italic>egl-9(-);</italic> CDO-1::GFP and <italic>rhy-1(-);</italic> CDO-1::GFP animals and assayed expression of CDO-1::GFP. Consistent with our studies using <italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic> and <italic>Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> transgenes, we found that CDO-1::GFP levels, encoded by <italic>cdo-1(rae273)</italic>, were increased by <italic>egl-9(-)</italic> or <italic>rhy-1(-)</italic> mutations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). Furthermore, high cysteine also promoted accumulation of CDO-1::GFP (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). In all scenarios, the hypodermis was the most prominent site of CDO-1::GFP accumulation. Specifically, we found that CDO-1::GFP was expressed in the cytoplasm of Hyp7, the major <italic>C. elegans</italic> hypodermal cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the expression pattern of CDO-1::GFP encoded by <italic>cdo-1(rae273)</italic>, we hypothesized that CDO-1 acts in the hypodermis to promote sulfur amino acid metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a <italic>cdo-1</italic> rescue construct in which <italic>cdo-1</italic> is expressed exclusively in the hypodermis under the control of the <italic>col-10</italic> promoter (<italic>Pcol-10::CDO-1::GFP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>).

We tested the ability of the <italic>Pcol-10::CDO-1::GFP</italic> transgene to rescue the <italic>cdo-1(-)</italic> mutant suppression of Moco-deficient larval arrest. We found that multiple independent transgenic strains of <italic>cdo-1(-) moc-1(-)</italic> double mutant animals carrying the <italic>Pcol-10::CDO-1::GFP</italic> transgene displayed a larval arrest phenotype when fed a Moco-deficient diet (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These data demonstrated that hypodermal-specific expression of <italic>cdo-1</italic> is sufficient to rescue the <italic>cdo-1(-)</italic> mutant suppression of Moco-deficient lethality. This rescue was dependent upon the enzymatic activity of CDO-1 as an active site variant of this transgene (<italic>Pcol-10::CDO-1[C85Y]::GFP)</italic> did not rescue the suppressed larval arrest of <italic>cdo-1(-) moc-1(-)</italic> double mutant animals fed Moco-deficient diets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Taken together, our analyses of CDO-1::GFP expression demonstrate that CDO-1 is expressed, and that expression is regulated, in multiple tissues, principal among them being the hypodermis and Hyp7 cell. Our tissue-specific rescue data demonstrate that hypodermal expression of <italic>cdo-1</italic> is sufficient to promote cysteine catabolism and suggest that the hypodermis is a critical tissue for sulfur amino acid metabolism. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that CDO-1 also acts in other cells and tissues.</p>

<title>HIF-1 promotes CDO-1 activity downstream of the H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway</title>
<p>We sought to determine the physiological impact of <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcriptional activation by HIF-1. We reasoned mutations that activate HIF-1 and increase <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription may cause increased CDO-1 activity. CDO-1 sits at a critical metabolic node in the degradation of the sulfur amino acids cysteine and methionine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). A key byproduct of sulfur amino acid metabolism and CDO-1 is sulfite, a reactive toxin that is detoxified by the Moco-requiring sulfite oxidase (SUOX-1). Null mutations in <italic>suox-1</italic> cause larval lethality. However, animals carrying the <italic>suox-1(gk738847)</italic> hypomorphic allele are healthy under standard culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). <italic>suox-1(gk738847)</italic> mutant animals display only 4% SUOX-1 activity compared to wild type, and are exquisitely sensitive to sulfite stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Thus, the <italic>suox-1(gk738847)</italic> mutation creates a sensitized genetic background to probe for increases in endogenous sulfite production. To test if increased <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription would impact the growth of <italic>suox-1-</italic>comprimised animals, we combined the <italic>egl-9</italic> null mutation, which promotes HIF-1 activity and <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription, with the <italic>suox-1(gk738847)</italic> allele. While <italic>egl-9(-)</italic> and <italic>suox-1(gk738847)</italic> single mutant animals are healthy under standard culture conditions, the <italic>egl-9(-); suox-1(gk738847)</italic> double mutant animals are extremely sick and slow growing, establishing a synthetic genetic interaction between these loci (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Loss of <italic>rhy-1</italic> also strongly activates <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription.

These data suggest that increasing <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription alone is not sufficient to promote sulfite production via CDO-1. In addition to the role played by <italic>rhy-1</italic> in the regulation of HIF-1 activity, <italic>rhy-1</italic> itself is a transcriptional target of HIF-1.

To test this hypothesis, we engineered <italic>rhy-1(-); egl-9(-); suox-1(gk738847)</italic> triple mutant animals. To our surprise, the <italic>rhy-1(-); egl-9(-); suox-1(gk738847)</italic> triple mutant animals were healthy, demonstrating that <italic>rhy-1</italic> was necessary for the deleterious activity of the <italic>egl-9(-)</italic> mutation in a <italic>suox-1(gk738847)</italic> background. These genetic data suggest a dual role for <italic>rhy-1</italic> in the control of sulfur amino acid metabolism; first as a component of a regulatory cascade that controls the activity of HIF-1 and second as a functional downstream effector of HIF-1 that is required for sulfur amino acid metabolism.</p>

<p>EGL-9 PHD hydroxylates specific proline residues on HIF-1. These hydroxylated proline residues are recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase (VHL-1). VHL-1-mediated ubiquitination promotes degradation of HIF-1 by the proteasome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).

For example, mammalian HIF1A induces the hematopoietic growth hormone erythropoietin, glucose transport and glycolysis, as well as lactate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> encounters a range of oxygen tensions in its natural habitat of rotting material: as microbial abundance increases, oxygen levels decrease from atmospheric levels (∼21% O<sub>2</sub>). In fact, <italic>C. elegans</italic> prefers 5-12% O<sub>2</sub>, perhaps because hypoxia predicts abundant bacterial food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Elements of the HIF-1 pathway have emerged from <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetics as have critical targets of HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). For instance, <italic>C. elegans</italic> HIF-1 promotes H<sub>2</sub>S homeostasis by inducing transcription of the mitochondrial sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (<italic>sqrd-1)</italic>, detoxifying H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>We sought to define genes that regulate the levels and activity of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO-1), a critical regulator of cysteine homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Taking an unbiased genetic approach in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we found that <italic>cdo-1</italic> was highly regulated by HIF-1 downstream of a signaling pathway that includes <italic>rhy-1</italic>, <italic>cysl-1</italic>, and <italic>egl-9</italic>. We demonstrated that HIF-1 promotes <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription, accumulation of CDO-1 protein, and increased CDO-1 activity. Loss of <italic>rhy-1</italic> or <italic>egl-9</italic> activate <italic>hif-1</italic> to in turn strongly induce the <italic>cdo-1</italic> promoter. The pathway for activation of <italic>cdo-1</italic> also requires <italic>cysl-1</italic>, which functions downstream of <italic>rhy-1</italic> and upstream of <italic>egl-9.</italic> Based on ChIP-Seq studies, HIF-1 directly binds to the <italic>cdo-1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>).</p>
<p>We also show that the transcriptional activation of <italic>cdo-1</italic> by HIF-1 promotes CDO-1 enzymatic activity. Genetic activation of <italic>cdo-1</italic> by loss of <italic>egl-9</italic> causes severe sickness in a mutant with reduced sulfite oxidase activity, an activity required to cope with the toxic products of CDO-1. This synthetic sickness is dependent upon an intact HIF-1 signaling pathway and a functioning sulfur amino acid metabolism pathway, as the dramatic sickness of an <italic>egl-9; suox-1</italic> double mutant is suppressed by loss of <italic>hif-1, cth-2</italic>, or <italic>cdo-1.</italic> These striking genetic results validate the intersection of HIF-1 and CDO-1 as converging biological regulatory pathways and encourage further exploration of this regulatory node. The potential physiological relevance of the connection between HIF-1 signaling and cysteine metabolism is discussed below.</p>

<title>Evidence for distinct pathways of HIF-1 activation by hypoxia and cysteine/H<sub>2</sub>S</title>
<p>The hypoxia-signaling pathway is defined by EGL-9-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-1. Hydroxylated HIF-1 is then targeted for degradation via VHL-1-mediated ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). However, multiple lines of evidence, reinforced by our work, demonstrate VHL-1- and prolyl hydroxylase-independent activity of EGL-9. <italic>egl-9(-)</italic> null mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic> accumulate HIF-1 protein and display increased transcription of many genes, including <italic>nhr-57</italic>, an established target of HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). In rescue experiments of an <italic>egl-9(-)</italic> null mutant, Shao <italic>et al.</italic> (2009) demonstrate that a wild-type <italic>egl-9</italic> transgene restores normal HIF-1 protein levels and HIF-1 transcription. However, rescue experiments with a PHD-inactive <italic>egl-9(H487A)</italic> transgene do not correct the accumulation of HIF-1 protein and only partially reduce the HIF-1 transcriptional output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Through our studies of <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription, we demonstrate that an <italic>egl-9(H487A)</italic> mutant incompletely activates HIF-1 transcription when compared to an <italic>egl-9(-)</italic> null mutation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C,D</xref>). Taken together, we conclude EGL-9 has activity independent of its PHD domain, mirroring and supporting previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>).</p>
<p>In studies of the HIF-1-dependent P<italic>nhr-57::GFP</italic> transcriptional reporter, Shen <italic>et al.</italic> (2006) observed that <italic>egl-9(-)</italic> null mutants promote HIF-1 transcription more than a <italic>vhl-1(-)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). We observe this same distinction between <italic>egl-9</italic> and <italic>vhl-1</italic> mutations with our <italic>Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> reporter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C,D</xref>). This difference in transcriptional activity is not explained by HIF-1 protein levels as HIF-1 protein accumulated equally in <italic>egl-9(-)</italic> and <italic>vhl-1(-)</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). This observation suggests that EGL-9 represses both HIF-1 levels and activity. This study also notes that <italic>vhl-1</italic> represses HIF-1 transcription in the intestine while <italic>egl-9</italic> acts in a wider array of tissues including the intestine and the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Budde and Roth (2010) also demonstrate that loss of <italic>vhl-1</italic> promotes HIF-1 transcription in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine while total loss of <italic>egl-9</italic> promotes HIF-1 transcription in multiple tissues including the intestine and the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Our data expand upon these observations by demonstrating that loss of the EGL-9 PHD promotes <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription in the intestine alone, mirroring the loss of <italic>vhl-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Budde and Roth (2010) additionally demonstrate that physiologically relevant stimuli also elicit a tissue-specific transcriptional response: hypoxia promotes HIF-1 transcription in the intestine while H<sub>2</sub>S promotes HIF-1 transcription in the hypodermis. Importantly, H<sub>2</sub>S promotes hypodermal HIF-1 transcription in a <italic>vhl-1(-)</italic> mutant, demonstrating a VHL-1-independent pathway for H<sub>2</sub>S activation of HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). We demonstrate that high cysteine promotes <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription in the hypodermis. Taken together with our data, these studies suggest 2 distinct pathways for activating HIF-1 transcription: i) a hypoxia-sensing pathway that is dependent upon <italic>vhl-1</italic> and the EGL-9 PHD and promotes HIF-1 activity in the intestine and ii) an H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway that is independent of <italic>vhl-1</italic> and the EGL-9 PHD and promotes HIF-1 activity in the hypodermis.</p>
<p>The genetic details of the H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway were solidified through studies of <italic>rhy-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Ma <italic>et al.</italic> (2012) demonstrate that <italic>hif-1</italic> repression via <italic>rhy-1</italic> requires the activity of <italic>cysl-1</italic>, a gene encoding a cysteine synthase-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). They further demonstrate that high H<sub>2</sub>S promotes a physical interaction between CYSL-1 and EGL-9, resulting in the inactivation of EGL-9 and increased HIF-1 activity. Together, these studies suggest distinct genetic regulators of EGL-9/HIF-1 signaling: <italic>rhy-1</italic> and <italic>cysl-1</italic> govern the H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway while <italic>vhl-1</italic> mediates the hypoxia-sensing pathway. These pathways are distinct in their requirement for the EGL-9 PHD.</p>

<title>A negative feedback loop senses high cysteine/H<sub>2</sub>S, promotes CDO-1 activity, and maintains cysteine homeostasis</title>
<p>Why would the RHY-1/CYSL-1/EGL-9/HIF-1 H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway control the levels and activity of cysteine dioxygenase? We speculate this intersection facilitates a homeostatic pathway allowing <italic>C. elegans</italic> to sense and respond to cysteine level. We propose that H<sub>2</sub>S acts as a gaseous signaling molecule to promote cysteine catabolism. H<sub>2</sub>S activates HIF-1 in the hypodermis by promoting the CYSL-1-mediated inactivation of EGL-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). We show that high cysteine similarly induces <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription in the hypodermis. Our genetic data demonstrate that <italic>cdo-1</italic> is induced by the same genetic pathway that senses H<sub>2</sub>S in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and CDO-1 acts in the hypodermis, the major site of H<sub>2</sub>S-induced transcription. Furthermore, H<sub>2</sub>S induces endogenous <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription &gt;3-fold but <italic>cdo-1</italic> mRNA levels do not change when <italic>C. elegans</italic> are exposed to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Thus, it is likely that H<sub>2</sub>S promotes <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription through RHY-1, CYSL-1, EGL-9, and HIF-1. H<sub>2</sub>S is a reasonable small molecule signal to alert cells to high cysteine stress. Excess cysteine results in the production of H<sub>2</sub>S mediated by multiple enzymes including cystathionase (CTH), cystathionine ý-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). We speculate that excess cysteine in <italic>C. elegans</italic> promotes the enzymatic production of H<sub>2</sub>S which would activate HIF-1 via the RHY-1/CYSL-1/EGL-9 signaling pathway. In this homeostatic model, H<sub>2</sub>S-activated HIF-1 would then induce <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription, promoting CDO-1 activity and the catabolism of the high-cysteine trigger (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Supporting this model, <italic>cysl-1(-)</italic> and <italic>hif-1(-)</italic> mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic> cannot survive in a high cysteine environment, demonstrating their central role in promoting cysteine homeostasis.</p>

Under these conditions <italic>cdo-1</italic> transcription is kept at basal levels and cysteine catabolism is not induced. C) During conditions where HIF-1 is activated (high H<sub>2</sub>S), CYSL-1 directly binds and inhibits EGL-9, preventing HIF-1 inactivation. Active HIF-1 binds the <italic>cdo-1</italic> promoter, driving transcription and promoting CDO-1 protein accumulation. High CDO-1 promotes the catabolism of cysteine.

<p>Members of the H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway have also been implicated in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Many secreted proteins that mediate intercellular signaling or innate immune responses to pathogens are cysteine-rich and form disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum before protein secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). Levels of free cysteine may fall during the massive inductions of cysteine-rich secreted proteins in development or immune defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). The oxidation of so many cysteines to disulfides in the endoplasmic reticulum might locally lower oxygen levels preventing EGLN1 hydroxylation of HIF1A. Thus, the intersection between oxygen sensing and cysteine homeostasis we have uncovered may contribute to a regulatory axis in cell-cell signaling during development and in immune function.</p>

Details about plasmid construction are described below. MiniMos transgenic animals were generated using established protocols that rescue the <italic>unc-119(ed3)</italic> Unc phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).</p>
<p>To generate a construct that expressed CDO-1 under the control of its native promoter, we cloned the wild-type <italic>cdo-1</italic> genomic locus from 1,335 base pairs upstream of the <italic>cdo-1</italic> ATG start codon to (and including) codon 190 encoding the final CDO-1 amino acid prior to the TAA stop codon.

This plasmid is called pKW24 (P<italic>cdo-1::CDO-1::GFP</italic>).</p>
<p>To generate pKW44, a construct encoding the active site mutant transgene <italic>Pcdo-1::CDO-1(C85Y)::GFP</italic>, we performed Q5 site-directed mutagenesis on pKW24, following manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs).

Here we report the analysis of 6 new mutant strains (USD655, USD656, USD657, USD658, USD659, and USD674). Among these mutant strains, we found 2 unique mutations in <italic>egl-9</italic> (USD659 and USD674) and 4 unique mutations in <italic>rhy-1</italic> (USD655, USD656, USD657, USD658). The allele names and molecular identity of these new <italic>egl-9</italic> and <italic>rhy-1</italic> mutations are specified in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>. These genes were prioritized based on the isolation of multiple independent alleles and their established functions in a common pathway, the hypoxia and H<sub>2</sub>S-sensing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>

<title>Genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9</title>
<p>We followed standard protocols to perform CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering of <italic>cdo-1</italic> and <italic>egl-9</italic> genomic loci in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). Essential details of the CRISPR/Cas9-generated reagents in this work are described below.</p>
<p>We used homology-directed repair to generate <italic>cdo-1(rae273)</italic> [CDO-1::GFP]. The guide RNA was 5’-gactacagaggatctaagaa-3’ (crRNA, IDT). The GFP donor double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was amplified from pCFJ2249 using primers that contained roughly 40bp of homology to <italic>cdo-1</italic> flanking the desired insertion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>). The primers used to generate the donor dsDNA were: 5’-gtacggcaagaaagttgactacagaggatctaagaataatagtactagcggtggcagtgg-3’ and 5’-agaatcaacacgttattacattgagggatatgttgtttacttgtagagctcgtccattcc-3’. Glycine 189 of CDO-1 was removed by design to eliminate the PAM site and prevent cleavage of the donor dsDNA.</p>
<p>The <italic>egl-9(rae276)</italic> and <italic>egl-9(rae278)</italic> [EGL-9(H487A)] alleles were also generated by homology-directed repair using the same combination of guide RNA and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donor. The guide RNA was 5’-tgtgaagcatgtagataatc-3’ (crRNA, IDT) The ssODN donor was 5’-gcttgccatctatcctggaaatggaactcgttatgtgaaggctgtagacaatccagtaaaagatggaagatgtataaccactatttattactg-3’ (Ultramer, IDT). Successful editing resulted in altering the coding sequence of EGL-9 to encode for an alanine rather than the catalytically essential histidine at position 487. We also used synonymous mutations to introduce an AccI restriction site that is helpful for genotyping the <italic>rae276</italic> and <italic>rae278</italic> mutant alleles.</p>

<title><italic>C. elegans</italic> growth assays</title>
<p>To assay developmental rates, <italic>C. elegans</italic> were synchronized at the first stage of larval development. To synchronize animals, embryos were harvested from gravid adult animals via treatment with a bleach and sodium hydroxide solution. Embryos were then incubated overnight in M9 solution causing them to hatch and arrest development at the L1 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>). Synchronized L1 animals were cultured on NGM seeded with B2W5113 (Wild type, Moco+) or JW0764-2 (τ..<italic>moaA753::kan</italic>, Moco-) <italic>E. coli.</italic> Animals were cultured for 48 or 72 hours (specified in the appropriate figure legends), and live animals were imaged as described below. Animal length was measured from tip of head to the end of the tail.</p>
<p>To determine qualitative ‘health’ of various <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains, we assayed the ability of these strains to consume all <italic>E. coli</italic> food provided on an NGM petri dish. For this experiment, dietary <italic>E. coli</italic> was produced via overnight culture in liquid LB in a 37°C shaking incubator. 200μl of this <italic>E. coli</italic> was seeded onto NGM petri dishes and allowed to dry, producing nearly identical lawns and growth environments. Then, 5 L4 animals of a strain of interest were introduced onto these NGM petri dishes seeded with OP50. For each experiment, petri dishes were monitored daily and scored when all <italic>E. coli</italic> was consumed by the population of animals. This assay is beneficial because it integrates many life-history measures (i.e. developmental rate, brood size, embryonic viability, etc.) into a single simple assay that can be scaled and applied to many <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains in parallel.</p>

<title>Cysteine exposure</title>
<p>To determine the impact of supplemental cysteine on expression of <italic>cdo-1</italic> and animal viability, we exposed various <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains to 0 or 100μM supplemental cysteine. Wild-type and mutant animals carrying the <italic>Pcdo-1::GFP</italic> or CDO-1::GFP transgenes were synchronously grown on NGM media supplemented with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 at 20°C until reaching the L4 stage of development. Live L4 animals were then collected from the petri dishes and cultured in liquid M9 media containing 4X concentrated <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 with or without 100μM supplemental cysteine. These liquid cultures were gently rocked at 20°C overnight. Post exposure, GFP imaging was performed as described in the Microscopy section of the materials and methods. A subset of the assayed animals were also scored for viability after being seeded onto NGM petri dishes. Animals were determined to be alive if they responded to mechanical stimulus.</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>Low magnification bright field and fluorescence images (imaging GFP simultaneously in multiple animals) were collected using a Zeiss AxioZoom V16 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca flash 4.0 digital camera using Zen software (Zeiss). For experiments with supplemental cysteine, low magnification bright field and fluorescence images were collected using a Nikon SMZ25 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca flash 4.0 digital camera using NIS-Elements software (Nikon). High magnification differential interference contrast (DIC) and GFP fluorescence images (imaging CDO-1::GFP encoded by <italic>cdo-1(rae273)</italic>) were collected using Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam HRc digital camera using Zen software (Zeiss). All images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH). All imaging was performed on live animals paralyzed using 20mM sodium azide. For all fluorescence images shown within the same figure panel, images were collected using the same exposure time and processed identically. To quantify GFP expression, the average pixel intensity was determined within a set transverse section immediately anterior to the developing vulva. Background pixel intensity was determined in a set region of interest distinct from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> samples and was subtracted from the sample measurements.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study presents findings on how the hypoxia response pathway senses and responds to changes in the homeostasis of the amino acid cysteine and other sulfur-containing molecules, with <bold>compelling</bold> and rigorous genetic analyses. The works adds to a growing body of literature showing that prolyl hydroxylation is not the only mechanism by which the hypoxia response pathway can act. Although the paper does not reveal new biochemical insight into the mechanism, it opens up new areas of investigation that will be of interest to cell biologists and biomedical researchers studying the many pathologies involving hypoxia and/or cysteine metabolism.</p>

<p>Warnhoff et al present a genetic investigation of the response of C. elegans to high dietary cysteine. Using a Pcdo-1::CDO-1::GFP reporter (for a cysteine dioxygenase gene) and unbiased mutagenesis, they identify multiple alleles, including nonsense alleles, in egl-9 and rhy-1, which they validate with reference alleles. Further mutational analysis shows that hif-1 and cysl-1, components of the same established genetic regulatory pathway, also act in cdo-1 regulation. High dietary levels of cysteine activate cdo-1 expression, but loss of cdo-1 does not cause sensitivity to excess dietary cysteine, whereas cysl-1 and hif-1 are completely inviable in these conditions. Using sulfite oxidase suox-1 mutant and double and triple mutant analysis the authors show that the defects caused by suox-1 deletion (which causes sulfite accumulation) are exacerbated by loss of egl-9, which is alleviated by concomitant loss of enzymes cdo-1 / cth-2 or regulators rhy-1 / hif-1, demonstrating that the key issue is cysteine derived sulfites. Further genetic analysis shows that although egl-9 is required for cdo-1 induction, this is only partially dependent on its hydroxylase activity and the egl-9 partner vhl-1 is also only partially involved.</p>
<p>The significance of the findings is that they describe a regulatory pathway by which organisms might respond to high levels of cysteine in vivo.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
- The genetic analysis is generally well done and convincing, with multiple alleles identified for each gene, several reporters used for cdo-2, etc.</p>
<p>
- Genetic analysis using site-directed mutagenesis of egl-9 and cdo-1 with point mtuations is especially nice.</p>
<p>
- The data are analyzed and represented properly, and microscopy data have been quantified.</p>
<p>
- The paper is also written quite clearly and the figures are easy to understand.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
- The relevance is somewhat unclear. High cysteine levels can be achieved in the laboratory, but, is this relevant in the life of C. elegans? Or is there physiological relevance in humans, e.g. a disease? The authors state &quot;cells and animals fed excess cysteine and methionine&quot;, but is this more than a laboratory excess condition? SUOX nonfunctional conditions in humans don't appear to tie into this, since, in that context, the goal is to inactivate CDO or CTH to prevent sulfite production. The authors also mention cancer, but the link to cysteine levels is unclear. In that sense, then, the conditions studied here may not carry much physiological relevance.</p>
<p>
- The pathway is described as important for cysteine detoxification, which is described to act via H2S (Figure 6). Much of that pathway has already been previously established by the Roth, Miller, and Horvitz labs as critical for the H2S response. While the present manuscript adds some additional insight such as the additional role of RHY-1 downstream on HIF-1 in promoting toxicity, this study therefore mainly confirms the importance of a previously described signalling pathway, essentially adding a new downstream target rhy-1 -&gt; cysl-1 -&gt; egl-9 -&gt; hif-1 -&gt; sqrd-1/cdo-1. The impact of this finding is reduced by the fact that cdo-1 itself isn't actually required for survival in high cysteine, suggesting it is merely a maker of the activity of this previously described pathway.</p>

<p>The authors investigate the transcriptional regulation of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO-1) in C. elegans and its role in maintaining cysteine homeostasis. They show that high cysteine levels activate cdo-1 transcription through the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. Using transcriptional and translational reporters for CDO-1, the authors propose a negative feedback pathway involving RHY-1, CYSL-1, EGL-9, and HIF-1 in regulating cysteine homeostasis.</p>
<p>Genetics is a notable strength of this study. The forward genetic screen, gene interaction, and epistasis analyses are beautifully designed and rigorously conducted, yielding solid and unambiguous conclusions on the genetic pathway regulating CDO-1. The writing is clear and accessible, contributing to the overall high quality of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Addressing the specifics of cysteine supplementation and interpretation regarding the cysteine homeostasis pathway would further clarify the paper and strengthen the study's conclusions.</p>
<p>First, the authors show that the supplementation of exogenous cysteine activates cdo-1p::GFP. Rather than showing data for one dose, the author may consider presenting dose-dependency results and whether cysteine activation of cdo-1 also requires HIF-1 or CYSL-1, which would be important data given the focus and major novelty of the paper in cysteine homeostasis, not the cdo-1 regulatory gene pathway. While the genetic manipulation of cdo-1 regulators yields much more striking results, the effect size of exogenous cysteine is rather small. Does this reflect a lack of extensive condition optimization or robust buffering of exogenous/dietary cysteine? Would genetic manipulation to alter intracellular cysteine or its precursors yield similar or stronger effect sizes?</p>
<p>Second, there remain several major questions regarding the interpretation of the cysteine homeostasis pathway. How much specificity is involved for the RHY-1/CYSL-1/EGL-9/HIF-1 pathway to control cysteine homeostasis? Is the pathway able to sense cysteine directly or indirectly through its metabolites or redox status in general? Given the very low and high physiological concentrations of intracellular cysteine and glutathione (GSH, a major reserve for cysteine), respectively, there is a surprising lack of mention and testing of GSH metabolism. In addition, what are the major similarities and differences of cysteine homeostasis pathways between C. elegans and other systems (HIF dependency, transcription vs post-transcriptional control)? These questions could be better discussed and noted with novel findings of the current study that are likely C. elegans specific or broadly conserved.</p>

<p>There has been a long-standing link between the biology of sulfur-containing molecules (e.g., hydrogen sulfide gas, the amino acid cysteine, and its close relative cystine, et cetera) and the biology of hypoxia, yet we have a poor understanding of how and why these two biological processes and are co-regulated. Here, the authors use C. elegans to explore the relationship between sulfur metabolism and hypoxia, examining the regulation of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO1 in humans, CDO-1 in C. elegans), which is critical to cysteine catabolism, by the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF1 alpha in humans, HIF-1 in C. elegans), which is the key terminal effector of the hypoxia response pathway that maintains oxygen homeostasis. The authors are trying to demonstrate that (1) the hypoxia response pathway is a key regulator of cysteine homeostasis, specifically through the regulation of cysteine dioxygenase, and (2) that the pathway responds to changes in cysteine homeostasis in a mechanistically distinct way from how it responds to hypoxic stress.</p>
<p>Briefly summarized here, the authors initiated this study by generating transgenic animals expressing a CDO-1::GFP protein chimera from the cdo-1 promoter so that they could identify regulators of CDO-1 expression through a forward genetic screen. This screen identified mutants with elevated CDO-1::GFP expression in two genes, egl-9 and rhy-1, whose wild-type products are negative regulators of HIF-1, raising the possibility that cdo-1 is a HIF-1 transcriptional target. Indeed, the authors provide data showing that cdo-1 regulation by EGL-9 and RHY-1 is dependent on HIF-1 and that regulation by RHY-1 is dependent on CYSL-1, as expected from other published findings of this pathway. The authors show that exogenous cysteine activates cdo-1 expression, reflective of what is known to occur in other systems. Moreover, they find that exogenous cysteine is toxic to worms lacking CYSL-1 or HIF-1 activity, but not CDO-1 activity, suggesting that HIF-1 mediates a survival response to toxic levels of cysteine and that this response requires more than just the regulation of CDO-1. The authors validate their expression studies using a GFP knockin at the cdo-1 locus, and they demonstrate that a key site of action for CDO-1 is the hypodermis. They present genetic epistasis analysis supporting a role for RHY-1, both as a regulator of HIF-1 and as a transcriptional target of HIF-1, in offsetting toxicity from aberrant sulfur metabolism. The authors use CRISPR/Cas9 editing to mutate a key amino acid in the prolyl hydroxylase domain of EGL-9, arguing that EGL-9 inhibits CDO-1 expression through a mechanism that is largely independent of the prolyl hydroxylase activity.</p>
<p>Overall, the data seem rigorous, and the conclusions drawn from the data seem appropriate. The experiments test the hypothesis using logical and clever molecular genetic tools and design. The sample size is a bit lower than is typical for C. elegans papers; however, the experiments are clearly not underpowered, so this is not an issue. The paper is likely to drive many in the field (including the authors themselves) into deeper experiments on (1) how the pathway senses hypoxia and sulfur/cysteine/H2S using these distinct mechanisms/modalities, (2) how oxygen and sulfur/cysteine/H2S homeostasis influence one another, and (3) how this single pathway evolved to sense and respond to both of these stress modalities.</p>
<p>Major strengths of the paper include (1) the use of the powerful whole animal C. elegans model to reveal results that have meaning in vivo, (2) the careful demonstration through mutant rescue experiments that key transgenes have functional activity, (3) the use of CRISPR/Cas9 editing to mutate a critical residue in the catalytic domain of the EGL-9 prolyl hydroxylase, (4) transgenic rescue experiments that show that CDO-1 operates in the hypodermis with regard to the larval arrest phenotype, and (5) the thorough epistatic analysis of different pathway mutants.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses of the paper include (1) the over-reliance on genetic approaches, (2) the lack of novelty regarding prolyl hydroxylase-independent activities of EGL-9, and (3) the lack of biochemical approaches to probe the underlying mechanism of the prolyl hydroxylase-independent activity of EGL-9.</p>
<p>Major Issues We Feel the Authors Should Address:</p>
<p>1. One particularly glaring concern is that the authors really do not know the extent to which the prolyl hydroxylase activity is (or is not) impacted by the H487A mutation in egl-9(rae276). If there is a fair amount of enzymatic activity left in this mutant, then it complicates interpretation. The paper would be strengthened if the authors could show that the egl-9(rae276) eliminates most if not all prolyl hydroxylase activity. In addition, the authors may want to consider doing RNAi for egl-9 in the egl-9(rae276) mutant as a control, as this would support the claim that whatever non-hydroxylase activity EGL-9 may have is indeed the causative agent for the elevation of CDO-1::GFP. Without such experiments, readers are left with the nagging concern that this allele is simply a hypomorph for the single biochemical activity of EGL-9 (i.e., the prolyl hydroxylase activity) rather than the more interesting, hypothesized scenario that EGL-9 has multiple biochemical activities, only one of which is the prolyl hydroxylase activity.</p>
<p>2. The authors observed that EGL-9 can inhibit HIF-1 and the expression of the HIF-1 target cdo-1 through a combination of activities that are (1) dependent on its prolyl hydroxylase activity (and subsequent VHL-1 activity that acts on the resulting hydroxylated prolines on HIF-1), and (2) independent of that activity. This is not a novel finding, as the authors themselves carefully note in their Discussion section, as this odd phenomenon has been observed for many HIF-1 target genes in multiple publications. While this manuscript adds to the description of this phenomenon, it does not really probe the underlying mechanism or shed light on how EGL-9 has these dual activities. This limits the overall impact and novelty of the paper.</p>
<p>3. Cysteine dioxygenases like CDO-1 operate in an oxygen-dependent manner to generate sulfites from cysteine. CDO-1 activity is dependent upon availability of molecular oxygen; this is an unexpected characteristic of a HIF-1 target, as its very activation is dependent on low molecular oxygen. Authors neither address this in the text nor experimentally, and it seems a glaring omission.</p>
<p>4. The authors determined that the hypodermis is the site of the most prominent CDO-1::GFP expression, relevant to Figure 4. This claim would be strengthened if a negative control tissue, in the animal with the knockin allele, were shown. The hypodermal specific expression is a highlight of this paper, so it would make this article even stronger if they could further substantiate this claim.</p>
<p>Minor issues to note:</p>
<p>Mutants for hif-1 and cysl-1 are sensitive to exogenous cysteine levels, yet loss of CDO-1 expression is not sufficient to explain this phenomenon, suggesting other targets of HIF-1 are involved. Given the findings the authors (and others) have had showing a role for RHY-1 in sulfur amino acid metabolism, shouldn't the authors consider testing rhy-1 mutants for sensitivity to exogenous cysteine?</p>
<p>The cysteine exposure assay was performed by incubating nematodes overnight in liquid M9 media containing OP50 culture. The liquid culture approach adds two complications: (1) the worms are arguably starving or at least undernourished compared to animals grown on NGM plates, and (2) the worms are probably mildly hypoxic in the liquid cultures, which complicates the interpretation.</p>
<p>An easily addressable concern is the wording of one of the main conclusions: that cdo-1 transcription is independent of the canonical prolyl hydroxylase function of EGL-9 and is instead dependent on one of EGL-9's non-canonical, non-characterized functions. There are several points in which the wording suggests that CDO-1 toxicity is independent of EGL-9. In their defense, the authors try to avoid this by saying, &quot;EGL-9 PHD,&quot; to indicate that it is the prolyl hydroxylase function of EGL-9 that is not required for CDO-1 toxicity. However, this becomes confusing because much of the field uses PHD and EGL-9/EGLN as interchangeable protein names. The authors need to be clear about when they are describing the prolyl hydroxylase activity of EGL-9 rather than other (hypothesized) activities of EGL-9 that are independent of the prolyl hydroxylase activity.</p>
<p>The authors state in the text, &quot;the egl-9; suox-1 double mutants are extremely sick and slow growing.&quot; We appreciate that their &quot;health&quot; assay, based on the exhaustion of food from the plate, is qualitative. We also appreciate that it is a functional measure of many factors that contribute to how fast a population of worms can grow, reproduce, and consume that lawn of food. However, unless they do a lifespan assay and/or measure developmental timing and specifically determine that the double mutant animals themselves are developing and/or growing more slowly, we do not think it is appropriate to use the words &quot;slow growing&quot; to describe the population. As they point out, the rate of consumption of food on the plate in their health assay is determined by a multitude and indeed a confluence of factors; the growth rate is one specific one that is commonly measured and has an established meaning.</p>
