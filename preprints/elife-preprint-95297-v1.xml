<title>Introductory paragraph</title><p><italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> is a microbiota species in humans that can modulate host immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, but has also acquired antibiotic resistance and is a major cause of hospital-associated infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Notably, diverse strains of <italic>E. faecium</italic> produce SagA, a highly conserved peptidoglycan hydrolase that is sufficient to promote intestinal immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and immune checkpoint inhibitor antitumor activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. However, the essential functions of SagA in <italic>E. faecium</italic> were unknown. Here we report that deletion of <italic>sagA</italic> impaired <italic>E. faecium</italic> growth and resulted in bulged and clustered enterococci due to defective peptidoglycan cleavage and cell separation. Moreover, Δ<italic>sagA</italic> showed increased antibiotic sensitivity, yielded lower levels of active muropeptides, displayed reduced activation of the peptidoglycan pattern-recognition receptor NOD2, and failed to promote cancer immunotherapy. Importantly, plasmid-based expression of SagA, but not its catalytically-inactive mutant, restored Δ<italic>sagA</italic> growth, production of active muropeptides and NOD2 activation. SagA is therefore essential for <italic>E. faecium</italic> growth, stress resistance and activation of host immunity.</p>

<title>Main Text</title>
<p><italic>Enterococcus</italic> is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria that is composed of more than seventy different species found in diverse environments, both free-living and in relationships with various animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> strains have been isolated from humans and reported to have both beneficial and pathogenic properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Notably, antibiotic resistant strains of <italic>E. faecium</italic>, particularly vancomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> (VREfm), have emerged as major causes of healthcare-associated infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and have been correlated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and increased mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. <italic>E. faecium</italic> has also been recovered from ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease patients and has been shown to exacerbate intestinal inflammation and colitis in mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, commensal strains of <italic>E. faecium</italic> have also been reported to enhance intestinal immunity in animal models and have been developed as probiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, microbiota analysis has shown that <italic>E. faecium</italic> was enriched in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy-responsive patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. These studies highlight the potential pathogenic and beneficial features of <italic>E. faecium</italic>.</p>
<p>Our laboratory previously investigated the beneficial effects of <italic>E. faecium</italic> on host physiology. We demonstrated that secreted antigen A (SagA), a highly conserved NlpC/P60 peptidoglycan hydrolase in <italic>E. faecium</italic>, was sufficient to confer protection against enteric infections in both <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In mice, <italic>E. faecium</italic> and an <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strain engineered to express SagA both up-regulated expression of mucins and antimicrobial peptides, resulting in improved intestinal barrier function as well as tolerance to <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium and <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In contrast, wild-type <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, which does not express SagA, did not exhibit these effects. We then determined the X-ray crystal structure of the SagA NlpC/P60 hydrolase domain, and demonstrated that this hydrolase preferentially cleaves crosslinked peptidoglycan fragments into smaller muropeptides (such as GlcNAc-MDP), which more effectively activate the peptidoglycan pattern recognition receptor NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2) in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Importantly, NOD2 was shown to be required for <italic>E. faecium</italic> stimulation of intestinal immunity and tolerance to infection <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, <italic>E. faecium</italic> and SagA were sufficient to protect mice against dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis that required the expression of NOD2 in myeloid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The discovery of <italic>E. faecium</italic> among the microbiota of cancer immunotherapy-responsive patients then motivated our analysis of <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species and SagA in mouse tumor models. Indeed, diverse strains of <italic>E. faecium</italic> that express SagA, but none of the non-SagA-expressing <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strains evaluated, were sufficient to promote ICI (anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4) anti-tumor activity against different cancer types in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, other <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species including <italic>E. durans</italic>, <italic>E. hirae</italic> and <italic>E. mundtii,</italic> which each have SagA orthologs with greater than 80% protein similarity to that of <italic>E. faecium</italic>, were sufficient to enhance anti-PD-L1 antitumor activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The SagA orthologs from these other <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species were expressed and secreted at similar levels to <italic>E. faecium</italic> SagA and showed similar peptidoglycan hydrolase activity <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Importantly, heterologous expression of SagA in inactive bacterial species (<italic>E. faecalis</italic> and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>) was sufficient to promote anti-PD-L1 antitumor activity and required NOD2 <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Collectively, these studies demonstrated that <italic>Enterococcus</italic> peptidoglycan remodeling by SagA is sufficient to enhance intestinal immunity against infection and promote cancer immunotherapy. However, the endogenous functions of SagA in <italic>E. faecium</italic> microbiology and modulation of host immunity were not investigated previously, as <italic>sagA</italic> was believed to be an essential gene in <italic>E. faecium</italic> (strain TX1330), as reported by Murray and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, our collaborative studies with the Duerkop laboratory have indicated that phage-resistant strains of <italic>E. faecium</italic> (strain Com12) containing catalytically inactivating point mutations in <italic>sagA</italic> were still viable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, suggesting that SagA may not be essential and could be functionally evaluated in <italic>E. faecium</italic>.</p>
<p>Here we report the generation of a Δ<italic>sagA</italic> strain of <italic>E. faecium</italic> (Com15). This strain, generated using RecT-mediated recombineering methods developed by our laboratory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, exhibited significantly impaired growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1a</bold></xref>) and sedimentation in liquid culture (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy revealed that Δ<italic>sagA</italic> cells form irregular clusters, as opposed to the typical wild-type morphology of diplococci or short chains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1b</bold></xref>). This cell morphology suggested that dividing Δ<italic>sagA</italic> cells may be unable to separate from one another during binary fission. Indeed, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of chemically fixed samples confirmed that Δ<italic>sagA</italic> cells have defects in cell separation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1c</bold></xref>). Division septa could form and mature in these cells; however, daughter cells failed to separate, resulting in clusters of unseparated cells. Cells on the periphery of these clusters were highly strained, and in some cases appeared to lyse and leave behind strands of undegraded peptidoglycan. We then performed whole-genome sequencing to assess the fidelity of the Δ<italic>sagA</italic> strain’s genome to that of wild-type. While Δ<italic>sagA</italic> contained a small number of mutations, most were outside of open-reading frames (ORFs) or were in genes that are unrelated to peptidoglycan metabolism (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Extended Data Table 1</xref></bold>). One notable mutation, however, was in the predicted glycosidase EFWG_00994. This mutation, L200F, alters a leucine residue that is conserved among GH73 family members and the other putative Com15 glucosaminidases (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Extended Data Table 1</xref></bold>). To confirm that the Δ<italic>sagA</italic> growth defect was truly SagA-dependent and was not an outcome of suppressor mutations, we generated a complementation strain (Δ<italic>sagA</italic>/ p<italic>sagA</italic>) that contained a plasmid expressing <italic>sagA</italic> under control of its native promoter. Western blot analysis with ɑ-SagA polyclonal serum confirmed the deletion and complementation of SagA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1d</bold></xref>). The complementation largely restored the log-phase growth rate and stationary-phase OD of the Δ<italic>sagA</italic> strain to those of wild-type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1a</bold></xref>). It also reversed the liquid-culture sedimentation phenotype (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref></bold>) and reduced the cell clustering (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1b</bold></xref>) and defective septal separation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1c</bold></xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate the significance of peptidoglycan hydrolase activity in SagA, we generated a catalytically inactive point mutant (C431A) in our <italic>sagA</italic> complementation plasmid. Consistent with our previous biochemical results on recombinant SagA NlpC/P60 domain activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, the C431A mutant was unable to complement the <italic>sagA</italic> deletion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1a-c</bold></xref>), despite Western blot analysis confirming that the mutant SagA was expressed and secreted properly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1d</bold></xref>). Together, these results demonstrated that catalytically active SagA is required for proper <italic>E. faecium</italic> growth.</p>
<p>Based on the growth defect of Δ<italic>sagA</italic> and the previously-reported antibiotic sensitization effect of catalytically inactivating point mutants in the SagA of <italic>E. faecium</italic> strain Com12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, we chose to investigate the impact of the <italic>sagA</italic> deletion on the effectiveness of various cell wall-acting antibiotics. Using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test strips of common antibiotics (vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, telavancin, fosfomycin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and imipenem), we observed increased sensitivity to the β-lactams (ampicillin, ceftriaxone and imipenem), moderately increased sensitivity to daptomycin, tigecycline, fosfomycin, and linezolid and no change in sensitivity to telavancin and vancomycin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). MIC analysis of ampicillin in liquid culture, further demonstrated that Δ<italic>sagA</italic> has increased susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics, which was abrogated with p<italic>sagA</italic> expression (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To further investigate the growth defect and increased β-lactam antibiotic sensitivity of Δ<italic>sagA</italic>, we performed cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) on frozen-hydrated samples to quantify factors such as peptidoglycan thickness, septum thickness, and placement of divisome components at a higher resolution (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Extended Data Fig. 3a,b</xref></bold>). There was no statistically significant change in peptidoglycan thickness and septum thickness in Δ<italic>sagA</italic> and Δ<italic>sagA/</italic> p<italic>sagA</italic> cells compared to wild-type cells (<bold>Extended Data Fig 3c,d</bold>). Similar to previous studies of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, the divisome machinery was directly observable as concentric rings in cross-sectional images generated by cryo-ET in <italic>E. faecium</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Extended Data Fig. 4a-d</xref></bold>). We quantified the distances from these rings in order to assess potential differences in divisome placement (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref></bold>). The distance between the septal membrane and the distal ring of the divisome showed a slight increase, but we did not observe any statistical difference between the distance from the septal membrane to the proximal ring and the ratio between the proximal and distal rings in wild-type, Δ<italic>sagA</italic>, and complementation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Extended data Fig. 4f,g</xref></bold>). However, we observed that the placement and projection angle of growing septa were significantly altered in Δs<italic>agA</italic> but were mostly restored by complementation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2a-f</bold></xref>). Both room temperature TEM and cryo-ET revealed that <italic>sagA</italic> complementation largely restored the wild-type cell morphology of Δ<italic>sagA</italic> to that of wild-type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">4</xref></bold>). The complemented cells separate from one another and mostly take the form of diplococci. These results suggest that the ultrastructure of the peptidoglycan cell wall is unchanged as a result of <italic>sagA</italic> deletion, but peptidoglycan cleavage, divisome angle and septal resolution are impaired.</p>

<p><italic>E. faecium</italic> is a prominent microbiota species and pathogen in animals and humans. While <italic>E. faecium</italic> identification and dominance in fecal microbiota have been correlated with health and disease outcomes, the underlying mechanisms have only begun to emerge. Our previous gain-of-function studies with recombinant protein and engineered bacterial strains demonstrated that SagA, a unique secreted peptidoglycan hydrolase that is highly conserved in <italic>E. faecium</italic> strains and other <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species, but not <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, is sufficient to activate NOD2 and promote host immunity <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. However, the endogenous functions of SagA in <italic>E. faecium</italic> were unknown. Based on the results described above, we now show that SagA peptidoglycan hydrolase activity is not required for <italic>E. faecium</italic> viability, but essential for proper growth and specifically for septal separation following cell division (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></bold>). These results are consistent with key peptidoglycan hydrolases in other bacterial species, such as AmiA/B in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, CwlO/LytE in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, PcsB in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and RipC in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Although the mechanisms of regulation may differ amongst peptidoglycan hydrolases and remain to be determined for SagA, the <italic>sagA</italic> promoter contains sequence motifs that may be regulated by WalRK two-component systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and the SagA protein contains a N-terminal coil-coil domain that may interact with <italic>E. faecium</italic> divisome components, which warrants further investigation in the future. Notably, the deletion of <italic>sagA</italic> in <italic>E. faecium</italic> Com15 also renders this strain more susceptible to cell wall-acting antibiotics (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref></bold>), akin to inactive SagA variants in <italic>E. faecium</italic> Com12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, suggesting SagA and its related peptidoglycan hydrolases may be potential antibacterial targets to use in combination with existing antibiotics. Interestingly, clade B strains of <italic>E. faecium</italic> including Com12 and Com15 have been suggested to be reclassified as <italic>Enterococcus lactis</italic> based on genomic and phenotypic similarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, SagA orthologs have greater than 90 percent protein sequence identity within the C-terminal NlpC/P60 hydrolase domain of ICI therapy-promoting <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species (<italic>E. faecium-clade A and B, E. durans, E. hirae</italic> and <italic>E. mundtii</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Notably, all the <italic>Enterococcus</italic> strains and species that express active SagA orthologs that we have analyzed promote ICI cancer immunotherapy in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Beyond intrinsic functions in <italic>E. faecium</italic> microbiology, we have also demonstrated for the first time that SagA is essential for the activation of host immunity. Notably, we showed that Δ<italic>sagA</italic> does not generate significant amounts of non-crosslinked muropeptides (i.e. GlcNAc-MDP) that are sensed by the peptidoglycan pattern recognition receptor NOD2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). Indeed, Δ<italic>sagA</italic> failed to activate NOD2 <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>) and promote ICI antitumor activity in mouse models compared to wild-type <italic>E. faecium</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4</bold></xref>). Collectively, our results provide important mechanistic insight on SagA in peptidoglycan remodeling for bacterial cell separation and reveal an essential feature of <italic>E. faecium</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref></bold>) and other related <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species that are associated human health, disease, and response to therapy.</p>

Three days after bacterial colonization (Day 0), mice were subcutaneously implanted with B16F10 melanoma cells (10<sup>5</sup> cells per mice) or MC38 tumor cells (3x10<sup>5</sup> cells per mice) with Matrigel matrix (Corning, 356231). Once the tumors established (around 100 mm<sup>3</sup>), tumor volume was measured every two days by digital calipers and was calculated as length x width<sup>2</sup> x 0.5, where the width was the smaller of the two measurements. For B16F10 implanted mice, 20 ug anti–PD-L1 (BioXCell, BP0101) were administered to the mice at Day 6, 9 and 12 by intraperitoneal injection in 200 μL antibody buffer solution (BioXCell, PH 6.5 dilution buffer). For MC38 implanted mice, 100 ug anti–PD-1 (BioXCell, BP0146) were administered to the mice at Day 5, 7, 9, 11 and 14 by intraperitoneal injection in 200 μL antibody buffer solution (BioXCell, PH 7.0 dilution buffer). Mice were euthanized with CO2 asphyxiation when the tumors larger than 1.5 cm<sup>3</sup> or any ulceration or lesioning developed.</p>

<title>Fecal colonization analysis</title>
<p>Fecal samples were sterilely collected six days after the start of bacterial administration. Fecal samples were weighed, resuspended in sterile PBS, homogenized by douncing with sterile pestles, serially diluted in sterile PBS, and then plated by drip assay onto selective HiCrome™ <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> Agar plates (HIMEDIA 1580) with <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> selective supplement (FD226, HIMEDIA). Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C under ambient atmosphere and colonies were manually counted.</p>

<title>Cell isolation and flow cytometry analysis</title>
<p>Tumor dissection and cell isolation were performed as previously described<sup>6</sup>. The dissected tumor samples were placed in RPMI with 1.5 U mL<sup>-1</sup> Liberase TM (Roche 5401119001), 0.2 mg mL-1 DNase I (Worthington Biochemical LS002006) and ceramic spheres (6.35 mm, MP Biomedicals 116540424-CF) for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Samples were then filtered and resuspended in 5 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer (ThermoFisher 00-4333-57) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and incubate with 1:1000 Zombie Yellow stain (BioLegend 423103) for 20 min at room temperature. After two times wash, samples were incubated with 20 μL of staining buffer containing 0.5 μL of TruStain FcX anti–mouse CD16/32 blocking agent (BioLegend 101319) for 30 min at room temperature. Sample directly incubate with anti-CD4 (BUV496, GK1.5, BD Biosciences 612953) and anti-PD-1 (BV711, CD279, BD Biosciences 135231) for another 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice, fixed and permeabilized with the FoxP3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (ThermoFisher 00-5523-00) overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed twice with perm buffer and then incubated with 20 μL of perm buffer containing 10% rat serum (ThermoFisher 24-5555-94) for 20 min on ice. Cells were then stainied with the follow antibodies for 20 min on ice: anti-CD45 (APC-Fire 750, 30-F11, BioLegend 103153), anti-CD3 (BV785, 17A2, BioLegend 100232), anti-NK1.1 (BV480, PK136, BD Biosciences 746265) anti-CD8 (PE-Cy-7, 53-6.7, BioLegend 100721), anti-FoxP3 (AF532, FJK-16s, ThermoFisher 58-5773-80), anti-Granzyme B (PE-CF594, GB11, BD Biosciences 562462) and anti-Ki67 (FITC, SolA15, LifeTech 11-5698-82). Samples were analyzed using Cytek Aurora spectral flow cytometer and the data were analyzed using FlowJo Version 10.9.0.</p>

<p>Klupt, Fam, Zhang, Hang, and colleagues present a novel study examining the function of sagA in E. faecium, including impacts on growth, peptidoglycan cleavage, cell separation, antibiotic sensitivity, NOD2 activation, and modulation of cancer immunotherapy. This manuscript represents a substantial advance over their prior work, where they found that sagA-expressing strains (including naturally-expressing strains and versions of non-expressing strains forced to overexpress sagA) were superior in activating NOD2 and improving cancer immunotherapy. Prior to the current study, an examination of sagA mutant E. faecium was not possible and sagA was thought to be an essential gene.</p>
<p>The study is overall very carefully performed with appropriate controls and experimental checks, including confirmation of similar densities of ΔsagA throughout. Results are overall interpreted cautiously and appropriately.</p>
<p>I have only two comments that I think addressing would strengthen what is already an excellent manuscript.</p>
<p>In the experiments depicted in Figure 3, the authors should clarify the quantification of peptidoglycans from cellular material vs supernatants. It should also be clarified whether the sagA need to be expressed endogenously within E. faecium, and whether ambient endopeptidases (perhaps expressed by other nearby bacteria or recombinant enzymes added) can enzymatically work on ΔsagA cell wall products to produce NOD2 ligands?</p>
<p>In the murine experiments depicted in Figure 4, because the bacterial intervention is being performed continuously in the drinking water, the investigators have not distinguished between colonization vs continuous oral dosing of the mice peptidoglycans. While I do not think additional experimentation is required to distinguish the individual contributions of these 2 components in their therapeutic intervention, I do think the interpretation of their results should include this perspective.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The gut microbiome contributes to variation in the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in cancer therapy; however, the mechanisms responsible remain unclear. Klupt et al. build upon prior data implicating the secreted peptidoglycan hydrolase SagA produced by Enterococcus faecium in immunotherapy, leveraging novel strains with sagA deleted and complemented. They find that sagA is non-essential, but sagA deletion leads to a marked growth defect due to impaired cell division. Furthermore, sagA is necessary for the immunogenic and anti-tumor effects of E. faecium. Together, this study utilizes compelling methods to provide fundamental new insights into E. faecium biology and host interactions, and a proof-of-concept for identifying the bacterial effectors of immunotherapy response.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Klupt et al. provide a well-written manuscript with clear and compelling main and supplemental figures. The methods used are state-of-the-art, including various imaging modalities, bacterial genetics, mass spectrometry, sequencing, flow cytometry, and mouse models of immunotherapy response. Overall, the data supports the conclusions, which are a valuable addition to the literature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Only minor revision recommendations were noted.</p>
