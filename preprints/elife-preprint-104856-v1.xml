<title>Abstract</title><p>The clearance of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) remains a significant public health challenge due to impaired cellular immune responses and HIV-1 maintenance during acute infection. However, the genetic and epigenetic changes influencing the immune response on host infected cells remain unclear. Here, this study analyzes HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) during early infection (&lt;6 months) using single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing. It is observed that HIV-1 hinders the antiviral response, particularly by interfering with the interferon signalling pathway. Multimodal analysis identifies KLF2 as a key transcription factor in infected CD4+ T cells. Moreover, cells harbouring HIV-1 provirus are predominantly identified as Th17 cells, which exhibit elevated KLF2 activity. This suggests an increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and a constrained immune response due to the quiescent characteristics of these cells. The finding provides insights into the immune mechanisms and key regulators of HIV-1 maintenance in CD4+ T cells during the early stages of infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Each year, approximately two million people are infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), and about 1.1 million individuals die from HIV-related illnesses. HIV-1 primarily targets CD4+ T lymphocytes, leading to a gradual depletion of this critical T-cell population and the eventual onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) helps inhibit HIV-1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], the persistent presence of the virus causes chronic inflammation, contributing to HIV-related morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Additionally, latent proviruses can be reactivated and causing viral rebound if ART is discontinued. As a result, achieving complete clearance of HIV-1 remains a major goal and public health challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>During HIV-1 infection, cellular immune responses are disrupted, leading to immune cell dysfunction and alterations in the immune cell landscape. Acute HIV infection (AHI) occurs from 3 weeks to 6 months after transmission, following an initial period when the viral load is undetectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Once proviruses integrate into the host genome, they impact the recruitment of regulatory factors, thereby affecting gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. These modifications during AHI play a role in the host cell’s initial immune response and contribute to HIV-1 latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Studying transcriptomic changes during AHI is crucial to identify primary immune responses and regulatory factors that influence HIV-1’s effect on host immune cell function.</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq) are powerful techniques that provide insights into cellular diversity, allowing for high-resolution analysis of gene expression and regulatory landscapes in individual cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have driven numerous studies to uncover biological factors contributing to HIV-1 pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. However, challenges remain in studying genetic and epigenetic regulation in HIV-1-infected cells: low HIV-1+ CD4+ T cell frequency in PBMCs limits reliable analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], ex vivo activation in previous studies does not capture in vivo heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Additionally, although recent studies have attempted direct ex vivo omics analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], integrating these datasets remains difficult due to the varying cell types used in each dataset.</p>
<p>To address these limitations, we conducted single-cell multi-omics analyses on PBMCs from people living with HIV (PLWH) in the early stages of infection. Using a targeted sequencing strategy, we identified and analyzed HIV-1-infected cells at the single-cell level. Based on these findings, we established a gene regulatory network specific to HIV-1-infected cells. This study highlights multiple immune pathways and regulatory factors mediating the effects of acute HIV-1 infection on immune cell function, offering potential therapeutic targets for complete HIV-1 eradication.</p>

<title>Result 1: The single cell transcriptional landscape of HIV-1 infected cells in early stage of infection</title>
<p>To uncover immune mechanisms and transcriptional regulation in HIV-1-infected cells, we performed single-cell multiomics sequencing on PBMCs from nine individuals with early-stage HIV infection (&lt; 6 months) (Supplementary Table 1). Using the 10x Genomics Single-Cell platform, we obtained five scRNA-seq and four snRNA-seq data from single cell multiome datasets. We integrated scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data, identifying 16 distinct cell populations based on marker genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1A). Focusing on CD4+ T cells as main targets of HIV-1, we defined four subtypes: CD4 naïve T cells, CD4+ effector memory T cells (CD4 EM cells), T helper (Th)2 cells, and Th17 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1B). <italic>LDHB</italic> and <italic>SELL</italic> were highly expressed in CD4 naïve T cells, whereas CD4 EM cells were characterized by high expression levels of <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> and <italic>GZMK</italic>. Among the activated CD4+ T cells, Th2 cells were identified based on the expression of <italic>STAT6</italic> and <italic>GATA3</italic> and Th17 cells were annotated based on the expression levels of <italic>RORA</italic> and <italic>STAT3</italic>.</p>

<p>To identify HIV-1 RNA+ cells, we aligned scRNA-seq reads to the HIV-1 genome. Additionally, we conducted targeted long-read sequencing using the remaining scRNA-seq libraries to improve the sequencing depth of HIV-1 transcripts. We identified 985 HIV-1 RNA+ cells and 3,450 uninfected cells. CD4 naïve and EM cells showed a higher proportion of HIV-1 RNA+ cells than Th2 and Th17 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1C).</p>
<p>Gene expression profiling revealed 334 upregulated and 1,002 downregulated genes in HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), including genes related to T cell activation (<italic>PRDX2</italic>, <italic>PRDX1</italic>, <italic>HLA-B</italic>, <italic>HLA-C</italic>, <italic>HLA-A</italic>, <italic>HLA-F</italic>, and <italic>HLA-E),</italic> defense responses to viruses (<italic>IFITM3</italic>, <italic>IFITM1</italic>, <italic>IFITM2</italic>, and <italic>MX1</italic>), and interferon-beta responses (<italic>IFITM3</italic>, <italic>BST2</italic>, <italic>IFITM1</italic>, <italic>IFITM2</italic>, <italic>XAF1</italic>, and <italic>SHFL</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Notably, IFITM1 was the most upregulated gene in HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells. As an interferon-stimulated gene, IFITM1 is known to inhibit HIV-1 replication by interfering with viral entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. This finding indicates that the primary cellular pathways active during acute infection are also engaged in the antiviral response to suppress HIV-1.</p>
<p>Given that CD4+ T cell differentiation influences HIV-1 survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], we used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to assess subtype-specific responses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). The GSEA results revealed that interferon-gamma and interferon-alpha responses were upregulated in all CD4+ T-cell subtypes upon HIV-1 infection. Additionally, hallmarks related to T-cell activation were downregulated in both Th2 and Th17 cells. Additionally, while interferon-alpha responses were enriched, downstream pathways (e.g., PI3-AKT-mTOR) were downregulated in Th17 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F, G</xref>). Downregulated genes in Th17 cells were linked to PI3K-AKT signaling, while no such enrichment was observed among upregulated genes (Supplementary Fig. 2A, 2B). These results suggest that activated T cells experience immune dysfunction in early HIV-1 infection, contrasting with the effects observed in naïve CD4+ T cells.</p>

<title>Result 2: Characterization of epigenetic changes in HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells in early infection</title>
<p>Single-cell multiome technology enables a detailed understanding of cell states by simultaneously profiling transcriptome and epigenetic signatures within the same cell, facilitating the construction of an accurate gene regulatory network by identifying gene expression drivers. A combined UMAP was generated based on chromatin accessibility and gene expression, with cell types annotated using marker genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3A). Additionally, coverage plots revealed cell type-specific chromatin accessibility for nearby marker genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Chromatin accessibility in HIV-1 RNA+ naïve and memory CD4+ T cells identified specific patterns, with closed DARs in naïve cells linked to TNF-alpha signaling via NF-κB and open DARs related to HIV-1 Nef protein and signal transduction. In memory CD4+ T cells, closed DARs were related to interferon signaling and negative regulation of viral transcription, whereas open DARs were related to Tat-mediated HIV elongation. When examining genes adjacent to open chromatin regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), we observed high chromatin accessibility for <italic>PSMB7</italic> and <italic>CDK9</italic> in naïve and memory CD4+ T cells, respectively, both of which interact with the HIV-1 Tat protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, the chromatin accessibility of <italic>NR4A2</italic> and <italic>TRIM62</italic>, which negatively regulate HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], was reduced in HIV-1 RNA+ cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>Result 3: Identification of key transcription factors (TFs) governing HIV-1 infection features</title>
<p>Following HIV-1 infection, host transcription factors (TFs) regulate immune responses and viral persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. To identify key TFs and construct a gene regulatory network associated with HIV-1 infection, we integrated gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells.</p>
<p>We found 15 TFs with increased and 24 with decreased regulon activity in HIV-1 RNA+ cells compared to uninfected cells across all CD4+ T-cell subtypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We also confirmed the significantly different regulon activity of these TFs by cell type. CD4 naïve and EM cells shared similar TF activity profiles, while Th17 and Th2 cells exhibited more comparable patterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). KLF2, typically high in naïve cells and suppressed in activated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], showed elevated regulon activity in naïve and EM cells, with lower activity in Th17 and Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, in HIV-1-infected cells, KLF2 activity was upregulated across all subtypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Conversely, FOXO1 showed higher regulon activity in Th17 and Th2 cells but was downregulated in HIV-1 RNA+ Th17 and Th2 cells. In HIV RNA+ cells, the TFs KLF2 and JUND showed strong regulatory activity and elevated gene expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Additionally, we identified the upregulated target genes of six TFs (KLF2, JUND, STAT1, JUNB, XBP1, MYC) in HIV-1 RNA+ cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), which were significantly associated with the defense response to viruses, negative regulation of viral genome replication, and innate immune responses (Supplementary Fig. 3B). As the GSEA result showed different enriched signaling pathways in HIV-1 RNA+ cells by various cell types (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), several key transcription factor-encoding genes (<italic>KLF2</italic>, <italic>FOXO1</italic>, <italic>TBL1XR1</italic>) which regulate PI3K-ATK signaling and p53 signaling, were also differentially expressed in each cell types.

<p>The chromatin accessibility data further supported the increased activity of these TFs in HIV-1 RNA+ cells. We calculated TF activity based on chromatin accessibility and identified enriched TF-binding motifs in HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells using DARs. KLF2-, JUND-, and FOSL2::JUNB-binding motifs were highly enriched in the DARs opened in HIV-1 RNA+ cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), along with enhanced TF activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Furthermore, TF footprinting analysis revealed higher chromatin accessibility adjacent to the KLF2-binding motif sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). The promoter region of <italic>KLF2</italic> was more accessible, with higher mRNA expression in HIV-1 RNA+ cells than in uninfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). Furthermore, the putative cis-regulatory element of KLF2 showed more chromatin-accessible peaks in HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells than in uninfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). Overall, this multidimensional approach enabled integrating gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the early stage of infection in PLWH, highlighting potential key TFs that regulate HIV-1 transcription in host cells.</p>

<title>Result 4: KLF2 is an essential regulator in the function of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells</title>
<p>Using a multidimensional approach, we identified KLF2 as a key TF within the gene regulatory network of HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells. KLF2 is reported to be involved in the quiescence, survival, and differentiation of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. However, its function in viral infection remains poorly understood. To elucidate the role of KLF2, we curated 88 KLF2 target genes from published chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip, ChIP-seq, and other TF-binding site profiling data, as well as SCENIC regulon datasets. Out of 88 KLF2 target genes, 44 were upregulated in HIV-1 RNA+ cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). These target genes were mainly associated with negative regulation of apoptotic process and negative regulation of programmed cell death (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Among these significantly upregulated KLF2 target genes, those reported to be involved in the regulation of HIV-1 replication (<italic>PIM1</italic> and <italic>IL32</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], cell proliferation (<italic>TXNIP</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], and the JAK/STAT pathway (<italic>LTB</italic>) also exhibited higher levels of chromatin accessibility in HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells than in uninfected cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Considering that CD8+ T cells play a critical role in the immune response against HIV-1 infection during chronic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], we further attempted to identify specific ligand– receptor pairs between CD4+ T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes to characterize the immune response induced by HIV-1-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Toward this end, we computed significant ligand–receptor pair interactions between CD8+ and CD4+ T cells using CellPhoneDB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. The results indicated a strong interaction between LTB and its receptor (LTBR) in naïve CD4+ T cells, whereas other CD4+ T cell subtypes displayed a weaker interaction with cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. LTB expression was also significantly elevated in HIV-1 RNA+ cells (Supplementary Table 2). Additionally, the NRP2 receptor exhibited heightened levels of interaction between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, particularly in the effector CD4+ T cell population. <italic>NRP2</italic>, a known target gene of KLF2, is expressed on T cells and modulates immune responses under pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Subsequently, we explored the interactions between the host proteins encoded by KLF2 target genes and HIV-1 proteins. Using the STRING database, we identified 16 KLF2 target genes that encode proteins that directly interact with HIV-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). One of these target genes, <italic>SOCS3</italic> which encodes a protein exhibiting a strong interaction with the Tat protein, pivotal for viral genome replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Another KLF2 target gene, <italic>PIM1</italic>, which is known as a transactivator of Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], displayed substantial interaction with JUNB and exhibited high gene expression and chromatin accessibility in HIV-1 RNA+ cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Result 5: Th17 cells exhibit increased enrichment and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection</title>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> analysis of the states of cells with the HIV-1 provirus integrated into host genome has been a long-standing challenge in HIV research. To address this issue, we defined cells with two or more scATACseq reads that aligned to the HIV-1 genome as HIV-1 DNA+ cells. The sequencing reads predominantly aligned to the 5′- and 3′-long terminal repeat (LTR) regions of the HIV-1 genome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We observed clustered HIV-1 DNA+ cells in a distinct region, indicating that these cells share a similar epigenetic profile (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 4A). DARs were identified in the cluster enriched with HIV-1 DNA+ CD4+ T cells compared to the remaining CD4+ T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The genes closest to the DARs that showed increased accessibility levels in the HIV-1 DNA+ CD4+ T cell cluster compared to the corresponding levels in the uninfected clusters were associated with the inflammatory and defense responses, which was in line with the activation of the innate immune response observed in HIV-1 RNA+ cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>

<p>Notably, we identified distinctly enriched TF-binding motifs in HIV-1 DNA+ CD4+ T cells and HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells. The binding motifs for key regulators of Th17 cell differentiation (RORC, STAT3, and RORA) were enriched in HIV-1 DNA+ CD4+ T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E, F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. These TFs were also reported to regulate viral gene expression by binding to the HIV-1 LTRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Overall, HIV-1 DNA+ cells mostly represented the Th17 cell type (Supplementary Fig. 4B, C), in contrast to HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells, which belonged to various subtypes. Additionally, we confirmed significant enrichment of the KLF2 TF-binding motif in HIV-1 DNA+ CD4+ T cells, as found for HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, we detected increased gene expression levels and chromatin accessibility of <italic>CCR6</italic>, <italic>IL4I1</italic>, <italic>NFKB1</italic>, and <italic>CCR5</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In response to early HIV-1 infection, various host immune responses are triggered, contingent upon the subtype of CD4+ T cells. Our study utilized scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets to profile PBMCs from early HIV-1-infected patients, revealing specific immune responses and mechanisms in distinct HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cell subsets that contribute to HIV pathogenesis. We further identified key regulators of HIV-1 persistence in CD4+ T cells, offering new targets for complete viral elimination.</p>
<p>Interferons play a crucial role in the initial antiviral response during early viral infection by upregulating interferon-stimulated genes and activating signaling pathways like JAK/STAT, PI3K, and p53-dependent pathways. These pathways facilitate T-cell differentiation and selective proliferation of antiviral T cells, effectively inhibiting viral replication and clearing infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. However, our findings indicate that during acute HIV-1 infection, Th2 and Th17 cells exhibit heightened interferon-alpha responses, despite diminished downstream signaling pathways. This suggests a potential immunological malfunction induced by HIV-1, hindering host antiviral responses by disrupting interferon target signaling, akin to strategies observed in other viruses like Influenza, HCV, and HSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>].</p>
<p>In CD4+ memory T cells, we observed enriched chromatin accessibility linked to Tat-mediated HIV-1 elongation, concurrent with downregulated interferon-gamma signaling. This underscores HIV-1’s ability to persist in memory CD4+ T cells and evade host antiviral responses early in infection. Through integrated analysis, we identified KLF2 as a pivotal transcription factor within the regulatory network of HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells. KLF2, known for promoting cellular quiescence and regulating T-cell migration, exhibited sustained expression across all HIV-1-infected CD4+ T-cell subtypes, including activated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Upregulated KLF2 target genes associated with HIV-1 replication and TXNIP, a cell proliferation inhibitor, further suggest HIV-1’s ability to persist without triggering transcriptional repressors or proliferation.</p>
<p>Using scATAC-seq data, we differentiated HIV-1 DNA+ CD4+ T cells, revealing enriched TF motifs (RORC, STAT3, RORA) indicative of Th17 cell predominance. These cells, unlike HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cells distributed across various subtypes, exhibited heightened susceptibility and integration of HIV DNA, with increased expression of <italic>CCR6</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic>—critical HIV-1 co-receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Moreover, enriched KLF2 motifs in HIV-1 DNA+ cells positively regulate <italic>CCR5</italic> expression, along with increased <italic>IL4I1</italic> expression linked to Th17 cell immunosuppression and <italic>NFKB1</italic> involved in HIV-1 genome transcription initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. This suggests Th17 cells’ potential role as reservoirs due to their susceptibility, quiescent nature, and stem cell-like characteristics.</p>
<p>Limitations include the inability of our HIV-1 targeted sequencing strategy to distinguish HIV-1 RNA from DNA within single cells, necessitating deeper sequencing to capture transcriptionally silenced proviruses. Our study’s design focused on early infection stages (&lt; 6 months), limiting insights into longitudinal changes in cell populations and gene expression profiles during HIV-1 progression. Given the heterogeneity of HIV-1 infection among PLWH, our findings primarily apply to early infection stages and require validation across different infection phases.</p>
<p>In summary, our study unveils disrupted immune mechanisms in distinct HIV-1 RNA+ CD4+ T cell subsets and underscores KLF2’s role in HIV-1-infected cells. We propose that this dysregulation enables HIV-1 transcription maintenance while attenuating pathogenic immune responses. Furthermore, Th17 cells may serve as reservoirs due to their heightened susceptibility and KLF2-mediated CCR5 expression. Our findings provide insights into the complex transcriptional and epigenetic changes during HIV-1 infection, informing potential immunomodulatory therapies to restore normal immune responses and enhance viral control in PLWH, thereby limiting disease progression.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV-1 persistence and host immune dysfunction in CD4+ T cells during early infection (&lt;6 months). Using single-cell multi-omics technologies-including scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and single-cell multiome analyses-they characterized the transcriptional and epigenomic landscapes of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. They identified key transcription factors (TFs), signaling pathways, and T cell subtypes involved in HIV-1 persistence, particularly highlighting KLF2 and Th17 cells as critical regulators of immune suppression. The study provides new insights into immune dysregulation during early HIV-1 infection and reveals potential epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in HIV-1-infected T cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study excels through its innovative integration of single-cell multi-omics technologies, enabling detailed analysis of gene regulatory networks in HIV-1-infected cells. Focusing on early infection stages, it fills a crucial knowledge gap in understanding initial immune responses and viral reservoir establishment. The identification of KLF2 as a key transcription factor and Th17 cells as major viral reservoirs, supported by comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, provides robust evidence for the study's conclusions. These findings have immediate clinical relevance by identifying potential therapeutic targets for HIV-1 reservoir eradication.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite its strengths, the study has several limitations. By focusing exclusively on CD4+ T cells, the study overlooks other relevant immune cells such as CD14+ monocytes, NK cells, and B cells. Additionally, while the authors generated their own single-cell datasets, they need to validate their findings using other publicly available single-cell data from HIV-1-infected PBMCs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors observed gene ontologies associated with upregulated KLF2 target genes in HIV-1 RNA+ CD4 T Cells using scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets from the PBMCs of early HIV-1-infected patients, showing immune responses contributing to HIV pathogenesis and novel targets for viral elimination.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors carried out detailed transcriptomics profiling with scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets to conclude upregulated KLF2 target genes in HIV-1 RNA+ CD4 T Cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This key observation of up-regulation KLF2 associated genes family might be important in the HIV field for early diagnosis and viral clearance. However, with the limited sample size and in-vivo study model, it will be hard to conclude. I highly recommend increasing the sample size of early HIV-1-infected patients.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript studies intracellular changes and immune processes during early HIV-1 infection with an additional focus on the small CD4+ T cell subsets. The authors used single-cell omics to achieve high resolution of transcriptomic and epigenomic data on the infected cells which were verified by viral RNA expression. The results add to understanding of transcriptional regulation which may allow progression or HIV latency later in infected cells. The biosamples were derived from early HIV infection cases, providing particularly valuable data for the HIV research field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors examined the heterogeneity of infected cells within CD4 T cell populations, identified a significant and unexpected difference between naive and effector CD4 T cells, and highlighted the differences in Th2 and Th17 cells. Multiple methods were used to show the role of the increased KLF2 factor in infected cells. This is a valuable finding of a new role for the major transcription factor in further disease progression and/or persistence.</p>
<p>The methods employed by the authors are robust. Single-cell RNA-Seq from PBMC samples was followed by a comprehensive annotation of immune cell subsets, 16 in total. This manuscript presents to the scientific community a valuable multi-omics dataset of good quality, which could be further analyzed in the context of larger studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Methods and Supplementary materials</p>
<p>
Some technical aspects could be described in more detail. For example, it is unclear how the authors filtered out cells that did not pass quality control, such as doublets and cells with low transcript/UMI content. Next, in cell annotation, what is the variability in cell types between donors? This information is important to include in the supplementary materials, especially with such a small sample size. Without this, it is difficult to determine, whether the differences between subsets on transcriptomic level, viral RNA expression level, and chromatin assessment are observed due to cell type variations or individual patient-specific variations. For the DEG analysis, did the authors exclude the most variable genes?</p>
<p>The annotation of 16 cell types from PBMC samples is impressive and of good quality, however, not all cell types get attention for further analysis. It's natural to focus primarily on the CD4 T cells according to the research objectives. The authors also study potential interactions between CD4 and CD8 T cells by cell communication inference. It would be interesting to ask additional questions for other underexplored immune cell subsets, such as: 1) Could viral RNA be detected in monocytes or macrophages during early infection? 2) What are the inferred interactions between NK cells and infected CD4 T cells, are interactions similar to CD4-CD8 results? 3) What are the inferred interactions between monocytes or macrophages and infected CD4 T cells?</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>
It would be interesting to see more discussion of the observation of how naïve T cells produce more viral RNA compared to effector T cells. It seems counterintuitive according to general levels of transcriptional and translational activity in subsets.</p>
<p>
Another discussion block could be added regarding the results and conclusion comparison with Ashokkumar et al. paper published earlier in 2024 (10.1093/gpbjnl/qzae003). This earlier publication used both a cell line-based HIV infection model and primary infected CD4 T cells and identified certain transcription factors correlated with viral RNA expression.</p>
