<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The tumor stroma is a tissue composed primarily of extracellular matrix, fibroblasts, immune cells, and vasculature. Its structure and functions, such as nutrient support and waste removal, are altered during malignancy. Tumor cells transform fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts, which have important immunosuppressive activity on which growth, invasion, and metastasis depend. These activated fibroblasts prevent immune cell infiltration into the tumor nest, thereby promoting cancer progression and inhibiting T-cell-based immunotherapy. To understand these complex interactions, we measure the density of different cell types in the stroma using immunohistochemistry techniques on tumor samples from lung cancer patients. We incorporate these data, and also known information on cell proliferation rates and relevant biochemical interactions, into a minimal dynamical system with few parameters. A spatio-temporal approach to the inhomogeneous environment explains the cell distribution and fate of lung carcinomas. The model reproduces that cancer-associated fibroblasts act as a barrier to tumor growth, but also reduce the efficiency of the immune response. The final outcome depends on the parameter values for each patient and leads to either tumor invasion, persistence, or eradication as a result of the interplay between cancer cell growth, T-cell cytotoxic activity, and fibroblast attraction, activation, and spatial dynamics. Our conclusion is that a wide spectrum of scenarios exists as a result of the competition between the characteristic times of cancer cell growth and the activity rates of the other species. Nevertheless, distinct trajectories and patterns allow quantitative predictions that may help in the selection of new therapies and personalized protocols. We conclude with different options for further modeling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer results from the malignant transformation of cells due to genetic changes or damage that causes cells to grow and spread in an abnormal and uncontrolled way. Mutated cells can form solid tumor tissue at specific sites and spread to distant regions of the body through metastasis. The growth, development, and response to drugs and therapies of tumor masses are highly dependent on biophysical environmental conditions. These involve a not fully understood crosstalk between cancer cells and the surrounding stroma, which consists of cancer-associated fibroblasts, vessels, and immune cells embedded in the extracellular matrix. Indeed, the tumor-stroma ratio turns out to be an independent prognostic factor, with a large proportion of stroma leading to a worse prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. In this paper, we focus on modeling tumorstroma interactions in lung cancer which is one of the most common and deadly cancers, with more than 2.2 million new cases diagnosed and 1.8 million deaths worldwide in 2020. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) accounts for the vast majority of lung cancers (85%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The majority of cells that make up the stroma are fibroblasts and macrophages. Both types are affected and reprogrammed by cancer cells and have been shown to act as tumor promoters and tumor suppressors, depending on the stage of tumor progression and of its mutational status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. As cancer progresses, tumor cells often transform surrounding healthy fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) which, similarly to a wound healing context, produce higher levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as growth factors and cytokines that affect the recruitment of immune or vascular cells and the growth of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Experimental observations and evidence of the mutual interactions between cancer cells, the immune response and cancer-associated fibroblasts suggest that a multi-physical model of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including molecular and spatial dynamics, could be highly beneficial in understanding and predicting the complex evolution of tumor growth and progression. Thus, such analysis mayrepresent a critical step in improving T-cell-based therapies. Quantitative models already exist for biochemical interactions between fibroblasts and cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], or for the T-cell recruitment in immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], but models for multispecies are less common. A recent paper by Mukherjee <italic>et al</italic>. analyzed the spatial dynamics of infiltrating splenocytes in an aggregate of cancerous melanocytes using experimental data obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Their conclusion is that a strong persistent random walk and contact energies are important for the ability of T-cells to infiltrate the tumor. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no approaches in the current literature to model the dynamics behind human lung tumor proliferation due to the role of CAFs in excluding T-cells from the nest. Here, we propose such a model for NSCLC tumors to describe the dynamic interplay between cancer cells, T-cells and fibroblasts in their non-activated and activated states, incorporating the most relevant interactions within the human tumor microenvironment.</p>
<p>To this end, we briefly review the literature on the interactions between different tumor components, including quantitative information on their composition. In particular, we base our model on data extracted from immuno-histochemistry (IHC) staining of the tumor microenvironment performed on a large cohort of human NSCLC tumor samples. This allows us to calibrate our model so that the densities and localization of the various species that the model yields are consistent with the actual data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] (<xref rid="s2" ref-type="sec">Section I</xref>). We then build the theoretical description in two steps. In a first step, we ignore any spatial organization and model the proliferation and activation phenomena alone, while introducing a pressure-like term to avoid excessive proliferation. This leads to a nonlinear dynamical system for the cell concentrations (<xref rid="s3" ref-type="sec">Section II</xref>). Careful analysis of this dynamical system yields a stable steady state in which T-cells become inefficient against tumor survival for a given set of parameters. More precisely, we demonstrate that two mechanisms control tumor growth: the competition with other species for resources and space, and the efficiency of the T-cell response. In a second step, we enrich the model by considering the spatio-temporal evolution of tumor growth through a continuum approach for cell mixtures based on Onsager’s variational principle. Indeed, it has been shown that the spatial distribution of T-cells inside the tumor is an indicator of the patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Finite element-based simulations in two-dimensional space demonstrate the ambiguous activity of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in regulating cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Finally, we discuss our results obtained with this minimal model and suggest directions for future works, such as considering more precisely the geometry of the tumor micro-environment, and introducing anisotropic friction that would depend on the nematic orientation of the fibers (<xref rid="s4" ref-type="sec">Section III</xref>). In the Supporting Information, further details about the results of numerical simulations are provided to show how the proposed dynamical system is able to capture different evolutionary and tumor fates depending on the role played by the species, their initial conditions, as well as the shapes and distributions of the regions occupied by cells. Appendix A is joined to this article with details for the calculation of the dynamical system section, and Appendix B for the anisotropic friction.</p>

<title>Lung Cancer Microenvironment</title>
<p>Modeling the tumor environment requires a deep understanding of the interactions between the various components, such as cells of different types, soft materials and fibers as well as fluids and diffusing molecules. These interactions are summarized in <xref rid="s2a" ref-type="sec">section I.1</xref>. Next, in section I.2, we present data on the density of the different cell types in the TME. Indeed, our continuous approach incorporates <italic>in vivo</italic> biological data that vary between patients and tumor sites, and also evolve over time within the tumor. Therefore, after a review of the available values found in the literature, we performed direct measurements from samples stained by multiplex IHC to study the composition of fibroblasts and distribution of T-cells in human</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<label>I.1</label>
<title>Interactions Between TME Components</title>
<p>Almost all tissues contain a population of fibroblasts that provide the tissue architecture, and serve as sentinels for tissue dysfunctions. When a solid tumor grows, quiescent or progenitor lung fibroblasts activate an initial wound-healing response with increased production of ECM and growth factor (cytokine) and upregulation of activation markers such as FAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Due to mechanotransduction and/or biochemical signals from tumor or immune cells, CAFs often increase their level of contractility, which affects the maintenance of the tumor stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. CAFs are characterized by their increased mobility, proliferation, and ECM remodeling and, unlike wound-associated fibroblasts, they seem to undergo poorly reversible activation in absence of an appropriate therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The diversity of this population, resulting from phenotypic modifications, explains their diverse functions and localization in the stroma, close or distant from the tumor nest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Activated fibroblasts produce fibers that act as a mechanical barrier around the tumor, impeding the movement of immune cells and limiting the interaction between cytotoxic T-cells and cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. However, by creating such a barrier around tumors, CAFs may also prevent the spread of cancer, as mechanical stress can reduce cell spreading and promote cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. In addition, biochemical factors expressed by CAFs also help to modify the phenotype of T-cells or inactivate their cytotoxic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Thus, CAFs have an ambiguous role as tumor promoters, inhibiting T-cell invasion into the nest, and as tumor suppressors, limiting the cancer growth and giving rise to an immune-excluded tumor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which is less proliferative than a free-growing tumor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Failure to confine the tumor induces high levels of cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, creating a hot tumor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Therefore, one aim of this study is to predict susceptibility of a tumor to T-cell infiltration according to the scheme given in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.</p>

<p>In the context of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the recruitment of CD8+ T-cells seems to be modulated by a specific tumor-associated antigen present on the surface of the cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In particular, in the family of inflammatory proteins, also called cytokines, Interlukin-6 (IL6) and (IL8) seem, among others to stimulate the infiltration of CD8<sup><italic>+</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. The origins of CD8<sup><italic>+</italic></sup> T-cells that infiltrate the tumor are diverse, as they differentiate from both circulating and tissue-resident precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. However, infiltration alone does not imply that the immune response is efficient. In fact, an immunotherapy such as anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies is often needed to boost the response of these T-cells. Chemical factors also play an important role in attracting T-cells via chemotaxis, such as the chemokines produced by dendritic cells or cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The absence of such chemicals leads to the formation of the so-called immune-desert tumor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Lung TME Composition</title>
<p>For a quantitative modeling, it is critical to use biologically well-identified data on both tumor and stroma, in terms of the density and the localization of the different species. Therefore, we survey the literature to build a quantitative view for the composition of the TME. We recapitulate these values in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table. 1</xref>. However, human data show a great diversity depending on many factors such as tumor edge, patient age, non-cancer health status, as well as method of analysis.</p>
<p>The fibroblast population in the stroma, which is very heterogeneous and not easy to identify, is the best example. In particular, although fibroblasts are often considered to be a major component of the stroma, they are only found in small proportions in scRNA-seq with 10X single-cell systems, which may be rather surprising. This situation is well known and may be due to tissue digestion processes, to the fact that part of the stroma is not extracted with the tumor nodule, and to a lower efficiency of 10X single-cell systems for fibroblasts. Another caveat is that identifying the surface fraction of cells by staining can be very different from counting individual cells. In fact, cell types can vary greatly in size. For example, lung cancer cells can be between 13-18 <italic>µ</italic> m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], fibroblasts <italic>∼</italic> 16 <italic>µ</italic>m m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], and T-cells between 5-10 <italic>µm</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], resulting in volumes and projected areas that can be 10 times smaller for T-cells compared to fibroblasts and can-cer cells for the same densities. Moreover, in some studies, authors focus on well-characterized zones of enrichment for the different species (tumor nest, fibrotic areas), and do not consider each cell type <italic>per se</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Despite these remarks, cancer cells, T-cells, and macrophages (fibroblasts are underestimated as mentioned above) appear to be a significant part of the TME. The limitations of using data coming from the literature led us to perform our own measurements. In this study, we analyzed data from 13 patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and 22 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), based on a recent publication by some of the present authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In this previous study, different fibroblast types were identified using multiplex IHC imaging. Tumor islets were stained with keratin, T-cells with CD3 and fibroblasts with <italic>α</italic>SMA, FAP and ADH1B. The coverage was evaluated for each fibroblast type and the total fibroblast coverage corresponds to the sum of these different coverages. Here, in the case of LUSC, we found that fibroblasts (composed of 6% ADH1B, 37% FAP<sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>α</italic>SMA<sup><italic>−</italic></sup>, 25% FAP<sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>α</italic>SMA<sup><italic>+</italic></sup>, 31% FAP<sup><italic>−</italic></sup><italic>α</italic>SMA<sup><italic>+</italic></sup>) occupy 35% of the stroma with a tumor stroma ratio (TSR) of 1.29. In LUAD, these proportions were partly modified: fibroblasts (composed of 48% ADH1B, 18% FAP<sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>α</italic>SMA<sup><italic>−</italic></sup>, 7% FAP<sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>α</italic>SMA<sup><italic>+</italic></sup>, 26% FAP<sup><italic>−</italic></sup><italic>α</italic>SMA<sup><italic>+</italic></sup>) occupy 31% of the stroma, with a TSR of 1.07. The fibroblasts most responsible for T-cell exclusion are shown to be FAP<sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>α</italic>SMA<sup><italic>+</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>, we compare two LUSC microenvironments. In the top one, FAP<sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>α</italic>SMA<sup><italic>+</italic></sup> are lining the tumor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2(a),(c),(d)</xref>), and T-cells are excluded from it (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2(b)</xref>). On the contrary, in cases where no FAP<sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>α</italic>SMA<sup><italic>+</italic></sup> are observed, fibroblasts are homogeneously distributed in the stroma (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2(g),(e),(h)</xref>), and T-cells infiltrate the tumor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(f)</xref>).</p>

<p>Although no data for T-cells were obtained from the last measurements, it turns out that since the surface is occupied at 80% by cancer cells and fibroblasts, and that the rest of the TME occupies less than 20%, the surface fraction of T-cells can be considered as small compared to cancer cells and fibroblasts.</p>

<title>Dynamic Modeling in the Lung Cancer TME</title>
<p>Our theoretical and numerical analyses consist of two steps in the spirit of Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] for the study of cancer stem cells. In a first analysis, we examine only the dynamics of an interactive ecological system in order to evaluate the physical parameters that quantify these interactions and how the dynamics depend on them. Spatial constraints are represented by a pressure term avoiding overcrowding. We present this approach step by step in order to set the parameters one by one, highlighting the physical importance of each choice through stability analyzes of the system. In addition, this first step allows to explore efficiently the parameter space without time consuming numerical resolution, and to already produce a first classification of the global outcomes. The second step is the spatial description of the tumor growth in <xref rid="s4" ref-type="sec">Section III</xref>. In both approaches, the case where fibroblasts, cancer cells and T-cells are present is intended to correspond to the patient data presented in the previous section.</p>

<title>Dynamical System for Immune and Cancer Cells in Interaction</title>
<p>As we saw in the previous section, the complexity of the microenvironment makes the role of the immune system hardly predictable and highly dependent on the tumor being studied. In the case of lung tumors, the immune system is triggered as the carcinoma expands, but T-cells may be excluded from the tumor nest by activated fibroblasts. Therefore, the goal of this work is to physically and quantitatively understand the process of T-cell exclusion from the tumor mass in the simplest way possible, and to explore different possible scenarios,since the dynamical system can be seen as the spatial integration of the different processes over the domain under study.</p>
<p>We focus on the interaction between different cell types in the case of the NSCLC. In particular we consider a closed system including the cancer cells, T-cells, non-activated fibroblasts (NAFs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and healthy cells with the extracellular medium. Diffusive signaling molecules are not explicitly introduced: their production by one cell type and their effect on another cell type is modeled as a direct interaction between the two. For example, the attraction of T-cells to cancer cells by chemotaxis is introduced in the mathematical model as a source term proportional to the product of the two concentrations T and C in the T-cell equation (see below <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref>). We also hypothesize that the main difference between NAFs and CAFs is the fiber production of the latter, which prevents T-cells from infiltrating the tumor. Furthermore, our model does not consider transformation of NAFs into CAFs as a reversible process. All these cells have the same mass density and the sum of their mass fraction satisfies the relationship <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline16.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>N</italic> is a healthy non active compo-nent such as healthy cells and interstitial fluid, for example. The mass fraction of cancer cells is represented by <italic>C</italic>, T-cells by <italic>T</italic>, quiescent or non-activated fibroblasts NAFs by <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub>, activated fibroblasts CAFs by <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>. Note that <italic>N</italic> is not an active component and therefore does not appear in the following equations. Also, we do not consider here the recruitment of macrophages to better highlight the competing mechanisms related to the sole role of T-cells and CAFs in the tumor mass development. With this in mind, we write an evolution equation for each component of the system: <italic>d X</italic> /<italic>dt =</italic> Γ<sub><italic>X</italic></sub>, where Γ<sub><italic>X</italic></sub> corresponds to a source term modeling the proliferation, death, differentiation, or fluxes into/out of the system under study. The source terms for each species are described in detail below.</p>
<p>The dynamics of the cancer cells is driven by their proliferation, controlled by a growth rate coefficient <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>, and limited by a death rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. It takes into account the population pressure caused by self-inhibition as well as by the inhibition of the other species. In the following, we will choose <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> as the unit of time, and all coefficients introduced in the following will be pure constants without unit, so that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. In addition, cytotoxic T-cells eliminate cancer cells if their anti-tumor activity is not inhibited by the activated fibroblasts (although they do not remove T-cells from the mixture). This process is quantified by the cytotoxic coefficient <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>CT</italic></sub>, and by the coefficient of T-cell inhibition by CAFs, <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>T F</italic></sub>. With these assumptions, the dynamics of the cancer cell mass fraction can be read:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Although proliferation of cytotoxic T-cells has been observed, we do not consider explicitly proliferation in our study as we focus on their ability to infiltrate the tumor. Rather, we consider that T-cells proliferate outside the domain boundaries, so that this proliferation is included in the boundary source contributions. Therefore, their only source is their attraction to cancer cells, which occurs at a recruitment rate of <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>TC</italic></sub><italic>C</italic>, while the crowding limits this recruitment:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Fibroblasts are the key regulators of tumor immunity and progression. Their dynamics involve a recruitment of non-activated fibroblasts <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> whose role is to maintain an adequate supply given by <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub>/<italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> in healthy tissue, i.e. in the absence of cancer cells, and a death rate due to the pressure exerted by the cells and controlled by <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub>. NAFs are attracted to the tumor nest at a rate <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic>,<italic>C</italic></sub><italic>C</italic> by the cancer cells that activate them to become CAFs. This process is accounted by introducing a specific transformation rate controlled by the plasticity coefficient K<sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, so that the dynamic equation for NAFs reads:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Thus, the dynamics of the CAFs is purely determined by the transformation of the NAFs and by the pressure through <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, which leads to:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Therefore, the role of fibroblasts in human lung carcinoma can be investigated by studying the interplay between cancer cells and the TME. The interactions discussed above are described by 11 parameters and lead to a system of 4 coupled nonlinear differential equations concerning 4 unknowns. Within this framework, we proceed to the estimation of the parameters and the steady states of the system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<label>II.2</label>
<title>Model Parameters and Fixed Point Analysis</title>
<p>When all the parameters vary, the steady states or the equilibrium points of the dynamics can be quite impractical, so we start by assuming that all the coefficients at the origin of a pressure are equivalent: <italic>δ = δ</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub> <italic>= δ</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> <italic>= δ</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> <italic>= δ</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> <italic>&gt;</italic> 0. This reduces the number of independent parameters to 7. Fixed points are obtained by setting the time derivatives in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eqs. (1)</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">(4)</xref> to 0 which gives the long-term behavior when the system reaches equilibrium.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the values of the parameters in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eqs. (1)</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">(4)</xref>, we study different simplified situations that can be reproduced in experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> or in controlled experiments <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also use the conclusions obtained in Section. I.2 for the cell densities. We will start by analyzing the case of cancer cells alone and we will successively add all the other cell types with fractions <italic>C</italic>, <italic>T, F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub>, <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>. More details on the calculations can be found in Appendix A.</p>

<title>Cancer cells and T-cells</title>
<p>The dynamic evolution of cancer cells alone is limited to: <italic>dC</italic> /<italic>dt = C − δC</italic> <sup>2</sup>. This equation leads to two equilibrium fixed points: <italic>C =</italic> 0 and <italic>C = δ</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> and only the second one <italic>C = δ</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> is stable. When cancer cells are isolated from other active cellular components, they are expected to invade the system or to be its major component, leading to a cancer death rate of <italic>δ ∼</italic> 1.</p>
<p>We now examine the interaction between T-cells and cancer cells in the nest in the absence of fibroblasts (so <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> <italic>= F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> 0) and the relevant parameters scaled by <italic>δ</italic> are <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>CT</italic></sub> and <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>TC</italic></sub>. Then, we study the equilibrium regime:
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_eqn5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>There are three equilibrium solution pairs {<italic>C</italic>, <italic>T</italic>}, including the trivial one: {0, 0}. To analyze whether the solutions found are physically relevant (0 ≤ <italic>C</italic>, <italic>T</italic> ≤ 1) and dynamically stable, we estimate possible scaling for the two parameters, focusing on an effective immune response against cancer. For efficient elimination of cancer cells by T-cells, the killing rate <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>CT</italic></sub> must be much larger than the natural death rate <italic>δ</italic>, so we introduce a small parameter 0 <italic>&lt; ϵ</italic> ≪ 1, so that <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>CT</italic></sub> <italic>= δϵ</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>. We also assume that the T-cell recruitment is slow compared to cancer cells, which means that <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>TC</italic></sub> <italic>= a</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>ϵ</italic>, where <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> being of order one. So the only stable solution is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> where <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> <italic>&gt;</italic> 1 (see Appendix A.1). Thus, even if the inflammation level is low, resulting in a small number of T-cells, the immune action on the cancer cells remains efficient.</p>

<title>Role of activated fibroblasts on T-cells</title>
<p>Fibroblasts play an active role in the exclusion of the T-cells from the tumor nest. We isolate a subsystem composed of cancer cells, T-cells and active fibroblasts to determine the inhibition rate <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>T F</italic></sub>, responsible for the marginalization of the T-cells and subsequently for the increase of cancer cells at a fixed volume fraction of fibroblasts. We consider the fixed points corresponding to an ensemble {<italic>C</italic>, <italic>T</italic>, 0, <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>}. For simplicity, we first assume that <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> is constant, which leads to the dynamical system:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

where <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> <italic>=</italic> 1 <italic>− δF</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, Δ<sub><italic>CT</italic></sub> <italic>= δ</italic><sub><italic>CT</italic></sub> (1 <italic>+ δ</italic><sub><italic>T F</italic></sub> <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>)<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> and Δ<sub><italic>F</italic></sub> <italic>= δF</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>. There are four solution pairs (see Appendix A.2).</p>
<p>We use the scaling of both parameters already established in the previous paragraph: <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>CT</italic></sub> <italic>= δϵ</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>, <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>TC</italic></sub> <italic>= a</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>ϵ</italic>. We also assume that the inhibition of the T-cells may counteract their cytotoxic effect on cancer cells, i.e. (1<italic>+δ</italic><sub><italic>T F</italic></sub> <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>)<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> <italic>∼ ϵ</italic>, when activated fibroblasts are abundant <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> <italic>= δ</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>. This results in <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>T F</italic></sub> <italic>= d</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>δϵ</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>.</p>
<p>The only stable equilibrium solution is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline17.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where the notation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline18.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> denotes a quantity whose order of magnitude is <italic>ϵ</italic>. Thus, when fibroblasts inactivate T-cells, they promote the cancer cell proliferation.</p>

<title>Residual Fibroblasts in Healthy Tissue</title>
<p>In healthy tissue, most of the fibroblasts are in a quiescent state and are not activated in the absence of pathologies such as wounds, allergic reactions or cancer cells. Therefore, in such tissues, for a quiescent fibroblast population, the density of <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> is the equilibrium solution of the equation <italic>d F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub>/<italic>dt =</italic> 0 <italic>= α</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> <italic>− δF</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub><sup>2</sup>. The parameter <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> represents the net influx of fibroblasts into the tissue.

<title>Fibroblast Plasticity</title>
<p>Fibroblast plasticity is the phenotypic change responsible for T-cell inhibition and for more active fiber production. Cancer cells drive this transformation of the current population <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> into <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>. This process is quantified by the constant <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>. We first estimate that the fibroblast population is comparable to the cancer cell population when they are alone, which leads to: <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> <italic>= f</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub><italic>δ</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> where <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> <italic>∼</italic> 1 is a constant.</p>

<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_eqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Because of the effect of the fibroblasts on them, the T-cells have little effect on the cancer cells, so cancer cell proliferation is little affected. At equilibrium, this leads to <italic>C ∼ δ</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>, <italic>T ∼ ϵδ</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>. The equation for <italic>T</italic> gives <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> <italic>∼ a</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>δ</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>/<italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub>. This means that the activated fibroblasts must be relatively abundant to fully inhibit the activity of the T-cells. It follows that the plasticity parameter is of low order in <italic>ϵ</italic>, since the non-activated fibroblasts are maintained at a high density: <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> <italic>∼ δ</italic> (see Appendix A.3).</p>

<title>Tumor Fibroblast Attraction</title>

If the T-cells are efficient, the tumor is said to be immune-inflamed and several scenarios can be discussed. Their response is triggered by the proliferation of cancer cells. Thus, in the absence of CAF inhibition, T-cells inhibit cancer growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(f)</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3(h)</xref>). In contrast, in the immune-excluded tumor, CAFs impede the T-cell response and thus indirectly promote cancer cell growth, as observed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(e)</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our dynamical system, limited to 4 cell types, recapitulates the different possible scenarios that could evolve according to the interaction between cancer cell, T-cells and fibroblasts in lung adenocarcinoma. With respect to cancer cells, three main outcomes can be identified: the tumor can invade the tissue (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(a)</xref>), the cancer cell population can be limited without disappearing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(b)</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3(e)</xref>), or it can be eradicated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(f)</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3(h)</xref>). Each outcome can have multiple origins, that are all related to either competition for space and resources or T-cell efficiency, see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(i)</xref>. Each origin has a particular signature with respect to the different species densities, so that the TME properties can be inferred from the measured densities. However, the dynamical system does not provide information about the morphology of the tumor, and its local composition. Indeed, this analysis poorly represents the structure of the tumor, which is divided into a nest, a cancer-associated stroma, and a healthy stroma.</p>
<p>For these reasons, in what follows we extend our model by incorporating the effects of cell species diffusion in order to obtain a more faithful spatio-dynamical description of the system, thus re-analysing the cases above mentioned in this more general framework.</p>

<title>Spatio-Temporal Behavior of Tumor Growth</title>
<p>Spatial study is an important tool in cancer diagnosis since the tumor shape reveals the aggressiveness of cancer cells and the role of their microenvironment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Similarly, the localization of immune cells in the tumor environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], as well as proliferating and pre-metastatic cells often found in niches, are active areas of research in oncology and a valuable support for clinical prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>].</p>
<p>In the previous section, we described our cell mixing through the global time evolution given by a dynamical system. Here, we aim to complete the modeling by considering the spatial het-erogeneity of the interplay between fibroblasts, T-cells and cancer cells and its consequences for tumor cell localization and proliferation. We first present the mixture model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], which is able to incorporate the spatial distribution and evolution of active cells leading to a set of partial differential equations that we solve with the finite element (FEM) software COMSOL Multiphysics (COMSOL Multiphysics® v. 6.2. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.comsol.com">www.comsol.com</ext-link>. COMSOL AB, Stockholm, Sweden.). Last, we propose different mechanisms as sources of anisotropy in the tumor nest, including the introduction of a nematic tensor for the orientation of fibroblasts.</p>
<p>As in the previous section, we consider 4 different cell types namely cancer cells, T-cells, activated and non-activated fibroblasts, with different attraction properties. A component that does not play an active role in the mixture is also added via an inactive <italic>N</italic> fraction. It concerns the intercellular fluid, the healthy cells and the dead cells. This last component is also a source of material, for the proliferation of cancer cells. Each component is described by a local mass fraction <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, a velocity <bold>v</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, and a proliferation/death term Γ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, with <italic>φ</italic> and Γ denoting generic quantities that are now space and time dependent. More specifically, <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> corresponds to the local value of <italic>C</italic>, <italic>T, F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> introduced in the previous sections and <italic>φ</italic><sub>0</sub> <italic>=</italic> 1 <italic>−</italic> ∑<sub><italic>i≠</italic>0</sub> <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> repre-sents <italic>N</italic>. Γ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the growth rate of each component, which is now space and time dependent (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eqs. (1)</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">(4)</xref>) and may be positive only for cancer cells, since we consider that fibroblasts and T-cells are recruited from the surrounding environment. CAFs produce a significant amount of fibers, resulting in a higher friction between different species, chosen to be proportional to the local amount of CAFs. This friction, which is also a space-time dependent quantity, will impact the dynamics of the mixture.</p>
<p>The sample also contains diffusive signaling molecules that are at the origin of the immune activity. In the previous section, chemicals were not introduced, although they were associated with some coefficients of the dynamical system. Here, the chemicals that determine the cell behavior, are represented by a concentration <italic>c</italic> <sub><italic>j</italic></sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Note that these chemicals have no mass and diffuse through the mixture with the diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to a single chemical of concentration <italic>c</italic>, that mediates both chemotaxis and activation of fibroblasts. The balance between its production and degradation rate writes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, since it is produced by cancer cells and naturally degraded. With these considerations, we study the case where the tumor is well supplied with nutrients, which are therefore not explicitly mentioned, and we write a set of conservation equations for each component of the mixture:
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_eqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>When integrated over the whole space and when the only boundary conditions for the velocity are considered, the first equation in (8) recovers the dynamical system. Besides, we consider that chemicals equilibrate much faster than the tissue dynamics, so that: <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>∇<sup>2</sup><sub><italic>c</italic></sub><italic>+α</italic><sub><italic>cC</italic></sub> <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub> <italic>−c =</italic> 0, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> the penetration length and <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>cC</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> (<italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub><italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>cC</italic></sub>)<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>. We now present a derivation for the average local velocity <bold>v</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of each species by evaluating its momentum equation and the expressions for the various source terms.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<label>III.1</label>
<title>Momentum and Free Energy Density Derivation</title>
<p>Since the dynamics is very slow and completely controlled by dissipation, the Onsager variational principle of least dissipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] yields the set of partial differential equations coupling the densities to the velocities in the mixture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. This principle, introduced by Lord Rayleigh and further developed by Onsager [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>], is widely used in soft matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>], in the biophysical context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] as well as other areas of physics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. First we define a free energy functional ℱ from a free energy density <italic>F</italic> integrated over the volume <italic>V</italic>, the associated chemical potentials <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, and a dissipation function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline19.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> :
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where the <italic>ξ</italic><sub><italic>i j</italic></sub> are the relative friction coefficients between components <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, and <bold>v</bold><sub><bold>i</bold></sub> and <bold>v</bold><sub><bold>j</bold></sub> are the velocities of the different cell types. The Rayleighian is then defined as the sum of the dissipation function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline20.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and the rate of change of the free energy function ℱ. Within this framework, the final equations for the local velocities are obtained by minimizing the Rayleighian with respect to each velocity <bold>v</bold><sub><bold>i</bold></sub>:
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_ueqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i j</italic></sub> is the friction matrix and <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> are the chemical potentials. Defining: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="575824v3_inline7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> friction matrix reads:
<disp-formula id="ueqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_ueqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Importantly, in our model we assume that all frictions <italic>ξ</italic><sub><italic>i j</italic></sub> are equal, except for the friction with the CAFs. In fact, the mass fraction of CAFs is assumed to reflect the amount of matrix produced by the fibroblasts, resulting in a very high friction in the medium. Therefore, we write: <italic>ξ<sub>ij</sub></italic> = <italic>ξ<sub>0</sub>,ξ<sub>iCAF</sub></italic> = <italic>ξ<sub>0</sub>+ξ</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>ϕ<sub>CAF</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>After deriving the momentum equations, we construct the free energy density. Building a free-energy density for a biological material is justified, because, although biological materials are out of equilibrium, their behavior often resembles that dictated by thermodynamics. It is therefore useful to write a free energy in terms of state variables. Following [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] and inspired by the Cahn-Hilliard approach, we define a free energy density <italic>F</italic> as a sum of the interaction potential <italic>f</italic> and of the cost induced by the mass fraction gradients <italic>κ</italic>(∇<italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>)<sup>2</sup>/2. We also assume for <italic>f</italic>, the Flory-Huggins free energy density of mixing that depends on the local mass fractions (or equivalently the volume fractions) of each component <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]:
<disp-formula id="eqn9">

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The terms <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> log(<italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) control both the diffusion and volume exclusion, and the quadratic expansion <italic>−α</italic><sub><italic>i j</italic></sub> <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> controls the attraction or repulsion between species.</p>
<p>In the following, we explain in more detail the effective free energy density of our system, as well as the expression of the different proliferation rates, and the values of the parameters, focusing on the attraction/repulsion and the chemotactic terms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<label>III.2.</label>
<title>Effective Free Energy Density and Source Terms</title>
<p>We now apply the general formalism presented in the previous section to the cancer cell mixture using the same notation as <xref rid="s3" ref-type="sec">Section II</xref> for <italic>C</italic>, <italic>T, F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub>, <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>. However, whereas in the first section these quantities represented averaged mass fractions over the whole tumor, here they are local mass fractions averaged over a small volume of the tumor but large compared to the cell size. We now detail the effective free energy, focusing first on the interaction potential <italic>f</italic> defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Eq. 9</xref>.</p>
<p>The attraction between cancer cells is represented by <italic>−λ</italic><sub><italic>CC</italic></sub><italic>C</italic> <sup>2</sup>, between cancer cells and T-cells by <italic>−λ</italic><sub><italic>CT</italic></sub> <italic>CT</italic>, and between all types of fibroblasts and cancer cells by <italic>−λ</italic><sub><italic>CF</italic></sub> <italic>C</italic> (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>NA</italic></sub><italic>+F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>), where the <italic>λ</italic> coefficients are positive. These interactions are accounted for the free energy density that reads:
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_eqn10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Finally, we focus on the proliferation rates to complete the system <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Eq. 8</xref>. Note that we must distinguish the cells produced <italic>in situ</italic>, such as the cancer cells <italic>C</italic> and the activated fibroblasts <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, from the cells attracted to the tumor nest (<italic>T</italic> and <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub>) by the chemical <italic>c</italic>. We keep the growth rate of cancer cells Γ<sub><italic>C</italic></sub> given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref> with <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>T F</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> 0 because the inhibition of T-cells by fibroblasts is now treated by increasing the friction created by the fiber barrier. T-cells and NAFs do not proliferate and are not derived from precursors at the tumor site, but are instead generated far away from the tumor and are attracted to it by chemotaxis. Thus, at the boundaries <italic>S</italic>, their source rate is driven by an incoming flux due to the chemical <italic>c</italic>. For the NAFs, the volume term Γ<sub><italic>N A</italic></sub>|<sub><italic>V</italic></sub> does not include the source term <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic>,<italic>C</italic></sub> (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 3</xref>) which is provided by the boundaries, and <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> is neglected:
<disp-formula id="ueqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_ueqn5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the production of CAFs is not changed and Γ<sub><italic>A</italic></sub> defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. 4</xref> is still relevant, provided that the plasticity contribution is now proportional to the chemical concentration <italic>c</italic> and not the cancer cells fraction.</p>
<p>We scale the various physical parameters in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table. 3</xref>. Their values are derived from the literature and from the spatial structure of the TME, as well as the expected outcomes for the different scenarios, while the growth parameters are related to those in the first part of the ar-ticle. For example, the tumor nest is a dense phase of cancer cells with mass fraction <italic>C =</italic> 0.8 that an interface of size d<italic>∼</italic> 10 <italic>µ</italic> m separates from the dilute phase <italic>C ∼</italic> 0. This choice, together with the typical value for the energy-density of 10<sup>6</sup> kg.<italic>µ</italic>m<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>.d<sup><italic>−</italic>2</sup> found in literature imposes the values of <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>, <italic>D</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>CC</italic></sub>, <italic>κ</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Similarly, we assume a weak infiltration of T-cells and fibroblasts into the nest, resulting in low values for the attraction parameters <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>CT</italic></sub>, <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>CF</italic></sub> when compared to <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>CC</italic></sub>. Since <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>N AF</italic></sub>, <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>C AF</italic></sub>, <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> control the diffusion of the fibroblasts and T-cells, whose source is located at the boundaries, their values are determined by the density gradients between the boundaries and the tumor nest. At the same time, the times required for T-cells to kill the tumor nest is given by <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>CT</italic></sub>, and the times for the arrival of the T-cells and NAFs into the domain, as well as their average mass fractions, are governed by <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub>, respectively. The NAFs transform into CAFs in a time controlled by <italic>K</italic>. We use the letter T<sub>0</sub> as the time unit which corresponds to the typical division time for tumor development. For experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> in perfect conditions of nutrient access, the relevant time is the largest one, corresponding to the slowest process, so the typical division time of cancer cells. It is about one day and the same time is needed for the eradication of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. But <italic>in vivo</italic>, it is obviously a very different time. It is more related to the time scale necessary for the tumor to grow in its natural environment and is of the order of months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>]. The plasticity of fibroblasts is controlled by the chemical penetration length. Since we assume that only the fibroblasts lining the tumor nest are activated, we choose a low penetration length of 30 <italic>µ</italic>m. At the same time, the ratio <italic>α</italic> between the chemical production and degradation parameters is set to <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>cC</italic></sub> <italic>=</italic> 3.</p>
<p>In the following, we will show that, once activated by tumor cells, fibroblasts can inhibit tumor growth through a confinement effect but also limit the cytotoxic role of T-cells or simply prevent their infiltration into the tumor.</p>

<title>Ambiguous Role of Fibroblasts in Tumorigenesis</title>
<p>To illustrate the ambiguous role of fibroblasts in tumor progression, we explore different scenarios through a 2-dimensional numerical study. This allows us to compare a fibrotic and a non-fibrotic tumor in the presence or absence of an immune response. Thus, the different growth cases we present are: a tumor without CAFs and T-cells, a tumor with both CAFs and T-cells, a tumor with T-cells but with a low level of CAFs, and a case with CAFs but no efficient T-cells. In the Supplementary Information, we present other scenarios of free growth: a TME in the presence of only NAFs and inefficient T-cells (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1B</xref>), in presence of NAFs (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1C</xref>), and a TME in which only cancer cells are present (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1D</xref>). We first consider a single tumor nest before analyzing the case of two adjacent nests. Therefore, there is only one tumor nest at time <italic>t =</italic> 0 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E,H</xref> (blue curve), in the case of a free-growing tumor, i.e. in the presence of NAFs and inactive T-cells, cancer cell growth is not hindered by any obstacles, so this is the most severe situation. However, the tumor provokes the formation of a stroma composed of the NAFs and inefficient T-cells. The presence of a stroma plays a role in the cancer cell growth described in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref> and leads to a growth that would be less important than in a case without stroma or composed only of NAFs (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. Sup. 1A</xref>→<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). In fact, the pressure exerted by the stroma increases the mass fraction of cancer cells in the core of the nest, as well as the total mass fraction <italic>N</italic> at the stroma-nest interface. This phenomenon corresponds to the competition for space and resources between the different species already described in the previous section. In the case of a free cancer growth without stroma, the tumor nest rapidly invades the environment and its surface fraction in the simulation window is almost 40% after reaching <italic>t =</italic> 35 T<sub>0</sub>, with a trend that is not yet saturated and an average mass fraction of cancer cells of 25%.</p>
<p>When fibroblasts are activated, they make the environment around the tumor nest fibrotic (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,C</xref>), with a mass fraction around the nest reaching 20-30%. As explained earlier (in <xref rid="s4a" ref-type="sec">Section III.1</xref>), the fibers are introduced in our model by an increase of the friction coefficient between the different species and the activated fibroblasts, which is directly related to the fiber concentration. The tumor cells are then trapped behind a barrier with a very high friction which prevents the nest from expanding, and the surface area of the tumor nest decreases to 25% after 35 T<sub>0</sub>, with a fibrotic area reaching 70%, while the average cancer cell decreases to 17% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E,F,G</xref> cyan curve). The fibroblast population is composed of 30% NAFs and 70% CAFs, as the average fibroblast mass fraction is 26% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I,K</xref> cyan curve).</p>
<p>At the same time, even in a situation where T-cells are efficient, the barrier precludes T-cells from the tumor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In the latter case, tumor integrity is maintained and CAFs play a tumor-promoting role, inhibiting the immune response and stabilizing the tumor nest at 7.5% of the domain, with a fibrotic zone of 50% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E,F,H</xref>,green curve). In this scenario, the average mass fractions are 5% for cancer cells, 10% for CAFs, 10% for NAFs (so 20% for the fibroblast population) and 20% for T-cells. It is interesting to note that this scenario quickly leads to a stable steady state. In contrast, the other simulations take longer times to reach a steady state. This could be due to the fact that the stroma builds up quickly compared to cell death when the cell population is not renewed, and that the steady state corresponds to a small nest that is reached after a short period of growth.</p>
<p>When T-cells are introduced without transformation from NAFs to CAFs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>-red curve), the tumor dies as cancer cells are eliminated and the compact nest disappears (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>-red curve). As the stroma initially builds up due to the presence of a tumor, the fibroblast and T-cell populations slowly relax. However, the tumor stroma takes a long time to retract. This suggests that even if the cancer is cured, the effects on the tissue can be long-lasting. In this case of non-activation of NAFs, T-cells infiltrate the core of the nest thanks to the attraction of cancer cells (through the parameter <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>CT</italic></sub>) and allows tumor reduction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Therefore, their invasion is efficient only in the absence of fibers. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>-red curve).</p>
<p>There are many mechanisms able to inhibit the immune system. In addition to the exclusion of T-cells from the tumor and the absence of active feedback, low attractiveness can also reduce the immune response. Indeed, when T-cells are less attracted, for example because chemotaxis is not efficient enough, the tumor is free to expand. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, the cytotoxicity of T-cells is impaired, but their chemotaxis from the boundaries of the domains is not. This leads to an accumulation of inefficient T-cells around the tumor nest.</p>
<p>Next, we analyze the case where two tumor nests are nucleated and interact. We assume that they have the same initial size and mass fraction of cancer cells. In the absence of CAFs, an immune response is triggered and T-cell infiltration can occur. As expected, in the immuneinflamed tumor, the activity of T-cells reduces the ability of the two nests to coalesce by also reducing their mass fraction, leading to very low values of cancer cells (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). When T-cell activity is marginalized by the presence of CAFs, the two nests slowly coalesce to form a single solid tumor nest (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In this case, growth is actually limited by the tumor-promoting function of CAFs. Although fibroblasts surround the tumor, its growth is enhanced due to the lack of immune cells inside. On the contrary, in the absence of T-cell chemotaxis, the tumor growth is unrestricted and the nests create a larger tumor by also increasing their mass fraction (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In the latter cases, coalescence leads to anisotropic shapes of the tumor. Al-though relaxation in our model eventually leads to a round shape, this relaxation is slower for large tumors and even more for fibrotic tumors where friction significantly slows down this process. Patterns associated with coalescence may thus provide insights into the interpretation of anisotropic patterns in tumors. These are also related to the particular geometry of the system, such as the shape of the organ and the location of various blood vessels. In the next paragraph, we provide different directions to better describe this anisotropy.</p>

<title>Toward anisotropy</title>
<p>To gain insight into the mechanisms leading to anisotropy, we numerically study different cases where the blood vessels are not spatially homogeneously distributed in the vicinity of the tumor nest. Thus, we introduce in our systems localized sources of T-cells and NAF, in the sense of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, where blood vessels are disk-like patterns in the tissue slice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), or sources corresponding to only a part of the boundaries, as it would be the case for a blood vessel located in the plane of the tissue slice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We note that the anisotropy in the sources can lead to non-trivial shapes of the tumor tissue that are not due to instability but rather to the geometry of the system. These vessels are considered static, as dynamic vessels would require a more accurate modeling of angiogenesis. In the case of localized blood vessels modeled as disks, since the interface between the vessel and the system is smaller than in the case of boundary sources, the parameters driving T-cell population growth and T-cell efficiency in killing cancer cells must be increased in order to eradicate the tumor in the absence of cancer-associated fibroblasts. This highlights a peculiar phenomenon: increasing the density of blood vessels has ambiguous consequences. On the one hand, it allows a more efficient immune response and activate the arrival of T-cells. However, on the other hand, it also provides more nutrients to cancer cells and could ultimately favors metastasis. Therefore, critical processes such as the presence of a fibrous barrier around the tumor may have dual effects on and during tumor evolution.</p>

<p>Following biological observation reported in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, we here show different cases for describing anisotropy. <bold>A</bold>: Example of the tumor microenvironment in the presence of two blood vessels (in white). The tumor nest is in cyan (<italic>C &gt; F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> <italic>+F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> <italic>+T</italic>), the cancerous stroma in red (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> <italic>&gt; F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> <italic>+T</italic>) and the healthy stroma in green (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> <italic>+ T &gt; F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>).

The flux <italic>C</italic> <bold>v</bold><sub><italic>C</italic></sub> is indicated with blue arrows whose thickness is proportional to the magnitude of the flux. The nematic order is shown with red lines whose thickness is proportional to the determinant of the matrix <bold><italic>Q</italic></bold> (see Appendix B.1) and the fibroblast fraction is indicated with a pink color gradient.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="575824v3_fig6.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Furthermore, we introduce a more complete description of the fibrous stroma by adding a nematic order to the matrix and an anisotropic friction with respect to this matrix. A tensor order parameter <bold><italic>Q</italic></bold> is introduced which characterizes the average orientation of the fibroblasts and fibers and their degree of order (see Appendix B). Indeed, it has been shown that the density of the extracellular matrix is not always sufficient to induce T-cell exclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. We therefore provide the CAFs with an orientation, that is the result of there coupling with the matrix they deposit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. This long range order has been shown to induce an anisotropic friction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>] that may be related to immune cell exclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. At the same time, matrix orientation strongly influences metastasis and tumor growth by providing directional cues. Thus, there is a strong difference in the outcome of a tumor with fibers normal to the tumor surface and one with fibers along the tumor, both at the level of immune response and cancer escape. In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B,C</xref> we show the nematic order of the matrix and the flux field of the cancer cells in the case of orthonormal and normal orientation with respect to the tumor nest boundary, and due to the influx of fibroblasts from the right side of the system. The flux of cancer cells is much higher in the case of normal orientation of the fibers than in the case of parallel orientation. In conclusion, the description of T-cell exclusion by the sole density would be adapted to a case with fibers orientation aligned with the cancer nest surface, but not in the case with different orientations.</p>
<p>Further investigations may therefore introduce these two elements to our model: a nematic order in the CAF layer, whose orientation is determined by coupling with the orientation of the interfaces, and an anisotropic friction, which is higher in the direction normal to the nematic matrix order than in the orientation of the matrix. Note that active stresses (<bold><italic>σ</italic></bold> <italic>= −ζ</italic><bold>Q</bold> with <italic>ζ</italic> the activity) and couplings with the proliferation can develop in interaction with this nematic order, as explained and modeled in a previous article by some of us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], and a precise description of the nematic order may require to describe separately the fibroblasts and the matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our work provides a physical model to quantify the role of the immune system in human lung tumors. This is in line with different similar mathematical models, that study through this lens the inhibition/activation of the immune system by cancer cells either by the mean of nonlinear compartment models resembling our dynamical system, for instance regarding macrophage enrolment and cytokine signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>], or mixture models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. We thus con-nect the two approaches in order to rigorously derive the parameters of the model and derive insights from both. In our article, the focus is on early tumor growth prior to angiogenesis and the development of its stroma rich in T-cells and fibroblasts, the activation of non-activated fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts and the marginalization of T-cells from the tumor nest. Other immune cells, such as macrophages, could complete this study in a further investigation.</p>
<p>After analyzing the data from the literature and from patients with LUSC or LUAD pathologies, we propose a physical model, both theoretical and numerical, for the interactions between cancer cells, T-cells and fibroblasts during tumor progression and their different roles. In particular, fibroblasts are introduced in the model in their inactive and active states (NAFs and CAFs). The modeling involves two steps: firstly, a dynamic study aimed at elucidating the key factors that can characterize the properties of the micro-environment on which the ability of T-cells to inhibit tumor growth depends. Scenarios scaled by only two parameters control the dynamics and evaluate the aggressiveness of the tumor. In particular, we have established the spatial organization of the different cell types inside and outside the tumor core. The model is based on the continuous mixture model derived from Onsager’s variational principle. Simulations were performed with the FEM software COMSOL Multiphysics in a two-dimensional framework. This provided a complete description of the tumor morphology and composition. In fact, we explored different scenarios to fully appreciate the role of all cell types involved. The results confirmed the experimental evidence that CAFs play a dual role in promoting and suppressing cancer cell proliferation. First, they alter the tumor microenvironment with a fiber barrier that reduces the motility and activity of T-cells, thereby promoting cancer cell growth. At the same time, this growth is limited and results to be lower than in the absence of active fibroblasts. Moreover, we have also shown that although the different parameters can take a wide range of values and continuously change the results of the numerical study, different scenarios can be drawn by looking only at the orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>In this study, we did not consider the fibers of the extracellular matrix as a component <italic>per se</italic>, but we consider them through the friction increase. We also provided the basics and started to describe the consequences of an anisotropic friction in relation to a nematic fiber orientation (see Appendix B.2). The same formalism could also integrate non trivial active stresses as done in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>].</p>
<p>Our physical model aims to limit the number of parameters as much as possible. This may seem far-fetched given the complexity of the biological system, especially in vivo. However, there are several reasons for this limitation. First, determining the range of values for these parameters is a complex task in the absence of direct measurement. The strategy we used in <xref rid="s3" ref-type="sec">Section II</xref> is to isolate each process corresponding to each parameter and thus construct the model step by step. In <xref rid="s4" ref-type="sec">Section III</xref> we used both this latter strategy and the spatial structure of the mixing. In addition, the different combinations of the parameter values provide a wide variety of scenarios and it would be sufficient to modify these values to model new chemical entering the system. Limiting the complexity of the different processes allows us to focus on other aspects of the problem, such as the time evolution and the spatial structure, as well as a more precise quantitative study. In the same spirit, we numerically report in <xref rid="s4" ref-type="sec">Section III</xref> a 2-dimensional system without substrate, which yields results that we can consider similar as a 3-dimensional system with an invariance in the third dimension.</p>
<p>Identifying the different scenarios that can occur in the TME and their likelihood is critical to predict the outcome of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Indeed, both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are highly dependent on the spatial structure and composition at the tumor site. In particular, the dynamic of arrival of the T-cell population is over simplified here via chemotaxis and discard auto-chemotaxis at the origin of a swarming displacement of an increased number of cytotoxic T-cells eventually, CAR-T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. This mechanism, rare in the solid-tumor case, is sequential in time leading to a competition between killing efficiency and cancerous cell repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>] which will depend on the cancer type considered. Classification and quantitative characterization of the various outcomes can also help to monitor the treatment in real time according to the evolution of the TME.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this numerical investigation may help to understand the limitations of the immune system in the face of solid tumor growth. Understanding quantitatively how immune cells are excluded from the tumor nest may be helpful in the drug design of T-cell-based therapies. Conversely, the numerical reproduction of various processes that can be observed <italic>in vivo</italic> is an important step in the context of personalized medicine. A next step in the theoretical and numerical investigation would therefore be to introduce drug molecules into the framework we have presented. Indeed extending our model to follow the tumor evolution under treatment and the associated internal dynamics from the early alveolar stage of the lung by incorporating the actual three-dimensional environment would also be a major step forward.</p>

<title>Dynamical System</title>
<p>In this section, we detail the calculations referred to in the dynamical system part of the article (<xref rid="s3" ref-type="sec">Section II</xref>). More precisely, we demonstrate the scaling of the various parameters in the case where activated fibroblasts prevent T cells from killing the cancer cells. With the found scaling, we show that the stationary solutions of this dynamical system are the only stable solutions.</p>
<p>First, we recall the complete system of equations describing the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment. <italic>C</italic>, <italic>T, F</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>N A</italic></sub> represent the cancer cells, T cells, active fibroblasts, and inactive fibroblasts, respectively.

<p>The authors present an important work where they model some of the complex interactions between immune cells, fibroblasts and cancer cells. The model takes into account the increased ECM production of cancer-associated fibroblasts. These fibres trap the cancer but also protect it from immune system cells. In this way, these fibroblasts' actions both promote and hinder cancer growth. By exploring different scenarios, the authors can model different cancer fates depending on the parameters regulating cancer cells, immune system cells and fibroblasts. In this way, the model explores non-trivial scenarios. An important weakness of this study is that, though it is inspired by NSCLC tumors, it is still far from modelling tumor lesions with morphologies similar to NSCLC tumors and does not explore the formation of ramified tumors. In this way, is a general model and it is challenging how it can be adapted to simulate more realistic tumor morphologies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors develop a computational model (and a simplified version thereof) to treat an extremely important issue regarding tumor growth. Specifically, it has been argued that fibroblasts have the ability to support tumor growth by creating physical conditions in the tumor microenvironment that prevent the relevant immune cells from entering into contact with, and ultimately killing, the cancer cells. This inhibition is referred to as immune exclusion. The computational approach follows standard procedures in the formulation of models for mixtures of different material species, adapted to the problem at hand by making a variety of assumptions as to the activity of different types of fibroblasts, namely &quot;normal&quot; versus &quot;cancer-associated&quot;. The model itself is relatively complex, but the authors do a convincing job of analyzing possible behaviors and attempting to relate these to experimental observations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>As mentioned, the authors do an excellent job of analyzing the behavior of their model both in its full form (which includes spatial variation of the concentrations of the different cellular species) and in its simplified mean field form. The model itself is formulated based on established physical principles, although the extent to which some of these principles apply to active biological systems is perhaps debatable (see Weaknesses). The results of the model do indeed offer some significant insights into the critical factors which determine how fibroblasts might affect tumor growth; these insights could lead to new experimental ways of unraveling these complex sets of issues and enhancing immunotherapy. In this revised version, the authors have properly placed this work within the general context of other research on modeling the tumor-immune ecology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Models of the form being studied here rely on a large number of assumptions regarding cellular behavior. One major issue is the degree to which close-to-equilibrium assumptions (such as the dynamics being driven by free energy minimization) can be taken as reliable predictors of the obviously active dynamics of biological cells. The authors have recognized this conceptual issue and have argued that these assumptions provide a reasonable first step for understanding the full complexity of dynamics in the tumor microenvironment.</p>
<p>The problem of T cell infiltration as well as the patterning of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by fibroblasts necessarily involve understanding cell proliferation, cell motion and cell interactions due e.g. to cell signaling. There is evidence that inherently non-equilibrium interactions between the fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix can lead to patterning of the fiber network and trapping of potentially infiltrating T-cells. it is not clear the extent to which this type of interaction can be captured by the approach being used here, although the authors propose that they can be mimicked by proper terms in their formulation. This to me is the primary concern that I had with this paper.</p>
<p>The authors have now addressed what used to be a separate weakness concerning the assumption that fibroblasts affect T cell behavior primarily by just making a more dense ECM. Instead, the organization of the ECM (for example, its anisotropy) could be playing a much more essential role than is given credit for here. This possibility is now discussed in some detail and the authors have suggested that the introduction of a nematic order parameter field would be a useful way to treat this effect.</p>

<p>We thank the editor for recognizing the usefulness of our work. This work does not aim to precisely describe the complexity of the tumor microenvironment in lung cancer, but rather to classify and rigorously calibrate a minimum number of parameters to the clinical data we collect and generate, and reproduce the global structures of the microenvironment. We identify different scenarios, and show how they depend on the local interactions within this framework. Although we started in the first version with coalescence in the main text and anisotropic geometry in the supporting information, we realized that we needed to provide more directions to better show how our model can be extended. Thus, in Section III-4 we added an analysis of a microenvironment with blood vessels, and showed how to introduce anisotropic friction as a function of fiber orientation, as well as active stress, paving the way for further studies, that would make our model more complex. However, in a first step, it is crucial to start with a limited number of parameters that can be rigorously determined, and this is how this first work was conceived.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for highligting the importance of our work. We acknowledge that although we provided anisotropic geometries and the study of the coalescence in the first version, more effort was needed to provide tools to extend our formalism to non-ideal cases. This is now added as Section III-4, where we analyze the impact of blood vessels, and the anisotropic friction due to the nematic order for the fibers; this nematic order can also be used to introduce active nematic stress.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Models of the form being studied here rely on a large number of assumptions regarding cellular behavior. Some of these seemed questionable, based on what we have learned about active systems. The problem of T cell infiltration as well as the patterning of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by fibroblasts necessarily involve understanding cell motion and cell interactions due e.g. to cell signaling. Adopting an approach based purely on physical systems driven by free energies alone does not consider the special role that active processes can play, both in motility itself and in the type of self-organization that can occur due to these cell-cell interactions. This to me is the primary weakness of this paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the referee for this important comment, that allows us to clarify this important point. Although biological materials are out of equilibrium, their behavior often resembles that dictated by thermodynamics. Hence the usefulness of constructing a free energy, in terms of these variables. In a first approach to decipher the complex interactions and describe the different and sometimes non-trivial outcomes in this system that involves many components, we must start by minimizing the number of parameters, and identifying those complex processes, that control the evolution of the system. The free energy that we build on this biological system contains therefore out-of-equilibrium processes that can be approximated by a ”close to equilibrium” description. Our approach is a classical one in statistical physics of active systems, namely in the effort to construct an equivalent free-energy for out-of-equilibrium systems. This allows to gain a clearer insight into those complex processes.</p>
<p>We have added a sentence in the main text, section III.1, to clarify this point:</p>
<p>“Building a free-energy density for a biological material is justified, because, although biological materials are out of equilibrium, their behavior often resembles that dictated by thermodynamics. It is therefore useful to write a free energy in terms of state variables.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we recognize that we should have provided more tools for using our formalism by making it active. This is why we introduced the nematic order in the fibers in Section III-4. This nematic order can be used to introduce active stress, and we have cited previous works by some of us see [<bold>?</bold>, <bold>?</bold>, <bold>?</bold>] as references for building active processes out of it.</p>
<p>We must also note that cell signaling has been introduced <italic>a minima</italic> in our system for providing the cue for the arrival of T-cells and NAFs from the boundaries. However, we found that although we had evoked the other role of the chemicals in the transformation from NAFs to CAFs in the text, details were not well explained. We have therefore corrected and added some explanations in the introduction of section III, and III.1, III.2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A separate weakness concerns the assumption that fibroblasts affect T cell behavior primarily by just making a more dense ECM. There are a number of papers in the cancer literature (see, for some examples, Carstens, J., Correa de Sampaio, P., Yang, D. et al. Spatial computation of intratumoral T cells correlates with survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. Nat Commun 8, 15095 (2017);Sun, Xiujie, Bogang Wu, Huai-Chin Chiang, Hui Deng, Xiaowen Zhang, Wei Xiong, Junquan Liu et al. ” Tumour DDR1 promotes collagen fibre alignment to instigate immune exclusion.” Nature 599, no. 7886 (2021): 673-678) that seem to indicate that density alone is not a sufficient indicator of T cell behavior. Instead, the organization of the ECM (for example, its anisotropy) could be playing a much more essential role than is given credit for here. This possibility is hinted at in the Discussion section but deserves much more emphasis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The referee is right in his comment, and we thank him for raising this issue. We have therefore introduced the anisotropic orientation of the fibers, which induces an anisotropic friction in a new section III-4. In addition, the references pointed out were included in this section. However, although the anisotropy strongly influences the fate of the tumor when the fibers are oriented perpendicular to the surface of the cancer nest, it is less effective when the fibroblasts are oriented in the direction of surface of the cancer nest. In the latter case, which is often the case before cancer cells reshape the tumor microenvironment, the matrix density should correlate with the friction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the mixed version of the model is, from a general perspective, not very different from many other published models treating the ecology of the tumor microenvironment (for a survey, see Arabameri A, Asemani D, Hadjati J (2018), A structural methodology for modeling immune-tumor interactions including pro-and anti-tumor factors for clinical applications. Math Biosci 304:48-61). There are even papers in this literature that specifically investigate effects due to allowing cancer cells to instigate changes in other cells from being tumor-inhibiting to tumor-promoting. This feature occurs not only for fibroblasts but also for example for macrophages which can change their polarization from M1 to M2. There needed to be some more detailed comparison with this existing literature.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The referee is right that the first part of our approach, namely the dynamical system may be common in this kind of system, and it needs to be mentioned. So we added the following sentence in the discussion: ”This is in line with several similar mathematical models, that study through this lens the inhibition/activation of the immune system by cancer cells either by means of compartmental nonlinear models similar to our dynamical system, for instance regarding macrophage recruitment and cytokine signaling {arabameri2018structural} {li2019computational}, or mixture models {fotso2024mixture}. We combine the two approaches in order to rigorosly derive the parameters of the model and gain insights from both.”</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors should address the following points:</p>
<p>Major issues</p>
<p>(1) The shape of tumors simulated differs immensely from the observed tumors in Fig. 2. Here, the tumor is constituted by irregular domains, not dissimilar from domains in phase separating mixtures. The domains simulated are circular. Since the authors are using the space dependent model to model the increase in tumor cells with time in the different scenarios (immune-desert, immune-excluded, immune inflamed), it should explain how non-spherical tumor structures can be observed in these scenarios. The authors introduce tumor coalescence in page 28, however, it is not expected that the structures observed in Fig 2 are the result from different tumors merging and coalescing, because that would result from an unlikely large number of initial mutation events in the same region of the tissue. The authors should explain what mechanisms present in the model can lead to non-spherical forms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that real tumors are rarely round contrary to what our numerics suggests. In fact, only the last figure of our paper in the supporting information was more appropriate for such a discussion. We are now adding discussions and new figures to better illustrate our spatial model, see Figure 6 and section III-4. The in situ geometry of tumors depends on the shape of the host organ, the diffusive (chemical) or advected species such as T cells and fibroblasts, and on the nutrients. Thus, in our case, only cancer cells are produced locally, but during growth the tumor is strongly constrained by the microenvironment, and thus the geometry of the domain we model in the numerics and its boundary conditions. This is also true for the chemicals responsible for growth, cellular advection and phenotypic transformation. Their concentration depends on a convection-diffusion equation and boundary conditions. For a tumor in situ, such as in the lung, the available space is a constraint that will dominate the final geometry of the tumor nests. We do not think that coalescence is controlled by mutational events, but most likely by the search for space necessary for growth. Compared to the first version, we add new figures (Figure 6) that show that the geometry of the organ, as well as the localization of blood vessels, are a cause of the irregularity of the tumor shapes. We also introduce orientational order, which as suggested in section III-4, can induce anisotropic friction and stresses, as well as anisotropic growth. We cite (Ackermann, Joseph, and Martine Ben Amar. ”Onsager’s variational principle in proliferating biological tissues, in the presence of activity and anisotropy.” The European Physical Journal Plus 138.12 (2023): 1103.) where we described active stresses and coupling related to anisotropic growth.</p>

<p>(2) According to the authors, the model presented in equations (1) and onwards simulates the evolution of the fraction of tumor cells in the tissue. However the fraction of tumor cells, for example, depends itself on the variation of other cell types. For example, if fibroblasts were to proliferate with rate alpha, even without tumor cells proliferating, the fraction of tumor cells in the mixture should decrease as alpha times the tumor cells fraction. These terms are missing. The equations do not describe the evolution of the cells’ fractions but of the amount of cells of each type, normalised by the total carrying capacity of non-normal cells in the tissue. The text should be rewritten accordingly.</p>

<p>We agree with the referee: our definition of cell density was not precise enough and may appear misleading. In the paragraph II1, we more explictly introduce the word mass fraction which is the correct physical quantity to introduce into the spatial model.</p>
<p>”All these cells have the same mass density and the sum of their mass fraction satisfies the relationship <italic>S = C + T + F<sub>NA</sub> + F<sub>A</sub></italic> = 1-<italic>N</italic>, where <italic>N</italic> is a healthy non active component as healthy cells, for example.”</p>

<p>(3) The authors start by calculating fixed points of different versions of the dynamical system without spatial dependence. They should explain what is the relevance of these fixed points: in a real situation, where the concentration of tumor fibroblasts and T-cells depend on position, in which conditions are these fixed points relevant?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The referee is right and we will clarify this point: the dynamic analysis is a help for understanding and predicting the scenario occurring in the system. After all the steps of paragraph 2.2, we are faced with 11 independent parameters only for the dynamical system and without the parameters generated by the space modeling itself. Our estimation concerns only lung cancer. These parameters do not appear in the literature. The parameters introduced in Sec. III which are more related to physical interactions such as friction, cell-cell adhesion, etc. can be found in the literature or can be estimated and thus measured in in vitro experiments (see Ackermann and Ben Amar, EPJP 2023, P. Benaroch, J. Nikolic et al. 2024, biorxiv). So what are the fixed points for: they help to get the right numbers for spatial analysis. To recover special features of cancer evolution, we need a model, but also correct estimates of the data in a code that is quite technical and heavy, with each simulation taking a certain amount of time. For users who only need rough predictions, the analysis in section 2 is sufficient.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the global result depends only on the source terms, and on the boundary conditions. This can be illustrated with a simple example: Consider the governing equation for the density of a component with velocity <bold>v</bold> and source term:</p>
<disp-formula id="sa3equ1">
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-101885-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<p>Integrating the equation over a fixed volume <italic>V</italic> of surface <italic>S</italic> gives:</p>
<disp-formula id="sa3equ2">
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-101885-sa3-equ2.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<p><inline-formula id="sa3equ3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-101885-sa3-equ3.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>. This integrated equation can then be approximated by the dynamical system that we write. Thus, while the dynamical system does not give any information about the local structure of the system, it may be indicative of its global outcome.</p>
<p>(4)   In page 15, the authors identify that α<sub>NA</sub> is proportional to δ𝝐<sup>4</sup>. However, in equation (7), they replace α<sub>NA</sub> by δ𝝐<sup>4</sup> without the proportionality constant. This should be corrected.</p>
<p>Thank you for your remark. This typo is now corrected.</p>

<p>(5) The tumor cell movement should be much slower than the T-cells. Here, the authors assign a similar friction coefficient for the cancer cells and T-cells, for example. However, in lung cancer tumor cells are epithelial, and adhere to each other in the tissue. Their movement is very restricted by the basement membranes and by cell-cell adhesion. Immune cells and T-cells on the other hand move rapidly throughout the stroma. It is a gross simplification to not consider the low epitelial tissue mobility in the context of lung cancer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is possible to assume different friction coe cients for each phase pair. This has been done in a previous publication, Ackermann et al., Physics report 2021. It is also possible to play with the cell-cell adhesion in the energy density and on the diffusion coe cient introduced in the Flory-Higgins free energy. Cell-cell adhesion is taken into account in the energy, and this makes the tumor a more dense phase, while T-cells can move towards cancer cells to which they are attracted. In the last part of the paper, we show the role of an anisotropic friction due to a nematic order for activated fibroblasts and all the other cells</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) What is the biological mechanism by which the T-cells form a colony with a surface tension? In the phase-field model, the authors have a surface tension assigned to the cancer cells, T-cells and fibroblasts. Can the authors justify biologically why do they consider these surface tensions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The fact that T-cells form a colony is due to the accumulation of T-cells at the outer boundary of the tumor, as they are attracted to it but cannot penetrate due to the strong cell-cell adhesion of the tumor cells in the nest. Adding a gradient square is standard in continuous models to limit the sharp variations. In a continuous approach, the gradient square contribution limits the sharp variations in cell density which are not physical.</p>

<p>Minor issues</p>
<p>(a) Page 6 (end), characterisation of the fibre barrier produced by CAFs missing: what is the fibre density, how it can hinder the spread of cancer and T-cell motility? Is it so dense that it prevents ameboid movement? Can cells move through it using matrix degradation proteins?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The fiber density corresponds to the fibrous organic extracellular matrix secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts. In desmotic (highly fibrous tumors such as PDAC or NSCLC), this extracellular matrix deposited around the tumor forms a physical barrier around the tumor nest, preventing both cell migration and capillary and immune cells penetration. In these cases, the fibrous belt actually prevents ameboid movement and cells must deform significantly to migrate. The role of this barrier was particularly demonstrated in the reference (Grout, John A., et al. ”Spatial positioning and matrix programs of cancer-associated fibroblasts promote T-cell exclusion in human lung tumors.” Cancer Discovery 12.11 (2022): 2606-2625.). In later stages of cancer, the tumor may adapt and develop strategies to metastasize, such as matrix degradation. This matrix can be oriented, organized or disordered. To build a minimal model, we first considered an isotropic friction and also an anisotropic friction of the nematic belt, due to the activated fibroblasts. In the case of T-cells, as mentioned in section I.1, it is true that the biological literature also considers a phenotypic transformation of the T cells by the activated fibroblasts: this concerns both their proliferative capacities, antigen recognition and also their cytotoxic function. To better document the different mechanisms, we add the following publication: Cancer associated fibroblasts-an impediment to effective anti-cancer T cell immunity, by Koppensteiner, Lilian and Mathieson, Layla and O’Connor, Richard A and Akram, Ahsan R, Frontiers in immunology (2022).</p>
<p>However, our goal is to build a minimal model and to characterize and quantify the physical process in which CAFs are involved, namely the role of a physical barrier, that has been documented, as documented above.</p>

<p>The referee is right: the surface plots presented in figure 4 would be easier to compare with the same colorbar range for the legends. In fact, as the referee noted, figures in A, B and C have the same legends, while figure in D has a different one. This is due to the fact that D represents the case of the immune-inflamed tumor where the cancer mass fraction is quite vanishing, resulting in values that are of 3 orders of magnitude lower than those present in A, B and C. Therefore, they would disappear if the colorbar range were equal to the others.We insist more on the change of scale in the legend of Figure 4, in the new version.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major points</p>
<p>(1) Following on from the discussion in the public review, I feel that there are a number of critical issues that need to be addressed regarding modeling assumptions. I would like to understand why the authors believe it is possible to use a free energy-driven model of the microenvironment when many of the processes relevant for their study have an undeniably ”active media” flavor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The referee is right that processes in biology are active processes. However, it is a classical approach to model physical interactions between biological components with a free-energy, especially cell adhesion, as they often lead to quasi-stationary equilibrium-like patterns. The free-energy approach has also the advantage to derive straight-forwardly complex phenomena involving many components. Activity can indeed be introduced in such a framework, if we know that the fibroblasts transform into myo-fibroblasts, see for example our previous publication Ackermann and Ben Amar, EPJP 2023. However, in the interest of simplification and reduction of the number of free parameters, we have not not considered further complication of the model here, as a minimal model allows to distinguish the main processes that occur. Nevertheless, introducing more precisely activity, in the nematic approach already achieved for the friction, is a natural continuation of our work: See the new Section III-4, where we introduce the nematic order, and we indicate that active nematic stresses can be written from it.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Next, I don’t understand the assumption that T cells do not proliferate once they detect neoantigens on the cancer cells; activation of T cells usually causes them to become more proliferative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the referee for this question. The T-cell fraction has two origins: proliferation of T-cells in situ in the stroma or inside tumor nest or external arrival from the sources that we privilege. We recognize that a full analysis of the tumor-microenvironment would require to consider proliferation near the tumor, as many more other processes which is do able but requires the knowledge of more biological date. In addition, besides, the proliferation of T-cells will be equivalent to increase the killing abilities of T-cells and these two effect overlapp in our approach.</p>
<p>In order to clarify this point, we modify the following sentence in Section II.2:</p>
<p>“Although proliferation of cytotoxic T-cells has been observed, we do not consider explicitly proliferation in our study as we focus on their ability to infiltrate the tumor.”</p>
<p>Rather, we consider that T-cells proliferate outside the domain boundaries, so that this proliferation is included in the boundary source contributions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the issue of whether the density of fibers is sufficient to understand the role of fibroblasts is not at all settled. There should be a full discussion of this issue including mentioning of the Nature paper (cited in the public review) that argues that orientation (and not density) is the key to the role of fibers, as well as the earlier cited work of Kalluri and collaborators on the role of ECM density in pancreatic cancer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the referee for this remark. As we wrote above in the response to the public review, we introduced significant additions that aim to tackle this question in the article.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors present a picture of a tumor cell with fibroblasts apparently arrayed circumferentially around the tumor boundary and therefore blocking infiltration. This type of tumor structure has been seen before, for example in ”On the mechanism of long-range orientational order of fibroblasts.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 114, no. 34 (2017): 8974-8979, which should be cited. More importantly, in that paper the argument is made that positive feedback between fibroblasts and ECM geometry can cause structures like this to form. If this is indeed what is occurring, this would indicate the crucial importance of a mechanism beyond what is contained in the current model. This issue should therefore be discussed within this paper. This issue is of course connected to the previous point regarding the role of ECM structure beyond density.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We completely agree that the interplay between the fibroblast layer and the tumor shapes the tumor boundary. One of the authors has worked recently on this precise topic (Aging and freezing of active nematic dynamics of cancer-associated fibroblasts by fibronectin matrix remodeling, C Jacques, J Ackermann, S Bell, C Hallopeau, CP Gonzalez, ... bioRxiv, 2023.11. 22.568216, Ordering, spontaneous flows and aging in active fluids depositing tracks S Bell, J Ackermann, A Maitra, R Voituriez arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.05195). Since the fibroblast layer is an active material, it contributes to an anisotropic stress that can be introduced into the model. Our first strategy was to present the simplest modeling in order to focus on the most important interactions as cell-cell adhesion and cell-tissue adhesion. However, we recognize that those questions should be discussed in the text, and we discuss it in the new section III-4</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points</p>
<p>There are also a number of more minor points to consider:</p>
<p>(1) Since the parameter is taken to be O(1), why exactly does it matter how the other parameters scale with it?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is very important to compare the order of magnitude of the other parameters once the selected parameter of order O(1) is really the driving parameter of the coupling. It gives a first picture of the main interactions that has to consider.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I didn’t understand the relevance of referring specifically to IL 6 among many other possibly relevant signals, as is currently done on page 7.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This corresponds to studies aiming to correlate lung cancer risks and the concentration of interleukin, mostly IL6 and IL8 (McKeown, D. J., et al. ”The relationship between circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein, inflammatory cytokines and cytokine receptors in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.” British journal of cancer 91.12 (2004): 1993-1995.,Brenner, Darren R., et al. ”Inflammatory cytokines and lung cancer risk in 3 prospective studies.” American journal of epidemiology 185.2 (2017): 86-95. ) but in the absence of very detailed biological information, the modeling and its results are not modified if other chemicals intervene..We slightly modeified the following phrase in section I.1:</p>
<p>“In particular, in the family of inflammatory proteins, also called cytokines, Interlukin-6 (IL6) and (IL8) seem, among others to stimulate the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors need to mention the possibility of T-cell chemotaxis to the tumor being ”self-amplified” in the T cell system, as put forth in Galeano Nin˜o, Jorge Luis, Sophie V. Pageon, Szun S. Tay, Feyza Colakoglu, Daryan Kempe, Jack Hywood, Jessica K. Mazalo et al. ”Cytotoxic T cells swarm by homotypic chemokine signalling.” eLife 9 (2020): e56554. This might again reveal a needed extension of the current modelling strategy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the referee for his/her comment on the self-amplification of T-cell population in the stroma and we mention the indicated reference in our paper. This auto-chemoatactic process which induces a dynamic of more e cient recruitment towards the tumor, may be important for immunotherapy. To have more e cient T-cell arriving at the site of the tumor, will lead a better issue for the patient, if the swarming organization is maintained in a desmoplastic nematic stroma.</p>

<p>(4) It is not obvious to me that in sub figures 3F and 3H the tumor is enroute to being totally eradicated, as is stated in the text. The blue lines seemed to asymptote at non-zero population values.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Looking at sub-figures 3F and 3H, we stated in the main text that the tumor is eradicated as the representative population approaches a 0 value fraction, or at least decays around the 0 (0.01/0.05 to be more precise). This is even more evident when compared with the other cases where the tumor mass fraction reaches values of a higher order (up to 0.6), thus leading us to dinstinguish between these different scenarios.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The description of the interaction of cells with fibers as being increased friction might be misleading, as the real effect could be actual trapping in the network (as opposed to just slowing down the motion).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the referee for this question as it allow us to make an important distinction. Indeed, what the referee describes seems to correspond to a discrete event, namely a cell trapped in a network. However, coarse-graining the dynamics to the continuous modeling seems to us as leading to an effective friction between the two phases. Moreover, we also now introduced an anisotropic friction which can represent a trapping. The velocities are not only directed around the tumor but can also be oriented towards the tumor, so that eventually the friction along the radius mimics a trapping (see Fig.4 on top). We have introduced this anisotropic friction via a nematic model, see the appendix.</p>
