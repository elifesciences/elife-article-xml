<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cryo-EM single-particle analyses typically require target macromolecule concentration at 0.05∼5.0 mg/ml, which is often difficult to achieve. Here, we devise Magnetic Isolation and Concentration (MagIC)-cryo-EM, a technique enabling direct structural analysis of targets captured on magnetic beads, thereby reducing the targets’ concentration requirement to &lt; 0.0005 mg/ml. Adapting MagIC-cryo-EM to a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation protocol, we characterized structural variations of the linker histone H1.8-associated nucleosomes that were isolated from interphase and metaphase chromosomes in Xenopus egg extract. Combining <underline>Du</underline>plicated <underline>S</underline>election <underline>T</underline>o <underline>E</underline>xclude <underline>R</underline>ubbish particles (DuSTER), a particle curation method that removes low signal-to-noise ratio particles, we also resolved the 3D cryo-EM structures of H1.8-bound nucleoplasmin NPM2 isolated from interphase chromosomes and revealed distinct open and closed structural variants. Our study demonstrates the utility of MagIC-cryo-EM for structural analysis of scarce macromolecules in heterogeneous samples and provides structural insights into the cell cycle-regulation of H1.8 association to nucleosomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent advances in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) technology have enabled the structural characterization of biomolecules isolated from their native conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. However, the necessity for high sample concentration restricts its applicability to abundant targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The vitrification step of cryo-EM is a major contributor to this bottleneck. In a conventional plunge vitrification method, 3 µL of aqueous samples greater than 1 mg/mL are typically required to acquire sufficient numbers of particle images on cryo-EM micrographs for 3D structure reconstruction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This is because most of the target complexes in the sample solution applied on a cryo-EM grid must be removed by a blotting paper to make a thin ice layer suitable for analysis. Several methods are currently available to reduce sample volume/concentration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>). Jet vitrification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and Spotiton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> require sub-nanoliters of the sample volume, but they still require high-concentration samples. Affinity grids, such as Ni-NTA lipid monolayer grids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, chemically functionalized grids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, antibody-attached grids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and streptavidin monolayer grids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, are amenable for lower concentration samples (∼0.05 mg/mL), but concentrating natively isolated targets to such a level and reproducibly generating the affinity grids remains challenging.</p>
<p>For the structural analysis of chromatin-associated proteins, it is a common practice to overexpress target recombinant proteins in cultured cells and assemble nucleoprotein complexes with a specific short (10 – 1000 bp) linear DNA. However, this reconstitution approach has a limitation since the structure and function of chromatin proteins can be altered by several variances under native conditions, such as DNA sequence, DNA and protein modifications, and short- and long-scale DNA folding. Although isolation of the endogenous chromatin-associated complexes can be achieved through <underline>ch</underline>romatin immuno<underline>p</underline>recipitation (ChIP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> to determine the associated DNA sequences and proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, the amount obtained by this method is too little to apply for conventional structural analysis.</p>
<p>To obtain high-resolution cryo-EM structures of chromatin-associated protein complexes while they are functioning on the native chromosomes, we previously analyzed structural variation of nucleosomes isolated from interphase and metaphase chromosomes formed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. We found that the averaged structures of the nucleosome core particle (NCP) in interphase and metaphase chromosomes are essentially identical to the NCP crystal structure assembled with histone proteins and DNA with strong nucleosome positioning sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. We also observed that the major structural variation of the nucleosome structures between interphase and metaphase chromosomes was attributable to binding status of the oocyte-specific linker histone H1.8. We resolved the 3D structure of H1.8 bound to the nucleosome at the on-dyad position, in which H1 interacts both sides of the linker DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, from the chromatin sample isolated from metaphase chromosomes but not from interphase chromosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. While H1.8 on metaphase chromosomes competes with the condensin complex to control the size and the shape of mitotic chromosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, the reason we could not resolve an H1.8-bound nucleosome structure from interphase chromosomes despite its abundant presence in the nucleus remained unclear. We sought to address this question by enriching H1.8-bound nucleoprotein complexes from interphase chromosomes by adapting ChIP-based methods.</p>
<p>Aiming to reduce sample requirements for single particle cryo-EM analyses to levels lower than those widely used for ChIP-seq (10-50 ng DNA, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, here we developed <underline>Mag</underline>netic Isolation and <underline>C</underline>oncentration (MagIC)-cryo-EM, which enables direct cryo-EM analysis of target molecules enriched on superparamagnetic nanobeads. By adapting the ChIP protocol to MagIC-cryo-EM, we successfully determine the ∼4 Å resolution structures of H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes using highly heterogeneous dilute fractions isolated from metaphase and interphase chromosomes. In addition, by combining the particle curation method, <underline>Du</underline>plicated <underline>S</underline>election <underline>T</underline>o <underline>E</underline>xclude <underline>R</underline>ubbish particles (DuSTER), which effectively removes particles with a low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), we revealed structural variations of the H1.8-bound chaperone NPM2 isolated from interphase chromosomes, providing structural insights into the cell cycle regulation of H1.8 stabilization on nucleosomes.</p>

<title>Development and optimization of MagIC-cryo-EM using nucleosomes</title>
<p>Inspired by a report using 200-300 nm superparamagnetic beads directly loaded onto a cryo-EM grid to image viral particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we examined the feasibility of 50 nm streptavidin nanobeads for cryo-EM single-particle analysis using poly-nucleosome arrays as pilot targets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Nanobeads were easily identified on the grid as black dots in the intermediate-magnification montage map (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), facilitating target identification for subsequent high-magnification data collection. In the high-magnification micrographs, poly-nucleosome fibers were observed around the nanobeads as expected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Using nucleosome-like particles selected from 550 micrographs by the machine-learning-based software Topaz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we successfully determined the 3D structure of the nucleosome at sub-5 Å resolution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This result, however, revealed a notable issue; an intense halo-like noise covered a ∼30 nm radius around the nanobeads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, blue areas), interfering with the signal from particles that were proximal to the beads.</p>

<p>To reduce the effect of the halo-like noise surrounding the nanobeads, a protein spacer module was attached to the beads so that the target biomolecules are placed outside the reach of the noise (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). After several rounds of optimization using the <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted H1.8-bound nucleosome as a model target, we chose a spacer module comprising an 11-nm triple helical bundle (3HB) protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and four copies of a 60-nm single alpha helix (SAH) protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> for its effectiveness and reasonable production yield (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>).

<p>To assess the feasibility of the MagIC-cryo-EM beads for structural analysis of a low-concentration target in heterogeneous samples, we isolated H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes by anti-GFP nanobody coupled to the MagIC-cryo-EM beads from a mixture of H1.8-GFP nucleosomes (1.7 nM, or 0.00047 mg/mL) and a large excess of unbound mono-nucleosomes (53 nM, or 0.012 mg/mL) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). This target concentration was approximately 100 to 1000 times lower than the concentration required for conventional cryo-EM methods, including affinity grid approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The magnetic beads were captured on a cryo-EM grid by neodymium magnets for 5 min in a humidified chamber (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). This magnetic capture step significantly increased the number of beads that were found in the sample holes of the grid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-I</xref>), thereby mitigating the sample loss caused by filter paper blotting to generate a thin ice layer.</p>
<p>High-magnification micrographs of MagIC-cryo-EM beads show that the spacer module successfully placed nucleosome-like particles outside the noise surrounding the nanobeads (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). The local enrichment of target molecules around MagIC-cryo-EM beads offers a substantial advantage in data collection efficiency over available cryo-EM methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, in which target molecules are disseminated across the grids and are difficult to identify. In contrast, the magnetic beads are easily identified in the Medium-Magnification Montage (MMM) map (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), enabling the selection of target-rich areas prior to high-magnification data collection. Indeed, approximately 100 H1.8-GFP nucleosome particle images per bead were efficiently collected even with a sample concentration as low as 0.00047 mg/mL of H1.8-GFP nucleosomes in the heterogeneous sample (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref> right panel).</p>
<p>After removing junk particles using decoy classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>), an H1.8 density-containing nucleosome class was isolated via <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction and heterogeneous refinement using cryoSPARC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Among the nucleosome-containing particles, 55.7 % of them were classified as a nucleosome with H1.8 at the on-dyad position (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>), yielding a final 3D structure at 3.6 Å resolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). This high fraction of H1.8-bound nucleosome particles indicated that the MagIC-cryo-EM beads efficiently isolated the target molecules. Notably, this method only required 5 ng of H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes (including 2 ng of DNA) per cryo-EM grid, which is comparable to or even lower than the requirements of widely used ChIP-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>MagIC-cryo-EM application for ChIP to assess structural features of H1.8 in chromosomes</title>
<p>We next adapted MagIC cryo-EM to ChIP protocols to elucidate the cell-cycle-specific mechanism that controls H1.8 stability on interphase and metaphase nucleosomes. We previously reported the cryo-EM structure of <italic>Xenopus</italic> H1.8 bound to the metaphase nucleosome at the on-dyad position, whereas no H1.8-containing structures were reconstructed from interphase chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, left). Despite the high accumulation of H1.8 in the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), the amount of nucleosome-associated H1.8 in interphase is reduced to approximately 30% of that in metaphase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Given the high mobility of the linker histone H1 on chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that H1.8 on nucleosome is destabilized by an interphase-specific mechanism. By enriching H1.8-bound nucleosomes from interphase and metaphase chromosomes using MagIC-cryo-EM, we intended to examine if H1.8 in interphase preferentially associates with nucleosomes at more unstable binding positions, such as at off-dyad positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, positioning model), or if there is an interphase-specific mechanism (by chaperones, for example) that dissociates H1.8 from nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, chaperone model), although the amount H1.8-bound NAP1, the known histone H1.8 chaperone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, did not differ between metaphase and interphase egg extracts (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>).</p>

<p>To distinguish between these models, we applied MagIC-cryo-EM to enrich H1.8 bound nucleosomes from chromosomes assembled in interphase and metaphase <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. Sperm nuclei were incubated in egg extracts supplemented with H1.8-GFP to obtain replicated interphase chromosomes and metaphase chromosomes, which were crosslinked and fragmented to generate soluble nucleoprotein complexes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We confirmed that H1.8-GFP is functional as it rescued the chromosome elongation phenotype caused by H1.8 immunodepletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B-D</xref>). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was conducted to separate different H1.8-containing complexes, including mono-nucleosome fractions and oligo-nucleosome fractions, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and S4). As we had predicted that more H1.8 proteins would associate with nucleosomes in metaphase than in interphase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, we increased the quantities of egg extract and sperm nuclei by 2.5 fold to prepare comparable amounts of H1.8-bound interphase nucleosomes as compared to metaphase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, fractions 4-11). To ensure that most nucleosomes isolated through MagIC-cryo-EM were bound by H1.8, we selected the fractions enriched with H1.8-bound mono-nucleosomes (fraction 5 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>), as oligo-nucleosomes (abundant in fractions 6-11) might include H1.8-free nucleosomes. These fractions contain highly heterogeneous protein mixtures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), in which H1.8-GFP is a minor constituent with an estimated concentration at 1-2 nM (corresponding to 0.00025-0.0005 mg/ml of H1.8-bound mono-nucleosomes) (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>).</p>
<p>H1.8-GFP-bound mono-nucleosomes in the fraction 5 (from metaphase and interphase chromosomes) were captured by GFP nanobody-MagIC-cryo-EM beads and applied to grids for cryo-EM analysis. To quantitatively assess the population of the H1-bound modes of interphase and metaphase nucleosomes, we employed <italic>in silico</italic> mixing 3D classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Micrographs of interphase and metaphase MagIC-cryo-EM were mixed and used for particle picking and decoy classification to isolate the nucleosome-containing classes (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). Subsequently, particles were classified into three nucleosome-containing 3D models (A, B, C), which were generated by <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">S5A</xref>). Further 3D classification on the class A, which has weak H1.8 density, yielded three new nucleosome-containing structures, A1, A2, and A3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">S5A</xref>). Then, the populations of interphase and metaphase particles in each class were assessed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Only class A1 had an apparent H1.8 density at the on-dyad position of the nucleosome, with 27% and 23% of the nucleosome particles assigned to this class coming from interphase and metaphase conditions, respectively. Although class A2 had linker DNA densities on both sides of the entry/exit sites of the nucleosome in a closed conformation, it did not have a clear H1.8 density. This suggested that the structures of H1.8 in the particles assigned to this class were not uniform, and that the H1.8 density was averaged out during the cryo-EM processing. Class A3, to which 3-4 % of the nucleosome particles were assigned, had ambiguous extra densities outside of the on-dyad position (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, red arrows), possibly representing H1.8 bound to non-dyad positions. Overall, the relative distributions of these 5 classes were largely similar between interphase and metaphase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), and the structures of H1.8-bound nucleosomes in interphase and metaphase were indistinguishable (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). The result suggests that differential positional preferences of H1.8 on the nucleosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, positioning model) are unlikely to drive the reduced H1.8 association to interphase nucleosomes.</p>

<title>MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER reconstructed cryo-EM structure of interphase-specific H1.8-containing complex, NPM2</title>
<p>Although we could not discern structural differences of H1.8-bound mono-nucleosomes from metaphase and interphase samples, we noticed that substantial portions of H1.8 were enriched in sucrose fractions 3 and 4 isolated from interphase chromosomes but not from metaphase chromosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). As these interphase-specific H1.8 fractions were lighter than mono-nucleosome-containing fractions, we thought that they may contain regulatory proteins that preferentially dissociate H1.8 from nucleosomes in interphase, in line with the chaperone model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>To characterize these interphase-specific fractions, we sought to determine their structural features using MagIC-cryo-EM. However, our initial attempt failed to reconstitute any reasonable 2D classes of the interphase-specific H1.8-containing complex (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref>), even though Topaz successfully picked most of the 60∼80 Å particles present on the MagIC-cryo-EM beads (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref>). This was likely due to their small size; most of the particles did not have a high enough S/N to be properly classified during the 2D classifications as they were masked by background noise from the ice, graphene, and/or spacer proteins (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref>).</p>
<p>To solve this issue, we devised the particle curation method DuSTER that does not requires the successful 2D classifications (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The principle of DuSTER is based on our realization that low S/N ratio particles were not reproducibly recentered during 2D classification (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>). On the particles that were successfully recognized during 2D classification, picked points were shifted to the center of the particles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, black arrows). However, on the low S/N ratio particles that could not be recognized during 2D classification, picked points were shifted outside the center of the particles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, green arrows). To assess the reproducibility of the particle recentering during 2D classification, two independent particle pickings were conducted by Topaz so that each particle on the grid has two picked points (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, second left panel). These picked points were independently subjected to 2D classification. After recentering the picked points by 2D classification, distances (<italic>D</italic>) between recentered points from the first picking process and other recentered points from the second picking process were measured. DuSTER keeps recentered points whose <italic>D</italic> are shorter than a threshold distance (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub>). By setting <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub> = 20 Å, 2D classification results were dramatically improved in this sample; a five-petal flower-shaped 2D class was reconstructed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Although approaches to utilize the reproducibility of 2D class assignments have been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, the advantage of DuSTER is that it can be applied to small particles that cannot even be properly classified in 2D classification.</p>

<p>Repetitive rounds of particle curation using the picked point locations recentered by 2D classification (referred to as 2D DuSTER) successfully reconstituted 2D classes of 60∼80 Å complexes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, and <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">S8</xref>). As expected, the particles rejected by DuSTER have a generally weak contrast (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig S9A</xref>). Although higher contrast images can be generated by increasing the defocus (the distance between the target particles and the lens focus), the selected particles were evenly distributed in all defocus ranges between 1.5 ∼ 3.5 µm (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig S9B</xref>), demonstrating that DuSTER did not merely select any random high contrast particles. By selecting these 2D classes, an initial 3D model was built (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>, and <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">S10</xref>). Using this 3D model, particle curation was revised with 3D DuSTER. In the 3D DuSTER, three NPM2 3D maps were used as the initial models for the cryoSPARC heterogenous refinement to centering the particles accurately (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub> = 15 Å) (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10A</xref>). 3D DuSTER enabled the reconstruction of a 5 Å-resolution 3D structure of the interphase-specific H1.8-containing complex, a pentameric macromolecule with a diameter of approximately 60 Å (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the identity of this complex, MagIC-cryo-EM beads used for isolating the complex were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Among the proteins detected by MS, NPM2 aligned well with the MagIC-cryo-EM result. Western blotting confirmed that NPM2 was preferentially enriched in interphase chromatin fractions compared to metaphase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), while NPM2 interacts with H1.8 in chromosome-free egg extracts both in interphase and metaphase (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). The native PAGE of the chromatin fractions indicated that NPM2 forms various complexes, including NPM2-H1.8, on the interphase chromatin fractions (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D</xref>). In addition, the crystal structure and AlphaFold2 (AF2)-predicted models of <italic>Xenopus</italic> NPM2 matched the MagIC-cryo-EM structure of the interphase-specific H1.8-bound complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Structural variations of NPM2 bound to H1.8</title>
<p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs, NPM2 replaces sperm protamines with core histones upon fertilization, thereby promoting nucleosome assembly on sperm DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. NPM2 can also extract out somatic linker histones from chromatin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. X-ray crystallography suggested that recombinant <italic>Xenopus</italic> NPM2 forms a pentamer and a decamer (a dimer of pentamers)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. The acidic tracts in the C-terminal tail of NPM2 binds H2A-H2B, histone octamers, and the linker histone H5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, while poly-glutamylation and hyperphosphorylation of NPM2 promote its substrate sequestration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. In addition, NPM1 (nucleophosmin), a paralog of NPM2, interacts with H1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. However, no subnanometer-resolution structure of NPM2 or NPM1 with post-translational modifications or with substrates is currently available. By further analyzing our cryo-EM structure representing the H1.8-bound state of NPM2, we identified two structural variants, classified as open and closed forms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">S11</xref>). Due to its structural similarity to a flower, we call the highly acidic putative substrate-binding surface the petal side whereas the other more charge neutral surface the sepal side (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">S12</xref>). The major structural differences between the two forms are found at C-terminal and N-terminal segments of NPM2 core and at the A1 loop (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, and <xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">S12</xref>). In the closed form, β8 runs straight from the sepal to the petal sides of each pentamer and has an extended C-terminal segment that protrudes past the petal side of the pentamer. In the open form, however, the C-terminal portion of β8 is bent outward to the rim (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Along with this β8 bending, C-terminal segment, N-terminal segment, and A1 loop are also positioned outward in the open form. The configuration of β1, β8, and A1 loop in the crystal structure of <italic>Xenopus</italic> NPM2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, the AF2-predicted structure of <italic>Xenopus</italic> NPM2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, and the cryo-EM structure of the bacterially expressed human NPM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, which were all determined in the absence of their target proteins, is similar to the closed form (<xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Figure S12B-D</xref>). Notably, extra cryo-EM densities, which likely represent H1.8, are clearly observed in the open form but much less in the closed form near the acidic surface regions proximal to the N terminus of β1 and the C terminus of β8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Supporting this idea, the acidic tract A1 (aa 36-40) and A2 (aa 120-140) are both implicated in the recognition of basic substrates such as core histones concentration required for conventional cryo-EM methods, including the affinity grid approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. This significant improvement was achieved through the four unique benefits of MagIC-cryo-EM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). First, the on-bead-cryo-EM approach minimizes preparation steps, which can lead to sample loss, such as target isolation, enrichment, and buffer exchange (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Second, sample loss during the grid-freezing process is reduced by magnet-based enrichment of the targets on cryo-EM grids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E-2I</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). Third, magnetic beads are easily identifiable on the grid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Fourth, the target molecules are accumulated around magnetic beads, ensuring that each micrograph contains more than 100 usable particles independent of input sample concentration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Adapting the ChIP-based method to MagIC cryo-EM, we successfully isolated and reconstructed the H1.8-bound nucleosome and the H1.8-bound NPM2 structures from interphase chromosomes, which have never been accomplished before.</p>

<p>To reconstitute the structure of H1.8-bound NPM2, we needed to devise the particle curation method DuSTER, which greatly helped the structural reconstitution of small particles with low S/N (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). By combining MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER, we were able to determine the sub-nanometer structure and structural variations of the NPM2-H1.8-GFP complex, in which the mass of the ordered region is only 60 kDa. Notably, particle curation by DuSTER does not require human supervision or machine learning, except for determining the distance threshold between repeatedly picked particles. This feature may allow for automating particle curation via DuSTER in the future.</p>
<p>MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER approaches hold the potential for targeting a wide range of biomolecules, including small ones, for two main reasons. First, the target-capturing module could be replaced with various other proteins, such as different nanobodies, single-chain variable fragments (scFv), protein A, dCas9, or avidin, to capture a wide range of biomolecules. Second, the sample requirement for MagIC-cryo-EM is a mere 5 ng per grid, which is comparable to or even lower than the requirements of widely used ChIP-seq <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Coupling next-generation sequencing with MagIC-cryo-EM beads would help the field determine structural features of functionally distinct chromatin regions, such as heterochromatin, euchromatin, transcription start sites, telomeres, and centromeres. The low sample requirement of MagIC-cryo-EM also opens the door to structural analysis using limited specimens, including patient tissues.</p>
<p>Combining MS, MagIC-cryo-EM and DuSTER, we found that the majority of chromatin-bound H1.8 in interphase existed as a complex with NPM2 rather than with nucleosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). This contrasts to the reports suggesting that NAP1 is the major H1.8-bound chaperone in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, while it is consistent with our previous MS analysis that also detected NPM2, but not NAP1, in fractions enriched with nucleosomes in interphase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Our observation is also in line with a previous report that NPM2 is able to remove linker histones but not core histones from somatic nuclei that are introduced to <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Since the amounts of H1.8-associated NAP1 or NPM2 in the egg cytoplasm did not change between interphase and metaphase (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>), a mechanism must exist such that NPM2 interacts with H1.8 on chromatin specifically in interphase and suppresses H1.8-nucleosome interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Two basic patches at the C-terminal tail of NPM2 may contribute to cell cycle-dependent DNA binding as they are flanked with potential Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. NPM2 may maintain nucleosome-bound H1.8 at a low level in interphase during early developmental cell cycles to support rapid DNA replication, while mitotic induction of H1.8 association with nucleosomes tunes condensin loading on chromosomes and ensures proper chromosome size to facilitate chromosome segregation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Structural studies based on <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution previously suggested that NPM2 binds to its substrate as a homo-decamer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, or a homo-pentamer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Our cryo-EM structure strongly suggests that the NPM2 binds to H1.8 as a homo-pentamer. Structure variation analyses suggest that NPM2 subunits can exhibit two structural configurations, open and closed forms, of which H1.8 is stably associated with only the open form. Since the closed form is more similar to the reported crystal structure and AF2-predicted structures (Figure S14B-D), both of which are determined in the absence of the substrates, our analysis points toward a possibility that substrate binding induces the structural transition of NPM2 to the open form. Among NPM2 acidic tracts A1, A2 and A3, which are important for substrate recognition, our atomic models visualize A1 and the edge of A2 at the petal side of the structure, where the density corresponding to the predicted H1.8 can be found (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). As the A2 and A3 belong to the disordered C-terminal tail that extends from the petal side of the NPM2 complex, our data suggest that the open form provides a stable association platform by exposing the acidic surface at the petal side for the substrate recognition, while the C-terminal A2 and A3 at the flexible tail may facilitate recruitment and possibly also entrapment of the substrate. Since our structural analysis further suggests that each NPM2 subunit may independently adapt open and closed form within a pentamer, this flexibility in the core domain may enable the association of substrates with diverse sizes and structures to support its molecular chaperone functionality.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>While MagIC-cryo-EM is envisioned as a versatile approach suitable for various biomolecules from diverse sources, including cultured cells and tissues, it has thus far been tested only with H1.8-bound nucleosome and H1.8-bound NPM2. For native protein targets, we applied MagIC-cryo-EM beads to solubilized chromatin fraction from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. To apply MagIC-cryo-EM for the other targets, the following factors must be considered: <italic>1) Pre-fractionation</italic>. This step (e.g., density gradient or gel filtration) may be necessary to enrich the target protein in a specific complex from other diverse forms (such as monomeric forms, subcomplexes, and protein aggregates). <italic>2) Avoiding bead aggregation</italic>. Beads may be clustered by targets (if the target complex contains multiple affinity tags or is aggregated) and nonspecific binders. <italic>3) Stabilizing complexes</italic>. The target complexes must be stable during the sample preparation. Crosslink was necessary for the H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosome. <italic>4) Loading the optimum number of targets on the bead</italic>. The optimal number of particles per bead differs depending on target sizes, as larger targets are more likely to overlap. For H1.8-GFP-bound nucleosomes, 500 to 2,000 particles per bead were optimal. We expect that fewer particles should be coated for larger targets.</p>
<p>Regarding the cryo-EM data acquisition, selection of data collection points is currently performed through manual picking of magnetic beads on MMM map. This method does not support image-shift-based data collection and serves as a bottleneck for data collection speed, limiting throughput to approximately 500–1000 micrographs per day. The development of machine learning-based software to automatically identify magnetic beads on MMM map and establish parameters for image-shift-based multiple shots could substantially enhance data collection efficiency.</p>

To extend the repeat to the desired length, MluI and AscI sites were inserted at the top and bottom of the DNA segment encoding 30 nm SAH, respectively. Although the target sequences for AscI (GG/CGCGCC) and MluI (A/CGCGT) are distinct, the DNA overhangs formed after the DNA digestion are identical. In addition, the DNA sequence formed by ligating these DNA overhangs translated into Lys-Ala-Arg, which does not disrupt a single alpha-helix.

These steps were repeated until more than 90 % of particles wer classified as a nucleosome-like class. To isolate the nucleosome class that has visible H1.8 density, four to six 3D references were generated with ab initio reconstruction of CryoSPARC v3 using purified nucleosome-like particles (Class similarity = 0.9). Refined particles were further purified with the heterogeneous refinement using an H1.8-visible class and an H1.8-invisible class as decoys. The classes with reasonable extra density were selected and refined with homogeneous refinement. The final resolution was determined with the gold stand FSC threshold (FSC = 0.143).</p>

H1.8-GFP was mixed with nucleosome with a 1.25 molar ratio in the presence of 0.001 % poly L-glutamic acid (wt 3,000-15,000) (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 37 ºC for 30 min. As a control nucleosome sample without H1.8-GFP, the sample without H1.8-GFP was also prepared. The samples were then crosslinked adding a 0.5-time volume of buffer XL containing 3 % formaldehyde and incubating for 90 min on ice. The crosslink reaction was quenched by adding 1.7 volume of quench buffer (30 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 10 ng/µL leupeptin, 10 ng/µL pepstatin, 10 ng/µL chymostatin, 10 mM sodium butyrate, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 400 mM glycine, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM DTT).

The supernatants were collected and layered onto a 10-22 % linear sucrose gradient solution with buffer SG (15 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.4], 50 mM KCl, 10-22 % sucrose, 10 µg/mL leupeptin, 10 µg/mL pepstatin, 10 µg/mL chymostatin, 10 mM sodium butyrate, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM glycine) and spun at 32,000 rpm (max 124,436 rcf) and 4 ºC for 13 h using an SW55Ti rotor in an Optima L80 centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). The samples were fractionated from the top of the sucrose gradient. The concentration of H1.8 in each fraction was determined by western blot. 15 µL of each sucrose gradient fraction was incubated at 95 ºC with 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and applied for SDS-PAGE with a 4-20 % gradient SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-rad). The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Cytiva) from the SDS-PAGE gel using TE42 Tank Blotting Units (Hoefer) at 15 V, 4 ºC for 4 h. As primary antibodies, 1 µg/mL of mouse monoclonal Anti-GFP Antibody sc-9996 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and as secondary antibodies, IR Dye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG (Li-Cor 926-32210; 1:15,000) were used. The images were taken with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor). The existence of the H1.8-GFP bound nucleosomes was confirmed by native PAGE. 15 µL of each sucrose gradient fraction was applied for a 6 % x0.5 TEB native PAGE gel. The DNA was stained with SYTO-60 (Invitrogen S11342: 1:10,000). The images of SYTO-60 signal and GFP signal were taken with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor).</p>

Finally, the beads were resuspended in approximately 80 µL of EM buffer C containing 0.001 % Tween 20.</p>
<p>To vitrify the grids, 4 µL of the samples were applied to plasma-cleaned graphene-coated Quantifoil gold R1.2/1.3 300-mesh grids (Quantifoil). The grid was then incubated on the 40 x 20 mm N52 neodymium disc magnets for 5 minutes and vitrified using the Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) with a 2-second blotting time at room temperature under 100 % humidity. The vitrified grids were loaded onto the Titan Krios (ThermoFisher), equipped with a 300 kV field emission gun and a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan). A total of 677 movies for the interphase and 965 movies for the metaphase were collected at a magnification of x 64,000 (1.33 Å/pixel) using super-resolution mode, as managed by SerialEM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The analysis pipeline is described in <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>.

The picked particles were then extracted using CryoSPARC v4 (extraction box size = 256 pixels) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Nucleosome-containing particles were isolated through decoy classification using heterogeneous reconstruction with one nucleosome-like model and four decoy classes generated through ab initio reconstruction in CryoSPARC v4. CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing were applied to the nucleosome-containing particles in Relion v4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. To isolate the nucleosome class with visible H1.8 density, three 3D references were generated through ab initio reconstruction in CryoSPARC v4 using purified nucleosome-like particles (Class similarity = 0.9). This step was repeated for the class with weak H1.8 density (Class A). Non-uniform refinement was performed in CryoSPARC v4 for each class. Subsequently, to isolate the H1.8-bound nucleosome structures in interphase and metaphase, the particles were separated based on their original movies. Using these particle sets, the 3D maps of the interphase and metaphase H1.8-bound nucleosomes were refined individually through non-uniform refinement in CryoSPARC v4.

<title>Mass spectrometry of interphase-specific H1.8-GFP containing complex isolated by MagIC-cryo-EM beads (used in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>)</title>
<p>For the MS analysis, 20 µL of the resuspended solution containing the MagIC-cryo-EM beads isolating interphase-specific H1.8-GFP containing complex was incubated at 95 °C for 10 minutes to reverse the crosslink. The 20 µL of the interphase sucrose gradient fraction 4 was also incubated at 95 °C. The samples were then applied to an SDS-PAGE (4 %–20 % gradient gel) from Bio-Rad. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Thermo Fisher). The corresponding lane was cut into pieces approximately 2 mm x 2 mm in size. The subsequent destaining, in-gel digestion, and extraction steps were carried out as described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. In brief, the cut gel was destained using a solution of 30 % acetonitrile and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate in water. Gel pieces were then dehydrated using 100 % acetonitrile. Disulfide bonds were reduced with dithiothreitol, and cysteines were alkylated using iodoacetamide. Proteins were digested by hydrating the gel pieces in a solution containing sequencing-grade trypsin and endopeptidase LysC in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Digestion proceeded overnight at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were extracted three times with a solution of 70 % acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid.</p>
<p>These extracted peptides were then purified using in-house constructed micropurification C18 tips. The purified peptides were subsequently analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Dionex 3000 HPLC system equipped with an NCS3500RS nano- and microflow pump, coupled to an Orbitrap ASCEND mass spectrometer from Thermo Scientific. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase chromatography using solvent A (0.1 % formic acid in water) and solvent B (80 % acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid in water) across a 70-min gradient. Spectra were recorded in positive ion data-dependent acquisition mode, with fragmentation of the 20 most abundant ions within each duty cycle. MS1 spectra were recorded with a resolution of 120,000 and an AGC target of 2e5. MS2 spectra were recorded with a resolution of 30,000 and an AGC target of 2e5.

<title>Application of DuSTER for Cryo-EM analysis of interphase-specific H1.8-GFP containing complex isolated by MagIC-cryo-EM beads (used in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>)</title>
<p>The pipeline to generate the initial 3D model is described in <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>. Movie frames are motion-corrected and dose-weighted patch motion correction in CryoSPARC v4 with output Fourier cropping factor 1/2<sup>33</sup>. To remove low S/N ratio particles that are not reproducibly recentered during 2D classification, through DuSTER, particles picking with Topaz v0.2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> were repeated twice to assign two picked points for each protein particle on micrographs. Training of Topaz was performed individually for each picked particle set using the same approximately 2000 manually picked particles as training models. The particles in these two picked particle sets were then extracted using CryoSPARC v4 (extraction box size = 185.8 Å) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. These two extracted particle sets were individually applied to 2D classification in CryoSPARC v4 (600 classes). These 2D classifications did not generate any reasonable 2D classes of interphase-specific H1.8-GFP containing complex that was expected from the particle images on the original motion-corrected micrographs. The reproducibility of the particles recentering can be assessed by the <italic>D</italic>. Smaller value of <italic>D</italic> indicates that two pick points on each particle are reproducibly recentered during 2D classification. To remove duplicate particles at closed distances, we used this tool to keep the recentered points whose <italic>D</italic> are shorter than <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub>. The DuSTER curation can be achieved by using the ‘Remove Duplicate Particles’ tool in CryoSPARC. Although the tool was originally designed to remove duplicate particles at closed distances, we used this tool to keep the recentered points whose <italic>D</italic> are shorter than <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub>. All particles from two individual particle sets after the 2D classification were applied to the ‘Remove Duplicate Particles’ tool in CryoSPARC v4 using the ‘Remove Duplicates Entirely’ option (Minimum separation distance: 20Å). Although the tool was originally designed to remove duplicate particles at closed distances, we used this tool to keep the recentered points whose <italic>D</italic> are shorter than <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub>. The particles whose recentered points whose <italic>D</italic> are shorter than <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>TH</italic></sub> and were the particles used in further downstream processing, were sorted as ‘rejected particles’. These particles were applied to the Particle Sets Tool in CryoSPARC v4 to split them into two individual particle sets. 2D DuSTER, including particle re-centering, particle extraction, and particle splitting steps, was repeated seven times. After seven rounds of 2D DuSTER, the particles were manually curated by removing the 2D classes with unreasonable sizes or shapes for the interphase-specific H1.8-GFP containing complex. The 2D images of removed classes are shown in <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>. After manual curation, the particles were further cleaned by an additional four rounds of 2D DuSTER. The particles were further cleaned by the Class Probability Filtering Tool in CryoSPARC v4. 2D classification was performed twice for one of the cleaned particle sets. The particles whose 2D class probability scores were lower than 0.3 in both replicates of 2D classification were removed. The redundant 2D classifications were necessary to prevent unintentional loss of high S/N particles.The duplicated class probability filtering was repeated six times. Using the filtered particles, 2D classification was performed twice. The high-resolution classes with reasonable protein-like features were manually selected from both 2D classification results. To prevent unintentional contamination of low S/N particles, the 92,382 particles that were selected in both 2D classification runs were used for ab initio 3D reconstruction (C5 symmetry applied). The 3D structure was highly similar to NPM2, and we were convinced that the interphase-specific H1.8-GFP containing complex is NPM2-H1.8-GFP complex.</p>
<p>The pipeline for the particle cleaning using 3D DuSTER is described in <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>. After seven rounds of 2D DuSTER for the particles picked by Topaz, decoy 3D classification was employed to remove nucleosomes and GFP complexed with GFP-nanobody. The nucleosome 3D model was generated by ab initio 3D reconstruction using the particles assigned to nucleosome-like 2D classes. The 3D model of GFP complexed with GFP-nanobody was modeled from the crystal structure of the complex (PDB ID: 3k1k) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> using EMAN2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. Noise 3D models were generated by ab initio 3D reconstruction using the low S/N particles that were removed during 2D DuSTER. Using these models and the initial 3D model of NPM2-H1.8-GFP, heterogeneous 3D refinement was performed twice in CryoSPARC v4. To prevent unintentional loss of high S/N particles, particles that were assigned to the nucleosome and GFP complexed with GFP-nanobody class in both heterogeneous 3D refinement results were removed. By using the Remove Duplicate Particles and Particle Sets tools in CryoSPARC v4, the particles in picked particle set 2 that corresponded to the particles cleaned by decoy classification were selected. Using both picked particle sets, heterogeneous 3D refinement of CryoSPARC v4 was performed individually. Using the same procedure as 2D DuSTER, the particles that were reproducibly centered in each particle set were selected (Minimum separation distance: 15 Å). 3D DuSTER was repeated six times. To conduct 3D DuSTER more comprehensively, 3D refinements were performed for each picked particle set three times. Particle curation based on the distance was performed for all nine combinations of these 3D refinement results, and this comprehensive 3D DuSTER was repeated once again. Using the particles in picked particle set 1 after 3D DuSTER, 2D classification was performed twice. The noise classes were manually selected from both 2D classification results. To prevent unintentional loss of high S/N particles, particles that were assigned to the noise class in both 2D classification runs were removed. This duplicated 2D classification and manual selection was repeated twice. During the 2D classification, 2D classes that represent GFP-nanobody were found. To remove the particles, duplicated decoy 3D classification was employed once again. The remaining 162,995 particles were used for the 3D structure reconstruction. The pipeline for 3D structure reconstruction using the particle curated by 3D DuSTER is described in <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10</xref>. Using the 162,995 particles after the 3D DuSTER, <italic>ab initio</italic> 3D reconstruction (5 classes, C5) was performed five times. The particles assigned to the NPM2-like classes were selected. To prevent unintentional loss of high S/N particles, particles that were assigned to the noise class in all five <italic>ab initio</italic> 3D reconstruction runs were removed. For the ‘averaged’ NPM2 structure, a single 3D map was built by ab initio 3D reconstruction (1 class, C5) using the remaining 92,428 particles. The 3D map was refined by local refinement using the particles after symmetry expansion. For the structural variants of the NPM2, particles were split into the 2 classes by ab initio 3D reconstruction (2 class, C5). The ab initio 3D reconstruction (3 class, C5) was performed again for each class, and the particles were manually split into the 3 groups to generate ‘open,’ ‘half-open,’ and ‘closed’ NPM2 structures. The initial atomic model of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> NPM2 pentamer was built by ColabFold v1.5.5, which implements AlphaFold2 and MMseqs2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. The full-length <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> NPM2 pentamer structure was docked on the cryo-EM maps by the Dock-in-map tool in Phenix v1.21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>.

The refined models were further refined using the real-space refinement in Phenix v1.21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For reconstituting the 3D maps without applying symmetry, the particles used for reconstituting ‘open,’ ‘half-open,’ and ‘closed’ NPM2 structures were applied to the manual picking tool in cryoSPARC to remove the 3D alignment information attached to the particle images.

Initial 2D classification based on particles picked by Topaz generated only noise 2D classes (outlined with blue in the top panel) beside obvious nucleosome classes (outlined with orange in the top). Although 2D classes seem noisy, many of the original pick points marked apparent protein particles on the original motion-corrected micrograph (bottom). This suggests that these particle images were not properly aligned during 2D classification due to the low S/N of these particles. Uneven background noises were likely generated by uneven ice thickness, graphene and the SAH spacer proteins on MagIC-cryo-EM beads. <bold>(B)</bold> Graphical presentation of how noise 2D classes were generated.

<p>The sucrose gradient fraction enriched with interphase-specific GFP-H1.8 containing complex (fraction 4 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) was isolated and analyzed by MagIC-cryo-EM. The initial particle locations assigned by particle picking software are updated during 2D to align the multiple images on a 2D map and place the reconstituted 2D map at the center of the reconstituted 2D space. To assess the reproducibility of particle centering during 2D classification, particle picking was repeated and subjected to the 2D classification individually. Particle images were sorted based on the distance <italic>D</italic> between a recentered picked point from the first picking set and another re-centered picked point from the second picking set. The sorted particle images were again applied to 2D classification. Particle images with <italic>D</italic> &gt; 20 Å, which were not reproducibly recentered, generated noise 2D classes.

<p>This study follows up on Arimura et al's powerful new method MagIC-Cryo-EM for imaging native complexes at high resolution.

Overall this is an <bold>important</bold> new tool in the arsenal of single molecule biologists, permitting a deep dive into structure of native complexes. This work will be of high interest to a broad swathe of scientists studying native macromolecules present at low concentrations in cells.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Arimura et al describe MagIC-Cryo-EM, an innovative method for immune-selective concentrating of native molecules and macromolecular complexes for Cryo-EM imaging and single-particle analysis. Typically, Cryo-EM imaging requires much larger concentrations of biomolecules than that are feasible to achieve by conventional biochemical fractionation. Overall, this manuscript is meticulously and clearly written and may become a great asset to other electron microscopists and chromatin researchers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Previously, Arimura et al. (Mol. Cell 2021) isolated from Xenopus extract and resolved by Cryo-EM a sub-class of native nucleosomes conjugated containing histone H1.8 at the on-dyad position, similar to that previously observed by other researchers with reconstituted nucleosomes. Here they sought to analyze immuno-selected nucleosomes aiming to observe specific modes of H1.8 positioning (e.g. on-dyad and off-dyad) and potentially reveal structural motifs responsible for the decreased affinity of H1.8 for the interphase chromatin compared to metaphase chromosomes. The main strength of this work is a clever and novel methodological design, in particular the engineered protein spacers to separate captured nucleosomes from streptavidin beads for a clear imaging. The authors provide a detailed step-by-step description of MagIC-Cryo-EM procedure including nucleosome isolation, preparation of GFP nanobody attached magnetic beads, optimization of the spacer length, concentration of the nucleosomes on graphene grids, data collection and analysis, including their new DUSTER method to filter-out low signal particles. This tour de force methodology should facilitate considering of MagIC-Cryo-EM by other electron microscopists especially for analysis of native nucleosome complexes.</p>
<p>
In pursue of biologically important new structures, the immune-selected H1.8-containing nucleosomes were solved at about 4A resolution; their structure appears to be very similar to the previously determined structure of H1.8-reconstituted nucleosomes. There were no apparent differences between the metaphase and interphase complexes suggesting that the on-dyad and off-dyad positioning does not explain the differences in H1.8 - nucleosome binding. However, they were able to identify and solve complexes of H1.8-GFP with histone chaperone NPM2 in a closed and open conformation providing mechanistic insights for H1-NPM2 binding and the reduced affinity of H1.8 to interphase chromatin as compared to metaphase chromosomes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Still, I feel that there are certain limitations and potential artifacts resulting from formaldehyde fixation, use of bacterial-expressed recombinant H1.8-GFP, and potential effects of magnetic beads and/or spacer on protein structure, that should be more explicitly discussed. Also, the GFP-pulled down H1.8 nucleosomes should be better characterized biochemically to determine the actual linker DNA lengths (which are known to have a strong effect of linker histone affinity) and presence or absence of other factors such as HMG proteins that may compete with linker histones and cause the multiplicity of nucleosome structural classes (such as shown on Fig. 3F) for which the association with H1.8 is uncertain.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present a straightforward and convincing demonstration of a reagent and workflow that they collectively term &quot;MagIC-cryo-EM&quot;, in which magnetic nanobeads combined with affinity linkers are used to specifically immobilize and locally concentrate complexes that contain a protein-of-interest. As a proof of concept, they localize, image, and reconstruct H1.8-bound nucleosomes reconstructed from frog egg extracts. The authors additionally devised an image-processing workflow termed &quot;DuSTER&quot;, which increases the true positive detections of the partially ordered NPM2 complex. The analysis of the NPM2 complex {plus minus} H1.8 was challenging because only ~60 kDa of protein mass was ordered. Overall, single-particle cryo-EM practitioners should find this study useful.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The rationale is very logical and the data are convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: I have seen an earlier version of this study at a conference. The conference presentation was much easier to follow than the current manuscript. It is as if this manuscript had undergone review at another journal and includes additional experiments to satisfy previous reviewers. Specifically, the NPM2 results don't seem to add much to the main story (MagIC-cryo-EM), and read more like an addendum. The authors could probably publish the NPM2 results separately, which would make the core MagIC results (sans DusTER) easier to read.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Arimura et al report a new method, termed MagIC-Cryo-EM, which refers to the method of using magnetic beads to capture specific proteins out of a lysate via, followed immunoprecipitation and deposition on EM grids. The so-enriched proteins can be analzyed structurally. Importantly, the nanoparticles are further functionalized with protein-based spacers, to avoid a distorted halo around the particles. This is a very elegant approach and allows the resolution of the stucture of small amounts of native proteins at atomistic resolution.</p>
<p>
Here, the authors apply this method to study the chromatosome formation from nucleosomes and the oocyte-specific linker histone H1.8. This allows them to resolve H1.8-containing chromatomosomes from oocyte extract in both interphase and metaphase conditions at 4.3 A resolution, which reveal a common structure with H1 placed right at the dyad and contacting both entry-and exit linker DNA.</p>
<p>
They then investigate the origin of H1.8 loss during interphase. They identify a non-nucleosomal H1.8-containing complex from interphase preparations. To resolve its structure, the authors develop a protocol (DuSTER) to exclude particles with ambiguous center, revealing particles with five-fold symmetry, that matches the chaperone NPM2. MS and WB confirms that the protein is present in interphase samples but not metaphase. The authors further separate two isoforms, an open and closed form that coexist. Additional densities in the open form suggest that this might be bound H1.8.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Together this is an important addition to the suite of cryoEM methods, with broad applications. The authors demonstrate the method using interesting applications, showing that the methods work and they can get high resolution structures from nucleosomes in complex with H1 from native environments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The structures of the NPM2 chaperone is less well resolved, and some of the interpretation in this part seems only weakly justified.</p>
