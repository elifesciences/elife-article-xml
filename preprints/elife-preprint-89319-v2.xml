<title>Abstract</title><p>During tuberculosis, migration of dendritic cells (DCs) from the site of infection to the draining lymph nodes is known to be impaired, hindering the rapid development of protective T-cell mediated immunity. However, the mechanisms involved in the delayed migration of DCs during TB are still poorly defined. Here, we found that infection of DCs with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> triggers HIF-1α-mediated aerobic glycolysis in a TLR2-dependent manner, and that this metabolic profile is essential for DC migration. In particular, the glycolysis inhibitor oxamate and the HIF-1α inhibitor PX-478 abrogated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced DC migration <italic>in vitro</italic> to the lymphoid tissue-specific chemokine CCL21, and <italic>in vivo</italic> to lymph nodes in mice. Strikingly, we found that although monocytes from TB patients are inherently biased toward glycolysis metabolism, they differentiate into poorly glycolytic and poorly migratory DCs, compared with healthy subjects. Taken together, these data suggest that because of their preexisting glycolytic state, circulating monocytes from TB patients are refractory to differentiation into migratory DCs, which may explain the delayed migration of these cells during the disease and opens avenues for host-directed therapies for TB.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health problem, responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths annually. The causative agent of TB, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), is a highly successful pathogen that has evolved several strategies to weaken the host immune response. Although reliable immune correlates of protective immunity against Mtb are still not well-defined, it is widely accepted that Th1 cells contribute to protection by secreting IFN-γ and promoting antimycobacterial activity in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Importantly, the induction of a strong Th1 immune response relies on the generation of immunogenic dendritic cells (DCs) with strong migratory properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Mtb has been shown to interfere with several DC functions, thus impairing the induction and development of adaptive immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. For instance, we and others previously reported that Mtb-exposed DCs have low capacity for mycobacterial antigen presentation and stimulation of Mtb-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Additionally, Mtb-infected DCs were reported to have an impaired ability to migrate to lymph nodes <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in murine models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of these phenotypes and their relevance to the migratory activity of monocyte-derived DCs in TB patients remain unknown.</p>
<p>Rapid, directed migration of DCs towards secondary lymphoid organs requires essential changes at the cellular and molecular levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Relatedly, the metabolic state of DCs is complex and varies according to cell origin, differentiation and maturation states, as well as local microenvironment, among other factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Studies have reported that upon pathogen sensing, the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) increases glycolysis, which promotes immunogenic functions of DCs, such as IL-12 production, costimulatory marker expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. By contrast, it was shown that HIF-1α represses the proinflammatory output of LPS-stimulated DCs and can inhibit DC-induced T-cell responses in other settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To reconcile these disparate roles for HIF-1α, it has been proposed that the impact of metabolic pathway activation on DC functions varies among DC subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. To this point, most prior studies have been conducted using murine conventional DCs and plasmacytoid DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Recently, with the implementation of high-dimensional techniques, it was demonstrated that distinct metabolic wiring is associated with individual differentiation and maturation stages of DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, highlighting the importance of defining the metabolic profile of specific subsets of DCs under physiological or pathological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Given the key role of DCs in the host response to TB, it is thus crucial to investigate DC metabolism in the context of Mtb infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We previously demonstrated that the TB-associated microenvironment, as conferred by the acellular fraction of TB patient pleural effusions, inhibits HIF-1α activity leading to a reduction in glycolytic and microbicidal phenotypes in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Moreover, activation of HIF-1α enhances Mtb control at early times post-infection in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and this effect was associated with a metabolic switch of alveolar macrophages towards an M1-like profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Given that HIF-1α activation promotes protection at early stages of Mtb infection and given its role as a key regulator of DC migration and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that HIF-1α could affect the functionality of DCs in regulating the initiation and orchestration of the adaptive immune response to Mtb, a process known to be delayed upon Mtb infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Here, we show that HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis promotes DC activation and migration in the context of TB. Importantly, we report active glycolysis in monocytes from TB patients, which leads to poor glycolytic induction and migratory capacities of monocyte-derived DCs.</p>

<title>Mtb impacts metabolism in human monocyte-derived DCs</title>
<p>To determine the impact of Mtb on the metabolism of human monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs), we assessed metabolic parameters associated with glycolysis and mitochondrial changes upon Mtb stimulation or infection. Cells undergoing aerobic glycolysis are characterized by increased consumption of glucose and the production and release of lactate. We measured lactate release and glucose consumption in Mo-DCs stimulated for 24 h with equivalent doses of either irradiated (iMtb) or viable Mtb. DCs treated with either iMtb or viable Mtb released increased levels of lactate and consumed more glucose than untreated DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref></bold>). Consistently, both iMtb treatment and Mtb infection resulted in an increase in expression of the key glycolysis-activating regulator HIF-1α at both mRNA and protein levels (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref></bold>). Expression of the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A (<italic>LDHA</italic>), which catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, was also increased in iMtb-treated or Mtb-infected DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). In agreement with their enhanced glycolysis profile, DCs stimulated with iMtb or infected with viable Mtb had increased expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 (SLC2A1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>)</bold>. Of note, <italic>LDHA</italic> and <italic>GLUT1</italic> are HIF-1α target genes, and their upregulation correlated with the increase in HIF-1α expression upon Mtb stimulation. To assess changes in the mitochondria, we measured mitochondrial mass and morphology. We found a higher mitochondrial mass as well as larger individual mitochondria in iMtb-stimulated DCs compared to untreated DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-H</xref></bold>). In contrast to the findings obtained upon iMtb stimulation, Mtb-infected DCs displayed a reduction in their mitochondrial mass (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>). This result indicates that although both Mtb-infected and irradiated Mtb-exposed DCs show a clear increase in their glycolytic activity, divergent responses are observed in terms of mitochondrial mass. Therefore, our data indicate that Mtb impacts the metabolism of Mo-DCs, leading to mitochondrial changes and triggering glycolysis-associated parameters.</p>

<title>Mtb exposure shifts DCs to a glycolytic profile over oxidative phosphorylation</title>
<p>To further characterize the metabolic profile of DCs upon iMtb-stimulation or Mtb-infection, we next evaluated the metabolism of DCs at single-cell level using the SCENITH technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. This method is based on a decrease in ATP levels that is tightly coupled with a decrease in protein synthesis and displays similar kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. By treating the cells with glucose or mitochondrial respiration inhibitors, and measuring their impact on protein synthesis by puromycin incorporation via flow cytometry, glucose and mitochondrial dependences can be quantified. Two additional derived parameters such as “glycolytic capacity” and “fatty acid and amino acid oxidation (FAO &amp; AAO) capacity” were also calculated. SCENITH technology revealed a lower reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in parallel with an increase in the glycolytic capacity of iMtb-stimulated (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>),</bold> Mtb-infected DCs and even bystander DCs. (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-B</xref></bold>). No differences were observed for glucose dependence and FAO &amp; AAO capacity (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref></bold>). Additionally, we found no changes between the FAO dependency in Mtb-stimulated DCs in comparison to control cells when the FAO inhibitor (etomoxir) was used (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>). For the case of iMtb-stimulated DCs, we also assessed the intracellular rates of glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP production using Seahorse technology. Bioenergetic profiles revealed that iMtb increased the rate of protons extruded over time, or proton efflux rate (PER), as well as the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in Mo-DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). The measurements of basal extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and OCR were used to calculate ATP production rate from glycolysis (GlycoATP) and mitochondrial OXPHOS (MitoATP). The ATP production rates from both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration were augmented upon iMtb-stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). Similar to SCENITH results, the relative contribution of GlycoATP to overall ATP production was increased, while MitoATP contribution was decreased in iMtb-treated cells compared to untreated cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). These results confirmed the change in DC metabolism induced by Mtb, with an increase in the relative glycolytic contribution to overall metabolism at the expense of the OXPHOS pathway. Together, metabolic profiling indicates that a metabolic switch toward aerobic glycolysis occurs in Mo-DCs exposed to Mtb.</p>

<title>Mtb triggers the glycolytic pathway through TLR2 ligation</title>
<p>Since Mtb is sensed by Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and -4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, we investigated the contribution of these receptors to glycolysis activation in Mo-DCs upon Mtb stimulation. Using specific neutralizing antibodies for these receptors, we found that TLR2 ligation, but not that of TLR4, was required to trigger the glycolytic pathway, as reflected by a decrease in lactate release, glucose consumption and HIF-1α expression in iMtb-stimulated DCs treated with an anti-TLR2 antibody (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref></bold>). As a control, and as expected given the reliance on TLR4 for LPS sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, lactate release and glucose consumption were abolished in LPS-stimulated DCs in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against TLR4 but not TLR2 (<bold>Figure S2A-B</bold>). Moreover, blockade of TLR2 also diminished glycolytic ATP production in iMtb-stimulated DCs without altering OXPHOS-associated ATP production (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>) or the size and morphology of mitochondria (<bold>Figure S2C</bold>), suggesting that TLR2 engagement by iMtb is required for the induction of glycolysis but not mitochondrial respiration. Interestingly, TLR2 ligation was also necessary for lactate release triggered by viable Mtb, (<bold>Figure S2D</bold>). To further confirm the involvement of TLR2 in the induction of glycolysis, we tested the effect of synthetic (Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK<sub>4</sub>) or mycobacterial (peptidoglycans, PTG) TLR2 agonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and found that both ligands induced lactate release and glucose consumption in DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref></bold>), without affecting cell viability (<bold>Figure S2E</bold>).

<title>HIF-1<bold>α</bold> is required for DC maturation upon iMtb stimulation but not for CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte polarization</title>
<p>To determine the impact of glycolysis on DC maturation and the capacity to activate T cells, we inhibited HIF-1α activity in iMtb-stimulated DCs employing two HIF-1α inhibitors that display different mechanisms of action. The first is PX-478 (PX) that lowers HIF-1α levels by inhibiting HIF-1α deubiquitination, decreases HIF-1α mRNA expression, and reduces HIF-1α translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>; the second one is echinomycin (Ech), which inhibits the binding of HIF-1α to the hypoxia response element thereby blocking HIF-1α DNA binding capability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Treatment with either HIF-1α inhibitor PX or Ech diminished lactate release and glucose consumption in iMtb-stimulated DCs without affecting cell viability at the indicated concentration (<bold>Figure S3A-F</bold>). HIF-1α inhibition by PX significantly abolished ATP production associated with glycolysis without affecting absolute levels of OXPHOS-derived ATP production in iMtb-stimulated DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and Figure S3G</bold>). In line with these results, the glycolytic capacity was reduced in iMtb-stimulated DCs treated with Ech (<bold>Figure S3H)</bold>. Although HIF-1α inhibitors did not affect the uptake of iMtb by DCs (<bold>Figure S3I</bold>), we observed a reduction in the expression of activation markers CD83 and CD86, but not in the inhibitory molecule PD-L1, upon treatment with PX (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>) or Ech (<bold>Figure S4</bold>). We then measured cytokine production in iMtb-stimulated DCs after HIF-1α inhibition and noted a reduction in TNF-α and an increase in IL-10 production by PX-treated cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). To assess the capacity of DCs to activate T cells in response to mycobacterial antigens, we co-cultured DCs and autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from PPD<sup>+</sup> donors in the presence or absence of HIF-1α inhibitors and measured the overall IFN-γ and IL-17 production in culture supernatants as well as cell surface expression of T cell markers. We found no significant differences in the activation profile of autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in coculture with iMtb-stimulated DCs treated or not with PX (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref> and Figure S5</bold>).

<title>HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis triggers the motility of DCs upon iMtb stimulation</title>
<p>Since DC migration to lymph nodes is essential to initiate an adaptive immune response and glycolytic activity has been reported to control DC migration upon stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we evaluated the migratory properties of iMtb-stimulated DCs in the presence of inhibitors of HIF-1α and glycolysis. First, we confirmed that PX and oxamate (OX), a well-established glycolysis inhibitor, diminished the glycolytic activity of iMtb-stimulated human Mo-DCs, as demonstrated by reduced lactate release (<bold>Figure S3A and 5A</bold>). Next, using a transwell migration assay, we found that PX and OX treatment significantly diminished the chemotactic activity of iMtb-stimulated human Mo-DCs in response to CCL21 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>), a CCR7 ligand responsible for the migration of DCs into lymphoid organs. We also assessed the 3 dimensional (3D) migration capacity of iMtb-stimulated DCs through a collagen matrix in which DCs use an amoeboid migration mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and found that 3D migration was significantly impaired upon HIF-1α or glycolysis inhibition (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). The role of glycolysis in the migration of iMtb-stimulated Mo-DCs was further confirmed using an additional glycolysis inhibitor, GSK2837808A, which reduced both the release of lactate by iMtb-stimulated Mo-DCs and their migration in response to CCL21 (<bold>Figure S6A-B</bold>). To further investigate the effects of glycolysis on cell migration, we turned to an <italic>in vivo</italic> model. Murine bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) isolated and stimulated with iMtb in the presence or absence of PX or OX were labeled with CFSE and transferred into naïve mice (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). Similar to human Mo-DCs, iMtb stimulation increased glycolysis in BMDCs, which was inhibited by PX and OX treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold>Figure S6C</bold>). Three hours after the transfer of BMDCs into recipient mice, nearby lymph nodes were collected for DC quantification (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). A higher number of adoptively transferred DCs (CFSE-labeled CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells) were detected in lymph nodes from mice that received iMtb-stimulated BMDCs compared to mice that received untreated BMDCs or iMtb-BMDCs treated with either PX or OX (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and Figure S6D</bold>). Of note, we verified that CCR7 expression on iMtb-stimulated BMDCs was not affected by OX or PX treatment, so the effect could not be ascribed to downregulation of the chemokine receptor (<bold>Figure S6E</bold>). Therefore, we conclude that HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis is required for the successful migration of iMtb-stimulated DCs into lymph nodes.</p>

<title>Stabilization of HIF-1<bold>α</bold> promotes migration of tolerogenic DCs and DCs derived from TB patient monocytes</title>
<p>Since DC differentiation is skewed, at least partially, towards a tolerogenic phenotype during TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> we investigated whether tolerogenic DCs can be reprogrammed into immunogenic DCs by modulating their glycolytic pathway after iMtb stimulation. To this end, we generated tolerogenic Mo-DCs by adding dexamethasone (Dx) before stimulation with iMtb in the presence or absence of dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), which stabilizes the expression of HIF-1α. HIF-1α expression is tightly regulated by prolyl hydroxylase domain containing proteins which facilitate the recruitment of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, leading to ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α by the proteasomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. DMOG inhibits the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins. Acquisition of the tolerogenic phenotype was confirmed by the lack of upregulation of costimulatory markers CD83 and CD86, as well as by increased PD-L1 expression in iMtb-DCs treated with Dx compared to control iMtb-DCs (<bold>Figure S7A</bold>). Moreover, Dx-treated DCs did not exhibit an increase in lactate release, consumption of glucose or induction of HIF-1α expression in response to iMtb, showing a high consumption of levels of glucose under basal conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref></bold>). Of note, HIF-1α stabilization using DMOG restored the HIF-1α expression and lactate production in response to iMtb in Dx-treated DCs and increased the consumption of glucose (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref></bold>). Activation of HIF-1α also improved 3D amoeboid migration, as well as 2D migration capacity of DCs towards CCL21 of iMtb-stimulated Dx-treated DCs (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref> and Figure S7B</bold>). Confirming the relevance of these findings to human TB patients, we found that iMtb-stimulated Mo-DCs from TB patients were deficient in their capacity to migrate towards CCL21 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>) and in glycolytic activity, compared to Mo-DCs from healthy subjects (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-G</xref></bold>). Strikingly, stabilizing HIF-1α expression using DMOG in Mo-DCs from TB patients restored their chemotactic activity in response to iMtb (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref></bold>). These data indicate that the impaired migratory capacity of iMtb-stimulated tolerogenic DCs or TB patient-derived DCs can be restored via HIF-1α stabilization; thus, glycolysis is critical for DC function during TB in both murine and human contexts.</p>

<title>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes from TB patients show increased glycolytic capacity</title>
<p>Since we observed differences in the metabolic activity of DCs derived from monocytes of TB patients when compared to healthy donors, we next focused on evaluating the release of lactate by DC precursors from both subject groups during the first hours of DC differentiation with IL-4/GM-CSF. We found a high release of lactate by monocytes from TB patients compared to healthy donors after 1 h of differentiation (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>). Lactate accumulation increased in both subject groups after 24 h with IL-4/GM-CSF (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>). Based on these differential glycolytic activities displayed by DC precursors from both subject groups at very early stages of the differentiation process, we decided to evaluate the <italic>ex vivo</italic> metabolic profile of monocytes using SCENITH. To this end, we assessed the baseline glycolytic capacity of the three main populations of monocytes: classical (CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>−</sup>), intermediate (CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>), and non-classical (CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>) monocytes. We found that both populations of CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes from TB patients had a higher glycolytic capacity than monocytes from healthy donors (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). Moreover, the glycolytic capacity of CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes (CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>) correlates with time since the onset of TB-related symptoms (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>), with no association to the extent or severity of lung disease (unilateral/bilateral lesions and with/without cavities, <bold>Figure S8</bold>). To further expand the metabolic characterisation of monocyte subsets from TB patients, we used previously published transcriptomic data (GEO accession number: GSE185372) of CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes isolated from individuals with active TB, latent TB (IGRA<sup>+</sup>), as well as from TB negative healthy controls (IGRA<sup>-</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Within this framework, we performed high-throughput GeneSet Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the BubbleMap module of BubbleGUM, which includes a multiple testing correction step to allow comparisons between the three monocyte subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. As expected, this approach reveals enrichments in genes associated with interferon responses (alpha and gamma) in patients with active TB compared to healthy donors (either IGRA<sup>-</sup> or latent TB) for all three monocyte subsets (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). Consistent with our findings, glycolysis increases in active TB in both CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes (albeit not significant), while it appears to decrease in classical CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup> monocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). Unlike CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup> cells, the inflammatory response is notably enriched in CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes from patients with active TB compared those with latent TB or healthy subjects (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>), suggesting that their glycolytic profile correlates with a higher inflammatory state. Finally, no significant enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation-associated genes was found in any of the performed comparisons (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that TB disease is associated with an increased activation and glycolytic profile of circulating CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes.</p>

<title>HIF1-<bold>α</bold> activation in CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes from TB patients leads to differentiated DCs with a poor migration capacity</title>
<p>Since circulating CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes from TB patients are highly glycolytic, we evaluated the expression of HIF1-α among the populations. We found that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes from TB patients exhibited a higher expression of HIF1-α than from healthy donors (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref></bold>). As we have previously demonstrated that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes from TB patients generate aberrant DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that the different metabolic profile of this monocyte subset could yield DCs with some sort of exhausted glycolytic capacity and thus lower migration activity upon Mtb exposure. To test this hypothesis, we treated with DMOG to increase the activity of HIF-1α during the first 24 h of monocyte differentiation from healthy donors, leading to an exacerbated increase in lactate release at early stages of the differentiation (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref></bold>). Such early addition of DMOG to healthy monocytes resulted in the generation of DCs (6 days with IL-4/GM-CSF) characterized by equivalent levels of CD1a as control DCs, with a significant decrease in the expression of DC-SIGN (<bold>Figure S9A</bold>). In terms of activation marker expression, DCs differentiated from DMOG-pretreated cells responded to iMtb by upregulating CD86 at higher levels compared to control cells, with an accompanying trend towards reduced upregulation of CD83 (<bold>Figure S9B</bold>). We also observed that DCs from DMOG pretreated-cells exhibited a lower migratory capacity in response to iMtb (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref></bold>), reminiscent of the 2D migration capacities of Mo-DCs from TB patients. Altogether, our data suggest that the activated glycolytic status of monocytes from TB patients leads to the generation of DCs with low motility in response to Mtb.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we provide evidence for the role of HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis in promoting the migratory capacity of DCs upon encounter with iMtb. Our approach to quantify the <italic>ex vivo</italic> metabolism of monocytes shows that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes from TB patients display an exacerbated glycolytic activity that may result in the generation of DCs with poor migratory capacities in response to iMtb. Our results suggest that under extensive chronic inflammatory conditions, such as those found in TB patients, circulating monocytes may be metabolically preconditioned to differentiate into DCs with low migratory potential.</p>
<p>Upon Mtb infection of naive mice, initial accumulation of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lung is delayed, occurring between 2-3 weeks post-infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. The absence of sterilizing immunity induced by TB vaccines, such as BCG, has been proposed to result from delayed activation of DCs and the resulting delay in antigen presentation and activation of vaccine-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In this context, it was demonstrated that Mtb-infected Mo-DCs recruited to the site of infection exhibit low CCR7 expression and impaired migration to lymph nodes compared to uninfected Mo-DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Additionally, Mo-DCs have been found to play a key role in transporting Mtb antigens from the lung to the draining lymph node, where conventional DCs present antigens to naive T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The migratory capacity of responding DCs is thus of paramount importance to the host response to Mtb infection.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that Mtb exposure triggers glycolysis in Mo-DCs from healthy donors, which promotes their migration capacity in a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Recently, it was shown that glycolysis was required for CCR7-triggered murine DC migration in response to LPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Glycolysis was also reported to be required for the migration of other immune cells such as macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and regulatory T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Consistently, we show that inhibition of HIF-1α-dependent glycolysis impairs human Mo-DC migration upon Mtb stimulation. The link between cellular metabolism and migratory behavior are supported by studies that have elucidated how glycolysis can be mechanically regulated by changes in the architecture of the cytoskeleton, ultimately impacting the activity of glycolytic enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. In addition, interesting links between cellular mechanics and metabolism have been previously described for DCs, highlighting the potential to alter DC mechanics to control DC trafficking and consequently T cell priming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, studies focused on the molecular mechanisms by which metabolic pathways impact the machinery responsible for cell movement in the context of TB infection will be required to better understand and design therapeutic manipulation.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that tolerogenic DCs induced by dexamethasone as well as DCs derived from TB patient monocytes exhibit lower lactate release and impaired trafficking toward CCL21 upon Mtb stimulation; both phenotypes could be rescued by stabilization of HIF-1α expression. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address how the metabolic status of monocytes from TB patients influences the migratory activity of further differentiated DCs. According to our findings, the activation status of the glycolysis/HIF-1α axis in monocytes would be a predictor of refractoriness to differentiation into migratory DCs in TB. With respect to the metabolism of tolerogenic DCs broadly, our results are consistent with reported data showing that DC tolerance can be induced by drugs promoting OXPHOS, such as vitamin D and dexamethasone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. It was interesting to note that, although migration of tolerogenic DCs did not increase upon Mtb stimulation, it was increased under basal conditions, which agrees with previous data showing a high steady-state migration capacity of putatively tolerogenic DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>It has been widely demonstrated that immune cells can switch to glycolysis following engagement of TLRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Our work showed that TLR2 ligation by either viable or irradiated Mtb was necessary to trigger glycolysis in DCs, at least at early times post-stimulation. It remains to be elucidated whether persistent interaction between DCs and Mtb might lead to an attenuation in glycolysis over time, as has been reported for macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. In this regard, our data demonstrates that chronic Mtb infection leads to monocytes bearing an exacerbated glycolytic status likely tied to prolonged and or excessive stimulation of membrane bound TLRs in circulation, which results in DCs with some sort of exhausted glycolytic capacity. Although DCs stimulated with iMtb in the presence of a HIF-1α inhibitor exhibited differences in activation markers and cytokine profile, we found that they were still able to activate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from PPD+ donors in response to iMtb. These findings complement previous evidence showing that LPS-induced mature DCs inhibit T-cell responses through HIF-1α activation in the presence of glucose, leading to greater T cell activation capacity in low glucose contexts such as at the interface between DCs and T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In this work, we did not detect an impact on T cell activation upon HIF-1α inhibition in DCs, but we observed a clear reduction in their migration capacity that may limit or delay DC encounters with T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, leading to poor T cell activation in the lymph nodes. In this regard, mouse studies have shown that DC migration directly correlates with T cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets (such as regulatory T cells), CD1-restricted T cells, and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets could be differentially activated by iMtb-stimulated DCs lacking HIF-1α activity.</p>
<p>Three different populations of human monocytes have been identified: classical (CD14<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>−</sup>), intermediate (CD14<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup>), and non-classical (CD14<sup>dim</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup>) monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. These monocyte subsets are phenotypically and functionally distinct. Classical monocytes readily extravasate into tissues in response to inflammation, where they can differentiate into macrophage-like or DC-like cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>; intermediate monocytes are well-suited for antigen presentation, cytokine secretion, and differentiation; and non-classical monocytes are involved in complement and Fc gamma-mediated phagocytosis and their main function is cell adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Unlike non-classical monocytes, the two CD14<sup>+</sup> monocyte populations are known to extravasate into tissues and thus are likely to act as precursors capable of giving rise to Mo-DCs in inflamed tissues. However, the DC differentiation capacity of the intermediate population is still not well defined. We previously demonstrated that monocytes from TB patients generate aberrant DCs, and that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes generate aberrant DCs upon treatment with GM-CSF and IL-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrated that glycolysis seems to play a dual role during DC differentiation from monocytes, on the one side, being required for fully differentiated-DC migration to lymph nodes in response to Mtb and, on the other side, leading to DCs with poor iMtb-responsive migratory capacity if activated during the onset of DC differentiation. In this regard, DCs from healthy subjects respond to iMtb by inducing a glycolytic and migratory profile, while monocytes isolated from TB patients exhibit an unusual early glycolytic state that results in the ulterior generation of DCs with low glycolytic and migratory activities in response to Mtb. Similarly, we found that CD16<sup>+</sup> cells from TB patients display an activated glycolytic status, as well as elevated HIF-1α expression levels compared to their healthy counterparts. Additionally, we showed that monocytes from TB patients are not only enriched in CD16<sup>+</sup> cells, but also display an altered chemokine receptor expression profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, demonstrating that both phenotype and function of a given monocyte subset may differ under pathological conditions. While it is difficult to determine whether the heightened glycolytic profile of monocytes may limit their differentiation into DCs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we provided evidence that an increase in HIF1α-mediated glycolysis in precursors leads to the generation of cells with poor ability to migrate in response to CCL21 <italic>in vitro.</italic> In line with this observation, a recent study revealed a significant increase in the glycolytic capacity occurs during the first 24 h of monocyte differentiation towards a tolerogenic DC phenotype, as induced by vitamin D3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, highlighting the detrimental role of an early activated inflammatory profile in DC precursors. A possible explanation for these effects may be found in lactate accumulation in monocytes during DC differentiation. Lactate signaling in immune cells leads to metabolic alterations in DCs that program them to a regulatory state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, and lactate has also been shown to suppress DC differentiation and maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>; thus, excessive precursor glycolytic activity may result in DCs biased toward regulatory functions.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data provide novel insights into the immunometabolic pathways involved in the trafficking of DCs to the lymph nodes, which may be targetable to generate sterilizing vaccine-induced immunity against TB. To this end, we propose that the development of tools aiming to improve the migratory capacity of DCs by fostering their HIF-1α-mediated glycolytic activity may increase the effectiveness of preventive strategies for TB, especially given that the number of DCs to reach the lymph node was shown to be a critical parameter for the outcome of DC-based vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Understanding how Mtb rewires the innate immune response at the early stages is crucial for the design of preventive and therapeutic vaccines, as well as novel therapies and disease biomarkers.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study tests the hypothesis that Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection increases glycolysis in monocytes, which alters their capacity to migrate to lymph nodes as monocyte-derived dendritic cells. The authors conclude that infected monocytes are metabolically pre-conditioned to differentiate, with reduced expression of Hif1a and a glycolytically exhaustive phenotype, resulting in low migratory and immunologic potential. However, the evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold> as the use of live and dead mycobacteria still limits the ability to draw firm conclusions. The study will be of interest to microbiologists and infectious disease scientists.</p>

<p>In the revised manuscript by Maio et al, the authors examined the bioenergetic mechanisms involved in the delayed migration of DC's during Mtb infection. The authors performed a series of in vitro infection experiments including bioenergetic experiments using the Agilent Seahorse XF, and glucose uptake and lactate production experiments. Also, data from SCENITH is included in the revised manuscript as well as some clinical data. This is a well written manuscript and addresses an important question in the TB field. A remaining weakness is the use of dead (irradiated) Mtb in several of the new experiments and claims where iMtb data were used to support live Mtb data. Another notable weakness lies in the author's insistence on asserting that lactate is the ultimate product of glycolysis, rather than acknowledging a large body of historical data in support of pyruvate's role in the process. This raises a perplexing issue highlighted by the authors: if Mtb indeed upregulates glycolysis, one would expect that inhibiting glycolysis would effectively control TB. However, the reality contradicts this expectation. Lastly, the examination of the bioenergetics of cells isolated from TB patients undergoing drug therapy, rather than studying them at their baseline state is a weakness.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Firstly, the authors place a great deal of emphasis on the impact of the Hif1-a inhibitor PX-478. The literature surrounding this inhibitor and its mode of action indicates that it is not a direct inhibitor of activity but that its greatest impact is on the production of Hif1-a. The authors do include another inhibitor as a control, Echinomycin, but it does not appear to be as biologically active and the panel of experiments conducted with this is extremely limited. I would be more comfortable with a full Seahorse experimental panel for Echinomycin, similar to SFig 2.G as performed with PX-478.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment highlighting the different mechanisms of action of the HIF-1α inhibitors used in this article. While echinomycin inhibits the binding of HIF-1α to the hypoxia response element (HRE) thereby blocking HIF-1a DNA binding capability, PX-478 inhibits HIF-1α deubiquitination, decreases HIF-1α mRNA expression, and reduces HIF-1α translation. We have included a paragraph explaining this phenomenon in the new version of the manuscript (page 9). In addition, we extended the panel of experiments performed with echinomycin, which confirmed a marked inhibition of the glycolytic pathway when DCs were stimulated with irradiated Mtb in the presence of echinomycin as assessed by SCENITH (new Figure S3H).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, it would be of value to have Seahorse profiling that directly excludes FAO from the metabolic profile through the use of Etomoxir as an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, which one would assume would have no impact on the metabolic response.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In order to estimate the contribution of FAO towards fueling protein synthesis in DCs stimulated with iMtb, the FAO inhibitor etomoxir was incorporated to the SCENITH method as previously described (Adamik et al., 2022). Overall, FAO dependence was found to be less than 10% in DCs, regardless of their activation state. While mitochondrial dependence is reduced after iMtb stimulation, there is no difference in FAO dependence, suggesting that OXPHOS is primarily driven by glucose in iMtb-stimulated cells. This is consistent with HIF1α-induced increase of glucose metabolism-related genes. We have adjusted the results section to include this new result (new Figure S1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Aside from these minor points, I believe this to be a rigorous study.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the authors conclude that Mtb rewires the metabolism of Mo-DCs and induces both glycolysis and OXPHOS. The data shows that infection with iMtb or Mtb increases glucose uptake and lactate release, suggesting an increase in glycolysis. However, an increase in lactate is not a measure of glycolysis. Lactate is a byproduct of glycolysis; the end product of glycolysis is pyruvate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewer's comment, as it gives us the opportunity to explain the conceptual framework on which we based our study. Traditionally, pyruvate has been considered to be the end product of glycolysis when oxygen is present and lactate the end product under hypoxic conditions. Numerous studies have shown that lactate is produced even under aerobic conditions (Brooks, 2018). Therefore, we frame this work in accordance with this view that states that glycolysis begins with glucose as its substrate and terminates with the production of lactate as its main end product (Rogatzki, Ferguson, Goodwin, &amp; Gladden, 2015; Schurr, 2023; Schurr &amp; Schurr, 2017).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Secondly, since the authors have access to the Agilent Extracellular Flux Analyzer, they should have performed detailed ECAR/OCR measurements to conclusively demonstrate that both glycolysis and OXPHOS are increased in Mo. This is especially important for OXPHOS because the only readout shown for OXPHOS is an increase in mitochondrial mass (figure 1 G, H), which is not acceptable. Overall, the data does not indicate that Mtb triggers OXPHOS in the dendritic cells. It only indicates dead iMtb increases the mass of mitochondria in DCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer’s advice is well appreciated. However, we would like to clarify what may be a misunderstanding; that is, the assays alluded to by the reviewer were not performed on monocytes but on DCs. As advised by the reviewer, we now include the OCR measurements by Seahorse and describe the figures according to their order of appearance in the new version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>What happens to the mitochondrial mass when infected with live Mtb?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to the reviewer’s question, we determined the mitochondrial mass in infected DCs with live Mtb. In contrast to DCs treated with irradiated Mtb, those infected with live bacteria showed a clear reduction of their mitochondrial mass (modified Figure 1G). This result indicates that, although both Mtb-infected and irradiated Mtb-exposed DCs show a clear increase in their glycolytic activity, divergent responses are observed in terms of mitochondrial mass.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It will be best if the authors indicate in the figure headings that dead Mtb was used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. For figures 1-3, we applied the term “Mtb” in the figure headings since both irradiated and viable bacteria were used for the corresponding experiments. In figures 4-5, the term “iMtb” (alluding to irradiated Mtb) was used in the figure headings as suggested by the reviewer. For the remaining figures, the term “iMtb” was indicated in their legends when dead bacteria weres used to stimulate DCs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>E.g., Figure 1F; what does live Mtb do to GLUT1 levels etc etc?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to the reviewer’s question, we included new data about Glut1 expression in DCs infected with live Mtb in the latest version of the manuscript. In line with the increase in glucose uptake shown in figure 1B, we observed an increase in the percentage of Glut1 positive DCs upon Mtb infection (new Figure 1F, lower panels). The increase in Glut1 expression strengthens the notion that DCs activates their glycolytic activity in response to the infection, as demonstrated by the elevated release of lactate, glucose consumption, HIF-1α expression, LDHA expression (Figure 1) and glycolytic activity (Figure 2, SCENITH results with viable Mtb). Therefore, these data strongly support the induction of glycolysis by Mtb (either viable or irradiated) in DCs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, we found that they were still able to activate CD4+ T cells from PPD+ donors in response to iMtb. This activation of CD4 T cells with iMtb in the presence of a HIF-1alpha inhibitor is expected, as iMtb is dead and not virulent. What happens when the cells are infected with live virulent Mtb?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify the main purpose of the DC-T cells co-culture assays in the presence of the HIF-1α inhibitors. To characterize the impact of HIF-1α on DC functionality, we assessed the capacity of DCs to activate autologous CD4+ T cells when stimulated with iMtb in the presence of HIF-1α inhibitors. To this end, we used iMtb merely as a source of antigens to load DCs and evaluate the effect of HIF-1α inhibition on the activation of antigen-specific T cell. The use of viable Mtb may introduce confounding factors, such as pathogen-triggered inhibitory mechanisms (e.g., EsxH secretion by Mtb, (Portal-Celhay et al., 2016)), which would prevent us from reaching conclusions about the role of HIF-1α. Thus, we consider that the use of live bacteria for this experiment is out of the scope of this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors demonstrated that CD16+ monocytes from TB patients have higher glycolytic capacity than healthy controls Fig 7. The authors should differentiate TB patient monocytes into DCs and measure their bioenergetics to test if infection alters their glycolysis and OXPHOS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In agreement with the reviewer, the determination of metabolic pathways in DCs differentiated from monocytes of TB patients is a key aspect of this work. Accordingly, the bioenergetic determinations of DCs generated from monocytes from TB patients versus healthy subjects are now illustrated in Figures 6F (lactate release) and 6G (SCENITH profile).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the discussion, the authors state that &quot;pathologically active glycolysis in monocytes from TB patients leads to poor glycolytic induction and migratory capacities of monocyte-derived DCs.&quot; However, the data from Fig. 1 and 2 show that treatment with iMtb or Mtb induces glycolysis in MoDCs. How do the authors explain these contrasting results?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. Figures 1 and 2 show DCs differentiated from monocytes of healthy donors (HS). In this case, DCs from HS respond to Mtb by inducing a glycolytic and migratory profile. Yet, in the case of monocytes isolated from TB patients, these cells exhibit an early glycolytic profile from the beginning of differentiation, ultimately yielding DCs with low glycolytic capacity and low migratory activity in response to Mtb. We included this explanation in the discussion (page 18) to better clarify this issue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, the term &quot;pathological&quot; active glycolysis (Introduction and Discussion) is an inappropriate term.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As requested by the reviewer, we excluded the term “pathological” to describe the phenomenon reported in this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lastly, it should be shown whether the DCs generated from CD16+ monocyte from TB patients generate tolerogenic and/or aberrant DCs, which have lower glycolytic and migration capacity compared to the CD16- monocyte population. In Figure 7B, the authors should discuss why the CD16+ monocyte population has lower glycolytic capacity compared to CD16- monocytes in healthy donors. Furthermore, in contrast to the TB patients, do DCs generated from CD16+ monocyte in healthy donors have increased glycolytic and migration capacity compared to CD16- monocyte (because these monocytes showed lower glycolytic capacity)? Furthermore, if there is no difference in glycolytic capacity among the three monocyte populations in TB patients, on what basis was it concluded that DCs generated only from the CD16+ monocyte population may be the cause of lower migration capacity? The authors state in Figure 7F that the DMOG pretreatment matches the situation where the Mo-DCs from TB patients showed reduced migration. Did the authors check the Hif-1alpha levels in monocytes obtained from TB patients?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this in-depth analysis by the reviewer because it allows us to clarify some interpretations of the SCENITH results in Figure 7B. It is important to keep in mind that with the SCENITH technique we can only infer about the relative contributions between the metabolic pathways, without alluding to the absolute magnitudes of such contributions. In this regard, it is key to note that the amount of lactate released during the first hours of the TB monocyte culture is much higher than that released by monocytes from healthy subjects (HS, Figure 7A), even when most of monocytes, which are CD14+ CD16-, have comparable glycolytic capacities between HS and TB. Another example to illustrate how to interpret SCENITH results can be found in Figure 2, where a lower mitochondrial dependence is observed in iMtb-stimulated DCs (Figure 2A), while the absolute ATP production associated to OXPHOS is indeed higher as measured by Seahorse (Figure 2D). Therefore, the glycolytic capacity is not a direct readout of the magnitude of glycolysis, but of its contribution to total metabolism. The low levels of lactate released from HS monocytes likely reflects their low activation state and low metabolic activity compared to TB monocytes. In this regard, we have previously demonstrated that monocytes from pulmonary TB patients display an activated phenotype (Balboa et al., 2011). The fact that there is no difference between the glycolytic capacities of TB and HS CD16- monocytes indicates that their proportional contributions to protein synthesis are comparable (again, without inferring about their absolute values, which may be very different).</p>
<p>Beyond the previous clarification, the reviewer's proposal to isolate subsets of monocytes is a very interesting idea. However, the experimental approach is very difficult based on the amount of blood we can obtain from patients. The cohort of patients included in this work comprises very severe patients and we are given up to 15-20 ml of peripheral blood from each. This volume of blood yields up to 10 million PBMC with approximately 1 million monocytes. If we separate the monocyte subsets, the recovered cells per condition will be insufficient to perform the intended assays.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we incorporate new evidence that TB disease is associated with an increased activation and glycolytic profile of circulating CD16+ monocytes.</p>
<p>i)  First, we show that the baseline glycolytic capacity of CD16+ monocytes correlates with time since the onset of TB-related symptoms (new Figure 7C).</p>
<p>ii) Second, we performed high-throughput GeneSet Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on transcriptomic data (GEO accession number: GSE185372) of CD14+CD16-, CD14+CD16+ and CD14dimCD16+ monocytes isolated from individuals with active TB, latent TB (IGRA+), as well as from TB negative healthy controls (IGRA-). We found enrichments that, unlike oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis tends to increase in active TB in both CD14+CD16+ and CD14dimCD16+ monocytes (new Figure 7D).</p>
<p>iii)    We measured the expression of HIF-1α in monocyte subsets by FACS and found that this transcription factor is expressed at higher levels in CD16+ monocyte subsets from TB patients compared to their counterparts from healthy donors (new Figure 8 A). We consider this result justifies the assays shown in Figure 8B-C, in which we prematurely activated HIF-1α in healthy donor monocytes during early differentiation to DCs and measured its impact on the migration of the generated DCs.</p>

<p>In the Discussion, the authors mention that circulating monocytes from TB patients differentiate from DCs with low immunogenic potential. However, the authors have not shown any immunological defect in any of their data with monocytes from TB patients. In the proxy model mentioned in Figure 7, they have in fact shown that these preconditioned DCs have higher CD86 expression. Can the authors explain/show data to justify the statement in the first paragraph of the Discussion?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer on this observation. Our findings are limited to the generation of DCs with low migratory potential (low chemotactic activity towards CCL21 of DC differentiated from TB patient monocytes shown in figure 6H and of DC generated from pre-conditioned monocytes shown in figure 8C). We have modified that part of the discussion to better clarify this point, replacing migratory with immunogenic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should note that oxamate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and not glycolysis. Also, LDHA catalyzes the conversion from pyruvate to lactate and not the other way around (Results, page 6).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment relates to the first one by the reviewer, in which the dogma of glycolysis was discussed. According to the new conception of glycolysis, it begins with glucose as its substrate and terminates with the production of lactate as its main end product.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The following statements by the authors on page 6 are incorrect: &quot;Because irradiated and viable Mtb induced comparable activation of glycolysis, we subsequently performed all our assays with irradiated Mtb only in the rest of the study due to biosafety reasons.&quot; and: &quot;To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing the metabolic status and migratory activity of Mo-DCs from TB patients.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We deleted the first sentence and reworded the second sentence as &quot;To our knowledge, this is the first study to address how the metabolic status of monocytes from TB patients influences the migratory activity of further differentiated DCs&quot;.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The Discussion reads as if live Mtb was used in the experiments, which is not the case. This should be corrected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We changed Mtb for iMtb when it was the case in the discussion. In some cases, Mtb stimulation was used instead of Mtb infection.</p>
