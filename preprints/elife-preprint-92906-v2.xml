<title>Abstract</title><p>As the largest mucosal surface, the gut has built a physical, chemical, microbial and immune barrier to protect the body against pathogen invasion. The disturbance of gut microbiota aggravates pathogenic bacteria invasion and gut barrier injury. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for microbiome-related disorders, where beneficial strain engraftment is a significant factor influencing FMT outcomes. The aim of this research was to explore the effect of FMT on antibiotic-induced microbiome-disordered (AIMD) model infected with enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC). We used piglet, mouse and intestinal organoid models to explore the protective effects and mechanisms of FMT on ETEC infection. The results showed that FMT regulated gut microbiota and enhanced the protection of AIMD piglets against ETEC K88 challenge, as demonstrated by reduced intestinal pathogen colonization and alleviated gut barrier injury. <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> (<italic>A. muciniphila</italic>) and <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> (<italic>B. fragilis</italic>) were identified as two strains that may play key roles in FMT. We further investigated the alleviatory effects of these two strains on ETEC infection in AIMD mice model, which revealed that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> relieved ETEC-induced intestinal inflammation by maintaining the proportion of Treg/Th17 cells and epithelial damage by moderately activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while the effect of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> was better than <italic>B. fragilis</italic>. We therefore identified whether <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> protected against ETEC infection using basal-out and apical-out intestinal organoid models. <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> did protect the intestinal stem cells and stimulate proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium, and the protective effects of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> was reversed by Wnt inhibitor. FMT alleviated ETEC-induced gut barrier injury and intestinal inflammation in AIMD model. <italic>A. muciniph</italic>ila was identified as key strain in FMT to promote proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells by mediating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota and its metabolites play important roles in modulating host health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Canfora et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ghosh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). The most drastic exposure that leads to intestinal microbiota dysbiosis is antibiotic treatment, which kills commensal micro-organisms and inhibits these microbiota-mediated immune defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andremont et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buffie and Pamer, 2013</xref>). The disturbance of intestinal microbiota may lead to disruptions of gut barrier and increase the susceptibility of host to pathogenic microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Flint et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Witkowski et al., 2020</xref>). Several clinical studies have demonstrated that early-life exposure to antibiotic leads to gut microbiota dysbiosis that can impair host immune system maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">An et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the negative impact of antibiotics on gut microbiota in early life may even last for long periods throughout a lifetime, increasing the risk of gut diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">bFrancino, 2016</xref>). Enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC) K88 infection is a common cause of diarrhea in humans and animals (<italic>Dubreuil, 2021</italic>). When ETEC adheres to intestinal epithelial cells, virulence factors interact with specific receptors to induce intestinal barrier injury and intestinal inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a therapeutic intervention for reconstructing gut microbiota in gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Borody et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Colman and Rubin, 2014</xref>). Since FMT has been successful in treating <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection and maintaining gut barrier, emerging investigation has been focused on other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Quraishi et al., 2017</xref>). However, whether FMT could remedy against ETEC K88 infection in antibiotic-induced gut microbiota-disordered (AIMD) piglets is still unknown. Simultaneously, the underlying mechanism of FMT and the gut microbes that confer its efficacy remain unclear.</p>
<p>Intestinal stem cell renewal is vital for the maintenance of gut barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beumer and Clevers, 2021</xref>). Mammalian intestinal epithelial cells are renewed approximately every 3-5 days with the migration of undifferentiated intestinal cells from the crypt to the top of the villi, accompanied by the differentiation of different types of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). The proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium driven by intestinal stem cells, mainly crypt base columnar cells expressing R-Spondin receptor Lgr5, is a necessary process for repairing intestinal barrier injury to prevent pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sato et al., 2009</xref> successfully cultured isolated intestinal stem cells into three-dimensional intestinal organoids with villous and crypt-like structural morphology for the first time. Intestinal organoids contain various terminally differentiated cell types, including intestinal stem cell, tuft cell, absorptive cell, enteroendocrine cell, goblet cell, and Paneth cell, which have more advantages over single cell lines for <italic>in vitro</italic> study of intestinal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sprangers et al., 2021</xref>). Intestinal organoid is an ideal model for studying the interaction between intestinal epithelium and microorganisms in vitro, which can eliminate the complexity of animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yin et al., 2019</xref>). In traditional basal-out intestinal organoid models, the intestinal epithelium was in the interior of organoid spheroid, which restricted the interaction between intestinal epithelium and gut microbiota. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Co et al., 2019</xref> first established the intestinal organoid model with polarity reversal in human and mouse, which optimizes the shortcomings of microinjection in terms of heterogeneous exposure concentrations and durations, as well as destruction of organoid walls, and evaluated the infection effects of the invasive pathogens with different polarity-specific patterns.</p>
<p>In the present study, we first investigated the effects of FMT on ETEC K88 infection in AIMD neonatal piglets, then by using bacterial 16S rDNA sequencing analysis, we identified <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> (<italic>A. muciniphila</italic>) as potential microbe to alleviate ETEC-induced intestinal barrier injury. We further hypothesized that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> could relieve intestinal barrier injury and intestinal inflammation by modulating the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium, and verified this hypothesis using <italic>in vivo</italic> mice experiments as well as <italic>in vitro</italic> porcine intestinal organoid models. Collectively, our results may provide theoretical basis that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> is a promising method to repair intestinal barrier damage and a new strategy for the precise application of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> in livestock production.</p>

<title>Preparation of fecal microbiota suspension and bacterial strains</title>
<p>The fecal microbiota suspension was prepared according to our previous method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). In short, healthy adult Jinhua pigs that administrated medicinal feed additives or drugs for more than 3 months were selected as fecal donors. The potential risks and infectious pathogens in donor pigs were determined by serological and stool testing to ensure the safety of the porcine FMT. Fresh fecal samples that collected from Jinhua pigs were transported in AnaeroPack (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, Japan) on ice to laboratory within 2 hours. The 50 g fecal samples were homogenized in 250 mL sterile phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), filtered through sterile stainless-steel strainer, and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitate was resuspended in sterile PBS solution containing 10% sterile glycerol, and the fecal microbiota suspension was stored at -80°C. All the above preparation was performed in an anaerobic incubator (AW400SG anaerobic workstations; Electrotek, UK). All the facilities and tools for the preparation of the fecal microbiota suspension were sterilized prior to use. When processing the FMT, the fecal microbiota suspension was thawed in 37°C water bath. ETEC K88 serotype O149:K91:K88ac was purchased from the China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control (Beijing China), cultured in Luria-Bertani medium (Qingdao Hope Bio-Technology Company, China), and incubated at 37°C in a shaker with 250 rpm overnight. <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> ATCC BAA-835 and <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> (<italic>B. fragilis</italic>) ATCC 25285 were purchased from Guangdong Microbial Culture Collection Center (GDMCC, Guangzhou, China). <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> was cultured in brain heart infusion media (OXOID, Thermo Fisher Biochemicals Ltd., UK) supplemented with 0.1% mucin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). <italic>B. fragilis</italic> was cultured in trypticase soy broth (Qingdao Hope Bio-Technology Company, China) supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood (Qingdao Hope Bio-Technology Company, China). These two anaerobic bacteria strains were incubated at 37°C in an anaerobic incubator with 10% H<sub>2</sub>, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 80% N<sub>2</sub> (AW400SG anaerobic workstations; Electrotek, UK). The cultures were centrifuged for 10 min at a speed of 4000 rpm, and the pellets were then resuspended in either aerobic or anaerobic PBS.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>A total of 9 litters (9-11 piglets per litter) of Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire ternary hybrid neonatal piglets (aged 5 days) with identical birth dates and parities were obtained from Anji Lvjiayuan Animal Husbandry Co. Ltd. (Zhejiang, China). Piglets were individually housed in pens with appropriate environment of 24-26°C and 55-65% humidity. All newborn piglets were fed with artificial milk substitutes, in which the nutrients reached the requirements recommended by the National Research Council (NRC, 2012), and had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to water.</p>
<p>A total of 130 female C57BL/6 mice aged 5 weeks were obtained from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal, Co., Ltd. (SCXK (Zhejiang) 2017-0005; Shanghai, China). Mice were housed in vinyl isolators in a room with 23 ± 1°C room temperature, 55-65% humidity and 12 h/12 h light/dark schedule. All mice had free access to water and food.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>The piglets were randomly assigned to three groups (three litters per group): the control group (Con group), the ETEC K88 + PBS group (EP group) and the ETEC K88 + FMT group (EF group). The piglets in EP and EF groups were orally inoculated with 2 ml ampicillin (120 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) twice daily on day 1-3 of the experiment to disorder the intestinal resident microbiota, then orally inoculated with ETEC K88 (1 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU ml<sup>-1</sup>) suspended in 2 ml sterile PBS once daily on day 4-6 of the experiment. After ETEC K88 infection, the piglets in EF group received 1.5 ml fecal microbiota suspension once daily by oral gavage for 6 days, while the piglets in EP group received the same volume of sterile PBS. Meanwhile, the piglets in Con group were orally inoculated with the same volume of sterile PBS throughout the experiment. The doses of ampicillin and fecal microbiota suspension were based on a previous study by Ma et al. [18]. Experimental design of piglets is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. The weight of each piglet was measured at both the beginning and the end of the experiment to calculate the average daily gain (ADG), and diarrhea score (0, normal feces; 1, moist feces; 2, mild diarrhea; 3, severe diarrhea) was recorded throughout the experiment. Six piglets (2 piglets per litter) were picked from each group to be slaughtered at the end of the experiment (Day 13).</p>

<p>After acclimating for a week, mice were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 10 each): the control group (C group), the ETEC K88 + PBS group (E group), the ETEC K88 + <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> group (A group) and the ETEC K88 + <italic>B. fragilis</italic> group (B group). On day 1-3 of the experiment, the mice in E, A and B groups were orally inoculated with 0.2 ml 15 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> ampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) twice daily to disorder the gut microbiota. On day 4-6 of the experiment, the mice in E, A and B groups were infected with ETEC K88 (1 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU) suspended in 0.2 ml 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> buffer (pH 9.0) by oral gavage once daily. Mice were fasted for 12 h before infection. Meanwhile, the mice in C group were given the equal volume of sterile PBS on day 1-6 of the experiment. On day 7-13 of the experiment, live <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU) and live <italic>B. fragilis</italic> (1 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU) suspended in 0.2 ml anaerobic sterile PBS were administered intragastrically once daily to the mice in A group and B group respectively, while mice in C and E groups received the same volume of anaerobic sterile PBS. The design of mouse experiment is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. Mice were orally infused with 0.2 ml 40 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> 4 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) 4 hours before sampling. At the end of the experiment (Day 14), six mice in each group were randomly selected for ether anesthesia and neck dislocation.</p>

<title>Culture and treatment of porcine intestinal organoid</title>
<p>The cryovial of porcine intestinal organoid was kindly provided by Professor Li Xiaoliang (Institute of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China). The frozen organoids were thawed in a 37°C -water bath for 2 min, and then added 1 ml of DMEM/F-12 (Gibco, USA) with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, BioFroxx, Germany) solution. The contents of the cryovial were mixed and transferred to the 15 ml conical tube containing 2 ml of DMEM/F-12 with 1% BSA solution, and then centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The organoids were resuspended in equal volume of complete IntestiCult<sup>TM</sup> Organoid Growth Medium (06010, StemCell<sup>TM</sup> Technologies, Canada) and Matrigel Matrix (356231, Corning, USA). The 50 μl of the 500-crypt suspension was plated in the center of each well of the pre-warmed 24-well plate (3524, Corning, USA). The plate was placed at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 10 min and then added 750 μl complete IntestiCult<sup>TM</sup> Organoid Growth Medium containing 100 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, USA) to each well. The culture medium was fully exchanged three times per week. For the treatment, the frozen organoids were passaged two times after thawing.</p>
<p>For generation of apical-out organoids, the procedure of reversing the polarity of organoids was performed according to a previously published protocol by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Co et al., 2021</xref>. Briefly, after growing in Matrigel Matrix with growth medium for 7 days, the Matrigel-embedded organoids were gently dissolved with 500 μl cold 5 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in D-PBS and transferred to the 15 ml conical tube containing 10 ml of cold 5 mM EDTA. The tubes were incubated on a rotating platform at 4°C for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 200 × g for 3 min at 4°C. The organoids were resuspended in complete IntestiCult<sup>TM</sup> Organoid Growth Medium containing 100 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> penicillin/streptomycin and transferred to ultra-low attachment 24-well plate (3473, Corning, USA). The suspended organoids were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 3 days.</p>
<p>To induce intestinal damage, the culture medium of basal-out and apical-out organoids was changed to DMEM/F-12 containing ETEC K88 (10<sup>6</sup> CFU). After the invasion for 1 h, the organoids were transferred to DMEM/F-12 containing 200 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> penicillin/streptomycin for 1 h to kill residual extracellular bacteria.

Specific primers 341 F (5’-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3’) and 805 R (5’-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3’) were used for bacterial PCR amplification of 16S rDNA V3-V4 hypervariable region. The PCR products were purified using AMPure XT beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, USA) and quantified by Qubit (Invitrogen, USA). The amplicon pools were prepared for sequencing and the size and quantity of the amplicon library were assessed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA) and the Library Quantification Kit for Illumina (Kapa Biosciences, USA), respectively. The libraries were sequenced on NovaSeq PE250 platform. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq platform according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Paired-end reads were assigned to samples based on their unique barcode and truncated by cutting off the barcode and primer sequence. Paired-end reads were merged using FLASH. Quality filtering on the raw reads were performed under specific filtering conditions to obtain the high-quality clean tags according to the fqtrim (v0.94). Chimeric sequences were filtered using Vsearch software (v2.3.4). After dereplication using DADA2, the Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) were constructed by Amplicon Sequence Variants to obtain the final feature table and feature sequence. Species annotation of OTU sequences was performed using the Mothur method with the SSUrRNA database of Silva 132, and multiple sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE (v3.8.31) software to obtain the phylogenetic relationships of all OTUs sequences. The data of each sample were normalized using a standard of sequence number corresponding to the sample with the least sequences. Subsequent analysis of alpha diversity and beta diversity were all performed based on the output normalized data. Alpha diversity is applied in analyzing complexity of species diversity for a sample through 4 indices, including Chao1, Observed species, Shannon, Simpson, and all these indices in our samples were calculated with QIIME2. Beta diversity was calculated by QIIME2, and the Anosim, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses were drawn implemented through R software (v3.5.2) with anosim, WGCNA, stats, ggplot2 and vegan packages.

<title>FMT enhanced the protection of AIMD piglets against ETEC K88 challenge</title>
<p>ETEC K88 infection is a leading cause of diarrhea in humans and animals. We set out to explore whether FMT protected against ETEC K88 challenge. The piglets were randomly assigned to three groups: the control piglets (Con group), the ETEC K88 infected piglets (EP group) and the ETEC K88 infected piglets with FMT treatment (EF group). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, decreased ADG and increased diarrhea score were observed in AIMD piglets at day 3 and day 6 after ETEC K88 infection, and these symptoms were relieved by FMT treatment. We next detected the pathogen colonization in mucosal tissues and found that FMT significantly decreased the copies of ETEC K88 in the jejunal and colonic mucosa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). To address whether FMT could protect intestinal barrier against ETEC K88 infection, intestinal barrier integrity and inflammatory cytokine levels were detected. FMT decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (<italic>TNF-</italic>α, <italic>IL-1</italic>β and <italic>IL-6</italic>) and increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (<italic>IL-10</italic> and <italic>TGF-</italic>β<italic>1</italic>) in the jejunum (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Jejunal scanning electron microscopy showed that the villi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> top) in ETEC K88 infected piglets were short and coarse, and there existed obvious rod-shaped bacterial adhesion on the surface of microvilli (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> bottom), while FMT reversed villi and microvilli injury caused by ETEC K88. In addition, the reduced mRNA and protein levels of the tight junctions (ZO-1, claudin and occludin) and adheren junctions (β-catenin and E-cadherin) caused by ETEC K88 challenge were also reversed by FMT treatment in the jejunum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-C</xref>). We then evaluated the expression of Mucin 2 (MUC2) in the jejunum using immunofluorescence staining. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, ETEC K88 infection reduced the expression of MUC2, which was significantly increased following FMT administration. These results indicated that FMT enhanced the protection of AIMD piglets against ETEC K88 challenge.</p>

<p>ETEC K88 adheres to intestinal epithelial cells and induces gut inflammation. As demonstrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, ETEC K88 decreased the relative mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines <italic>IL-10</italic> and <italic>TGF-</italic>β and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines <italic>TNF-</italic>α, <italic>IL-1</italic>β, <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>IFN-</italic>γ, which was reversed in A and B groups, indicating that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> ameliorated ETEC K88-induced intestinal inflammation. Intestinal inflammatory response is closely related to immune cells. Treg cells secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β to alleviate intestinal inflammation. Conversely, Th17 cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and IL-17, which aggravate intestinal inflammation. The dynamic balance of Treg and Th17 cells plays an important role in intestinal immunity. Therefore, we used flow cytometry to analyze the proportion of the immune cells isolated from jejunal lamina propria in the innate and adaptive immune system. Treg cells were labeled with CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells, Th17 cells were labeled with CD4<sup>+</sup>RORγt<sup>+</sup> cells, and mature dendritic cells were labeled with CD86<sup>+</sup>CD11C<sup>+</sup> cells.

ETEC K88 infection prominently decreased <italic>Ki67</italic> and <italic>Lyz</italic> mRNA expression and the number of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells and Lyz<sup>+</sup> Paneth cells in the crypt of the jejunum (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> increased <italic>Ki67</italic> and <italic>Lyz</italic> mRNA expression and the number of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells. However, only <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> enhanced the number of Lyz<sup>+</sup> Paneth cells, suggesting that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> accelerated the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. Lgr5-labeled active intestinal stem cells are the driving force of intestinal epithelial proliferation and differentiation after intestinal injury. ETEC K88 infection significantly increased the relative mRNA expression of <italic>Lgr5</italic>, <italic>Wnt3</italic>, <italic>Axin2</italic>, <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> in jejunum mucosa and had no significant impact on <italic>Notch1</italic> and <italic>Hes1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> inhibited the upregulation of <italic>Lgr5</italic>, <italic>Wnt3</italic>, <italic>Axin2</italic> and <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> at transcriptional level caused by ETEC K88 infection and had no significant effect on <italic>Notch1</italic> and <italic>Hes1</italic> levels. Western blot analysis also showed that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> inhibited the upregulation Lgr5, Wnt3, Active β-catenin, c-Myc and CyclinD1 at protein level, and the effect of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> was better than that of <italic>B. fragilis</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). These results implied that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> regulated the expression of intestinal stem cells in ETEC K88-challenged mice and regulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway rather than Notch signaling pathway.</p>

<p>We next isolated jejunal crypt from mice and explore whether <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> or <italic>B. fragilis</italic> influenced the ability of intestinal stem cells growing into intestinal organoids <italic>ex vivo.</italic> In ETEC K88-infected mice, the crypts formed into undifferentiated spherical organoids, while in <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> or <italic>B. fragilis</italic> treated mice, the crypts generated mature organoids with bud structure (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). We statistically analyzed the surface area and forming efficiency of the intestinal organoids. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, the organoids derived from ETEC K88-infected mice had smaller surface area and lower forming efficiency than those from control mice. <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> treatment led to larger surface area and higher forming efficiency of the intestinal organoids. The surface area of intestinal organoids in B group was larger than that in E group, while there was no significant difference in forming efficiency between these two groups. Meanwhile, the relative mRNA expression of genes related to the proliferation and differentiation at the intestinal organoid level was consistent with the results of jejunal mucosa <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>).

<title><italic>A. muciniphila</italic> protected intestinal organoids against ETEC infection via Wnt signaling</title>
<p>To explore the effects and mechanisms of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> on ETEC K88 infection <italic>in vitro</italic>, the porcine intestinal organoids were infected with ETEC K88 (ETEC group), and then co-cultured with <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> (AKK group). Wnt inhibitor Wnt-C59 was added to explore whether <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> acted through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (WNT-C59 group), and porcine intestinal organoids without any treatment were used as blank control (CON group). The relative mRNA expression of <italic>villin</italic>, <italic>ZO-1</italic>, <italic>Ki67</italic>, <italic>Lyz</italic>, <italic>MUC2</italic>, <italic>Lgr5</italic>, <italic>Wnt3a,</italic> β<italic>-catenin</italic> and the fluorescence intensity of villin, Ki67, Lgr5, Wnt3a and β-catenin in basal-out intestinal organoids were significantly down-regulated upon ETEC exposure (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-G</xref>). <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> upregulated Lgr5, Wnt3a and β-catenin expression in ETEC-infected organoids, while these effects were inhibited by Wnt-C59 treatment (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A-G</xref>). The results suggested that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> increased the number of intestinal stem cells and activated Wnt signaling, but did not promote the proliferation and differentiation of basal-out gut organoids. In basal-out intestinal organoid models, the intestinal epithelium was in the interior of organoid spheroid, which restricted the interaction between intestinal epithelium and <italic>A. muciniphila</italic>. Therefore, we reversed the polarity of basal-out intestinal organoids by removing the Matrigel from the culture system and suspending intestinal organoids in the culture (Figure S3A). In apical-out intestinal organoids, the apical surface was outward to make it accessible to <italic>A. muciniphila</italic>. Under confocal microscopy, the F-actin of basal-out intestinal organoid was located in the inside of the spheroids, while the F-actin of the apical-out intestinal organoid was outside the spheroids, indicating that the polar reversal intestinal organoid model was successfully constructed (Figure S3B). We conducted FD4 permeation test in apical-out intestinal organoid model, and co-cultivation with <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> restored the epithelial barrier integrity of organoids challenged by ETEC K88 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>, H). <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> not only increased the mRNA expression of <italic>ZO-1</italic>, <italic>Lyz</italic> and <italic>MUC2</italic> in the ETEC K88 infected apical-out intestinal organoids, but also up-regulated the protein expression of villin, Wnt3a, β-catenin and the number of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> and Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B-G</xref>, I). Moreover, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> also relieved the inflammatory response of the ETEC K88 infected apical-out intestinal organoids, as determined by decreasing proinflammatory cytokines, inducing <italic>TNF-</italic>α, <italic>IL-1</italic>β, <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>IFN-</italic>γ, and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines <italic>IL-10</italic> and <italic>TGF-</italic>β (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10J</xref>). However, the moderating effect of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> on the apical-out intestinal organoids disappeared after Wnt-C59 exposure. Taken together, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> accelerated the proliferation and differentiation of the intestinal stem cells and ameliorated the intestinal barrier injury and inflammation induced by ETEC K88. <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> protected intestinal organoids against ETEC infection via Wnt signaling.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The homeostasis of gut microbiota is a major contributor to host health. Intestinal dysbiosis increases intestinal colonization of antibiotic-resistant and pathogenic bacteria. Antibiotic treatment is the most drastic exposure leading to gut dysbiosis and pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andremont et al., 2021</xref>). Early-life exposure to antibiotic leads to gut microbiota dysbiosis and impair host immune system maturation, which may even last for long periods throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). Researchers have made a lot of attempts to prevent or inhibit antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. Our previous study showed that FMT alleviates early-life antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and mucosa injuries in a neonatal piglet model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). Our present study aimed to investigate whether FMT increases early-life antibiotic induced neonatal piglet against pathogen invasion. ETEC K88 is one of the most common pathogens in humans and animals and causes intestinal inflammation and diarrhea symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sun and Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Studies demonstrated that ETEC K88 infection led to pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation and intestinal mucosal barrier injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). In ETEC-induced neonatal piglets, ZO-1 and Claudin-2 levels in ileum of were significantly decreased after ETEC K88 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). In accordance with the above results, the present study showed that ETEC K88 infection increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced the expression of intercellular junction proteins in AIMD piglets. Since FMT has been successful in treating <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection and maintaining gut barrier, emerging investigation has been focused on other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cammarota et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Geng et al., 2018</xref> demonstrated that FMT diminished the inflammatory response and the destruction of epithelial integrity in piglets challenged with lipopolysaccharide. In the present study, we found that FMT dampened ETEC K88-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulation and improved the intestinal morphology. In addition, the number of ETEC K88 in jejunal and colonic mucosa was significantly decreased following FMT, which was consistent with the observation of jejunal microvilli under SEM, showing the absence of rod-shaped bacterial adhesion in FMT treatment. ETEC infection was reported to reduce the MUC2 expression by destroying goblet cells or directly degrading MUC2, thereby damaging the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). Our results demonstrated that FMT enhanced the expression of MUC2 and increased the expression of ZO-1, claudin, occludin, β-catenin and E-cadherin at mRNA and protein levels, indicating that FMT improved the intercellular junctions between intestinal epithelial cells and restored the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier to reduce the colonization and invasion of ETEC K88.</p>
<p>Intestinal microbiota plays a key role in maintaining gut mucosal barrier and resistance to pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chelakkot et al., 2018</xref>). Antibiotic-induced gut microbiota-disorders have been reported to disrupt gut barrier and increase the susceptibility of host to pathogenic microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wlodarska et al., 2011</xref>). So, we further probed the changes of gut microbiota in AIMD piglets infected with ETEC K88. The results showed that FMT regulated gut microbiota and SCFAs metabolism in ETEC K88-challenged piglets. LEfSe analysis manifested that <italic>B. fragilis</italic> and <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> were the key differential bacteria between three groups. <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> utilizes mucin as the only carbon and nitrogen source for its growth in the gut, and its metabolite SCFAs can facilitate MUC2 secretion by goblet cells to maintain the dynamic balance of intestinal mucus layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ottman et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> negatively correlated with many diseases, including diabetes, obesity and inflammatory bowel diseases (<italic>Belzer C and de Vos, 2012; </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Castro-Mejía et al., 2016</xref><italic>; </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Plovier et al., 2017</xref>). It has been reported that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> effectively inhibited intestinal inflammatory response and elevated epithelial barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Everard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> is one of the symbiotic anaerobes within the mammalian gut and is also an opportunistic pathogen which often isolated from clinical specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Although it was initially thought to be pathogenic, in the long-term evolution process, <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> colonized in the gut has established a friendly relationship with the host, which is an essential component for maintaining the health of the host, especially for obesity, diabetes and immune deficiency diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Troy and Kasper, 2010</xref>). <italic>B. fragilis</italic> could decompose mucin by lipid-anchored enzymes and interact with intestinal epithelial cells, thereby altering intestinal permeability and repairing intestinal epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Donaldson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Deng et al., 2016</xref> reported that <italic>B. fragilis</italic> altered macrophage phenotype and increased the phagocytosis of macrophages to restrain pathogens colonization. Hence, we speculated that FMT increased the relative abundance of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> in the intestine and alleviate intestinal barrier injury and intestinal inflammation caused by ETEC K88 infection.</p>
<p>Since <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> were identified as two strains that may play key roles in FMT, we further investigate whether <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> exerted protective effect on ETEC K88 infection in AIMD mice model. We found that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> maintained normal gut morphology after ETEC K88 infection, repaired the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier as evidenced by the reduced FD4 concentration in serum, colonized in the intestine and inhibit the translocation of ETEC K88, and reduced the intestinal inflammation, which may have been attributed to the increased proportion of Treg cells and mature dendritic cells and the decreased proportion of Th17 cells. These results are consistent with the protective role of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> in dextran sulphate sodium salt induced enteritis model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhai et al., 2019</xref>). Intestinal stem cell renewal is vital to maintaining the gut barrier. Ki67 is widely expressed in proliferating cells and presents a reliable indicator of cell proliferation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). Ki67 reaches its peak during the division stage with short half-life period and easy degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> increased the number of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells and the mRNA expression of <italic>Lyz</italic>, suggesting that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic> accelerated the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium. Paneth cells not only produce antimicrobial peptides and express key niche signals that regulate stem cells, but also secrete activators that dynamically modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hou et al., 2020</xref>). The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ring et al., 2014</xref>). When the Wnt receptors are activated, the multiprotein degradation complex is rapidly inhibited, which allows β-catenin to accumulate and subsequently migrate to the nucleus and binds to the transcription factors of T cell factor family and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor family to drive the expression of genes that regulate the stem cells, including Lgr5, c-Myc and Cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). The c-Myc and Cyclin D1 are cyclins that positively regulate cell cycle from the G1 phase to S phase, thus inducing cell cycle progression and promote cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhu et al., 2020</xref> reported that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> restored intestinal mucosal damage with the accelerated proliferation of intestinal epithelium through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thus relieving infection caused by <italic>Salmonella pullorum</italic> in chicks. In the present study, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> moderately activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and maintain the suitable expression of Wnt, Active-β-catenin, Lgr5, c-Myc and Cyclin D1. Consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> results, <italic>ex vivo</italic> results of mouse intestinal organoids also demonstrated that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> repaired the damaged intestinal epithelium caused by the ETEC K88 infection by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Simultaneously, <italic>B. fragilis</italic> also avoid the overactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway caused by the ETEC K88 infection, while the impact of <italic>B. fragilis</italic> was not as obvious as <italic>A. muciniphila</italic>.</p>
<p>Intestinal organoid is an ideal model for studying the interaction between intestinal epithelium and microorganisms in vitro, which can eliminate the complexity of animal models and avoid the unicity of the traditional intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yin et al., 2019</xref>). In order to further verify whether <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> attenuated ETEC K88 infection through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, basal-out and apical-out porcine intestinal organoid models was used. Notably, we found that the ETEC K88 infection down-regulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway <italic>in vitro</italic>, which was inconsistent with the results <italic>in vivo</italic>. A recent study showed that the addition of 400 ng ml<sup>-1</sup> STp, an enterotoxin of ETEC, could suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway of porcine intestinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). It is speculated that the reason for the difference results might be related to the difference in the processing time of the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment. In spite of the slight stimulation of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> on the proliferation and differentiation of infected intestinal organoids, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> up-regulated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and had protective effects on intestinal stem cells. In basal-out intestinal organoid models, the intestinal epithelium was in the interior of organoid spheroid, which restricted the interaction between intestinal epithelium and <italic>A. muciniphila</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Co et al., 2019</xref> first established the intestinal organoid model with polarity reversal in human and mouse and evaluated the infection effects of the invasive pathogens with different polarity-specific patterns, <italic>Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, on polarity reversal intestinal organoids. Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2020</xref> first applied the porcine intestinal organoids with polarity reversal to investigate the infectivity and antiviral immune responses of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. In addition, studies on host-pathogen interactions using polarity reversal intestinal organoids have also been reported in the sheep and chickens (). But up to now, there are few reports on the interaction between host and symbiotic microorganism using polarity reversal intestinal organoids. Here, we utilized porcine polarity reversal intestinal organoids to make <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> directly interacting with the intestinal epithelium. Our results showed that <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> alleviated the injury of polarity reversal intestinal organoids induced by ETEC K88. In agreement with the <italic>in vivo</italic> results, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> restrain the intestinal inflammation caused by the ETEC K88 infection in polarity reversal intestinal organoids. Additionally, the alleviatory effect of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> on ETEC K88 infection via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was confirmed with the addition of Wnt inhibitor Wnt-C59. The promoted proliferation and differentiation in the basal-out and apical-out intestinal organoids after co-culturing with <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> were reversed with Wnt-C59.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that FMT relieved intestinal inflammation and improved intestinal barrier function in AIMD piglets infected with ETEC K88. <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> was identified as key strain in FMT to promote the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells by mediating the Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway. The study revealed the possible mechanism that FMT alleviates the intestinal barrier injury.</p>

<p>The work by Han and collaborators describes <bold>valuable</bold> findings on the role of Akkermansia muciniphila during ETEC infection. If confirmed, these findings will add to a growing list of beneficial properties of this organism. However, as it stands, the strength of the evidence used to justify the conclusions in the manuscript is <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>The authors indicated that the adherence of ETEC is to intestinal epithelial cells. However, it is also possible that the majority of ETEC may reside in the intestinal mucus, particularly under in vivo infection condition. The colonization of ETEC in the jejunum and colon of piglets (Fig 2C) and in the intestines of mice (Fig S2A) does not necessarily reflect the adherence of ETEC to epithelial cells. Please verify these observations with other methods, such as immunostaining. Also, while Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes can invade organoids within 1 hour, it is unknown if ETEC invade into organoids in this study. Clarifying this will help resolve if A. muciniphila block the adherence and/or invasion of ETEC. Please also address if A. muciniphila metabolites could prevent ETEC infection in the organoid models.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Ma et al. describes a multi-model (pig, mouse, organoid) investigation into how fecal transplants protect against E. coli infection. The authors identify A. muciniphila and B. fragilis as two important strains and characterize how these organisms impact the epithelium by modulating host signaling pathways, namely the Wnt pathway in lgr5 intestinal stem cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this manuscript include the use of multiple model systems and follow up mechanistic investigations to understand how A. muciniphila and B. fragilis interacted with the host to impact epithelial physiology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>After revision, the bioinformatics section of the methods is still jumbled and may indicate issues in the pipeline. Important parameters are not included to replicate analyses. Merging the forward and reverse reads may represent a problem for denoising. Chimera detection was performed prior to denoising.</p>
<p>Potential denoising issues for NovaSeq data was not addressed in the response. The authors did not clarify if multiple testing correction was applied; however, it may be assumed not as written. The raw sequencing data made available through the SRA accession (if for the correct project) indicates it was a MiSeq platform; however, the sample names do not appear to link up to this experimental design and metadata not sufficient to replicate analyses.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors investigate the impact of fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) on intestinal recovery from enterotoxigenic E. coli infection following antibiotic treatment. Using a piglet model of intestinal infection, the authors demonstrate that FMT reduces weight loss and diarrhea and enhances the expression of tight junction proteins. Sequencing analysis of the intestinal microbiota following FMT showed significant increases in Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides fragilis. Using additional mouse and organoid models, the authors examine the impact of these microbes on intestinal recovery and modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Overall, the data support the notion that FMT following ETEC infection is beneficial, however, additional investigation is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms involved.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Initial experiments used a piglet model of infection to test the value of FMT on recovery from E. coli. The FMT treatment was beneficial and the authors provide solid evidence that the treatment increased the diversity of the microbiota and enhanced the recovery of the intestinal epithelium. Sequencing data highlighted an increase in Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides fragilis after FMT.</p>
<p>The mouse data are consistent with the observations in pigs, and reveal that daily gavage with A. muciniphila or B. fragilis enhances intestinal recovery based on histological analysis, expression of tight junction proteins, and analysis of intestinal barrier function.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate the benefit of probiotic treatment following infection using a range of model systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Without sequencing the pre-infection pig microbiota or the FMT input material itself, it's challenging to firmly say that the observed bloom in Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides fragilis stemmed from the FMT.</p>
<p>Response: We have determined the relative abundance of each bacterium in fecal bacterial suspension, referring to Hu et al. (2018). The absolute abundances of Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides fragilis in the FMT were 1.3 × 103 ± 2.6 × 103 and 4.5 × 103 ± 6.1 × 103 respectively.</p>

<p>The lack of details for the murine infection model, such as weight loss and quantification of bacterial loads over time, make it challenging for a reader to fully appreciate how treatment with Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides fragilis is altering the course of infection. Bacterial loads of E. coli were only quantified at one time point, and the mice that received A. muciniphila and B. fragilis had very low levels of E. coli. Therefore, it is not clear if all mice were subjected to the same level of infection in the first place. The reduced translocation of E. coli to the organs and enhanced barrier function may just reflect the low level of infection in these mice. Further, the authors' conclusion that the effect is specific to A. muciniphila or B. fragilis would be more convincing if the experiments included an inert control bacterium, to demonstrate that gavage with any commensal microbe would not elicit a similar effect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The weight loss was added in Figure S2A. All mice were subjected to the same level of infection in the first place.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Many of the conclusions in the study are drawn from the microscopy results. However, the methods describing both light microscopy and electron microscopy lack sufficient detail. For example, it is not clear how many sections and fields of view were imaged or how the SEM samples were prepared and dehydrated. The mucus layer does not appear to be well preserved, which would make it challenging to accurately measure the thickness of the mucus layer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For light microscopy, 3-4 fields were selected from each mouse to count about 30 crypts. The method of electron microscopy was complemented on line 263-270. We have removed data of the mucus layer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Gene expression data appears to vary across the different models, for example, Wnt3 expression in mice versus organoids. Additional experiments may be required to clarify the mechanisms involved. Considering that both of the bacteria tested elicited similar changes in Wnt signaling, this pathway might be broadly modulated by the microbiota.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reason why the Wnt3 expression pattern is different in mice and in porcine intestinal organoids may be caused by the different infection periods of ETEC in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo, the stem cell niche of intestinal stem cells is not only regulated by intestinal epithelial cells, but also affected by mesenchymal cells in connective tissues (Luo et al., 2022). However, in vitro models, stem cell niche is only regulated by epithelial secretory factors, which may also account for the differences in in vitro and in vivo results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It has been reported that B. fragilis pretreatment significantly increased the relative abundance of A. muciniphila in the intestine of CDI mice, and the growth and maintenance of A. muciniphila were involved in the restoration of intestinal barrier integrity after CDI infection, indicating that there might exist a bacterial metabolic symbiosis between A. muciniphila and B. fragilis (Deng et al., 2018).</p>

<p>Deng HM, Yang SQ, Zhang YC, et al. Bacteroides fragilis Prevents Clostridium difficile Infection in a Mouse Model by Restoring Gut Barrier and Microbiome Regulation. Front. Microbiol. 2018, 9.</p>
<p>The unconventional choice to not include references in the results section makes it challenging for the reader to put the results in context with what is known in the field. Similarly, there is a lack of discussion acknowledging that B. fragilis is a potential pathogen, associated with intestinal inflammation and cancer (Haghi et al. BMC Cancer 19, 879 (2019) ), and how this would impact its utility as a potential probiotic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Bacteroides fragilis is one of the symbiotic anaerobes within the mammalian gut and is also an opportunistic pathogen which often isolated from clinical specimens. Bacteroides fragilis was first isolated from the pathogenic site and considered to be pathogenic bacteria. However, with the deepening of research, it is gradually realized that in the long-term evolution process, Bacteroides fragilis colonized in the gut has established a friendly relationship with the host, which is an essential component for maintaining the health of the host, especially for obesity, diabetes and immune deficiency diseases. We have supplemented the discussion on line 598-603.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Ma X. et al proposed that A. muciniphila was a key strain that promotes the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells by acting on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. They used various models, such as the piglet model, mouse model, and intestinal organoids to address how A. muciniphila and B. fragilis offer protection against ETEC infection. They showed that FMT with fecal samples, A. muciniphila or B. fragilis protected piglets and/or mice from ETEC infection, and this protection is manifested as reduced intestinal inflammation/bacterial colonization, increased tight junction/Muc2 proteins, as well as proper Treg/Th17 cells. Additionally, they demonstrated that A. muciniphila protected basal-out and/or apical-out intestinal organoids against ETEC infection via Wnt signaling. While a large body of work has been performed in this study, there are quite a few questions to be addressed.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>- The similar protective effect of FMT with fecal samples, A. muciniphila or B. fragilis is perhaps not that surprising, considering that FMT likely restores microbiota-mediated colonization resistance against ETEC infection. While FMT with fecal samples increases SCFAs, it is unclear whether/how FMT with A. muciniphila or B. fragilis alter the microbiota composition/abundance as well as metabolites in the current models in a way that offers protection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We examined changes in the gut microbiota of mice treated with A. muciniphila and B. fragilis through 16s rRNA, and results showed that both A. muciniphila and B. fragilis improved the alpha and beta diversities of the microbiota, while these results were not included in this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Does ETEC infection in piglets/mice cause histological damage in the intestines? These data should be shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results of scanning electron microscopy (Figure 3A) showed the intestinal damage of piglets after ETEC infection. H&amp;E staining and transmission electron microscopy (Figure 5A and 5B) showed the intestinal damage of mice after ETEC infection.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Line 447, &quot;ETEC adheres to intestinal epithelial cells&quot;. However, there is no data showing the adherence (or invasion) of ETEC to intestinal epithelial cells, irrespective of piglets/mouse/organoids.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The scanning electron microscope (Figure 3A bottom) showed that ETEC K88 infected piglets existed obvious rod-shaped bacterial adhesion on the surface of microvilli. Figure 2C showed the colonization of ETEC K88 in the jejunum and colon of piglets. Figure S2A showed the E. coli colonization in intestines and other tissues of mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- In both basal-out and apical-out intestinal organoid models, A. muciniphila protects organoids against ETEC infection. Did ETEC enter into intestinal epithelial cells at all after only one hour of infection? Is the protection through certain A. muciniphila metabolites?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It has been reported that the duration of the co-culture for studying the host-microbiota cross-talk by apical-out organoids model is 1 hour (Poletti et al., 2021). In addition, Co et al. (2019) used apical-out organoids model to study host-pathogen interactions, with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes invading organoids for an hour.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Ma et al. describes a multi-model (pig, mouse, organoid) investigation into how fecal transplants protect against E. coli infection. The authors identify A. muciniphila and B. fragilis as two important strains and characterize how these organisms impact the epithelium by modulating host signaling pathways, namely the Wnt pathway in lgr5 intestinal stem cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this manuscript include the use of multiple model systems and follow-up mechanistic investigations to understand how A. muciniphila and B. fragilis interacted with the host to impact epithelial physiology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness is that, as presented, the manuscript is quite difficult to follow, even for someone familiar with the field. The lack of detail in figure legends, organization of the text, and frequent use of non-intuitive abbreviated group names without a clear key (ex. EP/EF, or C E A B) make comprehension challenging. The results section is perhaps too succinct and does not provide sufficient information to understand experimental design and interpretation without reading the methods section first or skipping to the discussion (as an example: WNT-c59 treatment). Extensive revisions could be encouraged to aid in communicating the potentially exciting findings.</p>

<p>The abbreviations of experimental groups are firstly defined in the Methods and Materials, and we have supplemented the experimental design in the results section on line 397-399, 439-442 and 516-520.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The bioinformatics section of the methods requires revision and may indicate issues in the pipeline. Merging the forward and reverse reads may represent a problem for denoising. Also since these were sequenced on a NovaSeq, the error learning would have to be modified or the diversity estimates would be inappropriately multiplied. &quot;Alpha diversity and beta diversity were calculated by normalized to the same sequence randomly.&quot; Not sure what this means, does this mean subsampled? &quot;Blast was used for sequence alignment&quot;, does this mean the taxonomic alignment? This would need to be elaborated on and database versions should be included. The methods, including if any form of multiple testing was included, for LEFSE was also not included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Denoising was conducted using UNOISE3 to correct for sequencing errors. Subsequent analysis of alpha diversity and beta diversity were all performed based on the output normalized data. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE (v3.8.31) software to obtain the phylogenetic relationships of all OTUs sequences. We have supplemented the method of multiple testing on line 323-328.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>At some points, the rationale for using both porcine and murine models was unclear, and it would be helpful for the reader to elaborate on the benefits of these models and why they were used in the introduction. Similarly, it would be helpful to describe the benefits of basal-in organoids versus injecting standard organoids with bacteria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The main subject of this study was piglets, supplemented by a mouse model for validation. Interpretation of measurements from organoid microinjection experiments must account for multiple confounding variables such as heterogeneous exposure concentrations and durations, as well as impacts of disrupting the organoid wall. We have added the description in the introduction on line 88-90.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 165 -- The number of piglets used seems high, is it correct approximately 100 pigs were used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Nine litters were selected for processing, while only 18 piglets were finally slaughtered.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>There is very little discussion of the preliminary experiment that the authors used to determine how much bacteria to use. I recommend either discussing the data and how the doses were chosen or omitting it. It was not clear if the authors used pasteurized or live bacteria in the experiments. It would also be interesting to include a discussion of the observation that relatively low levels of Akkermansia (10^6 CFU) appeared more beneficial than the higher doses, typically used in these types of experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed these results. The experiments used live bacteria.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Microscopy methods for both light microscopy and EM would be stronger with added details including how many sections and fields of view were imaged and how the numbers of goblet cells normalized across samples. Without having a clear cross-section of a crypt, it is not clear to me how the images can be used to accurately quantify the number of cells per crypt. Additional details in the methods on how many total crypts were counted should also be included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For light microscopy, 3-4 fields were selected from each mouse to count about 30 crypts. We have removed the data of the mucus layer and goblet cells.</p>

<p>Fig 4C -- The images do not clearly capture the mucus layer or how it was analyzed. The sections appear to be cut at a slight angle, with multiple partial sections of crypts. I think this might make it challenging to count goblet cells, especially if the counts are normalized over the number of crypts or villi. The mucus layer does not appear well preserved. For example, I would expect to see an intact mucus layer lining the colon in the PBS control group. Re-cutting sections with a clean cross-section through the tissue will make data analysis easier.</p>

<p>We apologize for the absence of the distal colon sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To fully preserve the mucus layer, in addition to fixing in Carnoy's solution, the embedding process must be run without the standard washes in 70% ethanol (see: Johansson and Hansson. Methods Mol Biol. (2012) 229; doi: 10.1007/978-1-61779-513-8_13). The mucus will wash away during standard paraffin embedding if the tissue is washed with 70% ethanol, and I wonder if that has occurred in these samples.</p>
