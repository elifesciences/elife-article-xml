<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We developed a 96-well plate assay which allows fast, reproducible and high-throughput generation of 3D cardiac rings around a deformable optically transparent hydrogel (PEG) pillar of known stiffness. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, mixed with normal human adult dermal fibroblasts in an optimized 3:1 ratio, self-organized to form ring-shaped cardiac constructs. Immunostaining showed that the fibroblasts form a basal layer in contact with the glass, stabilizing the muscular fiber above. Tissues started contracting around the pillar at D1 and their fractional shortening increased until D7, reaching a plateau at 25±1%, that was maintained up to 14 days. The average stress, calculated from the compaction of the central pillar during contractions, was 1.4±0.4 mN/mm2. The cardiac constructs recapitulated expected inotropic responses to calcium and various drugs (isoproterenol, verapamil) as well as the arrhythmogenic effects of dofetilide. This versatile high-throughput assay allows multiple in situ mechanical and structural read-outs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiac tissue engineering (CTE) aims to generate <italic>in vitro</italic> cell constructs that recapitulate the intricate structural and functional properties of the native myocardium (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">van der Velden et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>). As the heart lacks regenerative capacities, CTE emerged in the field of regenerative medicine with the objective of producing cardiac grafts that can be implanted in patients with heart failure (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Madonna et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jabbour et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eschenhagen et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>). In parallel, the rapid development of biomaterials and microfabrication techniques, combined with progress in pluripotent stem cell biology have enabled the generation of miniature engineered heart tissues (EHTs) used as “hearts-on-chips” or cardiac organoids models. While these EHTs recapitulate a limited number of functions <italic>in vitro</italic>, they have provided essential platforms for cardiac disease modeling (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Filippo Buono et al.

(2019)</xref></italic></bold>). The EHTs are optimally formed by mixing human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and/or other cell types such as endothelial cells to more closely mimic the structure and cellular complexity of native myocardium (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Giacomelli et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Saini et al. (2015)</xref></italic></bold>). However, a major obstacle in the development of EHTs is the inevitable trade-off between the need for miniaturization to increase throughput (i.e. several organoids in each well of a 96- or 384-well plate) and the biological complexity of the tissues (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cho et al. (2022)</xref></italic></bold>). The first EHTs were generated in small batches, using pre-designed molds, and having a millimetric size (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boudou et al. (2012)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Turnbull et al. (2014)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Legant et al. (2009)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mannhardt et al. (2016)</xref></italic></bold>). Since then, two different avenues of development have emerged. On the one hand, to optimize throughput, more straightforward, low complexity assays such as spheroids were developed to obtain smaller tissues (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beauchamp et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Polonchuk et al., 2017</xref></italic></bold>). These multicellular constructs are valuable models to study drug responses and the human heart micro-environment but they lack the geometric intricacy of a native cardiac tissue. On the other hand, the search for higher tissue complexity and maturity led to the development of chambered organoids (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">MacQueen et al. (2018)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al. (2018)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al. (2019)</xref></italic></bold>). These constructs require the use of complex techniques such as bioprinting or the use of bioreactors, and tissues are generated one at a time, making these approaches time-consuming and impractical on a large scale. Therefore, the next step in tissue engineering needs to be directed towards high-throughput physiologically-relevant assays that are simple and straightforward for the end-user. Scaling down the tissue size to increase throughput, while controlling their geometry represents a major engineering challenge. Moreover in actual designs, many EHTs are attached on static posts that can impact tissue formation, result in isometric contraction and can interfere with optical acquisitions when made with opaque material.</p>
<p>Here, we report the development of a novel assay which allows fast, reproducible and high-throughput generation of 3D cardiac rings in a 96-well plate using hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. The design allows the formation of multiple ring-shaped cardiac tissues in a well. The EHTs form around a central pillar made from an optically-transparent and deformable polymer that enables <italic>in situ</italic> monitoring of the tissue contraction with simultaneous measurements of force generation.</p>

<title>Design and characterization of the molds</title>
<p>3D steel molds were designed to obtain a structure on which cells can be directed to ring-shaped cavities during sedimentation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The mold fits in the well of a 96-well plate, and consists of 21 identical conical structures with a central hole (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> left). The molds obtained from the manufacturer were imaged by scanning electron microscopy and found to correspond to the intended design (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, right). Casts of the mold were created in PEG to check the shape of the inner cavities of the mold, but the resulting structures were too soft to maintain their shape in air, and were transparent in water and therefore could not be imaged. More rigid polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was cast from the mold to verify the shape of the resulting structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). These showed that the interior profile of the cavity was shaped in a reversed hourglass, as expected.</p>

<title>Generation and characterization of the gels</title>
<p>3D gel structures were obtained by adding a drop of PEG gel solution on top of the molds, inverting these onto a glass coverslip, polymerizing the gel and attaching the resulting sample on a 96-well plate. To determine the stiffness of the gels, a sample of the aqueous PEG solution was polymerized. A capillary was placed perpendicularly to the edge of the gel and negative pressure was applied to the gel through the capillary. The deformation of the gel into the capillary was measured and used to determine the Young’s modulus of the gel (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 supplement 1</xref>). The values obtained (11.4± 0.5 kPa) are within the physiological range for human cardiac tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gershlak et al. (2013)</xref>).</p>

<title>Generation of ring-shaped cardiac tissues</title>
<p>The efficiency of the differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes was in average of 96.9 ± 0.8 % (<xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 Supplement 2</xref>).Cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs (iPSC-CMs) with fibroblasts were seeded on the gels. After centrifugation, the cells sedimented into the ring-shaped cavities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), and compacted around the pillars to rapidly form ring-shaped cardiac constructs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>). Initial tests with cardiomyocytes resulted in cell cluster formation and malformation of the rings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To stabilize the tissues, iPSC-CMs were mixed with fibroblasts and different ratios of hiPSC-CMs to fibroblasts were tested in order to obtain the highest number of full stable cardiac rings with time. Three ratios of hiPSC-CMs:fibroblasts were tested (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) based on previous reports (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tiburcy et al. (2017)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Saini et al. (2015)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Giacomelli et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beauchamp et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold>). The 3:1 hiPSC-CMs:fibroblasts ratio was determined to be optimal as it allowed the generation of the highest number of tissues stable in time, and we could not see any difference in the contractile parameters of the tissues with different fibroblast ratios (see <xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 Supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the 3:1 hiPSC-CMs:fibroblasts ratio was used for all of the following experiments. Tissues started beating within 24 hours after seeding (Video 1). The rings compacted in time as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>. In these optimization experiments, we obtained an average of 10.75±0.48 tissues per well which were stable over time for at least 20 days with the 3:1 hiPSC-CMs:fibroblasts ratio.</p>

<title>Structure and organization of the engineered cardiac tissues</title>
<p>The 3D organization of the tissues was assessed by 3D immunofluorescence imaging 14 days after seeding. The fibroblasts are concentrated at the base of the ring in contact with the glass (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> – bottom panel), whereas the cardiomyocytes form a compact ring above the fibroblasts around the central pillar (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> – top panel). Troponin T staining evidenced the formation of striated elongated fibers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), which are typical of cardiac tissue. The obtained cardiac tissues are 75.5±1.8 µm high and their shape is toric, as shown in the 3D reconstruction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and video 1). To investigate the kinetics of the fibroblasts-cardiomyocytes segregation, the same immunostainings were performed respectively 1 and 7 days after seeding (see <xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 Supplement 3</xref>). It appears that 1 day after seeding the fibroblasts are not yet attached, although the cardiac fiber has already started to be formed. Seven days after seeding, fibroblasts are fully spread and attached, and the contractile ring is formed and well-aligned.</p>

<title>Contractility analysis</title>
<p>Tissues started contracting less than 24 hours after seeding, which was visible through the deformation of their central pillar (Supplemental video 1). Each tissue was recorded in brightfield imaging, at a 10X magnification with a high-speed camera (Supplemental video 1). An in-house Matlab code was developed to quantify the contraction and relaxation phases of the tissues by monitoring the area of the central pillar over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The beat rate of the tissues first decreased between day 1 and day 3 and increased again to reach 0.58±0.030 Hz on day 14 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The contraction stress developed by the tissues increased from day 1 until day 7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). At day 7, the contractility parameters stabilized with an average stress of 1.4±0.1 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>.). The corresponding developed strain <italic>ε</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> was of 24.84±0.92 % (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 supplement 1</xref>). Consistently, the relaxation and contraction speeds also increased during the first 7 days, then reaching a plateau (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Since long-term culture of iPSC-CMs is gaining interest we studied the contractile parameters of our rings 28 days after seeding in comparison to their contractile parameters at D14 (see <xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 Supplement 2</xref>). We found a slight increase for all the parameters, which is significant for the maximum contraction speed. Nevertheless, the data is much more variable and the number of tissues is lower (29 for D14 against 17 for D28). Therefore, we demonstrated that long-term culture of our tissues is possible, however not yet optimized. Hence, the following physiological and pharmacological tests have been done at D14.</p>

<p>The regularity of the rings was first evaluated by plotting each period (time between two contraction peaks) as a function of the following one.

We found that, as expected, the tissue depolarization induced a visible increase in fluorescence (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 B</xref>.). All the pixels were synchronous and we could not detect any sparks or re-entrant waves (see the video 1). We then developed a Matlab script to analyze the average FluoVolt fluorescence signal together with the contraction over time, which was also obtained from the same videos. We found that the tissues beat regularly, with a depolarization occurring just before the contraction of the ring, causing a large increase in tissue fluorescence (from 0 to 6 Δ<italic>F</italic> ∕<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>). We also observed that the repolarization signal is noisy, as it occurs during the time when the tissue deformation is greatest and is probably affected by tissue motion.</p>

<p>We next evaluated the dose-response to increasing concentrations of several cardiotropic drugs. The changes in the beating parameters with verapamil concentration were found to be significant (p=0.0053 for the beat rate and p&lt;0.0001 for the other parameters). The addition of verapamil, an L-type calcium channel inhibitor, induced a negative inotropic effect until the complete stop of contraction at 10µM, as expected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> was estimated to be 0.677 µM, CI=[4.278;12.81].10<sup>7</sup> M. The dose-response to the <italic>β</italic>-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol was tested. We observed a trend towards increase of the contraction amplitude, as well as a significant increase in the contraction and relaxation speeds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), without change in the beat rate. The changes in the contraction stress and the contraction and relaxation speeds with isoproterenol concentration are significant (p=0.0004 for the contraction stress; p&lt;0.0001 for the contraction and relaxation speeds). Finally, dofetilide, which is an inhibitor of the <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Kr</italic></sub> current, was also tested at different concentrations on the cardiac rings. This drug has been shown to be pro-arrhythmic and to induce arrhythmic events such as Torsades-de-Pointes in patients.

As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, dofetilide significantly reduced the contraction stress and speeds until the complete stop of the contraction of the cardiac tissues for a concentration of 10 nM. Arrhythmic events were noted after adding dofetilide at concentrations of 3 and 7 nM. Indeed, the Poincaré diagram for the different dofetilide concentrations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) shows an increase in the contraction-to-contraction intervals (equivalent to RR intervals) for some cells at 1 nM of dofetilide and an increasing number of erratic beats with increasing dofetilide concentrations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The combination of pluripotent stem cells technologies, advanced cardiomyocyte differentiation protocols and microfabrication methods have already resulted in the generation of engineered human cardiac muscle tissue-constructs, with different shapes and that can reproduce some cardiac functions (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seguret et al. (2021)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cho et al. (2022)</xref></italic></bold>). However, until now, approaching the complex geometry and structure of the human myocardium required complex techniques, which limit the number of tissues produced, thus hampering their application for high-throughput experiments. In this study, we aimed to address this challenge by developing a novel strategy to create ring-shaped miniature cardiac tissues around a central pillar that is made from an optically-transparent and deformable polymer. Our main findings are as follows : (1) this novel strategy enables the fast and reproducible formation of an important number of cardiac tissues (up to 21 per well in a 96-well format) with a limited number of hiPSC-cardiomyocytes (112,500 per well); (2) In this assay, fibroblasts are essential to generate and maintain the tissue structure, with a 3:1 hiPSC- CMs:fibroblast ratio providing with the best yield of tissue generation; (3) The self-organized ring-shaped cardiac tissues contract and deform the optically-transparent central pillar, which can be recorded and analyzed to estimate the contractile force developed by the tissue; (4) These ring-shaped tissues are compatible with live fluorescence imaging and allow the simultaneous measurement of contractile parameters and another readout provided by a fluorescent probe; (5) These EHTs display concordant responses to positive or negative inotropes, and to arrhythmogenic drugs, as required for drug testing applications.</p>
<p>The miniaturized cardiac constructs develop by self-organization of the hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, which are guided by a specific design to acquire a ring shape. The resulting EHTs are in a convenient 96-well plate format and easy to use for a user familiar with cell biology techniques. The 96-well plate format is adaptable to many plate readers and automated platforms. In addition, the optical clarity of the gels and the absence of gel directly under the structures ensures optimal imaging conditions. We showed that the tissues can be fixed, stained by immunofluorescence and imaged <italic>in situ</italic> at high resolution. Moreover, our EHTs are also be compatible with live cell imaging experiments with fluorescent reporters, such as the FluoVolt voltage-sensitive dye, for which we presented a proof-of-concept. Indeed, we demonstrated that while measuring the depolarization of the cells by imaging the fluorescence over time, we could simultaneously monitor the contraction parameters <italic>in situ</italic> through the deformation of the pillar. This possibility to simultaneously record two parameters represents a significant asset, as this proof-of-concept can be extended to other fluorescent probes.</p>
<p>The current design of our EHTs consists of up to 21 rings in a single well, thus providing many replicates within a single experiment, even if some of the rings fail to form due to biological variability. This high throughput can compensate for potential intra-batch effects. Moreover, the possibility to seed several wells at the same time allows to easily study several differentiations, compensating for the variability which is inherent to the differentiation of hiPSCs. The predictable circular shape of the tissues makes them easy to recognize and track using software. Coupled with the known organization of the 21 rings for easy automated imaging, a single well can quickly generate data on many tissues that is quickly and automatically analyzed. The EHTs we described here are thus easy to use, image, manipulate and obtain readouts from.</p>
<p>We found that the circular geometry of these self-organized cardiac tissues induces a homogeneous distribution of the cardiomyocytes and consequently of the contraction forces around the pillar and in the tissue. Importantly, the presence of the central pillar not only allows resistance to be felt by the tissue, but the control of its stiffness facilitates the calculation of the force developed by the tissue. Our results showed that the tissues develop a fractional shortening (or contraction strain) of about 25%, which is close to the contraction of a human heart (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cheng et al. (2010)</xref></italic></bold>). The corresponding stress was 1.4 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> which is in a similar range to other previously reported tissue-engineered cardiac muscle models with hiPSC-CMs in the literature (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seguret et al. (2021)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Turnbull et al. (2014)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shadrin et al.

(2020)</xref></italic></bold>). Some studies have reported higher force values (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ronaldson-Bouchard et al. (2018)</xref></italic></bold>) but in tissues that have a much large size than the tissues proposed here. The force generated by the adult human heart muscle, around 44 mM/mm<sup>2</sup> for a tissue strip (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hasenfuss et al. (1991)</xref></italic></bold>), however remains significantly higher than the force developed by the currently available platforms. Few cardiac assays can precisely monitor the force exerted by the tissues. Indeed, cardiac cells seeded on micropillars (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rodriguez et al. (2014)</xref></italic></bold>) and gels containing tracking beads (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dou et al. (2021)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Feyen et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold>) can provide information on local (subcellular) force exertion. The force measurements do not result from the concerted effort of an organized tissue composed of aligned cardiomyocytes, as proposed by ring-shaped tissues. Tissues attached on two posts (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Turnbull et al. (2014)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mannhardt et al. (2016)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abilez et al. (2018)</xref></italic></bold>) can also provide some information on the force generated by a tissue but the force exertion is not radial as it is in the native heart. Moreover, the presence of the posts can impact the contraction by affecting the force distribution in the tissue and creating potential edge effects in the vicinity of the posts, inducing the formation of v-necks (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abilez et al. (2018)</xref></italic></bold>). Lastly, some other ring-shaped cardiac constructs have to be transferred on posts or on a force transducer to measure their contraction force (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Goldfracht et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tiburcy et al. (2017)</xref></italic></bold>). Therefore, the easy <italic>in situ</italic> monitoring of the force generated by our ring-shaped tissues with an image analysis routine represents a significant advantage, as less manipulation improves the degree of standardization. Finally, the stiffness of the central pillar can easily be adapted to model a pathological increase or decrease of the extracellular matrix stiffness. The EHTs we developed are composed of cardiomyocytes that rely on fibroblasts for their assembly and inter-cellular adhesion. Fibroblasts have been shown to play a prominent role in the heart as they are crucial in the constitution of the supporting extracellular matrix and contribute to cardiomyocyte electrical coupling, conduction system insulation, vascular maintenance, and stress-sensing (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ivey and Tallquist (2016)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baudino et al. (2006)</xref></italic></bold>). Other studies have highlighted the importance of a multi-cellular approach to generate EHTs (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Giacomelli et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Saini et al. (2015)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Amano et al. (2016)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Caspi et al. (2007)</xref></italic></bold>). In our system, the fibroblasts additionally play a role in providing a basement support under the cardiomyocytes, in contact with the glass support of the EHTs. Immunofluorescence imaging showed an organization of the cardiomyocytes parallel to each other, perpendicular to the direction of contraction, with an increased alignment of sarcomeres. Our EHTs mimic the composition and organization of the native myocardial tissue, even if only composed of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. Future experiments will determine whether other, less abundant, cell types of the native myocardium, such as endothelial or smooth muscle cells, can further improve heart tissue modeling.</p>
<p>The constructs showed a spontaneous beating in the day following seeding and this activity was maintained over several weeks thus allowing contractile measurements and pharmacological testing in the conditions of auto-pacing. Since <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold> highlighted the occurrence of re-entrant waves in their circular cardiac tissues, we investigated the arrhythmogenicity of our tissues and performed live imaging of depolarization in the tissues to evaluate the presence of re-entrant waves. We were able to show that our cardiac tissues beat regularly, and we were able to correlate the depolarization with contraction over time. The next step would be to correct the fluorescence profile to account for tissue deformation in order to study tissue repolarization. This would require the development of a complex pixel-tracking code. The analysis of re-entrant waves is however hampered by a technical limitation. Indeed, it has been shown that the conduction velocity in iPSC-CMs is around 10-20 cm.s<sup>−1</sup>, compared to 40-60 cm.s<sup>−1</sup> in adult cardiomyocytes <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ahmed et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold>. Here we image our tissues at the maximum speed allowed by our camera, which is between 40 and 50 frames per second, which is faster than in <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold>. However, our constructs are smaller, with a perimeter of about 1.3 mm, and therefore, the required camera speed to detect the conduction in tissues should be at least of 120 fps if we consider a conduction speed of 15 cm.s<sup>−1</sup>. Hence we were not able to detect conduction in our tissues, nor re-entrant waves.</p>
<p>This first study is nevertheless a proof of concept for live imaging in miniature ring-shaped tissues, already allowing us to correlate the depolarization peaks with contraction peaks thus reflecting the excitation-contraction coupling efficiency in the tissues. Additional efforts, especially with a faster camera, will be needed to more accurately analyze tissue conduction and detect re-entrant waves. As a proof-of-concept, we also studied the effects of well-established negative and positive inotropes and showed the ability of our platform to reproduce the anticipated effects. We observed that our tissues presented a positive inotropic response to increasing extracellular calcium concentration with a corresponding EC<sub>50</sub> which is in agreement with the values reported in the literature for engineered heart tissues made of hiPSC-CM, which are between 0.4 and 1.8mM for the EC<sub>50</sub> (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Feric and Radisic (2016)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schaaf et al. (2011)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Streckfuss-Bömeke et al. (2013)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mannhardt et al.

(2020)</xref></italic></bold>). The negative inotropic response to increasing concentrations of verapamil of our constructs was also described in the literature and our IC<sub>50</sub> value is also in the range of reported values in other EHTs: Turnbull et al. <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Turnbull et al. (2014)</xref></italic></bold> found IC<sub>50</sub>=0.61 µM and other papers range from 0.3 µM to 0.6 µM (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mannhardt et al. (2016)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Thavandiran (2019)</xref></italic></bold>). The <italic>β</italic>-adrenergic stimulation of the tissues with increasing concentrations of isoproterenol-induced a trend towards increase in the contraction force and significantly increased contraction and relaxation speeds without change in the beat rate. This result may be surprising, as many articles report a positive chronotropic behavior for spontaneous hiPSC-CMs, while the inotropic response is less often highlighted (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">de Lange et al. (2021)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al. (2015)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ronaldson-Bouchard et al. (2018)</xref></italic></bold>). Nevertheless the increase in contraction and relaxation speeds that we observed is consistent with data reported in the literature. Our hypothesis is that this increase in contraction and relaxation speeds induced by isoproterenol is translated, on average in our study, into an increase in contractile force rather than in an increase in contraction frequency. This may depend on the cell line used, and is very well illustrated in <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mannhardt et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold>: of the 10 different cell lines tested in engineered heart tissues, all show an increase in contraction and relaxation speeds after isoproterenol administration, but this is translated either into an increase in contractile force (4 cell lines) or into a shortening of the beat (3 cell lines), and only 2 cell lines show an increase in both parameters. Indeed, since hiPSC-CMs are immature cardiac cells, it is rare to obtain a positive force-frequency relationship without any maturation medium or mechanical or electrical training. Last, applying increasing dofetilide concentrations on our constructs showed a decrease in the contraction amplitude and contraction and relaxation speeds. This is in line with the literature as <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhao et al. (2019)</xref></italic></bold> depicted a significant reduction of the action potential amplitude and an increase in action potential durations of the tissues with increasing dofetilide concentration, in line with <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huo et al. (2019)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Blinova et al. (2017)</xref></italic></bold>. Above a concentration of 10nM, dofetilide shows cardiotoxicity in our tissues as tissues completely stop beating. By assessing the beating regularity by plotting each period as a function of the previous one for doses of 0nM to 7nM of dofetilide, we highlighted an increasing number of erratic beats with the increase in dofetilide concentration. Other papers have also underlined the pro-arrhythmic effect of dofetilide on cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Goldfracht et al. (2019)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Patel et al. (2019)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Altrocchi et al. (2020)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Blinova et al. (2017)</xref></italic></bold>) and this drug has been shown to induce atrial fibrillation, torsade-de-pointes and heart failure in patients (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abraham et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shantsila et al., 2007</xref></italic></bold>). Therefore, we demonstrated that our platform recapitulated the expected cardiac responses to several inotropes and arrhythmogenic drugs.</p>
<p>While representing a significant improvement, our platform presents some limitations. First, the size of the rings is very small compared to native tissue (400 µm). This size limitation is necessary for the purposes of high throughput screening, but for applications requiring larger tissues, wider rings can be considered in the future. Second, all measurements were performed under spontaneous pacing as a specific technique should be developed to allow external pacing of the tissues in the 96-well format. This includes electrical field stimulation or an optogenetics system with light stimulation. The precise and regular organization of the rings in the well makes this design very amenable to the introduction of microelectrodes for pacing, which could also allow the measurement of the action potentials of individual micro-tissues. Nevertheless, our main results show that pharmacological responses, including the detection of the pro-arrhythmogenic effects of dofetilide, were correctly measured under spontaneous beating conditions. Third, the miniaturized format of our platform creates some limitations and challenges regarding some experiments, including tissue stretching. Therefore, the length-tension relationships (Franck-Starling mechanism) were not determined in our tissues.</p>
<p>Overall the novel platform we describe here is a versatile, easy-to-use and high-throughput tool to generate cardiac rings in a reproducible way and analyze them <italic>in situ</italic>. This platform will be useful in several cardiac research fields, including disease modeling and pharmacological testing.</p>

To check the shape of the interior cavities of the mold, a cast of the mold was created out of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Sylgard 184, Samaro), according to manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>3D hydrogel substrate preparation</title>
<p>A solution of 5% w/w photopolymerizable polyethylene glycol (PEG) was prepared in distilled water. Circular coverslips (16 mm, Paul Marienfeld GmbH, Germany) were silanized to ensure adequate bonding between the PEG and glass. A drop of 10-15 <italic>μ</italic>L of gel was placed on the stainless steel mold, which was then placed in contact with a silanized coverslip. The gel solution was briefly exposed to light of the appropriate wavelength to polymerize the hydrogel. The resulting 3D structured hydrogel, bound to the coverslip, was unmolded and immediately placed in distilled water. The hydrogel was rinsed at least three times with distilled water and incubated in water overnight. For cell experiments, the coverslip coated in a 3D hydrogel was briefly dried and attached to a commercial black polystyrene 96-well plate with an adhesive backing (Grace Bio-labs, USA). The resulting well was filled with distilled water. Prior cell seeding, the plate was sterilized by UV irradiation for at least 20 minutes.</p>

<title>Young’s modulus measurements of the molds</title>
<p>The PEG-based hydrogel solutions were prepared and 100µL of solution was deposited into a ring-shaped mold with an inner diameter of 1cm positioned on a 16mm glass coverslip. The solution was polymerized using 365nm UV light for 1 minute at a power of 70 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, after which the mold was removed. The coverslip containing the gel was then transferred to the microscope (Leica camera AG, Germany). A hollow glass capillary with an inner diameter 0.75mm (World Precision Instruments, USA) was attached to a platform movable in the xy-plane which was used to position the capillary right next to the edge of the circular polymerized hydrogel. Once the capillary and the hydrogel made contact, a negative pressure was applied, using the Cobalt autonomous pressure pump (Elvesys, France), creating a small convexity in the surface of the hydrogel. Images of this convexity were taken (5X magnification) for a pressure ranging from −100mbar to −200mbar, with 10 mbar increments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>.). Two measurements were done on two separate gels, resulting in 4 measurements per gel with 10 datapoints each. The images (and thus the size of the convexities) were analyzed using ImageJ (version 1.53c). The Young’s modulus was calculated with the formula <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534303v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> according to literature (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gandin et al.

<title>Cardiomyocyte differentiation and culture</title>
<p>The SKiPSC-31.3 hiPSC cell line, from a healthy control subject, has been used here and was previously reported (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Galende et al.

At 80 % confluency, cells were passaged with ReleSR reagent (StemCell Technologies). When hiPSCs reached a 90 % confluency, differentiation was carried out according to a protocol adapted from <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Garg et al. (2018)</xref></italic></bold>. Briefly, on day 0 of differentiation, mTESR Plus was changed to RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with B27 without insulin (RPMI-B27 minus insulin) and 6 µM CHIR-99021 (Abcam). After 48 hours, the medium was changed to RPMI-B27 minus insulin and then to RPMI-B27 minus insulin with 5µM IWR-1 (Sigma) for 48 hours. On day 5, the medium was replaced by RPMI-B27 minus insulin, and switched to RPMI-B27 with insulin on day 7. At day 11 a glucose starvation was carried out by replacing the medium with RPMI 1640 without glucose (Life Technologies), supplemented by B27 with insulin for 3 days. Cells were then dissociated with 0.05% trypsin (Life Technologies) and replated in a 12-well plate at a density of 0.3 10<sup>6</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in RPMI-B27 with insulin. The following day, the medium was switched back to RPMI 1640 without glucose (Life Technologies), supplemented by B27 with insulin for 3 days again. These two rounds of glucose starvation have been shown to increase dramatically the percentage of cardiomyocytes obtained <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sharma et al.

<title>Cardiomyocyte characterization</title>
<p>The efficiency of the differentiation was assessed by cardiac troponin T flow cytometry at D21. On day 21 of differentiation, hiPSC-CMs were dissociated by enzymatic digestion (Miltenyi Multi Tissue dissociation kit 3) and stained with the Zombie NIR™ Fixable Viability Kit (BioLegend). Then, collected cell pellets were fixed and permeabilized using Inside Stain kit (Miltenyi Biotech, 130-090-477) at room temperature for 10 minutes. Cells were incubated with either APC anti-cardiac troponin T (CTNT) antibody (Miltenyi Biotech; 130-106-689 1:100) or APC isotype control (Miltenyi Biotech, 130-104-615 1:100) for 10 min at room temperature.

<title>Human fibroblasts culture</title>
<p>Commercially available normal adult human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF-Ad Lonza CC-2511, Lot 545147) were used up to passage 6 to generate the tissues. They were cultured in T75 flasks, in DMEM high glucose, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% NEAA and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.</p>

<p>The wells of the assay were first rinsed twice with PBS and incubated at 37°C in DMEM high glucose, 2.3 mM CaCl2, 10%FBS, 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin. To generate the tissues, cardiomyocytes were dissociated by enzymatic digestion (Miltenyi Multi Tissue dissociation kit 3) on day 22 after differentiation. Fibroblasts were dissociated with TrypLE Express Enzyme (12605010 Thermofischer). Three ratios of hiPSC-CMs:fibroblasts were tested: 4:1, 3:1 and 2:1. For the following experiments the tissues are generated with a ratio of 3:1 hiPSC-CMs:fibroblasts as this ratio allowed the best preservation of tissues in time. A total of 150k cells were seeded in each well. The required numbers of fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes were then mixed and resuspended in 200µL per well of DMEM high glucose, 2.3 mM CaCl2, 10%FBS, 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin. The plate was then incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes and centrifuged 3 times in “short” mode to ensure that the cells fall into the circular molds. The plate was then kept at 37°C and the medium was changed every two days.</p>

<title>Tissues recording and analysis</title>
<p>The cardiac rings were recorded for 10 seconds in brightfield imaging with a high speed CCD camera (PL-D672MU, Pixelink) mounted on a microscope (Primovert, Zeiss), at a 10X magnification. The videos were then analyzed with a custom Matlab script. Briefly, the area of the central pillar is monitored in time and allows to recover the contraction amplitude in time Amplitude(t)= Max(Area)-Area(t) and therefore the contraction strain in time (in terms of area) <italic>ε</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> calculated as <italic>ε</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) = (<italic>Max</italic>(<italic>Area</italic>) − <italic>Area</italic>(<italic>t</italic>))∕<italic>Max</italic>(<italic>Area</italic>) as well as the derivative of this strain in time. <italic>ε</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is linked to the linear strain <italic>ε</italic> with the formula <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="534303v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. As we measured the Young’s Modulus of the gel, we can recover the stress developed by the cardiac rings <italic>σ</italic> = <italic>E</italic>.<italic>ε</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). From these traces we also derive the contraction frequency by Fourier transform. It was considered that below a contraction of 0.5 %, the signal to noise ratio was not sufficient enough to detect the contraction of the tissue and the beating frequency was therefore set to 0 Hz. Finally, the maximum contraction and relaxation speeds of the tissue were also calculated respectively from the maxima and minima of the derivative of this strain in time.</p>

<title>Response to increasing extracellular calcium concentration and drug tests</title>
<p>Tissues response to different drugs and increasing calcium concentrations was assessed after day 14. For the increasing extracellular calcium concentrations, tissues were first changed to Tyrode solution 0.5 mM in calcium (NaCl 140 mM, KCl 5 mM, 10 mM Hepes, Glucose 10 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5 mM, pH 7.4) and let to equilibrate for 30 minutes at 37°C, 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>. Calcium concentration was then increased by sequential addition of a Tyrode solution at 10mM in calcium. After each addition, the tissues were incubated for 5 minutes before recording. For drug tests, tissues were changed to Tyrode solution at 1.8mM in calcium (NaCl 14 mM, KCl 5 mM, 10 mM Hepes, Glucose 10 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8 mM, pH 7.4) and let to equilibrate for 30 minutes at 37°C, 5% CO2. To evaluate the dose-response of the cardiac rings to the different drugs (Verapamil-sigma v0100000, isoproterenol - sigma 1351005, dofetilide - sigma PZ0016), the contractility was first recorded for 30 seconds in basal state and the drug was then added sequentially.

<p>The manuscript, &quot;A versatile high-throughput assay based on 3D ring-shaped cardiac tissues generated from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes,&quot; developed a unique culture platform with PEG hydrogel that facilitates the in-situ measurement of contractile dynamics of the engineered cardiac rings. The authors optimized the tissue seeding conditions, demonstrated tissue morphology with expressions of cardiac and fibroblast markers, mathematically modeled the equation to derive contractile forces and other parameters based on imaging analysis, and concluded by testing several compounds with known cardiac responses.</p>
<p>The authors answered my questions with appropriate experiments and explanation.</p>
<p>(1) This paper presents an intriguing platform that creates miniature cardiac rings with merely thousands of cardiomyocytes per tissue in a 96-well plate format. The shape of the ring and the squeezing motion can recapitulate the contraction of the cardiac chamber to a certain degree. However, Thavandiran et al. (PNAS 2013) created a larger version of the cardiac ring and found that electrical propagation revealed spontaneous infinite loop-like cycles of activation propagation traversing the ring. This model was used to mimic a reentrant wave during arrhythmia. Therefore, there are concerns about whether a large number of cardiac tissues experience arrhythmia due to geometry-induced re-entry current and cannot be used as a healthy tissue model.</p>
<p>In the new experiment, the authors demonstrated with voltage-sensitive dye that these miniaturized tissues do not experience any arrhythmia, potentially due to their small size.</p>
<p>(2) The platform can produce 21 cardiac rings per well in 96-well plates, with the throughput being the highest among competing platforms. The resulting tissues exhibit good sarcomere striation due to the strain from the pillars. However, emerging questions pertain to culture longevity and reproducibility among tissues. According to Figure 1E, uneven ring formation around the pillar leads to tissue thinning and breakage. Only 50% survival is observed after 20 days of culture in the optimized seeding group. Are there any strategies to improve this survival rate? Additionally, do the cardiac rings detach from the glass slides and roll up, given the two compartments with cardiac and fibroblast-rich regions where fibroblasts maintain attachment to the glass slides? Moreover, the standard deviation of force measurement is a quarter of the value, which is suboptimal given the high replicate number. As the platform utilizes imaging analysis to derive contractile dynamics, calibration based on the angle and distance of the camera lens to individual tissues should be conducted to reduce error. On the other hand, how reproducible are the pillars? It is highly recommended to mechanically evaluate the consistency of the hydrogel-based pillars across different wells and within wells to understand the variance.</p>
<p>The authors stated that the platform has been tested and improved with multiple cell lines to enhance tissue survival rates. The methodology of image capture and calculation of contractile dynamics were explained in detail to address concerns. Moreover, the reproducibility of the pillars was demonstrated by consistent results of Young's Modulus (AFM) from each pillar, showing low standard deviations.</p>
<p>(3) Does the platform allow the observation of non-synchronized beating when testing with compounds? This can be extremely important as the intended applications of this platform are drug testing and cardiac disease modeling. The author should elaborate on the method in the manuscript and explain the obtained results in detail.</p>
<p>Referring to Question #1, the platform does not present arrythmia potentially due to the small size of the tissue.</p>
<p>(4) The results of drug testing are interesting. Isoperenoral is typically causing positive chronotropic and positive inotropic responses, where inotropic responses are difficult to obtain due to low tissue maturity. It is inconsistent with other reported results that cardiac rings do not exhibit increased beating frequency, but slightly increased forces only.</p>
<p>The authors repeated the experiment with the same results and hypothesized that the results would be line-dependent, since the maturation of iPSC-CM is not consistent. The additional dose curves provided more information on the tissue behaviors against well-known compounds.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well-written, and the designed platform presents unique advantages for high-throughput cardiac tissue culture. The paper has adequate data to demonstrate the proof-of-concept study of the platform. The throughput, consistency of the tissue, and the potential integration of high-throughput automation would be the highlights of this platform.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The author should evaluate the possibility of naturally occurring arrhythmia due to the geometry of the tissues, by using voltage or calcium dye.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have performed new experiments using a voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye (i.e. FluoVolt) with data reported in the new Figure 4 + new results section “arrhythmia analysis”. Briefly, we found that our ring-shaped tissues are compatible with live fluorescence imaging.  We were then able to show that our cardiac tissues beat regularly, without naturally occurring arrhythmias or extra beats. We could not detect any re-entrant waves in our tissues in the conditions offered by the speed of our camera. A specific paragraph has also been added to the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There is only 50% survival after 20 days of culture in the optimized seeding group. Is there any way to improve it? The tissues had two compartments, cardiac and fibroblast-rich regions, where fibroblasts are responsible for maintaining the attachment to the glass slides. Do the cardiac rings detach from the glass slides and roll up? The SD of the force measurement is a quarter of the value, which is not ideal with such a high replicate number.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: This paper report seminal data that will serve as a foundation for further use of the platform. We are currently expanding to other cell lines with improvement in survival (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/161356">https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/161356</ext-link>). We confirm that the rings do not detach. The pillar was specifically designed to avoid this (See figure 1B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As the platform utilizes imaging analysis to derive contractile dynamics, calibration should be done based on the angle and the distance of the camera lens to the individual tissues to reduce the error. On the other hand, how reproducible of the pillars? It is highly recommended to mechanically evaluate the consistency of the hydrogel-based pillars across different wells and within the wells to understand the variance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We propose a system and a measurement method that do not need calibration. Contraction amplitude is expressed as a ratio between the contracted / relaxed areas (See figure 3 A). There is thus no influence of the distance of the camera lens.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the consistency of the mechanical properties of the hydrogel, we reproduced the experiment pictured in Figure1-Supplement 1, and measured the Young’s Modulus of three different gel solutions on different days. In the three experiments performed, we found values of 10.0-12.2 kPa, resulting in a final average value of 11.2 (+/- 0.6) kPa, coherent with the value reported in the article. We are therefore confident that the mechanical properties are consistent across and within wells. More extensive mechanical characterization of the molded gels would require the access to an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), and is considered in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The author should address the longevity and reproducibility issues, by working on the calibration of camera lens position/distance to tissues and further optimizing the seeding conditions with hydrogels such as collagen or fibrin, and/or making sure the PEG gels have high reproducibility and consistency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: This paper report seminal data that will serve as a foundation for further use of the platform. This platform (including the design, approach and choice of polymers) allows a fast and reproducible formation of an important number of cardiac tissues (up to 21 per well in a 96-well format, meaning a potential total of about 2,000 tissues) with a limited number of cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The evaluation of the arrhythmia should be more extensively explained and demonstrated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer : See answer to comment 1</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The results of isoproterenol should be checked as non-paced tissues should have increased beating frequency with increasing dosages. Dofetilide does not typically have a negative inotropic effect on the tissues. Please check on the cell viability before and after dosing</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer : We agree with this reviewer on the principle. However, we have repeated the experiments and we confirm our results, i.e. increasing concentrations of isoproterenol induced a trend towards increase in the contraction force and significantly increased contraction and relaxation speeds without change in the beat rate (Figure 5C). We do not have a definitive explanation for this observation. Our hypothesis is that this increase in contraction and relaxation speeds induced by isoproterenol is translated, on average in our study, into an increase in contractile force rather than in an increase in contraction frequency. This may depend on the cell line used, and is very well illustrated in a recent paper from Mannhardt and colleagues (Stem cell reports. 2020; 15(4):983–998). Of the 10 different cell lines tested in engineered heart tissues, all show an increase in contraction and relaxation speeds after isoproterenol administration, but this is translated either into an increase in contractile force (4 cell lines) or into a shortening of the beat (3 cell lines), and only 2 cell lines show an increase in both parameters. Indeed, since iPSC-CMs are immature cardiac cells, it is rare to obtain a positive force-frequency relationship without any maturation medium or mechanical or electrical training.
We agree that above a concentration of 10nM, dofetilide shows cardiotoxicity in our tissues as tissues completely stop beating.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In addition to the general comments in the public review, I have the following specific suggestions to the authors, that would help improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Please describe the protocol for preparation of cardiac rings (shown in Figure 1C) in more detail. In particular, please describe how the tissues were transferred from the mold into the 96-well plate and how are they positioned and characterized during the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: There is no transfer of the tissues as they directly form in the well, that is pre-equipped with the molded PEG gel (See Figure 1B and methods section). The in situ analysis is a strong asset of this platform.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Please clarify the timepoints in this study. The overall schematic in Figure 1 C shows that the rings were formed on day 22 and then studied for 14 days, while Figure 2B shows data over 20 days following seeding, and Figure 3 shows data 14 days after seeding. It appears that these were separate studies (optimization of myocyte/fibroblast ratio followed by the main study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Figure 1C is showing the timeline including the cardiomyocytes differentiation. hiPSC-CMs are indeed seeded in the wells 22 days after starting the differentiation, which represent the Day0 for tissue formation. We apologize for the confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Please explain if the number of rings per well (Figure 2) was used as the only criterion for selecting the myocyte/fibroblast ratio, and if so, why. Were these rings also characterized for their structural and contractile properties?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Figure 2 supplement 1 report the contractility data according to the different tested ratios, and show no differences. The number for generated ring-shaped tissues was indeed the only criterion retained.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Please provide rationale for using the dermal rather than cardiac fibroblasts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We had previous experience generating EHTs using dermal fibroblasts which are easier to obtain commercially. Our approach could in theory also work using cardiac fibroblasts, which we have not tested in the present study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 2 panels C-E show an interesting segregation of cardiomyocytes into a thin cylindrical layer that does not appear to contain fibroblasts and a shorter and thicker cylinder containing fibroblasts mixed with occasional myocytes. Please specify at which time point this structure forms, and how does it change over time in culture? At which time point were the images taken? It would be helpful to include serial images taken over 1-14 days of study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for this interesting comment. We have performed additional immunostainings (reported in Figure 2 supplement 3) on tissues at Day 1 and day 7 after seeding. The segregation appears in the 7 first days. It appears that 1 day after seeding the fibroblasts are not yet attached, although the cardiac fiber has already started to be formed. Seven days after seeding, fibroblasts are fully spread and attached, and the contractile ring is formed and well-aligned. Brightfield images are reported in Figure 1E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In the cardiomyocyte region (Figure 2D) the cells staining for troponin seem to be only at the surfaces. The thickness of the layer is only about 30-40 µµ, so one would assume that cell viability was not an issue. Please specify and discuss the composition of this region.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree but we think this is a technical issue as at the center of the tissue, tissue thickness will limit laser penetration, although at the surface (inner our outer), the laser infiltrates easily between the tissue and the PEG. Moreover, we see on the zoomed view of the tissue in Figure 2 Supplement 2 that we have a staining inside the cardiac fiber, which just appears less strong due to tissue thickness.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Please also discuss segregation in terms of possible causes and the implications of apparently very limited contact between the two cell types, i.e., how representative is this two-region morphology of native heart tissue. Also, it would be interesting to know how the segregation has changed with the change in myocyte/fibroblast ratio.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We are not sure there is a very limited contact as the use of fibroblasts is critical to ensure the formation of tissues (i.e. no tissues can be formed if we avoid the use of fibroblasts). We agree that these ring-shaped cardiac tissues are not especially representative of a native heart tissue in terms of interactions between several cell types. They were developed as a surrogate for physiopathological and pharmacological experiments (see a recent application in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/161356">https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/161356</ext-link>)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) There is interest and demonstrated ability to culture engineered cardiac tissues over longer periods of time. Please comment what was the rationale for selecting 14-day culture and if the system allows longer culture durations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: In line with this comment, we have studied the contractile parameters of our rings 28 days after seeding and compared to their contractile parameters at D14. We found a slight increase for all the parameters, which is significant for the maximum contraction speed. Nevertheless, the data is much more variable and the number of tissues is lower (29 for D14 against 17 for D28). Therefore, we demonstrated that long-term culture of our tissues is possible, however not yet optimized. Hence, the following physiological and pharmacological tests have been done at D14.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Figure 3 documents the development of contractile parameters over 14 days of culture. Would it be possible to replace the arbitrary units with the actual values? Also, would it be possible to include the corresponding images of the rings taken at the same time points, to show the associated changes in ring morphologies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Contraction amplitude is expressed as a ratio between the contracted / relaxed areas (See figure 3 A): it is a ratio, thus without unit.  Corresponding images can be seen in Figure 1 E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) The measured contraction stress, strain, and the speeds of contraction and relaxation improve from day 1 to day 7 and then plateau (Figure 3, Supplemental Figure 3. Please discuss this result.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: The new immunostainings performed on tissues at Day 1 and Day 7 show the progressive alignment of the cardiomyocytes and the muscular fibers, with an almost complete organization at Day 7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The beating frequency does not appear to markedly change over time, while Figure 3B shows strong statistical significance (***) throughout the 14-day period. Please check/confirm.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We confirm this result.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) Please comment on the lack of effect of isoproterenol on beating frequency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree with this reviewer on the principle. However, we have repeated the experiments and we confirm our results, i.e. increasing concentrations of isoproterenol induced a trend towards increase in the contraction force and significantly increased contraction and relaxation speeds without change in the beat rate (Figure 5C). We do not have a definitive explanation for this observation. Our hypothesis is that this increase in contraction and relaxation speeds induced by isoproterenol is translated, on average in our study, into an increase in contractile force rather than in an increase in contraction frequency. This may depend on the cell line used, and is very well illustrated in a recent paper from Mannhardt and colleagues (Stem cell reports. 2020; 15(4):983–998). Of the 10 different cell lines tested in engineered heart tissues, all show an increase in contraction and relaxation speeds after isoproterenol administration, but this is translated either into an increase in contractile force (4 cell lines) or into a shortening of the beat (3 cell lines), and only 2 cell lines show an increase in both parameters. Indeed, since iPSC-CMs are immature cardiac cells, it is rare to obtain a positive force-frequency relationship without any maturation medium or mechanical or electrical training.</p>

<p>(13) Please compare the contractile function of cardiac tissues measured in this study with data reported for other iPSC-derived tissue models.</p>
