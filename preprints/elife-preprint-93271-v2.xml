<title>Abstract</title><p>The human GABA transporter (GAT1) is a membrane transporter that mediates the reuptake of the neurotransmitter GABA from the synaptic cleft into neurons and glial cells. Dysregulation of the transport cycle has been associated with epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting the crucial role of the transporter in maintaining homeostasis of brain GABA levels. GAT1 is a secondary active transporter that couples the movement of substrate to the simultaneous transport of sodium and chloride ions along their electrochemical gradients. Using MD simulations, we identified a novel sodium recruiting site at the entrance to the outer vestibule, which attracts positively charged ions and increases the local sodium concentration, thereby indirectly increasing sodium affinity. Mutations of negatively charged residues at the recruiting site slowed the binding kinetics, while experimental data revealed a change in sodium dependency of GABA uptake and a reduction of sodium affinity. Simulation showed that sodium displays a higher affinity for the sodium binding site NA2, which plays a role in stabilisation of the outward-open conformation. We directly show that the presence of a sodium ion bound to NA2 increases the stability of the closed inner gate and restrains motions of TM5. We find that sodium is only weakly bound to NA1 in the absence of GABA, while the presence of the substrate strengthens the interaction due to the completed ion coordinating shell, explaining cooperativity between GABA and sodium.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We thank our reviewer for their thorough evaluation and their constructive comments, which have helped to improve the manuscript. We have enhanced the description of the sodium recruiting site, created new figures, which clearly show structural details and sodium density. We conducted the suggested experiments, created the single GAT1 mutants D281A and E283A at the sodium recruiting site and measured surface expression, GABA uptake and sodium dependence. The data shows that E283A is wild-type like, while D281A is intermediate between wild-type and the D281A-E283A double mutant for all measured properties. A sequence alignment of all human SLC6 transporters corroborates these experimental data. The conservation of E283 is low, while D281 is an aspartate in all GABA transporters and a glutamate in all monoamine transporters. We now also give standard deviations and/or p-values for all experimental data. The SI now shows traces of distances between the sodium ion and the recruiting site for every trajectory in which sodium binds to GAT1. We have improved the visualisation of most structural figures to enhance clarity. For the analysis of the principal components (PC), we created new panels in figure 6 that visualise the motions described by the first two PCs. We have added a paragraph describing potential limitations of the AlphaFold model. The observed long-range effect of sodium binding to GAT1 and destabilisation of the inner gate has, based on our data, a causal effect. Motions of TM5a were among the 2 largest motions identified by PCA, which suggest to reflect relevant motions. To directly quantify the structural dynamics of the inner gate, we measured informative distances at the inner gate of GAT1, as shown in Figure 5i,j,k and separated data according to the presence of sodium in NA2. For the following reasons we exclude that the results are a consequence of structural inconsistencies introduced by AlphaFold and therefore not reflecting functionally relevant effect: If depending on the model instead of sodium binding, the effect should not be correlated with the presence of sodium in the NA2 binding site. We have observed the same property in SERT, for which we used experimental structures as starting positions (doi: 10.1038/s41467-023-44637-6), suggesting that this could be a generally mechanism. All available structures from the entire SLC6 family are consistent with structural effects of TM5a in response to bundle domain motions and therefore to binding of sodium to NA2 as stabilizing the outward-open state.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Krnjević and Schwartz, 1967</xref>). Release of GABA from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft triggers hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron through activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ghit et al., 2021</xref>). GABA is removed from the synaptic cleft by several GABA transporters, namely GAT1, GAT2, GAT3 and the betaine/GABA transporter BGT1. These are sodium- and chloride-dependent secondary active transporters from the SLC6 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhatt et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanner, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>) with GAT1 being the first cloned member of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guastella et al., 1990</xref>). Within the GABA transporter family, the presynaptic GAT1 is the main neuronal GABA uptake transporter. Dysregulation of GAT1 function has been associated with epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fischer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kasture et al., 2023</xref>), highlighting the crucial role of GAT1 in maintaining neurotransmitter homeostasis in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bhat et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Schousboe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Schousboe and Madsen, 2017</xref>) GAT1 consists of 12 transmembrane helices (TM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Motiwala et al., 2022</xref>) and shares the pseudo-symmetric inverted repeat motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Forrest et al., 2008</xref>) of the “LeuT fold” with the other SLC6 family members, including the fold defining bacterial small amino acid transporter LeuT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>), the Drosophila dopamine transporter dDAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Penmatsa et al., 2013</xref>), and the human serotonin transporter hSERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Coleman et al., 2016</xref>), which was the first structure for a human transporter of the SLC6 family. TM3, 4, 8 and 9 constitute the core of the rigid scaffold domain, while TM1, 2, 6 and 7 assemble into the more mobile bundle domain. The motion of the bundle domain relative to the scaffold domain allows for alternating access to the central substrate binding site S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Forrest et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Very recently, several inward-facing GAT1 structures and a substrate, sodium and chloride-bound inward-occluded structure were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Motiwala et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nayak et al., 2023</xref>). These conformations together with an AlphaFold2 model of the outward-facing state have allowed to formulate the translocation cycle for GAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nayak et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>) which consists of outward-open, occluded and inward-open states. The conformations of the outward-open and the occluded structures are very similar to the respective conformations observed in other SLC6 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Coleman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Singh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yang and Gouaux, 2021</xref>), confirming shared structural changes across the SLC6 family. In contrast, SLC6 transporter structures differ in the conformation of TM1a of the inward-facing state, whereby for GAT1 several conformations of TM1a were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Motiwala et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nayak et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). For LeuT we have shown that the large motions of TM1a as observed in the micelle solubilized crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>) are incompatible within the membrane environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sohail et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the conformation of TM1a is especially sensitive to the environment.</p>
<p>The concentrative uptake of GABA is enabled by the co-transport with two sodium ions and one chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhatt et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hilgemann and Lu, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keynan and Kanner, 1988</xref>). The chloride binding site and the two sodium binding sites (NA1 and NA2) are located in the centre of the transporter, next to the unwound regions on TM1 and TM6, which form the substrate binding site (S1) together with TM3 and TM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nayak et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zomot et al., 2007</xref>). Structural considerations on LeuT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>), MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Szöllősi and Stockner, 2022</xref>) and biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tavoulari et al., 2016</xref>) indicated that the sodium bound to the NA2 (Na2) is involved in stabilisation of the outward-open state by connecting TM1 of the bundle with TM8 of the scaffold. The sodium ion bound to the NA1 (Na1) is exclusively interacting with the bundle domain. It stabilises the bound substrate by directly interacting with its carboxyl group in GAT1 and LeuT.</p>
<p>Here we present direct evidence for the mechanism by which the two sodium ions exert their function in GAT1. Using a set of 60 simulations starting from the sodium-free outward-open GAT1 state, we investigated sodium binding to and the response of GAT1 to the presence of sodium ions. We observed comparable probability for initial binding of sodium to either NA1 or NA2. Importantly, only Na2 was stably bound, while we observed several unbinding events of Na1 from NA1 and in some cases a transfer of the sodium to NA2. Analysis of the simulations identified a clear sodium entry path with a sodium recruiting site at the entry to the extracellular vestibule and revealed a temporary site in the S1. The role of the recruitment site that includes two negatively charged residues (D281 and E283) on TM6a is to attract sodium ions, which increases the local sodium concentration and accelerates sodium binding. We find that Na1 stabilises GABA in the S1 by including its carboxyl moiety into the first interaction shell of Na1, holding the carboxyl moiety in the same position in space as the carboxylate of the conserved aspartate (D98 in SERT, D79 in DAT) of the monoamine transporters. Na2 is directly linked to the mobility of the bundle domain as Na2 binding reduces its mobility as well as increases the stability of the inner gate between TM1, TM5 and TM6.</p>

<title>The path taken by sodium to reach NA1 and NA2</title>
<p>Sodium ions reach the ion binding sites NA1 and NA2 through the outer vestibule. Binding to the outward-open conformation of SLC6 transporters is a fast process in the nano to microsecond time range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hilgemann and Lu, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bicho and Grewer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hasenhuetl, Freissmuth and Sandtner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Szöllősi and Stockner, 2021</xref>), therefore allowing for an unbiased direct simulation approach. Using 60 independent simulations, we repeatedly observed that sodium ions spontaneously entered the outward-open vestibule of GAT1. To characterise the path that sodium ions take for reaching the S1 and for binding to NA1 and NA2, we derived an averaged sodium density with a 0.1 nm spatial resolution from the sodium positions observed in all simulations. These sodium density maps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) highlight the regions with a high probability of observing sodium ions. The density analysis shows that sodium ions initially accumulate at the rim of the outer vestibule. This sodium recruitment site comprises two negatively charged amino acids (D281 and E283) that are located at the beginning of TM6a (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). The high sodium density at the recruitment site shows that sodium can more likely be found at the recruitment site compared to the extracellular solution. This locally higher concentration increases the probability of binding, because sodium ions can leave the recruitment site in two directions: either (i) enter the open outer vestibule towards the S1, attracted by the negative field in the S1 and the outer vestibule, or (ii) detach from GAT1 and diffuse into the external solution.</p>

<p>The salt bridge of the extracellular gate between R69 and D451 was defined as the structural threshold for considering a sodium ion within the vestibule, because once beyond this gate, ions would typically not leave the vestibule, but reach the S1 and bind to NA1 or NA2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e-g</xref>). We independently analysed trajectories in which sodium would bind to the NA1 or NA2 and found that the routes sodium ions take through the outer vestibule are indistinguishable. Once in the S1, sodium ions immediately bound to NA1 or NA2, or resided for some time in a temporary pre-binding site within the S1 and only in a second step reached NA1 or NA2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h-j</xref>). In some cases, Na1 unbound from the NA1 returning to this temporary site, and occasionally bound to NA2 in a second step. We did not observe unbinding from the NA2. This temporary pre-binding site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g,j</xref>) for sodium overlaps with the region where the positively charged amino group of the substrate GABA resides in the ligand-bound conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). A similar temporary site and comparable binding kinetics were observed in simulations of direct sodium binding to SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Szöllősi and Stockner, 2021</xref>). It also overlaps with the region where the positively charged amino group of serotonin was found in SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gradisch et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yang and Gouaux, 2021</xref>) suggesting that the temporary binding site is a common feature of SLC6 transporters.</p>

<title>Role of the sodium recruitment site</title>
<p>Sodium ions typically interact first with the recruiting site at the beginning of the outer vestibule before passing through the outer vestibule and binding to NA1 or NA2. Although negatively charged residues are present in other regions of the extracellular vestibule, and alternative pathways for sodium entry are available, sodium preferentially follows the same path, presumably, because attracted to the recruitment site. Electrostatic potentials (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h,i</xref>) showed the expected strong negative potential in the S1 and the vestibule, but also revealed a strong negative potential at the recruitment site. The residues D281 and E283 are in the centre of this area of negative electrostatic potential. A sequence alignment of all human SLC6 transporters (Figure S1) showed that the negative charge in position 281 is present in 70% of human SLC6 transporters and is an aspartate in all GABA transporters. Position 283 is polar or charged, but the glutamate amino acid is not conserved among GABA transporters. Their mutation in the paralog transporters DAT and SERT were shown to reduce substrate transport or sodium binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kortagere et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Szöllősi and Stockner, 2021</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> neutralisation of these charges by alanine mutations (D281A-E283A) collapsed the local negative electrostatic potential, as it changed sign and became weekly positive (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1j,k</xref>), supporting the notion of an electrostatic attraction. To explore the impact of D281 and E283 on sodium binding, the double alanine mutation (D281A-E283A) was introduced in GAT1, and ion binding simulations were repeated from the same 60 systems. Consistent with the inference from the electrostatic potential, the density analysis showed a strongly reduced sodium density at the recruitment site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>), confirming that sodium ions are electrostatically attracted and that residues D281 and E283 play a critical role. The overall sodium density in the S1, NA1 and NA2 was also lower due to the slower binding kinetics leading to a lower number of sodium binding events.</p>
<p>To determine the importance of the recruitment site for sodium binding, we quantified the kinetics of sodium entering the S1. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref> shows the time dependent cumulative number of simulations in which a sodium ion enters the S1. The data revealed that the double mutant reduced the binding kinetics as compared to wild-type GAT1, thereby showing that the recruitment site accelerates the rate of sodium binding. Consistent with the density analysis, time-dependent distance plots (Figure S2a,b (wild-type) and Figure S2c (double mutant D281-E283) show that sodium ions typically first interact with the recruitment site in wild-type GAT1 before reaching the S1, while no such initial interaction is seen in the double mutant. To verify this prediction <italic>in vitro</italic>, we mutated D281 and E283 to alanine and stably expressed the single mutants (D281A, E283A) and the double mutant in HEK293 cells to experimentally measure uptake and assessed the transport associated currents. The single mutant E283A was expressed similar to wild-type GAT1 (P=0.5423). However, the D281A mutant and D281A-E283A double mutant exhibited a significant reduction in surface expression by approximately 3-fold and 4-fold, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Plasma membrane localisation was clearly detectable for all variants, as visible in the insert of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>. We quantified intracellular accumulation and membrane expression of the YFP-tagged GAT1 by measuring the mean fluorescence of intracellular and membrane localised GAT1, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). In contrast, the cytosolic fluorescence was similar for wild-type and all three mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a,b</xref>). To verify functional expression of the single mutants (D281A and E283A) and the D281A-E283A variant of GAT1, we measured dose-dependent GABA uptake (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Consistent with surface expression, uptake of GABA was like wild-type (Vmax: 2335.43 ± 571.14 [confidence interval: 2130 - 2508 pmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells/3 min]) for the E283A mutant (Vmax: 2486.83 ± 292.62[confidence interval: 2368 - 2587 pmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells/3 min]), approximately 2-fold lower for the D281A mutant (Vmax: 1486.68 ± 135.74[confidence interval: 1434 - 1537 pmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells/3 min]) and 4-fold lower in the D281A-E283A double mutant (Vmax: 581.17 ± 150.14[confidence interval: 525 - 621 pmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells/3 min]) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Also Km values were similar for wild-type GAT1 (Km: 12.00 ± 4.12 µM [confidence interval: 9.11 - 14.36 µM]) and the E283A mutants (Km: 11.11 ± 1.86 µM [confidence interval: 9.66 - 12.38 µM]), the Km for the D281A mutant was smaller (Km: 7.83 ± 1.00 µM [confidence interval: 6.99 - 8.76 µM]) but the difference was statistically not significant (P=0.0582), while the double mutant (Km: 6.01 ± 2.84 µM [confidence interval: 4.26 - 7.36 µM]) showed a significant twofold lower Km (P=0.0054). This data demonstrates that the transport function of GAT1 was not compromised by the mutations and the differences can mainly be associated with reduced expression.</p>

<p>Simulations suggested that the double mutant (D281A-E283A) would affect sodium binding. To unmask a possible effect of sodium on GABA transport, we carried out GABA uptake with increasing concentrations of transport energising sodium. The results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, b) showed that the EC50 of wild-type GAT1 is 46.00 ± 4.51 μM [confidence interval: 42.14 - 49.34 µM] and single charge neutralisation mutants D281A (57.25 ± 2.82 µM [confidence interval: 54.86 - 58.91 µM]) and E283A (52.08 ± 2.06 µM [confidence interval: 50.11 - 54.01 µM]) had a non-significant effect on the sodium dependency of uptake (P=0.129 and P=0.5515, respectively). In contrast, the D281A-E283A double mutant significantly increased the sodium dependency of GABA transport to 80.73 ± 14,28 μM [confidence interval: 70.13 - 84.19 µM] (P &lt; 0.0001). The observed shift of the concentration response curve to the right showed that the Km of sodium dependency of GABA transport is reduced by 43% in double mutant D281A-E283A, verifying the computational predictions that D281 and E283 at the recruitment site effectively increases the local concentration of sodium at the entry to the outer vestibule, which leads to a locally increased sodium concentration and an enhanced sodium binding.</p>

<title>Local structural changes in the sodium binding sites NA1 and NA2</title>
<p>Binding of ligands is frequently accompanied by structural changes in the protein, both in the immediate vicinity of the binding site and at distant locations. Conformational selection and induced fit are two models that are commonly used to describe the structural changes induced by ligand binding. In the conformational selection model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Monod et al., 1965</xref>), the protein dynamically interchanges between multiple conformations and the ligand selectively binds and stabilises one conformation. In contrast, the induced-fit model (Koshland JR., 1959) describes the protein to initially exist in a conformation that is not fully complementary to the ligand and it undergoes a ligand-induced conformational change upon binding.</p>
<p>To characterise the structural changes of GAT1 upon sodium binding to NA1 and NA2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>), we first calculated the centre of mass (CoM) of the ion binding site(s), and then measured the average distance between the CoM and all coordinating oxygen atoms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b,c</xref>, Figure S3) to quantify their compactness. The averaged compactness of NA1 and NA2 was determined in all simulations which showed sodium binding, whereby each simulation was divided into the pre-binding and post-binding part (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d,e</xref>). The mean compactness of NA1 remained unaffected by sodium binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>), while the breadth of the distribution increased slightly, indicating that in GAT1, sodium binding to the NA1 does not induce the same conformational change as observed for SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Szöllősi and Stockner, 2021</xref>). In contrast, the NA2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>) site showed after sodium binding a clear transition to a more compact geometry, reminiscent of an induced-fit mechanism.</p>

</fig>
<p>The dynamics of Na1 and Na2 differed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5g</xref>). While Na2 was firmly bound to NA2, Na1 remained dynamic. Some trajectories showed an unbinding as Na1 returned to the temporary side and in a few trajectories the sodium ion subsequently bound to NA2. The low binding stability of Na1 is consistent with the lack of an induced fit effect and indicates that interactions of Na1 with the NA1 are weak. We use time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (tICA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Molgedey and Schuster, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Naritomi and Fuchigami, 2013</xref>), which is a dimension reduction method based on the slowest motions, in combination with Markov State Modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zwanzig, 1983</xref>) that allows for quantifying the transition probabilities between microstates to derive the underlying free surface as implemented in PyEMMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scherer et al., 2015</xref>). By applying this method, the simulation frames are first assigned to microstate to discretise the functionally important conformational space as defined by the dimension reduction method tICA. In a second step, a Markov State Model is derived from the transition probabilities between the microstates as observed in the simulations. This analysis allows to derive the free energy landscape of sodium translational motions and to project them into the subspace of the slowest two motions as identified by tICA. The results showed a deep energy minimum for NA2 and a shallow minimum for NA1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5h</xref>). Consistent with the repeatedly observed unbinding of Na1 and the transient binding of sodium to the temporary site before reaching NA1 or NA2, this temporary site in the S1 shows a broad and shallow energy minimum. The energy barrier separating NA1 from the temporary site is small, while a larger energy barrier separates the NA2 from the temporary site, supporting the interpretation of weak binding of Na1 and strong binding of Na2. The free energy profile in the S1 is well described, with many transitions and a dense distribution of microstates. In contrast, the fast transition from the recruitment side to the S1 resulted in a sparse density of microstates, only a few transitions and thus in poor convergence. The relative free energy levels between the recruitment site and the S1 are therefore less certain.</p>

<title>Na2 binding to the outward-facing conformation reduces internal transporter dynamics, thereby stabilising the closed inner gate and increasing structural integrity of TM5a</title>
<p>Next, we posed the question, if sodium binding to NA1 or NA2 would exert an allosteric effect on the overall transporter conformation and dynamics. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the primary motions that occurred prior to and after sodium binding. PCA is a dimension reduction method that allows for identifying and extracting the motions with the largest amplitude in multidimensional data sets. We used PCA to project the dynamics of GAT1 onto the first two principal components (PCs) which represent the two motions with the largest amplitudes. Consistent with the lack of a compacting effect, we find that sodium binding to the NA1 did not have a global structural or dynamic effect on GAT1 (Figure S3). In contrast, binding of sodium to NA2 stabilised GAT1 in the outward-open conformation, which locally glued together TM1a and TM8. The projection of the two largest motions (PC1 and PC2) of GAT1 before and after sodium binding to NA2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a,b</xref>) showed that GAT1 samples multiple conformations in the absence of Na2, consistent with a dynamic transporter. Upon sodium binding, the trajectories showed convergence towards the outward-open conformation, confirming that Na2 stabilises GAT1 in the outward-open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Szöllősi and Stockner, 2022</xref>). Projection of motions along PC1 as vectors on the TM helices of GAT1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c,d</xref>) showed that PC1 is mainly associated with motions of the bundle domain against the scaffold domain, whereby TM6a showing the largest amplitudes. In the absence of Na2, three basins can be observed along PC1, while after Na2 binding only one remains. In addition, PC1 captures motions of lower TM1a (residue 49 to 60) against TM5a (residue 242 to 245) and reduced mobility of the latter. Also PC2 describes motions of the bundle domain, though orthogonal to PC1. Helices with the largest amplitude are TM2, TM6 and TM12.</p>

<p>This data indicates that stabilisation of GAT1 in a specific conformation by Na2 is mos<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?3bciiot">https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?3bciiot</ext-link> likely a consequence of a reduction in bundle domain motions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6e,f</xref>). Similar to PCA, maximum likelihood structural alignment and correlation analysis showed that the largest motion of GAT1 prior to Na2 binding were concerted motions of the bundle domain relative to the scaffold domain. The motions of bundle and scaffold domains at the outer and the inner vestibule were anticorrelated with respect to each other, which is consistent with the rocking bundle model of SLC6 transporter motions. Consistent with the PCA analysis, at the cytosolic side the first part of TM5a showed large motions. Upon binding of Na2, the transporter dynamics were very different. Motions of the bundle domain relative to the scaffold domain were strongly diminished and breathing motions between the extracellular ends of TM5 and TM11 dominated. Na2 binding has therefore a long-range effect on the entire bundle domain, but also on TM5a, which contributes to the formation of the inner hydrophobic gate. Similar observations of a destabilisation of TM5a were linked to the inward-open conformation in both SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Coleman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Merkle et al., 2018</xref>) and LeuT, and were suggested to facilitate the creation of a permeation path from the intracellular side to the NA2 site. We have shown for SERT that destabilisation of TM5a is initiated by substrate occlusion, during which motions of TM5b follow the occluding movement of the bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gradisch et al., 2024</xref>), while simultaneously, TM5a elongates as it remains attached to the scaffold domain. As a consequence, the helical secondary structure of TM5a destabilises and contributes to the opening of the inner gates by weakening of interaction to the bundle domain.</p>
<p>Na2 makes an important contribution to the stabilisation of the inner gate. To quantify the stability of the inner gate, we measured two orthogonal distances at the hydrophobic inner gate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6i</xref>): the contact across the hydrophobic inner gate between F51 (TM1a) and Y241 (TM6), as well as a measure of the length of TM5a by determining the distances between Y227 (TM4) as fixed reference point and Y248 on TM5a. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6i,j</xref> shows distance distribution plots for the two measures. We found that the inner hydrophobic gate is dynamic in the absence of Na2, as GAT1 oscillates by 1 nm along the axis of inner gate opening (F51-Y241), indicating structural instability. The gate stabilised in the closed conformation in the presence of Na2, leading to a single main distance at ∼0.8 nm. Similar to the stability of the inner hydrophobic gate, TM5a (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6g</xref>) showed a broader distribution in the absence of Na2. It condensed to a single main distance of ∼1.9 nm after Na2 binding, indicating that Na2 has a long-range effect on TM5a that leads to its stabilisation. Consistent with GAT1, movements of TM5a have been associated with opening of the inner gate at other members of the SLC6 transporter family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Coleman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Merkle et al., 2018</xref>). To confirm that transporter occlusion alone is sufficient to weaken the inner gate and to prime GAT1 for reaching the inward-open conformation (as observed for SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gradisch <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>)), we carried out five simulations (200 ns each) of the GABA-bound occluded conformation of GAT1 using the recently published occluded structure of <italic>GAT1 (PDB ID: 7Y7W)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Applying the same measures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6j</xref>, k), the simulations showed that in the occluded conformation TM5a is extended by ∼0.5 nm with respect to the NA2-bound outward-open state and that TM1a separated from TM5a by ∼1.0 nm. The observed distributions for the GABA-bound occluded conformation of GAT1 are narrow, suggesting that complete opening of the inner gate is slow and might require an initial movement of Na2 to further destabilise the occluded state to promote a transition to the inward-open state.</p>

<title>Role of NA1 in substrate binding</title>
<p>The behaviour of Na1 differs between the paralogue transporters SERT and GAT1.

<p>To test this hypothesis, we docked GABA into sodium and chloride bound GAT1, carried out four independent 0.5 μs long simulations and compared the trajectories to four 0.5 μs long simulations in the absence of GABA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d-g</xref>). Consistent with the sodium binding simulations, Na1 was unstable and temporarily unbound from the NA1 in the absence of GABA, moving to the temporary site, but remaining within the S1. The compactness of the NA1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>) was consistent with the compactness of the NA1 as observed in the sodium binding simulations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>). Simulations carried out in the presence of GABA were strikingly different: Na1 remained stably bound and the NA1 was more compact. The compacting of the NA1 was reminiscent of an induced fit effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7g</xref>). This data shows that the carboxylate moiety is essential for completing NA1 and is required to stabilise the Na1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The importance of sodium for substrate transport has been characterised at the macroscopic and the kinetic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hilgemann and Lu, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Iversen and Snyder, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mager et al., 1993</xref>) and showed that GABA uptake is energised by the downhill concentration gradient of the co-transported sodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kanner, 1978</xref>). Structural data of transporters from the SLC6 family have revealed the binding sites of substrate and co-transport ions and the main conformations of the transport cycle of GAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nayak et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>We confirmed through direct observations that NA2 functions to stabilise GAT1 in the outward-open conformation and showed that Na2 achieves this by immobilising the scaffold and bundle domains in relation to each other. Meanwhile, NA1 plays a crucial role in securing the GAT1 substrate by directly interacting with its carboxylate component, forming the essential connections that constitute the primary coordination environment of Na1.</p>
<p>Despite all this information, it is not completely clear how the sodium ions would be able to control the GABA transporter at the molecular level. The free energy landscape showed that NA2 binds sodium much stronger than NA1, and that the energy barrier connecting NA1 with a temporary site in the S1 is small. This is reflected in the dynamics of sodium ions. Simulations showed a clear order for sodium binding: the first stably bound sodium enters the NA2 and stabilises the outward-open conformation, thereby priming GAT1 for substrate binding. Once bound to the NA2, we did not observe any indication for unbinding of Na2 during the time course of the simulations. Sodium ions, which initially interacted with NA1, remained mobile, eventually returning to the temporary site in the S1 and possibly bound to the NA2 (if empty). The second sodium ion that is electrostatically attracted to the S1 remains in a loose binding state as it keeps oscillating between the NA1 and the temporary site, because the NA1 remains incomplete until a substrate reaches the S1. Access to the S1 remains open in the outward-open state, irrespective of the presence of 0, 1, or 2 sodium ions. Importantly, in the outward-open state, the sidechain of F294 does not rotate into the vestibule to obstruct access to the S1. In analogy to SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gradisch <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) we can assume that the side chain of F294 reorients towards the vestibule to form a closed outer hydrophobic lid only once approaching the occluded state. The role of Na2 is to stabilise GAT1 in the outward-open conformation. It was shown for LeuT that the transporter isomerizes between the inward-facing and the outward-facing state with comparable populations for both conformations in the absence of sodium ions, while the presence of sodium stabilises the outward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). A similar conformational effect upon sodium binding was observed for human SLC6 transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Schicker <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tavoulari <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Szöllősi and Stockner, 2022</xref>), because the NA2 is located between the scaffold domain and the bundle domain, specifically between TM1a and TM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). NA2 becomes disrupted by a transition to the inward-facing state. These data remain inconclusive with respect to the functionally important question, if Na2 would stabilise the NA2 and thus the transporter in the outward-open state or if the outward-open state would be formed by other interactions and thereby creating the sodium binding competent NA2. Our data showed that it is Na2 binding that stabilises GAT1. We observed that GAT1 is dynamic in the outward-open state and showed large bundle domain motions on both the extracellular and the intracellular side in the absence of Na2. This is consistent with a dynamic state reminiscent of the apo state of LeuT without conformational preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). We also observed motions at the inner gate, specifically between TM5a and the bundle domain helices TM1a and TM6b, which indicate that Na2 binding plays a long-range stabilising role for the inner gate and for TM5a. A closed hydrophobic inner gate is necessary for stabilising the outward-facing state, while it has to open for reaching the inward-open state. We found a dynamic inner gate in the absence of Na2, as we measured broad distributions of distances across the inner gate. A long range effect of Na2 binding resulted in the disappearance of these dynamic motions, leading to the stabilisation of a sealed inner gate. We find that a long range allosteric effect of Na2 binding is a stabilisation of the conformation of TM5a, reminiscent of the observations in the homologous transporters LeuT and SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Merkle <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Coleman <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gradisch <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>), which showed an unwinding and an extension of TM5a in the transition from the outward-facing to the inward-facing state. By connecting the bundle domain to the scaffold domain, TM5 follows the motions associated with the transitions of the transport cycle, whereby TM5a is attached to the scaffold domain and TM5b is linked to the bundle domain. The motions of the bundle domain, responsible for this property, were quenched after sodium binding to NA2, showing how Na2 stabilises the outward-open state, and distances are extended once reaching the occluded state. The conformation stabilising effect of Na2 is achieved by an induced fit effect. Analysis of the local environment of the sodium coordinating oxygen atoms at the NA2 showed a clear structural change upon sodium binding that brought the NA2 exposed residues of TM1a and TM8 into a defined distance that is smaller than these residues would be in the absence of Na2. This local structural change fixes these two helices relative to each other and thereby prevents bundle domain motions relative to the scaffold domain.</p>
<p>The NA1 site has the role of stabilising the bound substrate in the S1. The apparent affinity of GABA for GAT1 increases strongly in the presence of sodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Radian and Kanner, 1983</xref>), indicating cooperative binding. Here we show that binding of Na1 and of GABA is synergistic, as GABA stabilises Na1 in the NA1 and Na1 stabilises GABA in the S1. We observed by direct simulations that sodium oscillated between the NA1 and a temporary site in the S1 without induced fit conformational changes of NA1 in the absence of substrate. In contrast, in the presence of GABA, sodium is firmly bound to the NA1, the carboxylate moiety of GABA completes the first coordination shell of Na1 and NA1 compacts. The same position for the carboxylate was found in the occluded structure of GAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). As yet no structural information on Na-bound GAT1 in the absence of GABA is available, but different coordination of Na1 in LeuT were observed in the absence and presence of the coordinating carboxyl group of the amino acid substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>), it is likely that this difference in Na1 coordination is similar in GAT1. The carboxyl group of GABA overlaps with the carboxylate of D98 in the paralogues serotonin transporter SERT, where sodium binds strongly in the absence of substrate and the NA1 compacts due to an induced fit effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Szöllősi and Stockner, 2021</xref>). The difference between GAT1 and SERT is therefore that strong binding of Na1 and the NA1 condensation in GAT1 is GABA dependent, while in the SERT it is substrate independent. From this data we can infer that the strong electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged carboxylate of GABA and the positive charge of sodium as well as the condensation of NA1 due to the induced fit effect contribute cooperatively to the affinity of GABA to GAT1. GABA adopts a binding mode in which the carboxyl group completes the coordination of sodium in NA1 but is also stabilised by a hydrogen bond to Y140 of the scaffold domain. It is tempting to speculate that this interaction relay from Na1 (bundle domain associated), GABA to Y140 (scaffold domain) could be the switch that triggers GAT1 occlusion and thus substrate uptake reminiscent of the mechanism described by Gradisch et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gradisch et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>For the simulations we used the AlphaFold model of outward-facing GAT1, as no outward-facing structure of GAT1 is available. The initial use of SERT based outward-open homology models resulted in GAT1 structures in which the inner hydrophobic gate was not sealed, allowing ions to penetrate. Thus, these models were not further used. A sequence comparison showed that this property is a consequence of a set of smaller side chains in GAT1 compared to SERT at the interface between the scaffold and the bundle domain. The outer vestibule of the AlphaFold model is somewhat less open as compared to the SERT based model, but PC1 and PC2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a,b</xref>) show that the AlphaFold starting structure is inside the highly populated basin of conformations accessed by GAT1 during simulations, confirming that the AlphaFold model represents a valid starting structure for the outward-open GAT1.</p>
<p>Sodium binding and substrate transport by GAT1 are accelerated by a sodium recruitment site. Our simulations showed consistently a region of high sodium density at the entry to the outer vestibule. The sodium recruitment site consists of two negatively charged residues located at the beginning of TM6a that electrostatically attracts sodium ions. <italic>In-silico</italic> mutations of these residues resulted in the disappearance of enhanced sodium density at the sodium recruitment site and slowed binding kinetics (slower on rate) for sodium entering the S1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>In-vitro</italic> experiments confirmed these predictions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) by showing a reduced sodium dependency of GABA uptake and a lower Vmax, while the Km of GABA uptake was almost unchanged. These data indicate that the role of the sodium recruiting site is to increase the probability of sodium ions to enter the outer vestibule for reaching the sodium binding sites NA1 and NA2. The negative electrostatic potential at the sodium recruitment site attracts positively charged sodium ions and locally increased sodium concentration at the entry into the outer vestibule. We did not observe tight binding to the recruitment site, but instead observed that sodium ions eventually unbind. This is kinetically important, because it increases the on rate, as the sodium ion can leave either towards the extracellular solution or it is efficiently steered towards the S1 by electrostatic attraction.</p>

<title>Molecular Dynamics simulations</title>
<p>In the absence of a crystal or cryo-EM structure of GAT1 in the outward-facing conformation, we selected the AlphaFold model to investigate sodium binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>). The bound-chloride ion was added to the GAT1 model using as a reference the outward-open human SERT crystal structure (PDB ID: 5I71; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Coleman et al., 2016</xref>). The generated system was converted from full-atom into a coarse-grained representation using the MARTINI force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">de Jong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Monticelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wassenaar et al., 2015</xref>), with a membrane composition of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC): cholesterol containing membrane (POPC:CHOL 70:30 mol%; (van Meer, 1998)), and solvated in water with 150 mM NaCl. The membrane was equilibrated after a 1 μs long coarse-grained simulation, while restraining the protein. The coarse-grained system was then converted to an all-atom representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ingólfsson et al., 2014</xref>) in which the transporter was replaced by the original GAT1 model to avoid spurious structural imprecisions induced by the double coordinate conversion protocol. Possible atom overlaps between the reinserted protein and the equilibrated membrane were relaxed using the membed procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wolf et al., 2010</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Szöllősi and Stockner, 2022</xref>). We used the amber ff99SB-ILDN force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010</xref>) to describe GAT1, ions and the solvent, and Slipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jämbeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jämbeck and Lyubartsev, 2013</xref>) for POPC and cholesterol. Previously reported structural analysis of the orthologous SERT structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Coleman et al., 2016</xref>) suggested that the residue E467 in GAT1 is protonated. All simulations were carried out with GROMACS version 2019.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>). Three replicas of the final assembled system were energy-minimised and equilibrated in four steps of 2.5 ns, each by stepwise releasing the position restraints (1,000, 100, 10, 1 kJ/mol/nm) that are active on the Cα atoms and the bound chloride ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Goda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sohail et al., 2016</xref>). Per each trajectory, the production run was carried for 500 ns. The temperature was maintained at 310 K using the v-rescale (τ = 0.5 ps) thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>), while separately coupling protein, membrane, and solvent. The pressure was maintained at 1 bar using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>) in a semi-isotropic manner and applying a coupling constant of 20.1 ps. Long-range electrostatic interactions were described using the smooth particle mesh Ewald method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Darden et al., 1993</xref>) applying a cutoff of 0.9 nm. The van der Waals interactions were described using the Lennard Jones potentials applying a cutoff of 0.9 nm. Long-range corrections for energy and pressure were applied. Coordinates of all atoms were recorded every 5 ps. The complete set of parameters of the production run can be found in the Supplementary Materials. The simulations of the holo inward-occluded GAT1 (PDB: 7Y7W) were conducted by following the same protocol, and comprised 4 repeats, each of which being 200 ns long.</p>
<p>The trajectories that were initiated from the AlphaFold model served as parent trajectories and were used to extract starting structures for the sodium binding simulations. From each replica, 20 equally spaced frames were extracted every 10 ns of the 200 ns long trajectories, which then served as starting structures after removal of sodium ions that might be present in the substrate binding pocket S1. Each of these 60 systems was simulated for 200 ns with the same simulation parameters as the parent trajectories. The same starting systems were used for the double mutant (D281A-E283A) systems and the same simulation parameters were applied. Mutants were created using the Pymol Mutagenesis Wizard tool (Schrödinger, LLC, Warren DeLano, 2020).</p>
<p>To generate the trajectory for investigating the role of sodium Na1, we extracted a frame from the parent trajectory in which Na2 was already bound. For the GABA-free systems, we placed the second sodium into the temporary site of the S1 as observed in the sodium binding simulations; for the GABA-bound systems we placed GABA in the binding site of GAT1, in a similar way as leucine was observed in the LeuT crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). Figures and statistical analyses were generated by the GROMACS package, R, and python scripts using the MD Analysis package, v0.19.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gowers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Michaud-Agrawal et al., 2011</xref>). For visualisation VMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>) v1.9.3 and Pymol v1.8.4 (Schrödinger, LLC, Warren DeLano, 2020) were used.</p>

<title>Markov State Modelling</title>
<p>The Markov State Models (MSMs) were built with the pyEMMA python package version 2.5.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scherer et al., 2015</xref>). To begin, we defined the reaction coordinates employing time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (tICA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Molgedey and Schuster, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Naritomi and Fuchigami, 2013</xref>), an advanced linear transformation technique design to maximise the autocorrelation of molecular descriptors. This facilitates the identification of slowest kinetic modes within the system, i.e., the reaction coordinates. The input dataset for tICA comprised the precise coordinates (x, y and z) of the sodium ions undergoing binding events. The dimensionality reduction was performed using a time lag of 1 ns which allowed for a complete exploration of the temporal dynamics. Subsequently, the trajectories were discretized into 500 cluster centres by applying the k-mean clustering algorithm. Finally, the MSMs were estimated using a time lag of 25 ns, the time point at which we observed convergence of the implied timescales. The Markovian behaviour was assured using the Chapman-Kolmogorov (CK) test (Figure S4). The free energy values were estimated using the MSMs based on the relationship derived from the stationary distribution (π) values, as obtained from the transition probability matrix. This relationship is represented mathematically as GSj=-K<sub>b</sub>Tln (sum(πj)). Where j denotes the MSM stationary weight of the j<sup>th</sup> microstate. G, S, K<sub>b</sub> and T represent the Gibbs free energy, entropy, Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. To visualise and interpret the free energy landscape associated with sodium binding, we plotted the free energy values into the tICA subspace, specifically along the first and second slowest motions, IC1 and IC2.</p>

<title>Cell lines and cell culture</title>
<p>An N-terminal eYFP tagged human GAT1 wild-type plasmid was used. The Agilent QuikChange Primer Design Program and the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) were utilized to incorporate point mutations into the coding sequence of human GAT1. After construct verification (LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany) double sorted polyclonal HEK293 cell lines, stably and consistently expressing hGAT1 wild-type, the single mutants D281A and E283A as well as the double alanine variant (D281A-E283A) were established, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gradisch <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Therefore, raw HEK cells were transfected with the respective plasmid by applying the jetPRIME transfection protocol (VWR International GmBH, Vienna, Austria). Adding 100 µl geneticin (G418, 50 mg x ml<sup>-1</sup>) ensured high selection pressure which was maintained for at least 14 days before cells were sorted by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Subsequently cells were grown for 1 week followed by a second round of FACS sorting. Cells stably expressing GAT1 were grown in 10 cm cell culture dishes (Greiner) with Dubleco’s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Sigma Aldrich), penicillin (1 U x ml<sup>-1</sup>, Sigma Aldrich), streptomycin (100 µg x ml<sup>-1</sup>, Sigma Aldrich) and geneticin (50 µg x ml<sup>-1</sup>, Sigma Aldrich) at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 in an incubator.

After aspiration of the culture medium, cell membranes were stained with a 0.4% Trypan blue containing solution (Sigma) for 10 minutes.

Cell imaging was performed using a Nikon A1R+ laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 60x NA1.4 oil immersion objective (Nikon, Vienna, Austria). To visualise Trypan blue and eYFP fluorescence, laser lines at 561 nm and 488 nm were employed, respectively. Prior light detection by a GaAsP PMT detector, emitted light was filtered with a 595/50 nm (trypan blue) and 525/50 (eYFP) nm emission filter. Image analysis was performed by using Fiji ImageJ 1.53c. Trypan blue staining confined both regions of interest (ROI) used to measure surface expression as well as cytosolic retained transporters.

<p>24 hours prior the experiment cells were seeded at very low density onto PDL-coated 35 mm dishes. hGAT1-mediated and substrate induced currents were recorded in whole-cell configuration at a holding-potential of −60 mV. Throughout the experiments cells were maintained in regular external solution (bath solution) containing: 140 mM NaCl, 20 mM D-glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 3 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript authored by Stockner and colleagues delves into the molecular simulations of Na+ binding pathway and the ionic interactions at the two known sodium binding sites site 1 and site 2. They further identify a patch of two acidic residues in TM6 that seemingly populate the Na+ ions prior to entry into the vestibule. These results highlight the importance of studying the ion-entry pathways through computational approaches and the authors also validate some of their findings through experimental work. They observe that sodium site 1 binding is stabilized by the presence of the substrate in the s1 site and this is particularly vital as the GABA carboxylate is involved in coordinating the Na+ ion unlike other monoamine transporters and binding of sodium to the Na2 site stabilizes the conformation of the GAT1 by reducing flexibility among the helical bundles involved in alternating access.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study displays results that are generally consistent with available information from experiments on SLC6 transporters particularly GAT1 and puts forth the importance of this added patch of residues in the extracellular vestibule that could be of importance to the ion permeation in SLC6 transporters. This is a nicely performed study and could be improved if the authors could comment on and fix the following queries.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed my comments and this has significantly improved the clarity of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The only point that I would like to inquire about is the role of EL4 in modulating Na+ entry. In the simulations do the authors see no role of EL4 in controlling Na+ entry. It is particularly intriguing as some studies in the recent past displayed charged mutations in EL4 of dDAT, SERT and GAT1 as being detrimental for substrate entry/uptake. It would therefore be nice to add a small discussion if there is any role for EL4 in Na+ entry.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Starting from an AlphaFold2 model of the outward-facing conformation of the GAT1 transporter, the authors primarily use state-of-the-art MD simulations to dissect the role of the two Na+ ions that are known to be co-transported with the substrate, GABA (and a co-transported Cl- ion). The simulations indicated that Na+ binding to OF GAT depends on the electrostatic environment. The authors identify an extracellular recruiting site including residues D281 and E283 which they hypothesized to increase transport by locally increasing the available Na+ concentration and thus increasing binding of Na+ to the canonical binding sites NA1 and NA2. The charge-neutralizing double mutant D281A-E283A showed decreased binding in simulations. The authors performed GABA uptake experiments and whole-cell patch clamp experiments that taken together validated the hypothesis that the Na+ staging site is important for transport due to its role in pulling in Na+.</p>
<p>Detailed analysis of the MD simulations indicated that Na+ binding to NA2 has multiple structural effects: The binding site becomes more compact (reminiscent of induced fit binding) and there is some evidence that it stabilizes the outward-facing conformation.</p>
<p>Binding to NA1 appears to require the presence of the substrate, GABA, whose carboxylate moiety participates in Na+ binding; thus the simulations predict cooperativity between binding of GABA and Na+ binding to NA1.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>- MD simulations were used to propose a hypothesis (the existence of the staging Na+ site) and then tested with a mutant in simulations AND in experiments. This is an excellent use of simulations in combination with experiments.</p>
<p>- A large number of repeat MD simulations are generally able to provide a consistent picture of Na+ binding. Simulations are performed according to current best practices and different analyses illuminate the details of the molecular process from different angles.</p>
<p>- The role of GABA in cooperatively stabilizing Na+ binding to the NA1 site looks convincing and intriguing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>- Assessing the effects of Na+ binding on the large scale motions of the transporter is more speculative because the PCA does not clearly cover all of the conformational space and the use of an AlphaFold2 model may have introduced structural inconsistencies. For example, it is not clear if movements of the inner gate are due to a AF2 model that's not well packed or really a feature of the open outward conformation.</p>
<p>- Quantitative analyses are difficult with the existing data; for example, the tICA &quot;free energy&quot; landscape is probably not converged because unbinding events haven't been observed.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>The study elucidates a detailed molecular mechanism of the initial stages of transport in a medically relevant GABA neurotransmitter transporter GAT1 and thus generates useful new insights for this protein family. In particular, it presents convincing evidence for the presence of a &quot;staging binding site&quot; that locally concentrates Na+ ions to increase transport activity, whilst solid evidence for how Na+ binding affects the larger scale dynamics.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript authored by Stockner and colleagues delves into the molecular simulations of Na+ binding pathway and the ionic interactions at the two known sodium binding sites site 1 and site 2. They further identify a patch of two acidic residues in TM6 that seemingly populate the Na+ ions prior to entry into the vestibule. These results highlight the importance of studying the ion-entry pathways through computational approaches and the authors also validate some of their findings through experimental work. They observe that sodium site 1 binding is stabilized by the presence of the substrate in the S1 site and this is particularly vital as the GABA carboxylate is involved in coordinating the Na+ ion unlike other monoamine transporters and binding of sodium to the Na2 site stabilizes the conformation of the GAT1 by reducing flexibility among the helical bundles involved in alternating access.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study displays results that are generally consistent with available information from experiments on SLC6 transporters particularly GAT1 and puts forth the importance of this added patch of residues in the extracellular vestibule that could be of importance to the ion permeation in SLC6 transporters. This is a nicely performed study and could be improved if the authors could comment on and fix the following queries.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank our reviewer for the overall positive evaluation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) How conserved are the residue pair of D281-E283 in other SLC6 transporters. The authors commented on the presence of these residues in SERT but it would be nice to know how widespread these residues are in other SLC6 transporters like NET, GlyT, and DAT.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have created a sequence alignment of the entire human SLC6 family (Supplementary Figure 1) and found that E283 is polar or charged in all SLC6 transporters. D281 shows a higher level of conservation across the family compared to E283. D281 is negatively charged in approximately 50% of the SLC6 family members, an aspartate in all GABA transporters and a glutamate in all monoamine transporters.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Further, one would like to see the effect of individual mutations D281A and E283A on transport, surface expression, and EC50 of Na+ to gauge the effect on transport.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have carried out experiments to investigate the effects of the individual mutations. The results revealed intermediate effects between WT and the double mutant (D281A-E283A) and showed that the effects mostly align with the degree of conservation, as a neutralisation of D281 by alanine has a stronger effect than the E283A mutant. Both single mutants had minimal effects on the sodium dependence of uptake, D281A had a stronger effect on expression, Km and Vmax as compared to E283. Only D281A reduced surface expression, while E283A expresses to a similar level as wild type GAT1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) A clear figure of the S1 site where Na+ tends to stay prior to Na1 site interactions needs to be provided with a clear figure. Further, it is not entirely clear how access to S1 is altered if the transporter is in an outwardoccluded conformation if F294 is blocking solvent access. Please comment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the structural images in Figure 1, 5, 6 and 7 to improve their comprehensibility. We have also added a comment on the role of F294 as part of the outer hydrophobic gate to the discussion. In short, F294 does not occlude the passage to the S1 as long as GAT1 is outward open, and we find that GAT1 is outward open in all sodium binding simulations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The p-value of the EC50 differences between GAT1WT and GAT1double mutant need to be mentioned. The difference in sodium dependence EC50 seems less than twofold, and it would be useful to mention how critical the role of the recruitment site is. Since the transport is not affected the site could play a transient role in attracting ions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added p-values or standard deviation to our data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) It would be very nice to know how K+ ions are attracted by this recruitment site. This could further act as a control simulation to test the preference for Na+ ions among SLC6 members.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that attraction of potassium to the recruitment site is not of relevance, as the residues are at the extracellular side and exposed to bulk, where the concentration of sodium is high (typically 130-150 mM), while the concentration of potassium is very small (3-5 mM). Exploring sodium binding by simulations for all SLC6 members could be interesting, but clearly outside the scope of this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Some of the important figures are not very clear. For instance, there should be a zoomed-in view of the recruitment site. The current one in Fig. 1b and 1c could be made clearer. Similarly as mentioned earlier the Na residence at the S1 site away from the Na1 and Na2 sites needs to be shown with greater clarity by putting side chain information in Fig. 6d.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the structural images in Figure 1, 5, 6 and 7 to improve their comprehensibility.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The structural features that comprise the two principal components PC1 and PC2 should be described in greater detail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified Figure 6 and added images that show the motions along PC1 and PC2. In addition, these are now better explained in the text.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Starting from an AlphaFold2 model of the outward-facing conformation of the GAT1 transporter, the authors primarily use state-of-the-art MD simulations to dissect the role of the two Na+ ions that are known to be cotransported with the substrate, GABA (and a co-transported Cl- ion). The simulations indicated that Na+ binding to OF GAT depends on the electrostatic environment. The authors identify an extracellular recruiting site including residues D281 and E283 which they hypothesized to increase transport by locally increasing the available Na+ concentration and thus increasing binding of Na+ to the canonical binding sites NA1 and NA2. The charge-neutralizing double mutant D281A-E283A showed decreased binding in simulations. The authors performed GABA uptake experiments and whole-cell patch clamp experiments that taken together validated the hypothesis that the Na+ staging site is important for transport due to its role in pulling in Na+.</p>
<p>Detailed analysis of the MD simulations indicated that Na+ binding to NA2 has multiple structural effects: The binding site becomes more compact (reminiscent of induced fit binding) and there is some evidence that it stabilizes the outward-facing conformation.</p>
<p>Binding to NA1 appears to require the presence of the substrate, GABA, whose carboxylate moiety participates in Na+ binding; thus the simulations predict cooperativity between binding of GABA and Na+ binding to NA1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>-  MD simulations were used to propose a hypothesis (the existence of the staging Na+ site) and then tested with a mutant in simulations AND in experiments. This is an excellent use of simulations in combination with experiments.</p>
<p>-  A large number of repeat MD simulations are generally able to provide a consistent picture of Na+ binding. Simulations are performed according to current best practices and different analyses illuminate the details of the molecular process from different angles.</p>
<p>-  The role of GABA in cooperatively stabilizing Na+ binding to the NA1 site looks convincing and intriguing.</p>

<p>We thank the review for the very supportive assessment.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>-  Assessing the effects of Na+ binding on the large-scale motions of the transporter is more speculative because the PCA does not clearly cover all of the conformational space and the use of an AlphaFold2 model may have introduced structural inconsistencies. For example, it is not clear if movements of the inner gate are due to an AF2 model that's not well packed or really a feature of the open outward conformation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The long range effect of sodium binding to GAT1 and destabilisation of the inner gate has, based on our data, a causal effect. PCA separates conformational motions into degrees of freedom and sorts them according to the largest motions. Motions of TM5a were among the 2 largest motions, which suggests that these are relevant motions. To directly quantify their behaviour, we measured informative distances at the inner gate of GAT1, as shown in Figure 6i,j,k and separated data according to the presence of sodium in NA2.</p>
<p>For the following reasons we exclude that the results are a consequence of structural inconsistencies introduced by AlphaFold2 and therefore not reflecting functionally relevant effects:</p>
<p>(1) If depending on the model instead of sodium binding, the effects should not be correlated with the presence of sodium in the NA2 binding site.</p>
<p>(2)  We carried out new simulations starting from the occluded GAT1 structure (Figure 6j,k). The data shows that in the occluded state the distance across the inner vestibule and the length of TM5a differ, consistent with our interpretation of the data. As sodium binding fixes GAT1 outwardfacing, as it also occurs in other SLC6 family members (Szöllősi and Stockner, 2022), the distances of the outward-open GAT1 are at the short extreme of the scale, distances of the inward-open state of the cryo-EM structure(s) are at the other extreme, while the occluded conformation of GAT1 shows intermediate values.</p>
<p>(3)  We have observed the same property in SERT, for which we used experimental structures as starting structure (Gradisch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024), suggesting that this could be a generally mechanism.</p>
<p>(4)  All available structures from the entire SLC6 family are consistent with structural effects of TM5a in response to bundle domain motions and therefore to binding of sodium to NA2 as it stabilized the outward-open state as well as transition to the inward facing conformation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Quantitative analyses are difficult with the existing data; for example, the tICA &quot;free energy&quot; landscape is probably not converged because unbinding events haven't been observed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Simulations can always be too short and therefore not fully describe the complete underlying conformational ensemble. We added a statement in the discussion indicating this shortcoming. With respect to the tICA analysis in our manuscript, the tICA approach does, by design, not need long simulations that capture the full binding and unbinding in multiple instances to construct a correct free energy landscape. Instead, the tICA method builds on Markov chain dependencies and relies only on the convergence of transitions between hundreds of conformational microstates and the fluxes between them. The free energy profile derived for the S1, including NA1, TMP and NA2 and up to the salt bridge of the outer gate is well converged and we observed many transitions. In contrast, the entry from the recruitment side to the S1 has most likely a too low density of microstate and a too small number of transition to be considered converged with respect to quantifying the free energy of binding from bulk. We now explain this shortcoming.</p>

<p>We have added the p-values to text and figure legends.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>-  Deposit simulation data in a public repository (input files, trajectories (possibly subsampled)).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We deposited the data to Zenodo and provided the DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10686813 to the data. As we were unable to upload the trajectories to zenodo, we deposited the starting and the end structures of the simulations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  Please include a short discussion of the reliability of using an AF2 model instead of experimental structures. What is expected to be correct/which parts of the structure are potentially incorrect? What makes you think that the AF2 model is a good model of the OF conformation of GAT1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, an outward-facing structure of GAT1 is not available. We have initially worked with an outward-open homology model of GAT1 based on SERT (build with MODELLER), but the structural differences between SERT and GAT1 are sufficiently large that these models did not behave well in simulations and too frequently could not maintain a sealed inner gate, also forming a channel. In contrast to the SERT-based GAT1 model, the AlphaFold2 model of GAT1 behaved as expected and consistent with the behaviour of SERT in simulations and with general knowledge of protein dynamics from literature. Based on structural analysis of our simulations and on the comparison to SERT we could not identify a region of GAT1 which would be potentially behave incorrect or unexpectedly. We added a statement to the discussion on this potential limitation of the use of homology models.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  Fig 1a: Na+ densities are not very clear (both due to small size and the transparency). I have a hard time seeing where bulk, 2*bulk regions are --- are you showing &quot;onion shells&quot; of density? Perhaps investigate presenting as cuts through the full density?</p>
<p>I like the labelling in terms of absolute density and multiples of bulk.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have created new images to improve the visualisation of data. The data are shown as onion shells (isosurface), with the shells at the indicated densities. This is now clearly stated. Transparency is needed, otherwise e.g. the inner onion shells would not be visible. The cut-through is intuitive, but we could not find a useful plain, as the densities are too extensively distributed in 3D and not on a single plain.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  Fig 1h-k: would be clearer if &quot;recruitment site&quot; (TMP?) was indicated in the figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have created a new image for the recruiting site (Figure 1b,c) and temporary site (Figure 1g) and indicated these two sites as appropriate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  Show time series of Na+ binding with a suitable order parameter (z or distances to NA1 and NA2?) to show how ions bind spontaneously. Mark the different sites. Mark pre- and post-binding parts of trajectories.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added time series for every simulation that shows sodium binding to the NA1 or NA2 to the supplementary information Figure 2a,b,c. These quantify the distances to the recruiting site, the temporary site and the respective sodium binding site.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  PCA - how much of the total variance was captured by PC1 and PC2?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The variance captured by the PCs are shown as eigenvalues in supplementary information Figure 4. PC1 captures about 19% of the variance, PC2 8%.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  &quot;We found that the inner hydrophobic gate is dynamic in the absence of Na2&quot; -- is this instability due to the AF2 model or likely realistic? E.g. was similar behaviour ever observed in simulations of the occluded state?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In simulations of the occluded state we do not see such instabilities as observed in the outward-open state in the absence of sodium (Figure 6). As these larger scale fluctuations are not randomly distributed across all simulations starting from the AlphaFold2 models, but confined to the systems without sodium, it is unlikely an effect of the AlphaFold2 model.</p>
<p>Please note, we have seen comparable behaviour in simulations of SERT starting from experimental structures (Gradisch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024), therefore suggesting a more general mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  Cooperativity between GABA-binding and Na+ binding to NA1: How would this lead to an experimentally measurable signature, i.e., which experiments could validate this interesting prediction?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Direct detection of cooperativity is difficult to separate from other effects in experiments, as sodium binding and transport involves NA1 and NA2, NA2 has a higher affinity according to our data, while mutations will not only affect cooperativity, but will also have other effects.</p>
<p>Conformational changes can also complicate experimental detection, as NA2 stabilises the outward-open conformation, while NA1+GABA binding triggers the transition to the inward-open state. To quantify cooperativity, it would be important to isolate the cooperative from all other effects, which is a challenge. Support for cooperativity has been found by (Zhou, Zomot and Kanner, 2006; Meinild and Forster, 2012) using this route. In the first paper the authors make use of lithium that only binds to the NA2, even though lithium is not only a mere NA2 selective ligand and otherwise identical to sodium. By comparing two GABA concentrates the authors showed that the sodium dependence of GABA transport is left shifted at higher GABA concentrations, which is not the case in the absence of lithium. This data is indirect, but consistent with cooperativity between GABA and NA1-bound sodium, as GABA transport mainly reflects binding of sodium to NA1. Similar approaches could be further explored, for example by varying the GABA concentration instead of sodium. Other options could be to create an outward-facing and conformationally locked GAT1 and to measure the cooperativity of sodium and GABA binding using for example the scintillation proximity assay. Most likely the assay would also need a way to be NA2 binding independent. We are not aware of such a GABA transporter system.</p>
