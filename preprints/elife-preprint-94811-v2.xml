<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The mRNA 5’-cap structure removal by the decapping enzyme DCP2 is a critical step in gene regulation. While DCP2 is the catalytic subunit in the decapping complex, its activity is strongly enhanced by multiple factors, particularly DCP1, which is the major activator in yeast. However, the precise role of DCP1 in metazoans has yet to be fully elucidated. Moreover, in humans, the specific biological functions of the two DCP1 paralogs, DCP1a and DCP1b, remain largely unknown. To investigate the role of human DCP1, we generated cell-lines that were deficient in DCP1a, DCP1b or both to evaluate the importance of DCP1 in the decapping machinery. Our results highlight the importance of human DCP1 in decapping process and show that the EVH1 domain of DCP1 enhances the mRNA-binding affinity of DCP2. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses outline the distinct functions of DCP1a and DCP1b in human cells, regulating specific endogenous mRNA targets and biological processes. Overall, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of human DCP1 in mRNA decapping and shed light on the distinct functions of its paralogs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene expression must be stringently regulated to ensure efficient control of cellular processes. A key mechanism of gene expression regulation is the control of mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen and Shyu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Corbett, 2018</xref>), mediated by the removal of protective structures from mRNA, which suppresses translation or leads to mRNA degradation. In most eukaryotic cells, mRNA is stabilized through the addition during posttranscriptional modification of an <italic>N</italic><sup>7</sup>-methyl guanosine (m<sup>7</sup>G) cap at the 5′ end and a polyA tail at the 3′ end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Furuichi et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Garneau et al., 2007</xref>). General mRNA decay is typically initiated by deadenylation, which is mediated by the coordinated activity of the CCR4/NOT and PAN2/3 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chen and Shyu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Decker and Parker, 1993</xref>). Shortening of the polyA tail typically initiates mRNA decay, resulting in exonucleolytic degradation in the 5’-3’ or 3’-5’ direction, respectively facilitated by the exonuclease XRN1 or the exosome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Garneau <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Webster et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yi et al., 2018</xref>). While the cytoplasmic RNA exosome degrades mRNA in the 3’-5’ direction, the primary effect of deadenylation is “mRNA decapping”, the removal of the m<sup>7</sup>G cap structure at the 5’-end of the mRNA that otherwise prevents mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Stevens, 1988</xref>). This connection between deadenylation and decapping is facilitated by Pat1, which together with the Lsm1-7 complex, recruits the decapping complex through a combination of disordered and structured domains, promoting distinct steps of mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Charenton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Charenton and Graille, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fourati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lobel and Gross, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lobel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sharif and Conti, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Wu et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The mRNA decapping process is crucial for gene regulation because it leads to the irreversible removal of the mRNA cap structure, inhibiting translation initiation and inducing the XRN1-mediated degradation of mRNA through the 5′-3′ mRNA decay pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hsu and Stevens, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Topisirovic et al., 2011</xref>). Decapping does not only lead to the degradation of bulk mRNA molecules; it is also involved in specific mRNA decay pathways, such as AU-rich element-mediated decay, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), and miRNA-triggered mRNA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arribas-Layton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen and Shyu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fenger-Gron et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Loh et al., 2013</xref>). Because of its crucial role in gene regulation, decapping is tightly regulated by the activity of both general and pathway-specific factors through various mechanisms. In the context of NMD for instance, target transcripts can be degraded through endonucleolytic cleavage by SMG6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Eberle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Huntzinger et al., 2008</xref>), or be facilitated by SMG5 in conjunction with the NMD effector SMG7 or the decapping factor PNRC2, leading to enhanced deadenylation and decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Fukuhara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Loh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Understanding the determinants of the preferential associations between certain degradation mechanisms and particular transcripts requires further study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Metze et al., 2013</xref>). Overall, the pivotal role of decapping in the intricate network of mRNA decay justifies ongoing research in this field.</p>
<p>In eukaryotes, the removal of the mRNA 5′-m<sup>7</sup>GDP cap structure is catalysed by the decapping enzyme DCP2, a pyrophosphatase belonging to the Nudix family of proteins. This process results in the generation of 5′ monophosphorylated mRNA, which is subsequently targeted for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arribas-Layton <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lykke-Andersen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Steiger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">van Dijk et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). The central component of the complex, DCP2, has two major domains: the N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD) and the catalytic Nudix domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">She et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">She et al., 2008</xref>). The positively charged patch of the Nudix domain plays a crucial role in RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Deshmukh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Piccirillo et al., 2003</xref>). Meanwhile, the NRD enhances decapping activity by specifically recognizing the m<sup>7</sup>G nucleotide of the mRNA cap structure and interacts with the N-terminal EVH1 domain of the major activator DCP1, further accelerating the decapping process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Charenton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Dunckley and Parker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Floor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Mugridge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">She <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wurm et al., 2017</xref>). Yeast Dcp2 has an additional unstructured C-terminal extension that contains short helical leucine-rich motifs (HLMs) responsible for protein-protein interactions and elements that inhibit Dcp2 catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Charenton <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">He and Jacobson, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to yeast, metazoans have the HLM in DCP1, implying a conserved biological function with evolving regulation of mRNA decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Fromm et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The interactions between DCP1 and DCP2 proteins and their functions across various species have garnered extensive attention in the study of mRNA degradation mechanisms. While DCP2 is capable of demonstrating catalytic activity on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lykke-Andersen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">van Dijk <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), it is important to note that additional cofactors are involved in stimulating DCP2 for complete activation. In yeast, the primary activator of DCP2 is Dcp1, which is essential for decapping activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beelman et al., 1996</xref>) and considerably enhances the catalytic activity of Dcp2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Deshmukh <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Floor <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">She <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Moreover, DCP1 has been shown to interact with other decapping proteins, such as DCP2, to form functional decapping complexes critical for mRNA degradation. Localization and functional analysis of decapping proteins across various species indicate that Dcp1-dependent decapping mechanisms have been conserved throughout evolution and play a significant role in the mRNA decapping machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sakuno et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the importance of DCP1 in plant species underscores the necessity of the decapping complex for proper plant development and highlights its potential homology with yeast and human DCP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). These findings suggest that the interaction between DCP1 and DCP2 and their role in mRNA degradation is a conserved key biological process across species.</p>
<p>In addition to Dcp1, proteins such as Edc1-3, Pby1, Lsm1-7, Pat1, and Dhh1 (PNRC1, PNRC2, EDC3, EDC4, Lsm1-7, Lsm14, PatL1, and DDX6 in metazoans) promote decapping by directly or indirectly interacting with Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Charenton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Charenton <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Charenton and Graille, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Charenton <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cho <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gaviraghi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">He and Jacobson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">He et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lobel <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Mugridge et al., 2018b</xref>). These proteins facilitate decapping through the assembly of messenger ribonucleoprotein (RNP) units or the structural rearrangement of DCP2. High levels of these proteins have been detected in large RNP granules, processing bodies (P-bodies), which likely serve as sites for the storage of translationally repressed RNAs and the process of mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Eulalio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Luo et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The interactions between the subunits of the decapping complex are crucial for enhancing its activity and for the targeting of specific mRNAs. Although Dcp1 and Dcp2 have been shown to interact strongly in yeast, direct DCP1-DCP2 interactions are weak in metazoans. Instead, the metazoan-specific protein EDC4, which has binding sites for both DCP1 and DCP2, likely functions as a scaffold that brings these proteins together despite their weak interaction propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fenger-Gron <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). In addition to EDC4, DCP1 acts as a binding platform for other coactivator proteins, such as yeast Edc1 and Edc2 and the human PNRC paralogs, PNRC1 and PNRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gaviraghi <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Mugridge <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). In metazoans, the HLM domain of DCP1 interacts with the Lsm domains of proteins such as EDC3 and Lsm14 in a mutually exclusive manner. Moreover, in multicellular eukaryotes, DCP1 features a C-terminal extension that induces DCP1 trimerization, referred to as the trimerization domain (TD). Trimerization is a prerequisite for the incorporation of DCP1 into active decapping complexes and for promoting efficient mRNA decapping <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Fromm <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tritschler et al., 2007</xref>). This competition results in the formation of structurally and functionally distinct assemblies, contributing to target specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Vidya and Duchaine, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent structural analyses of the <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> Dcp1-Dcp2-Edc3 complex indicate that the Lsm domain of Edc3 binds to an extended helix at the C-terminus of the Dcp2 Nudix domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Charenton <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the activation peptide of Edc1 bridges Dcp1 and Dcp2, as observed in the Edc1-Dcp1-Dcp2 complex in <italic>Saccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Mugridge <italic>et al</italic>., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wurm <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). These structural insights suggest that Edc1 and Edc3 collaborate through distinct mechanisms, aiding the decapping process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Charenton and Graille, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Charenton <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mugridge et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Mugridge <italic>et al</italic>., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Tibble et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, Edc1 stabilizes Dcp2’s catalytically active conformation, while Edc3 extends the RNA binding surface of the Dcp2 Nudix domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Charenton <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Mugridge <italic>et al</italic>., 2018b</xref>). This extended RNA interaction potentially accounts for the transcript-specific nature of Edc3-mediated decapping activation, hinting at distinct coactivators’ roles in gene-specific regulation.</p>
<p>While structural studies suggest that interactions with Dcp1 are central to the activation of Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Charenton and Graille, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Deshmukh <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mugridge <italic>et al</italic>., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Mugridge <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">She <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Valkov et al., 2016</xref>), the lack of structural information on the human decapping complex hinders our understanding of the specific role of human DCP1 in decapping. It remains unclear how DCP1 contributes to the conformational changes in the DCP2 catalytic cycle or to mRNA and cap structure recognition. A further complication is the existence of two paralogs of human DCP1, DCP1a and DCP1b, which have 31% sequence identity over their entire length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lykke-Andersen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">van Dijk <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). The functional differences of these paralogs have yet to be determined. Studies of their potentially distinct roles in the decapping complex may provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of mRNA decapping. The fact that decapping dysfunctions can have detrimental effects on cell growth and have been linked to severe neurological disorders in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahmed et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Ng et al., 2015</xref>), highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of mRNA decapping regulation and the potential therapeutic implications.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the roles of human DCP1 in mRNA decapping by generating HEK-293T cell lines lacking DCP1a, DCP1b, or both. Our findings indicate that human DCP1 promotes decapping <italic>in vivo</italic> and that DCP1a and DCP1b play redundant roles in the general 5′-3′ mRNA decay pathway. We found that EVH1 domain may be crucial for enhancing DCP2’s recruitment to target mRNA in cells. Multiomics analyses revealed distinct expressional and metabolomic profiles for the knockout cell lines. These results indicate that the DCP1 paralogs have distinct roles in the regulation of various biological processes. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying human DCP1-mediated mRNA decapping and the specific mRNA targets and biological processes regulated by DCP1a and DCP1b in humans.</p>

<title>Knockout of human DCP1 represses the general mRNA decapping process <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To investigate the roles of the two DCP1 paralogs, we knocked out DCP1a, DCP1b, or both in HEK-293T cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. Western blot analysis and Sanger sequencing confirmed the successful generation of the knockout cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1A-C). We further investigated whether the absence of DCP1a, DCP1b, or both affected decapping. To monitor mRNA decay, the NMD factor SMG7 was tethered to an mRNA reporter in the DCP1a/b-knockout cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). While DCP1 is the main decapping activator in yeast, previous studies in metazoans have shown that at least two decapping activators have to be simultaneously depleted to effectively inhibit mRNA decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Braun <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sakuno <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed that the depletion of both DCP1a and DCP1b substantially inhibited SMG7-mediated mRNA degradation, resulting in the accumulation of deadenylated reporter RNA molecules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 2 and 6).</p>

A red dotted line additionally marks the fast migrating deadenylated (A0) form.

<p>To investigate whether the inhibitory effect of DCP1 knockout on decapping is specific to SMG7 or a general effect, we performed tethering assays using either the mRNA decay factor Nanos1 or the crucial miRNA component TNRC6A to induce 5′-3′ mRNA decay. In both cases, DCP1 knockout led to the substantial accumulation of mRNA decay intermediates (Supplementary Figure S2A-C), indicating that DCP1 is important for the decapping and degradation of mRNA in general.</p>
<p>To confirm the presence of a cap structure on the accumulated reporter RNA intermediate, we treated it with Terminator 5’-phosphate exonuclease. The resistance of the transcripts to this treatment is strong evidence that the accumulated RNA fragments had intact 5’ caps (Figure. S2D). The accumulation of capped mRNA decay intermediates suggests slowed or impaired DCP2 mediated decapping in the absence of DCP1. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence for the important role of DCP1 in the decapping process in human cells, mirroring its established role in yeast.</p>
<p>To better understand the functional roles of the DCP1 paralogs in decapping, we performed tethering assays and reintroduced GFP-tagged DCP1a or DCP1b into DCP1a/b-knockout cells, leading in both cases to the restoration of decapping and degradation of the reporter mRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>; Supplementary Figure S2E). This finding strongly suggests that DCP1a and DCP1b are functionally redundant for the general decapping of mRNA.</p>

<title>DCP1 EVH1 domain is crucial for cellular mRNA decapping process</title>
<p>Building on our finding that DCP1 is crucial for efficient mRNA decapping in human cells, we sought to identify the specific region of DCP1 that is important for the function of the decapping complex. Given the observed functional redundancy of DCP1a and DCP1b in the decapping process, we chose to use DCP1a as a model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In DCP1a/b knockout cells, we overexpressed DCP1a fragments lacking either of three major domains (EVH1, HLM, TD) and monitored mRNA degradation status (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-H</xref>). Strikingly, we observed that overexpression of a DCP1a fragment lacking EVH1 domain (ΔEVH1) could not rescue the decapping defect, indicating that this domain is crucial to coordinate the cellular decapping process. Overexpression of DCP1a without the HLM domain (ΔHLM) partially restored the decapping defect, indicating a cooperative role for this domain in coordinating DCP1’s decapping function. Adequate mRNA degradation occurred in cells overexpressing DCP1a fragment without TD domain.</p>
<p>To precisely identify the minimal functional region of DCP1, we generated a series of DCP1a expression constructs by sequentially removing its domains. The structured core of DCP1 comprises its N-terminal EVH1 and HLM domains, followed by a long unstructured region (amino acids 169-538) and the terminal trimeric domain (TD). Given the presence of this unstructured region, we utilized AlphaFold to predict areas potentially possessing secondary or tertiary structures. This approach enabled us to design more effective truncations. We began by referencing an AlphaFold prediction indicating that the DCP1a segment spanning amino acids 1-254 is structured (AlphaFoldDB: A0A087WT55). Using these predictions, we systematically deleted specific domains and regions. This stepwise truncation method allowed us to pinpoint the crucial segments required for DCP1a’s function with greater accuracy. Overexpression and subsequent complementation assays in DCP1a/b-knockout cells revealed that all the constructs containing the EVH1 domain successfully restored the decapping ability of the enzyme complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I-K</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that the EVH1 domain is of DCP1 is essential for the formation of a functional decapping complex.</p>

<title>DCP1 knockout does not affect the formation of P-bodies or the enzymatic activity of DCP2</title>
<p>Since we observed that DCP1 appears to be indispensable for mRNA decapping, we sought to identify the precise role of DCP1 in decapping. To begin with, we explored P-body formation and DCP2 localization in DCP1a/b-knockout cells. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis of P-body formation indicated that DCP1 has little involvement in P-body formation. In DCP1a/b-knockout cells, DCP2 remained localized in P-body granules, indicating no correlation between DCP1 and P-body formation or DCP2 localization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; Supplementary Figure S3A, B). Meanwhile, we observed that in DCP1a/b knockout cells, although the number of P-bodies only slightly increased, their size significantly enlarged (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; Supplementary Figure S3C). This suggests that the knockout of DCP1a/b, while not affecting P-body formation, still has some impact on the morphology of P-bodies.</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to clarify if the absence of cellular DCP1 has a direct effect on decapping activity of DCP2. To evaluate the effects of DCP1 on the decapping activity of DCP2, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> decapping assays by immunoprecipitating DCP2 extracted from wild-type and DCP1a/b-knockout cells. We observed a decrease in the enzymatic activity of DCP2 immunopurified from DCP1a/b knockout cells, but it still retains a considerable decapping ability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>; Supplementary Figure S3D). These data suggest that, in accordance with prior literature, DCP2 is sufficient for <italic>in vitro</italic> decapping without DCP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lykke-Andersen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">van Dijk <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, our previous observations emphasize the significant role of DCP1a/b gene knockout in the regulation of mRNA decapping <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Although DCP2 still exhibits decapping activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, the decapping process of DCP2 is significantly inhibited <italic>in vivo</italic>. It should be noted that <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments inherently measure different aspects of molecular function. The discrepancies between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments are of great significance because <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments more comprehensively reflect the regulatory role of DCP1. The <italic>in vitro</italic> environment lacks the complexity and numerous cofactors present <italic>in vivo</italic>, often failing to accurately replicate the interactions occurring within cells, highlighting the indispensable contribution of DCP1 in real mRNA decapping scenarios. Therefore, our study indicates that relying solely on <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments is insufficient to fully understand the function of DCP1; while important, in vitro experiments cannot completely capture the dynamics within cells. Together, these experiments deepen the understanding of DCP1’s role in the decapping process <italic>in vivo</italic>. The lack of a significant difference in decapping activity observed <italic>in vitro</italic> does not negate DCP1’s regulatory role in the cellular context; rather, it underscores our previous oversight of DCP1’s importance under in vitro conditions and the fact that DCP1’s regulatory mechanisms in the decapping process remain to be elucidated.</p>

<title>DCP1 is a central scaffold protein that recruits multiple decapping factors to DCP2</title>
<p>Since the discrepancies between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments reflect the regulatory role of DCP1 in decapping machinery. There are various factors and complex regulatory networks in the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment, which make it challenging to accurately simulate <italic>in vitro</italic>. To determine the underlying cause, we postulated that the complexity of the cellular setting, where multiple factors and cofactors are at play, contributes to these discrepancies. The observed cellular decapping defect in DCP1a/b knockout cells might be attributed to DCP1 functioning as a scaffold. It is conceivable that DCP1 facilitates the assembly of decapping modules, enabling their interaction with DCP2. Alternatively, this discrepancy could stem from the unique contributions of individual subunits, such as EDC4, EDC3, DDX6, and other decapping factors, to DCP2’s activity. To explore this possibility, our investigation aimed to identify the specific decapping factors that rely on DCP1 for interaction with DCP2. We overexpressed V5-SBP-or GFP-tagged DCP2 in wild-type and DCP1a/b-knockout cells and then performed coimmunoprecipitation assays with RNase A treatment. In the absence of DCP1, interactions between DCP2 and the decapping factors EDC3, DDX6, and PatL1 (Edc3, Dhh1, and Pat1 in yeast, respectively) were almost completely suppressed, but not with EDC4 (also known as Ge-1 in Drosophila), a major component of the core decapping complex in metazoans (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the interaction between DCP2 and PNRC1, as well as PNRC2, which acts in synergy with DCP1 to promote decapping, was reduced in DCP1a/b-knockout cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F, G</xref>). These findings suggest that DCP1 acts as a binding platform for multiple decapping factors and is essential for the interaction of these cofactors with DCP2 in human cells.</p>

<title>DCP2-mediated decapping is not merely due to the presence of decapping factors on the DCP1a scaffold</title>
<p>Based on our observation that DCP1a EVH1 domain is sufficient to rescue the decapping defect in DCP1a/b knockout cells, we hypothesized that the DCP1 EVH1 domain may play a key role in regulating the decapping machinery. To evaluate the contribution of this domain to the formation of the decapping complex, we sought to identify which decapping factors interact with the DCP1 EVH1 domain. We overexpressed full-length or fragmented GFP-tagged DCP1a in DCP1a/b-knockout cells and subsequently immunoprecipitated the protein in the presence of RNase A. The EVH1 domain of DCP1a did not interact with any of the decapping factors except for DCP2 and PNRC1/2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure. 3A-D</xref>).</p>

GFP-MBP was used as a control. The levels of β-globin-6xMS2bs mRNA bound to V5-SBP-DCP2 E148Q were immunoprecipitated using streptavidin beads and quantified by RT-PCR with GAPDH as a reference.

<p>PNRC1 has been shown to interact with the NMD factor UPF1, indicating that it is involved in the NMD pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cho <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that PNRC1 serves as a regulator of rRNA maturation within nucleoli, tightly controlling the process of ribosomal RNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gaviraghi <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Previous studies have also demonstrated the involvement of PNRC2 in the NMD pathway. Structural analysis of the PNRC2-DCP1a complex has shown that PNRC2 can directly activate the decapping process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cho <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lai et al., 2012</xref>). Given this background, we investigated the functional role of PNRC1/2 in modulating the activity of DCP2 through DCP1 EVH1 domain.</p>
<p>To determine whether PNRC1 and PNRC2 are necessary for DCP2 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used shRNA to knockdown the expression of PNRC1 and PNRC2 individually (Supplemental Figure S4). Unlike the DCP1 knockout, the knockdown of PNRC1 or PNRC2 had only a minor effect on the results of the tethering assays, suggesting that PNRC1 and PNRC2 are not essential for DCP2 activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>). Therefore, we concluded the activation of the decapping complex by the DCP1a cannot be solely attributed to the binding of decapping factors on the DCP1a scaffold. This observation suggests that while DCP1’s scaffolding function is crucial for recruiting cofactors, the decapping process likely involves additional layers of regulation that are not fully understood.</p>

<title>DCP1 increases the mRNA-binding affinity of DCP2</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that the marked reduction in decapping activity observed in DCP1a/b-knockout cells is not exclusively essential for DCP1’s function as a scaffold in the decapping process. This discrepancy prompts an investigation into the potential role of the DCP1 EVH1 domain, as previous studies have theorized its critical involvement in DCP2 mRNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Valkov <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), although this aspect has not been explored to date. To evaluate this hypothesis, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of DCP1-mediated substrate binding by DCP2.</p>
<p>We evaluated the impact of DCP1 on interactions between DCP2 and mRNA in human cells using tethering assays with a catalytically inactive mutant DCP2 protein (DCP2 E148Q) introduced into DCP1a/b-knockout cells. This prevented the degradation of target mRNAs and maintained them in the decapping stage. Full-length DCP1a or the EVH1 domain alone were also introduced into the cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). DCP2 samples were then immunoprecipitated and real-time PCR was used to measure the concentrations of reporter mRNAs that interacted with DCP2. Our results show that the mRNA binding affinity of DCP2 is weak in the absence of DCP1 but significantly increases in the presence of DCP1a full-length or the EVH1 domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H, I</xref>). While these changes may initially seem minor <italic>in vitro</italic>, their cumulative impact in the dynamic cellular environment could be substantial. Even minor perturbations in RNA binding affinity can trigger cascading effects, leading to significant changes in decapping activity and the accumulation of deadenylated intermediates upon DCP1 depletion. Cellular processes involve complex networks of interrelated events, and small molecular changes can result in amplified biological outcomes.</p>
<p>To further bolster the validity of these findings, we conducted RNA immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) assays. Reporter RNA was isolated during the decapping process and consistent with the findings of the DCP2 immunoprecipitation assays, high levels of DCP2 were observed in the RNA immunoprecipitation assays when the DCP1a EVH1 domain was overexpressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). These findings strongly underscore the significance of the EVH1 domain of DCP1a in enhancing interactions between DCP2 and mRNA, demonstrating how subtle molecular variations observed in vitro may translate into significant phenotypic outcomes within the complex cellular environment, emphasizing the critical regulatory role of DCP1a in the cellular decapping process. Taken together, we demonstrated that DCP1a can regulate DCP2’s cellular decapping activity by enhancing DCP2’s affinty to RNA, in addition to bridging the interactions of DCP2 with other decapping factors. This represents a pivotal molecular mechanism by which DCP1a exerts its regulatory control over the mRNA decapping process.</p>

<title>DCP1a and DCP1b regulate distinct endogenous downstream mRNA</title>
<p>The existence of two apparently redundant DCP1 paralogs, DCP1a and DCP1b, is intriguing, and raises the question whether they are truly redundant or in fact have distinct roles. Considering the low sequence similarity of DCP1a and DCP1b and since DCP1 was observed to enhance mRNA recognition by DCP2, we hypothesized that the DCP1 paralogs may contribute to the preferential regulation of specific mRNA targets. In other words, although DCP1a and DCP1b may be redundant in the general mRNA decapping process, they may differentially regulate specific mRNA targets.</p>
<p>We performed an RNA-Seq analysis of HEK-293T cells lacking DCP1a, DCP1b, or both and compared the results with those from wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; Supplementary Figure S5A-D). There were significant differences in the transcript profiles of the knockout cells. In DCP1a-, DCP1b-, and DCP1a/b-knockout cells, the expression of 604, 1,255, and 1,146 genes were significantly downregulated, while 504, 677, and 1,383 genes were significantly upregulated (Supplementary Table 3-5). Notably, only a subset of genes dysregulated in both DCP1a- and DCP1b-knockout cells showed alterations in DCP1a/b-knockout cells. This observation is further evidence of the crucial role of DCP1 in decapping (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). It’s worth mentioning that these significantly altered genes could be caused by both the direct effect of the accumulation of the target genes or the indirect effect of the accumulation of target genes.</p>

<title>DCP1a and DCP1b play distinct roles in cancer and gene expression regulation</title>
<p>To identify the gene sets associated with DCP1a and DCP1b, we performed GSEA for Hallmark, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and REACTOM pathways using the transcriptome data from DCP1a and DCP1b knockout experiments. Analysis of the Hallmark pathways revealed that multiple cancer-related pathways were activated in DCP1a-knockout and/or DCP1b-knockout cells, such as apoptosis, E2F targets, MYC targets, the mTOR signalling pathway, the G2/M checkpoint pathway, the KRAS signalling pathway, and the epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Results for the GO, KEGG and REACTOM pathways likewise showed that DCP1a is involved in other cancer-related pathways, such as the Notch signalling pathway, embryonic skeletal system development, vasculature development, and the mitotic cell cycle pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; Supplementary Figure S5E–H). These results are consistent with recent findings that DCP1a is strongly associated with embryonic growth and tumour development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ibayashi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Wu et al., 2021a</xref>), and suggest that DCP1a is more strongly associated with cancer than is DCP1b.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we noted that the activation of capped intron-containing pre-mRNA processing was evident in both DCP1a- and DCP1b-deficient cells (Supplementary Figure S5H). This observation aligns with the understanding that the depletion of DCP1a not only diminishes mRNA degradation and transcription but also underscores the pivotal role of DCP1 in the orchestration of gene expression. To further assess the clinical relevance of our findings, we evaluated the expression levels of DCP1a and DCP1b using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Consistent with the above results, we found that expression levels of DCP1a were reduced in various cancers: bladder urothelial carcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, and thymoma. In contrast, DCP1b exhibited significant upregulation in certain cancer types while showing downregulation in others. Additionally, higher expression levels of DCP1a are found to be associated with a longer progression-free interval (PFI) in uterine carcinosarcoma carcinoma (Supplementary Figure S6A). Notably, higher expression of DCP1b is associated with a shorter PFI in brain lower grade glioma (Supplementary Figure S6B) and associated with a longer PFI in many other cancer types, including adrenocortical carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, uveal melanoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (Supplementary Figure S6C). This suggests that the role of DCP1b in tumorigenesis is multifaceted and context-dependent. In summary, these findings indicate that DCP1a and DCP1b likely have distinct targets and play non-redundant roles. The nuanced functions of DCP1a and DCP1b warrant further investigation to fully elucidate their specific contributions.</p>

<title>DCP1a and DCP1b play different roles in cellular metabolism</title>
<p>To decipher the distinct biological functions of DCP1a and DCP1b, we employ metabolic profiling to investigate the complex metabolic alterations resulting from their absence, thus deepening our grasp of their cellular roles. Through untargeted metabolomic profiling of DCP1a-, DCP1b-, and DCP1a/b-knockout cells, we aim to thoroughly assess the impact of these knockouts, uncovering the unique roles of these proteins. After removing features that appeared in control samples and manually removing features with a poor peak shape and extremely low abundance, we identified approximately 123 metabolites in the experimental samples. We successfully differentiated DCP1a- and DCP1b-knockout cells using PLS-DA score plots, loading plots, and heatmaps of the metabolomic data and the differences in the metabolomic profiles revealed the distinct impacts of DCP1a and DCP1b on cellular metabolism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; Supplementary Figure S7A, B). Additionally, the volcano plots illustrated the significant metabolic disparities among DCP1a-, DCP1b-, and DCP1a/b-knockout cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-D</xref>), emphasizing the presence of noticeable differences. Remarkably, uridine diphosphate (UDP)-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), GlcNAc, glycerophosphoserine, and glycerophosphocholine levels were significantly elevated in DCP1a- and DCP1a/b-knockout cells, whereas those of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) were reduced.

<p>The significantly altered metabolites in the DCP1-knockout cells included UDP–GlcNAc and GlcNAc, which are associated with the amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathway (hsa00520) in KEGG (Supplementary Figure S8). Further investigation revealed that the levels of these metabolites are correlated with the transcript levels associated with the amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>DCP1 is a key component in the mRNA decay pathway, crucial for the regulation of gene expression. Research across various species, from yeast to humans, has provided insights into the conservation and evolution of mRNA decapping mechanisms. Notably, DCP1 interacts with other decapping proteins such as DCP2, forming a decapping complex for mRNA degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the localization and functional analysis of DCP1 in different model organisms, as well as its importance in plant species, highlight its role in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lall <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sakuno <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). However, in human cells, the specific biological functions of DCP1, especially the distinctions between its two paralogs, DCP1a and DCP1b, have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that DCP1 plays a key role in promoting mRNA decapping in human cells. By generating cell lines deficient in DCP1a, DCP1b, or both, our research emphasizes the importance of human DCP1 in the decapping process. We also verified that DCP1 is not only a key platform for assembling various mRNA decapping cofactors, but also established that the EVH1 domain of DCP1 is critical for the mRNA decapping process. Through RNA immunoprecipitation assays, we discovered that the interactions between DCP2 and mRNA heavily rely on the presence of DCP1’s EVH1 domain. These findings imply that DCP1 facilitates the binding of DCP2 to target mRNAs through multiple mechanisms, thereby enhancing the efficiency of mRNA decapping. Finally, our integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses comparing the specific functions of DCP1a and DCP1b in human cells revealed that they can regulate distinct endogenous mRNA targets and biological processes.</p>
<p>In a prior investigation, we made an intriguing discovery. In human cells, substituting the conserved NR-loop with a flexible GSSG loop in the EVH1 domain of DCP1 had no adverse effect on the interaction between DCP1 and DCP2, nor did it impede their integration into decapping factors. However, this seemingly subtle alteration had a significant consequence – it disrupted the activation of DCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). This points to the pivotal role played by the EVH1 domain of DCP1 in the activation of DCP2, which, in turn, is a critical step in the mRNA decapping process. These findings, combined with our findings in the present study, provide compelling evidence that the DCP1 EVH1 domain is not just a passive component but a crucial player in coordinating interactions and facilitating conformational changes necessary for efficient mRNA decapping. A comprehensive functional characterization of these mechanisms is imperative to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying DCP1-mediated activation of decapping.</p>
<p>While the protein components of the mRNA decapping machinery have been identified, our current understanding of the distinct roles played by individual decapping factors throughout the process remains limited. Notably, whether the different decapping factors confer target specificity has yet to be clarified. Although previous studies have suggested that DCP1a and DCP1b, the two paralogs of DCP1, play redundant roles in general mRNA decay, this notion is mainly based on reporter assays and single-gene approaches. The specific regulation of endogenous mRNA targets and biological processes by DCP1a and DCP1b is yet to be elucidated.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated potential functional differences between DCP1a and DCP1b through a combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis. While DCP1a and DCP1b have both been implicated in cancer, our observation of significant alterations in multiple cancer-related pathways in DCP1a-knockout cells suggests that DCP1a might be more prominently associated with cancer development. Furthermore, the downregulation of DCP1a in multiple cancer types further supports the concept that DCP1a is a cancer-associated gene and suggests that its dysregulation may play a contributory role in the onset and progression of diverse cancers. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ibayashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2021a</xref>). Survival analysis has indicated that elevated DCP1a expression in uterine carcinosarcoma carcinoma correlates with improved progression-free interval (PFI). Conversely, higher levels of DCP1b expression are associated with both favorable and unfavorable PFIs. Together with the observation of dysregulation of DCP1b in numerous cancers, we speculate that DCP1b is also implicated in cancer pathogenesis, and further studies are required to fully understand the roles of DCP1a and DCP1b in cancer pathogenesis.</p>
<p>With the transcriptome profiles of DCP1a and DCP1b knockout cells, we anticipate significant upregulation among potential targets. However, to discern direct targets from genes upregulated due to indirect effects, it is imperative to delve deeper into mRNA decay rates. Various tools and methods, such as time-series RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Viegas et al., 2023</xref>) or specialized sequencing techniques like Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blumberg et al., 2021</xref>) or RNA Approach to Equilibrium Sequencing (RATE-Seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdul-Rahman and Gresham, 2018</xref>), have been proposed to estimate mRNA decay rates. Luo et al. utilized TimeLapse-seq to identify potential targets for DCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Luo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schofield et al., 2018</xref>). Incorporating these approaches could provide a more comprehensive understanding in this context.</p>
<p>Notably, our candidate target genes exhibited minimal overlap with the 91 targets of DCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>); only EPPK1 overlapped among potential targets of DCP1b_KO, while TES, PAX6, and C18orf21 were the only overlapping genes in the DCP1a/b double knockout.</p>
<p>Our scrutiny of the transcript profiles and metabolite levels within DCP1a- and DCP1b-knockout cells has unveiled their unique contributions to cellular processes. While DCP1a and DCP1b might exhibit certain common gene targets, the distinct transcriptome profiles suggest their functions are not entirely interchangeable. Pathway analysis indicated that DCP1a and DCP1b may have partially complementary roles in regulating cellular pathways. Additionally, several metabolites showed notable alterations in knockout cells, potentially opening a new avenue for investigating the metabolic consequences of DCP1 knockout. Our findings yield valuable understanding of the distinct functions of DCP1a and DCP1b in human cells and the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying cellular metabolism. The potential targets we identified could be investigated further by quantifying specific transcripts and metabolites, and a larger sample size would facilitate the identification of correlations between differentially expressed genes and differentially abundant metabolites.</p>
<p>Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms governing DCP1-mediated decapping in human cells and the coordinated regulation of DCP1a and DCP1b, which has important implications for gene expression and cellular function. Future biochemical characterization of the specific mRNA targets and biological pathways regulated by DCP1a and DCP1b is necessary to fully elucidate their roles. This information may help uncover the precise mechanisms underlying mRNA decapping and gene regulation. Furthermore, studying the dysregulation of DCP1 paralogs, especially in cancer, may reveal potential therapeutic targets and improve treatment strategies.</p>

<p>This study attempts to understand the functional roles of the human DCP1 paralogs in regulating RNA decay by DCP2. Using a combination of cellular-based assays and in vitro assays, the authors conclude that DCP1a/b plays a role in regulating DCP2 activity. While this revised version presents some new and interesting observations on human DCP1, the underlying data to support its claims remain <bold>incomplete</bold>. Overall, these results will be <bold>useful</bold> to the RNA community.</p>

<p>Summary &amp; Assessment:</p>
<p>The catalytic core of the eukaryotic decapping complex consists of the decapping enzyme DCP2 and its key activator DCP1. In humans, there are two paralogs of DCP1, DCP1a and DCP1b, that are known to interact with DCP2 and recruit additional cofactors or coactivators to the decapping complex; however, the mechanisms by which DCP1 activates decapping and the specific roles of DCP1a versus DCP1b, remain poorly defined. In this manuscript, the authors used CRISPR/Cas9-generated DCP1a/b knockout cells to begin to unravel some of the differential roles for human DCP1a and DCP1b in mRNA decapping, gene regulation, and cellular metabolism. While this manuscript presents some new and interesting observations on human DCP1 (e.g. human DCP1a/b KO cells are viable and can be used to investigate DCP1 function; only the EVH1 domain, and not its disordered C-terminal region which recruits many decapping cofactors, is apparently required for efficient decapping in cells; DCP1a and b target different subsets of mRNAs for decay and may regulate different aspects of metabolism), there is one key claim about the role of DCP1 in regulating DCP2-mediated decapping that is still incompletely or inconsistently supported by the presented data in this revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths &amp; well-supported claims:</p>
<p>• Through in vivo tethering assays in CRISPR/Cas9-generated DCP1a/b knockout cells, the authors show that DCP1 depletion leads to significant defects in decapping and the accumulation of capped, deadenylated mRNA decay intermediates.</p>
<p>
• DCP1 truncation experiments reveal that only the EVH1 domain of DCP1 is necessary to rescue decapping defects in DCP1a/b KO cells.</p>
<p>
• RNA and protein immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that DCP1 acts as a scaffold to help recruit multiple decapping cofactors to the decapping complex (e.g. EDC3, DDX6, PATL1 PNRC1, and PNRC2), but that none of these cofactors are essential for DCP2-mediated decapping in cells.</p>
<p>
• The authors investigated the differential roles of DCP1a and DCP1b in gene regulation through transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis and found that these DCP1 paralogs target different mRNA transcripts for decapping and have different roles in cellular metabolism and their apparent links to human cancers. (Although I will note that I can't comment on the experimental details and/or rigor of the transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, as these are outside my expertise.)</p>
<p>Weaknesses &amp; incompletely supported claims:</p>
<p>(1) One of the key mechanistic claims of the paper is that &quot;DCP1a can regulate DCP2's cellular decapping activity by enhancing DCP2's affinity to RNA, in addition to bridging the interactions of DCP2 with other decapping factors. This represents a pivotal molecular mechanism by which DCP1a exerts its regulatory control over the mRNA decapping process.&quot; Similar versions of this claim are repeated in the abstract and discussion sections. However, this claim appears to be at odds with the observations that: (a) in vitro decapping assays with immunoprecipitated DCP2 show that DCP1 knockout does not significantly affect the enzymatic activity of DCP2 (Fig 2C&amp;D; I note that there may be a very small change in DCP2 activity shown in panel D, but this may be due to slightly different amounts of immunoprecipitated DCP2 used in the assay); and (b) the authors show only weak changes in relative RNA levels immunoprecipitated by DCP2 with versus without DCP1 (~2-3 fold change in Fig 3H, where expression of the EVH1 domain, previously shown in this manuscript to fully rescue the DCP1 KO decapping defects in cells, looks to be almost within error of the control in terms of increasing RNA binding). If DCP1 pivotally regulates decapping activity by enhancing RNA binding to DCP2, why is no difference in in vitro decapping activity observed in the absence of DCP1, and very little change observed in the amounts of RNA immunoprecipitated by DCP2 with the addition of the DCP1 EVH1 domain?</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript and in their response to initial reviews, the authors rightly point out that in vivo effects may not always be fully reflected by or recapitulated in in vitro experiments due to the lack of cellular cofactors and simpler environment for the in vitro experiment, as compared to the complex environment in the cell. I fully agree with this of course! And further completely agree with the authors that this highlights the critical importance of in cell experiments to investigate biological functions and mechanisms! However, because the in vitro kinetic and IP/binding data both suggest that the DCP1 EVH1 domain has minimal to no effects on RNA decapping or binding affinity, while the in cell data suggest the EVH1 domain alone is sufficient to rescue large decapping defects in DCP1a/b KO cells (and that all the decapping cofactors tested were dispensable for this), I would argue there is insufficient evidence here to make a claim that (maybe weakly) enhanced RNA binding induced by DCP1 is what is regulating the cellular decapping activity. Maybe there are as-yet-untested cellular cofactors that bind to the EVH1 domain of DCP1 that change either RNA recruitment or the kinetics of RNA decapping in cells; we can't really tell from the presented data so far. Furthermore, even if it is the case that the EVH1 domain modestly enhances RNA binding to DCP2, the authors haven't shown that this effect is what actually regulates the large change in DCP2 activity upon DCP1 KO observed in the cell.</p>
<p>Overall, while I absolutely appreciate that there are many possible reasons for the differences observed in the in vitro versus in cell RNA decapping and binding assays, because this discrepancy between those data exists, it seems difficult to draw any clear conclusions about the actual mechanisms by which DCP1 helps regulate RNA decapping by DCP2. For example, in the cell it could be that DCP1 enhances RNA binding, or recruits unidentified cofactors that themselves enhance RNA binding, or that DCP1 allosterically enhances DCP2-mediated decapping kinetics, or a combination of these, etc; my point is that without in vitro data that clearly support one of those mechanisms and links this mechanism back to cellular DCP2 decapping activity (for example, in cell data that show EVH1 mutants that impair RNA binding fail to rescue DCP1 KO decapping defects), it's difficult to attribute the observed in cell effects of DCP1a/b KO and rescue by the EVH1 domain directly to enhancement of RNA binding (precisely because, as the authors describe, the decapping process and regulation may be very complex in the cell!).</p>
<p>This contradiction between the in vitro and in-cell decapping data undercuts one of the main mechanistic takeaways from the first half of the paper; I still think this conclusion is overstated in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Additional minor comment:</p>
<p>• Related to point (1) above, the kinetic analysis presented in Fig 2C shows that the large majority of transcript is mostly decapped at the first 5 minute timepoint; it may be that DCP2-mediated decapping activity is actually different in vitro with or without DCP1, but that this is being missed because the reaction is basically done in less than 5 minutes under the conditions being assayed (i.e. these are basically endpoint assays under these conditions). It may be that if kinetics were done under conditions to slow down the reaction somewhat (e.g. lower Dcp2 concentration, lower temperatures), so that more of the kinetic behavior is captured, the apparent discrepancy between in vitro and in-cell data would be much less. Indeed, previous studies have shown that in yeast, Dcp1 strongly activates the catalytic step (kcat) of decapping by ~10-fold, and reduces the KM by only ~2 fold (Floor et al, NSMB 2010). It might be beneficial to use purified proteins here, if possible, to better control reaction conditions.</p>
<p>In their response to initial reviews, the authors comment that they tried to purify human DCP2 from E coli, but were unable to obtain active enzyme in this way. Fair enough! I will only comment that just varying the relative concentration of immunoprecipitated DCP2 would likely be enough to slow down the reaction and see if activity differences are seen in different kinetic regimes, without the need to obtain fully purified / recombinant Dcp2.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses &amp; incompletely supported claims:</p>
<p>(1) A central mechanistic claim of the paper is that &quot;DCP1a can regulate DCP2's cellular decapping activity by enhancing DCP2's affinity to RNA, in addition to bridging the interactions of DCP2 with other decapping factors. This represents a pivotal molecular mechanism by which DCP1a exerts its regulatory control over the mRNA decapping process.&quot; Similar versions of this claim are repeated in the abstract and discussion sections. However, this appears to be entirely at odds with the observation from in vitro decapping assays with immunoprecipitated DCP2 that showed DCP1 knockout does not significantly affect the enzymatic activity of DCP2 (Figures 2B-D; I note that there may be a very small change in DCP2 activity shown in panel C, but this may be due to slightly different amounts of immunoprecipitated DCP2 used in the assay, as suggested by panel D). If DCP1 pivotally regulates decapping activity by enhancing RNA binding to DCP2, why is no difference in decapping activity observed in the absence of DCP1?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors show only weak changes in relative RNA levels immunoprecipitated by DCP2 with versus without DCP1 (~2-3 fold change; consistent with the Valkov 2016 NSMB paper, which shows what looks like only modest changes in RNA binding affinity for yeast Dcp2 +/- Dcp1). Is the argument that only a 2-3 fold change in RNA binding affinity is responsible for the sizable decapping defects and significant accumulation of deadenylated intermediates observed in cells upon Dcp1 depletion? (and if so, why is this the case for in-cell data, but not the immunoprecipitated in vitro data?)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's thoughtful comments on our paper. The reviewer points out an apparent contradiction between the claim that DCP1a regulates DCP2's cellular decapping activity and the observation that knocking out DCP1a does not significantly affect DCP2's enzymatic activity in vitro. However, it is important to underscore the challenge of reconciling differences between in vitro and in vivo experiments in scientific research. Although in vitro systems provide a controlled environment, they have inherent limitations that often fail to capture the complexities of cellular processes. Our in vitro experiments used immunoprecipitated proteins to ensure the presence of relevant factors, but these experiments cannot fully replicate the precise stoichiometry and dynamic interactions present in a cellular environment. Furthermore, the limited volume in vitro can actually facilitate reactions that may not occur as readily in the complex and heterogeneous environment of a cell. Therefore, the lack of a significant difference in decapping activity observed in vitro does not necessarily negate the regulatory role of DCP1 in the cellular context. Rather, it underscores our previous oversight of DCP1's importance in the decapping process under in vitro conditions. The conclusions regarding DCP1's regulatory mechanisms remain valid and supported by the presented evidence, especially when considering the inherent differences between in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions. It is precisely because of these differences that we recognized our previous underestimation of DCP1's significance. Therefore, our subsequent experiments focused on elucidating DCP1's regulatory mechanisms in the decapping process</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors acknowledge this apparent discrepancy between the in vitro DCP2 decapping assays and in-cell decapping data, writing: &quot;this observation could be attributed to the inherent constraints of in vitro assays, which often fall short of faithfully replicating the complexity of the cellular environment where multiple factors and cofactors are at play. To determine the underlying cause, we postulated that the observed cellular decapping defect in DCP1a/b knockout cells might be attributed to DCP1 functioning as a scaffold.&quot; This is fair. They next show that DCP1 acts as a scaffold to recruit multiple factors to DCP2 in cells (EDC3, DDX6, PatL1, and PNRC1 and 2). However, while DCP1 is shown to recruit multiple cofactors to DCP2 (consistent with other studies in the decapping field, and primarily through motifs in the Dcp1 C-terminal tail), the authors ultimately show that *none* of these cofactors are actually essential for DCP2-mediated decapping in cells (Figures 3A-F). More specifically, the authors showed that the EVH1 domain was sufficient to rescue decapping defects in DCP1a/b knockout cells, that PNRC1 and PNRC2 were the only cofactors that interact with the EVH1 domain, and finally that shRNA-mediated PNRC1 or PNCR2 knockdown has no effect on in-cell decapping (Figures 3E and F). Therefore, based on the presented data, while DCP1 certainly does act as a scaffold, it doesn't seem to be the case that the major cellular decapping defect observed in DCP1a/b knockout is due to DCP1's ability to recruit specific cofactors to DCP2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The findings that none of the decapping cofactors recruited by DCP1 to DCP2 are essential for decapping in cells further underscore the complexity of the decapping process in vivo. This observation suggests that while DCP1's scaffolding function is crucial for recruiting cofactors, the decapping process likely involves additional layers of regulation that are not fully captured by our current understanding of DCP1. Furthermore, the reviewer mentions that the observed changes in RNA binding affinity (approximately 2-3 fold) in our in vitro experiments seem relatively modest. While these changes may appear insignificant in vitro, their cumulative impact in the dynamic cellular environment could be substantial. Even minor perturbations in RNA binding affinity can trigger cascading effects, leading to significant changes in decapping activity and the accumulation of deadenylated intermediates upon Dcp1 depletion. Cellular processes involve complex networks of interrelated events, and small molecular changes can result in amplified biological outcomes. The subtle molecular variations observed <italic>in vitro</italic> may translate into significant phenotypic outcomes within the complex cellular environment, underscoring the importance of DCP1a's regulatory role in the cellular decapping process.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>So as far as I can tell, the discrepancy between the in vitro (DCP1 not required) and in-cell (DCP1 required) decapping data, remains entirely unresolved. Therefore, I don't think that the conclusions that DCP1 regulates decapping by (a) changing RNA binding affinity (authors show this doesn't matter in vitro, and that the change in RNA binding affinity is very small) or (b) by bridging interactions of cofactors with DCP2 (authors show all tested cofactors are dispensable for robust in-cell decapping activity), are supported by the evidence presented in the paper (or convincingly supported by previous structural and functional studies of the decapping complex).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have addressed the reconciliation of differences between in vitro and in vivo experiments in the revised manuscript and emphasized the importance of considering cellular interactions when interpreting our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Related to the RNA binding claims mentioned above, are the differences shown in Figure 3H statistically significant? Why are there no error bars shown for the MBP control? (I understand this was normalized to 1, but presumably, there were 3 biological replicates here that have some spread of values?). The individual data points for each replicate should be displayed for each bar so that readers can better assess the spread of data and the significance of the observed differences. I've listed these points as major because of the key mechanistic claim that DCP1 enhances RNA binding to DCP2 hinges in large part on this data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your feedback. Regarding your comments on the statistical significance of the differences shown in Figure 3H and the absence of error bars for the MBP control, we will address these concerns in the revised manuscript. We’ll include individual data points for the three biological replicates and corresponding statistical analysis to more clearly demonstrate the data spread and significance of the observed differences.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Also related to point (1) above, the kinetic analysis presented in Figure 2C shows that the large majority of transcript is mostly decapped at the first 5-minute timepoint; it may be that DCP2-mediated decapping activity is actually different in vitro with or without DCP1, but that this is being missed because the reaction is basically done in less than 5 minutes under the conditions being assayed (i.e. these are basically endpoint assays under these conditions). It may be that if kinetics were done under conditions to slow down the reaction somewhat (e.g. lower Dcp2 concentration, lower temperatures), so that more of the kinetic behavior is captured, the apparent discrepancy between in vitro and in-cell data would be much less. Indeed, previous studies have shown that in yeast, Dcp1 strongly activates the catalytic step (kcat) of decapping by ~10-fold, and reduces the KM by only ~2 fold (Floor et al, NSMB 2010). It might be beneficial to use purified proteins here (only a Western blot is used in Figure 2D to show the presence of DCP2 and/or DCP1, but do these complexes have other, and different, components immunoprecipitated along with them?), if possible, to better control reaction conditions.</p>
<p>This contradiction between the in vitro and in-cell decapping data undercuts one of the main mechanistic takeaways from the first half of the paper. This needs to be addressed/resolved with further experiments to better define the role of DCP1-mediated activation, or the mechanistic conclusions significantly changed or removed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We genuinely appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments on the kinetic analysis presented in Figure 2C. Your astute observation regarding the potential influence of reaction duration on the interpretation of in vitro decapping activity, especially in the absence of DCP1, is well-received. The time-sensitive nature of our experiments, as you rightly pointed out, might not fully capture the nuanced kinetic behaviors. In addition, the DCP2 complex purified from cells could not be precisely quantified. In response to your suggestion, we attempted to purify human DCP2 protein from E. coli; however, regrettably, the purified protein failed to exhibit any enzymatic activity. This disparity may be attributed to species differences.</p>
<p>Considering the reviewer’s valuable insights, our revised manuscript emphasized that purified DCP2 from cells exhibits activity regardless of the presence of DCP1. This adjustment aims to provide a clearer perspective on our findings and to better align with the nuances of our experimental design and the meticulous consideration of the results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The second half of the paper compares the transcriptomic and metabolic profiles of DCP1a versus DCP1b knockouts to reveal that these target a different subset of mRNAs for degradation and have different levels of cellular metabolites. This is a great application of the DCP1a/b KO cells developed in this paper and provides new information about DCP1a vs b function in metazoans, which to my knowledge has not really been explored at all. However, the analysis of DCP1 function/expression levels in human cancer seems superficial and inconclusive: for example, the authors conclude that &quot;...these findings indicate that DCP1a and DCP1b likely have distinct and non-redundant roles in the development and progression of cancer&quot;, but what is the evidence for this? I see that DCP1a and b levels vary in different cancer cell types, but is there any evidence that these changes are actually linked to cancer development, progression, or tumorigenesis? If not, these broader conclusions should be removed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you to the reviewer for pointing out that such a description may be misleading. We have removed our previous broader conclusion and revised our sentences. To further explore the potential impact of DCP1a and DCP1b on cancer progression, we examined the association between the expression levels of DCP1a and DCP1b and progression-free interval (PFI). We have incorporated this information into our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors used CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce frameshift mutations that result in premature termination codons in DCP1a/b knockout cells (verified by Sanger sequencing). They then use Western blotting with DCP1a or DCP1b antibodies to confirm the absence of DCP1 in the knockout cell lines. However, the DCP1a antibody used in this study (Sigma D5444) is targeted to the C-terminal end of DCP1a. Can the authors conclusively rule out that the CRISPR/Cas-generated mutations do not result in the production of truncated DCP1a that is just unable to be detected by the C-terminally targeted antibody? While it is likely the introduced premature termination codon in the DCP1a gene results in nonsense-mediated decay of the resulting transcript, this outcome is indeed supported by the knockout results showing large defects in cellular decapping which can be rescued by the addition of the EVH1 domain, it would be better to carefully validate the success of the DCP1a knockout and conclusively show no truncated DCP1a is produced by using N-terminally targeted DCP1a antibodies (as was the case for DCP1b).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comment regarding the validation of our DCP1a/b knockout cell line. We acknowledge your point about the DCP1a C-terminal targeting of the Sigma D5444 antibody used in our Western blot analysis. We agree that we cannot definitively rule out the possibility of truncated DCP1a protein production solely based on the lack of full-length protein detection. To address this limitation, we utilized a commercial information available N-terminally targeted DCP1a antibody (aviva ARP39353_T100) in a Western blot analysis. This will allow us to comprehensively detect any truncated protein fragments remaining after the CRISPR-Cas9-generated frameshift mutation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some additional minor comments:</p>
<p>• More information would be helpful on the choice of DCP1 truncation boundaries; why was 1-254 chosen as one of the truncations?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer's comment and suggestion. Regarding the choice of DCP1 1-254 truncation boundaries based on the predicted structure from AlphaFoldDB (A0A087WT55). We will include this information in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Figure S2D is a pretty important experiment because it suggests that the observed deadenylated intermediates are in fact still capped; can a positive control be added to these experiments to show that removal of cap results in rapid terminator-mediated degradation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, due to our institution's current laboratory safety policies, we are unable to perform experiments involving the use of radioactive isotopes such as 32P. Therefore, while adding the suggested positive control experiment to demonstrate rapid RNA degradation upon decapping would further validate our interpretation, we regret that we cannot carry out this experiment at the moment. However, the observed deadenylated intermediates in Figure S2D match the predicted size of capped RNA fragments, and not the expected sizes of degradation products after decapping. Furthermore, previous literature has well-established that for these types of RNAs, decapping leads directly to rapid 5' to 3' exonuclease-mediated degradation, without producing stable deadenylated intermediates. Thus, we believe that the current data is sufficient to support our conclusion that the deadenylated intermediates retain the 5' cap structure.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The direct targets of DCP1a and/or DCP1b were not determined as the analysis was restricted to RNA-seq to assess RNA abundance, which can be a result of direct or indirect regulation by DCP1a/b.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this important point. In our study, we acknowledge that the use of RNA-seq to assess RNA abundance provides a broad overview of the regulatory impacts of DCP1a and DCP1b. This method captures changes in RNA levels that may arise from both direct and indirect regulatory actions of these proteins. While we did not directly determine the targets of DCP1a and DCP1b, the data obtained from our RNA-seq analysis serve as a foundational step for future targeted experiments, which could include techniques such as RIP-seq, to delineate the direct targets of DCP1a and DCP1b more precisely. We believe that our current findings contribute valuable information to the field and pave the way for these subsequent analyses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>P-bodies appear to be larger in human cells lacking DCP1a and DCP1b but a lack of image quantification prevents this conclusion from being drawn.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable feedback. We have addressed the reviewer’s concern regarding P-bodies' size in human cells lacking DCP1a and DCP1b. We have now performed image quantification and can confirm that P-bodies are indeed larger in these cells.</p>

<p>The lack of details in the methodology and figure legends limit reader understanding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer's concerns regarding the level of detail provided in the methodology and figure legends. To address this, we are committed to enhancing both sections with additional details and clarifications in our revised manuscript. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) To me, the second half of the paper comparing DCP1a and DCP1b is in many ways distinct from the first half and could stand on its own as an interesting paper if this comparative analysis is explored a little deeper (maybe by validating some of the differences in decay observed for individual mRNAs targeted by DCP1a versus DCP1b, by measuring and comparing the decay rates of some individual transcripts under differential control by DCP1a vs b?), and revising the conclusions about links to cancer as mentioned above. I think these later comparative results in the paper present the most new and interesting data concerning DCP1 function in humans (especially since I think the mechanistic conclusions from the first half aren't well supported yet or are at least inconsistent), but when I read these later sections of the paper I struggle to understand the key takeaways from the transcriptomic and metabolomic data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer's suggestions. Estimating the decay rates of individual transcripts within the transcriptomes of DCP1a_KO, DCP1b_KO, and wild type can provide insight into the direct targets of DCP1a or DCP1b. However, this requires either time-series RNA-seq or specialized sequencing technologies such as Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) or RNA Approach to Equilibrium Sequencing (RATE-Seq). Unfortunately, we lack the necessary dataset in our project to estimate the decay rates for the potential targets identified in our RNA-seq data. Despite this limitation, we acknowledge the potential of this approach in identifying the true targets of DCP1a and DCP1b and have included this idea in our discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I think it would be helpful to add a little more descriptive or narrative language to the figure legends (I know some of them are already quite long!) so that readers can follow the general idea of the experiment through the figure legend as well as the main text; as written, the figure legends are mostly exclusively technical details, so it can be hard to parse what experiment is being carried out in some cases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s suggestion, we will strive to improve the language of the figure legends to include technical details while clearly conveying the main idea of the experiment. We will ensure that the language of the figure legends is more readable and comprehensible so that readers can more easily parse what experiment is being carried out.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions for improved or additional experiments, data, or analyses:</p>
<p>The use of RNA-seq to measure RNA abundance in DCP1a and/or b knockout cells can give some insight into both the indirect and direct effects of DCP1a/b on gene expression but cannot identify the direct targets of these genes. Rather, global analysis of RNA stability or capturing uncapped RNA decay intermediates would allow the authors to conclude they have identified direct targets of DCP1a and/or b. Without such analyses, the interpretation of these data should be scaled back to clearly state that RNA levels can be altered through indirect effects of DCP1a/b absence throughout the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. We have modified our sentences to emphasize that the dysregulated genes could be caused by both direct and indirect effects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A control/randomly generated gene list should be analyzed for GO terms to determine whether the enrichment of cancer-related pathways in the differentially expressed genes in the DCP1a/b knockout cells is meaningful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer's comment. We shuffled our gene list and reperformed the pathway enrichment analysis in Figure 4C and 4D 1,000 times. We focused on the following cancer-related pathways: E2F targets, MTORC1 signaling, G2M checkpoint, MYC target V1, EMT transition, KRAS signaling DN, P53 pathway, and NOTCH signaling pathways. We then calculated how many times the q-values obtained from the shuffled gene list were more significant than the q-value obtained from our real data. In four of the eight pathways (E2F targets, MTORC1 signaling, G2M checkpoint, and MYC target v1), none of the shuffled gene lists resulted in a q-value smaller than the real one. In the other four pathways (EMT transition, KRAS signaling DN, P53 pathway, and NOTCH signaling pathways), the q-values were smaller than the real q-value 2, 11, 4, and 4 times out of the 1000 shuffles. Based on the shuffled results, we conclude that the transcriptome of DCP1a/b knockout cells is statistically enriched in these cancer-related pathways.</p>

Some q-values derived from Figure 4C are too small to be labeled on the plots, such as in E2F targets (q value: 5.87E-07), MTORC1 signaling (q values: 6.59E-07 and 1.58E-06 for DCP1a_KO and DCP1b_KO, respectively), MYC target V1 (q value: 0.004644174 for DCP1a_KO), etc. The numbers x/1000 indicate how often the shuffled q-values were smaller than the real q-value out of 1,000 permutations.</p>

<p>Comparisons of the DCP1a and/or b knockout RNA-seq results should be done to published datasets such as those published by Luo et al., Cell Chemical Biology (2021) to determine whether there are common targets with DCP2 and validate the reported findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for reviewer’s suggestion. We compared the upregulated genes from DCP1a_KO, DCP1b_KO, and DCP1a/b_KO cell lines with the 91 targets of DPC2 identified by Luo et al. in Cell Chemical Biology (2021). Only EPPK1 was found to be overlapped between the potential DCP1b_KO targets and the targets of DCP2. No genes were found to be overlapped between the potential DCP1a_KO targets and the targets of DCP2. However, three genes, TES, PAX6, and C18orf21, were found to be overlapped between the significantly upregulated DEGs of DCP1a/b_KO and the targets of DCP2. We have included this information in the discussion section.</p>

<p>The RNA tethering assays are not clear and are difficult to interpret without further controls to delineate the polyadenylated and deadenylated species.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s feedback. We acknowledge that the reviewer might harbor some doubts regarding the outcomes of the RNA tethering assays. Nonetheless, this methodology is well-established and has also found extensive application across many studies. We are committed to enhancing the clarity of our experiment’s details and results within the figure legends and textual descriptions.</p>

<p>The representative images of p-bodies clearly show that DCP1a/b KO cells have larger p-bodies than the wild-type cells. The authors should quantify p-body size in each image set as the current interpretation of the data is that there is no difference in size or number of p-bodies, but the data suggest otherwise.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for the reviewer’s insightful comments and for drawing our attention to the need to quantify p-body sizes in DCP1a/b KO and wild-type cells. We agree with the reviewer’s assessment that the representative images suggest a difference in p-body size between DCP1a/b KO cells and wild-type cells, which we initially overlooked. We will revise our manuscript accordingly to include these findings, ensuring that our interpretation of the data aligns with the observed differences.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Statistical analysis of the Figure 2C results should be included because the difference between the wild-type and Dco1a/b KO cells with GFP-DCP2 looks significantly different but is interpreted in the text as not significant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out the need for a statistical analysis of the results shown in Figure 2C. We acknowledge that the visual difference between the wild-type and Dco1a/b KO cells with GFP-DCP2 suggests a significant variation, which may not have been clearly communicated in our text. We will conduct the necessary statistical analysis to substantiate the observations made in Figure 2C. Furthermore, we would like to emphasize that our primary focus was to demonstrate that purified DCP2 within cells retains its activity even in the absence of DCP1. This critical point will be highlighted and clarified in the revised version of our manuscript to prevent any misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation:</p>
<p>Additional context including what is known about the role of dcp1 in decapping from the decades of work in yeast and other model organisms should be incorporated into the introduction and discussion sections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s suggestion. We will incorporate additional context about the function and significance of DCP1 in decapping processes within our revised manuscript's introduction and discussion sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Details should be provided within the figure legends and methods section on experimental approaches and the number of replicates and statistical analyses used throughout the manuscript. For example, it is not clear whether western blots or RNA-IP experiments were performed more than once as representative images are shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s suggestion. In the figure legends and methods section, we will provide more details about the experimental methods, number of replicates, and statistical analyses. Regarding the Western blots and RNA-IP experiments the reviewer mentioned, we performed multiple experiments and presented representative images in the manuscript. We will clarify this in the revised manuscript to eliminate potential confusion.</p>

<p>The rationale for performing metabolic profiling is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's thoughtful feedback. The rationale behind conducting metabolic profiling in our study is rooted in its efficacy as a valuable tool for deciphering the consequences of specific gene mutations, particularly those closely associated with phenotypic changes or final metabolic pathways. Our objective is to utilize metabolic profiling to unravel the distinct biofunctions of DCP1a and DCP1b. By employing this approach, we aim to gain insights into the intricate metabolic alterations that result from the absence of these genes, thereby enhancing our understanding of their roles in cellular processes. We recognize the necessity of clearly presenting this rationale and promise to bolster the articulation of these points in the revised version of our manuscript to ensure the clarity and transparency of our research motivation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Details in the methods section should be included for the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing validation. The Sangar sequencing results presented in Figure S1b should be explained. The entire western blot(s) should be shown in Figure S1A to give confidence the Dcp1a/b KO cells are not expressing truncated proteins and the epitopes of the antibodies used to detect Dcp1a/b should be described. The northern blot probes should be described and sequences included. The transcriptomics method should be detailed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, in the revised manuscript we will detail the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing validation, explain the Sanger sequencing results in Figure S1b, show the full Western blot in Figure S1A to confirm that the Dcp1a/b knockout cells are not expressing truncated proteins, describe the Northern blot probes used, and detail the transcriptomics method, all to ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in our experimental procedures and results.</p>

<p>A diagram showing the RNA tethering assays with labels corresponding to all blots/gels should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We will provide a diagram showing the RNA tethering assays with labels corresponding to all blots/gels in our revised manuscript. This will help readers better understand our experimental design and results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The statement, &quot;This suggests that the disruption of the decapping process in DCP1a/b-knockout cells results in the accumulation of unprocessed mRNA intermediates&quot; regarding the results of the RNA-seq assay is not supported by the evidence as RNA-seq does not measure RNA decay intermediates or RNA decay rates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s comment. We agree with that RNA-seq experiments indeed do not directly measure RNA decay intermediates or RNA decay rates. Our statement could have caused confusion, and we have therefore removed this sentence from the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor corrections to the text and figures:</p>
<p>Figure S6A is uninterpretable as presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable feedback. We have taken note and made improvements. We have simplified Figure S6A to enhance its interpretability, hoping that the current version will make it easier for the readers to understand.</p>
