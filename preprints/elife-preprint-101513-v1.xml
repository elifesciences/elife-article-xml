<title>Abstract</title><p>The thalamocortical pathway exhibits neuroplasticity not only during the critical period but also in adulthood. Here, we aimed to investigate the modulation of age-dependent thalamocortical plasticity by cholecystokinin (CCK). Our findings revealed the expression of CCK in thalamocortical neurons, and high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the thalamocortical pathway elicited the release of CCK in auditory cortex (ACx), as evidenced by CCK sensor. HFS of the medial geniculate body (MGB) induced thalamocortical long-term potentiation (LTP) in wildtype young adult mice. However, knockdown of Cck expression in MGB neurons or blockade of the CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) in ACx effectively abolished HFS-induced LTP. Notably, this LTP could not be elicited in both juvenile mice (week 3) and mice over 18 months old, due to the absence of CCKBR in juvenile mice and the inability of CCK to be released in aged mice. Remarkably, the administration of exogenous CCK into the auditory cortex of the aged mice restored this LTP, accompanied by a significant improvement in frequency discrimination. These findings suggest the potential of CCK as a therapeutic intervention for addressing neurodegenerative deficits associated with thalamocortical neuroplasticity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the thalamocortical pathway plays a crucial role in the establishment and refinement of the topographical map in sensory cortices during development. In the somatosensory system, thalamocortical LTP can be induced by pairing the pre- and postsynaptic activation within the first postnatal week <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Disruption of NMDA receptor function has been shown to impede the formation of the topographical map of somatosensory cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Exposure of neonatal mice to a tone presentation during early postnatal days significantly altered the tonotopic map in the auditory cortex (ACx) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Towards the end of the critical period for topographical map formation in each sensory modality, neonatal LTP in the thalamocortical pathway vanished due to the developmental switch of NMDA receptor subunits, resulting in reduced susceptibility of sensory cortices to passive stimuli-induced modulations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, emerging evidence suggests that thalamocortical plasticity remains important for normal adult learning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Sensory deprivation or sensory experience can reactivate the plasticity of thalamocortical input in adulthood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In the adult auditory cortex, cortical map plasticity can be induced by pairing sound stimuli with activation of cholinergic inputs originating from the nucleus basalis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) applied to the dorsal lateral geniculate body (LGN) or medial geniculate body (MGB) in vivo can induce LTP in the sensory cortex of rats older than eight weeks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. This HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP has been demonstrated to account for perceptual learning in the post-critical period <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of thalamocortical plasticity in the mature brain remain elusive.</p>
<p>Previous studies have highlighted the crucial role of CCK, acting through its CCK-B receptor, in cortical plasticity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The presence of CCK facilitates the potentiation of cortical synaptic strength following presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Moreover, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) has been shown to induce cortical LTP in a manner that is dependent on CCK <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. HFS of entorhino-neocortical pathway triggers CCK release from its terminals in the ACx, subsequently leading to cortico-cortical LTP and the formation of sound-sound associative memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, as well as visuoauditory associative memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Pharmacological blockade of CCKBR inhibits HFS-induced neocortical LTP and disrupts the formation of associative memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we hypothesize that CCK, expressed in the MGB, plays an essential role in the formation of thalamocortical LTP in adult brain. We propose that the expression levels of CCK and its CCK-B receptor correlate with the emergence of thalamocortical LTP at distinct stages of postnatal development. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the existence of the HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP while specifically down-regulating Cck expression in MGB neurons or blocking CCKBR via its antagonist in the ACx. Furthermore, we utilized optogenetics to selectively activate the CCK-positive thalamocortical neurons for LTP induction. To assess CCK release from thalamocortical projections triggered by HFS, we employed a specialized CCK sensor. Additionally, we utilized RNAscope in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry techniques to explore the relationship between thalamocortical LTP and the ontogeny of CCK and CCKBR expression at different life stages. In parallel, CCK release in aged mice was examined using the CCK sensor. Finally, we investigated whether exogenous application of CCK could rescue the thalamocortical LTP deficit in old animals and whether the restored thalamocortical neuroplasticity could improve sound discrimination in a behavioral experiment.</p>

<title>HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP enhanced neuronal responses to a natural stimulus in the ACx</title>
<p>In the present study, we initially applied HFS to the MGB in an <italic>in-vivo</italic> preparation to induce thalamocortical LTP and investigated its impact on cortical neuronal responses to the natural stimulus (sound) in adult mice. We placed stimulation electrodes in the MGB and recording electrodes in the ACx of 8-weeks old mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Both electrodes effectively captured neuronal responses to noise-bursts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in response to the electrical stimulation (ES) in the MGB was measured. Consistent with previous findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, HFS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) successfully induced thalamocortical LTP in the young adult mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The slope of fEPSPs, measured 1 h after the HFS, was potentiated by 30.0 ± 4.8% compared to the baseline before the HFS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, one-way RM ANOVA, F[1,12] = 39.4; pairwise comparison, before vs. after HFS, 100.7 ± 0.4% vs. 130.7 ± 4.8%, p &lt; 0.001, n = 13 different recording and stimulation site, from N = 10 mice).</p>

<p>We subsequently examined whether the neuronal responses to the natural auditory stimulus in the ACx were also potentiated after the HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). As demonstrated in the example, the firing rate of the neuronal responses to the noise-burst stimulus in the ACx increased following HFS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The fEPSPs of the neuronal responses to the noise burst stimulus also exhibited significant potentiation after HFS in the MGB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, one-way RM ANOVA, F[1,16] = 67.0; pairwise comparison, before vs. after HFS, 98.9 ± 1.7% vs. 135.4 ± 2.9%, p &lt; 0.001, n = 17, from 6 mice), indicating that recorded thalamocortical LTP facilitated neuronal responses in ACx to the natural stimulus. Notably, these experiments were conducted in the brains of adult mice, thereby confirming the presence of thalamocortical plasticity that can be induced by HFS in the auditory system of mice beyond the critical period.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP is CCK-dependent</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that both exogenous and endogenous CCK can induce synaptic plasticity in different neural pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. HFS of entorhino-neocortical terminals triggers the release of CCK, thereby facilitating the formation of cortical LTP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, CCK expression is abundant in MGB neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, and high densities of CCK receptors are specifically located in layer IV of the auditory cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, which is the main target of thalamocortical afferents. Based on these findings, we formulated the hypothesis that the HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP is also CCK-dependent.</p>
<p>To obtain direct evidence that HFS of the thalamocortical CCK projections induces homosynaptic LTP, we employed optogenetic manipulation of specific projection neurons. Cre-dependent AAV9-EFIa-DIO-ChETA-EYFP was injected into MGB of CCK-Cre mice. The EYFP labeling marked CCK-positive neurons in MGB, and the thalamocortical projection fibers mainly targeted layer IV of the ACx, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> upper panel. Immunochemistry staining further revealed colocalization of projection terminals from MGB CCK neurons with the majority of CCKBRs in ACx (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> lower panel). During optogenetic electrophysiology experiment, a glass recording electrode was inserted into layer IV of the ACx, and an optic fiber was positioned near the recording electrode for laser activation of the thalamocortical terminals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> upper left, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). Following a stable 16-min recording baseline of laser-evoked thalamocortical fEPSPs, high-frequency laser stimulation (HFLS) was delivered to the ACx. The fEPSPs evoked by HFLS demonstrated reliable synchronization of thalamocortical afferent activation with the 80 Hz laser stimulation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). Significantly, robust LTP was observed after HFLS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, one-way RM ANOVA, F[1,24] = 62.8; pairwise comparison, before vs. after HFLS-ACx, 100.2 ± 0.7% vs. 131.0 ± 3.8%, p &lt; 0.001, n = 25 different recording and stimulation site, from 5 mice). Additionally, we performed HFLS of the MGB cell body instead of stimulating thalamocortical terminals. The fEPSPs elicited by the laser in MGB exhibited significant potentiation after HFLS (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>, one-way RM ANOVA, F[1,17] = 31.8; pairwise comparison, before vs. after HFLS-MGB, 99.6 ± 1.4% vs. 130.0 ± 4.7%, p &lt; 0.001, n = 18, from 6 mice). These findings support the notion that HF activation of thalamocortical CCK projections enables thalamocortical LTP, potentially through the induction of homosynaptic CCK release.</p>

<p>To further substantiate the dependence of HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP on CCK, we specifically knocked down the Cck expression in the MGB by injecting AAV constructs carrying a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Cck (anti-Cck) or a nonsense sequence (anti-Scramble, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Successful down-regulation of Cck mRNA levels by anti-Cck shRNAs was confirmed in vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. No discernible differences were observed in the ACx responses to MGB stimulation between the animals that received the anti-CCK virus injection and those that were injected with the anti-scramble virus (as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> upper middle). Notably, the anti-Cck group exhibited no induction of thalamocortical LTP following HFS, while the anti-Scramble control group showed significant LTP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, two-way RM ANOVA, F[1,31] = 50.3, p&lt;0.001, pairwise comparison: anti-Cck, before vs. after HFS, 99.7 ± 0.5% vs. 99.2 ± 2.9%, p = 0.859, n=16 from 10 mice; anti-Scramble, before vs. after HFS, 100.8 ± 0.5% vs. 129.4 ± 2.8%, p &lt; 0.001, n=17 from 8 mice; The difference between anti-Scramble and anti-Cck after HFS is 30.2 ± 4.0%, p &lt; 0.001). In the subsequent experiment, we administered L-365,260 (L365, 250 nM, 0.5 μL), a CCKBR antagonist, into the ACx of mice before HFS in the MGB. As a control, we injected artificial cerebral-spinal fluid (ACSF) instead of CCKBR antagonist. HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP was completely blocked in the L365 application group, whereas no such effect was observed in the ACSF application group (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>, two-way RM ANOVA, F[1,32] = 29.3, p &lt; 0.001, pairwise comparison: L365 group, before vs. after HFS, 99.5 ± 0.6% vs. 100.4 ± 3.2%, p = 0.779, n=22 from 5 mice; ACSF group, before vs. after HFS, 100.3 ± 0.8% vs. 128.9 ± 4.3%, p &lt; 0.001, n=12 from 5 mice; The difference between ACSF group and L365 group after HFS is 28.5 ± 5.4%, p &lt; 0.001). Taken together, these findings provide robust evidence supporting that HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP is CCK dependent.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that high-frequency activation of entorhinal neurons or entorhino-neocortical CCK projections can elicit CCK release from their terminals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, we investigated whether HFS of MGB or thalamocortical projections could also induce CCK release in the ACx. To directly monitor CCK dynamics, we utilized the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation-based CCK sensor in ACx <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The released CCK binds to the GPCR CCKBR, resulting in increased fluorescence intensity, which can be measured using fiber photometry. In our experimental approach, we injected the AAV9-syn-CCK sensor virus into ACx, and AAV9-Syn-FLEX-ChrimsonR-tdTomato/AAV9-Syn-ChrimsonR-tdTomato into the MGB of CCK-Cre/CCK-KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> upper panel). Effective gene expression was achieved six weeks after the injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> lower panel). We applied a high-frequency laser stimulation (HFLS, 620 nm) to the ACx to activate the thalamocortical terminals. Following HFLS, fluorescence intensity significantly increased in CCK-Cre mice but not in CCK-KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref>, green and orange traces, Averaged ΔF/F0%: two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparisons adjustment, significant interaction, F [1, 28] = 13.25, p = 0.001; before vs. after HFLS in CCK-Cre: −0.002 ± 0.018 vs. 0.163 ± 0.037, p &lt; 0.001, n = 16 from 8 mice; before vs. after HFLS in CCK-KO: 0.015 ± 0. 019 vs. -0.004 ± 0.039, ns, p = 0.616, n = 14 from 7 mice; After HFLS in CCK-Cre vs. CCK-KO: 0.163 ± 0.037 vs. -0.004 ± 0.039, p = 0.004). These findings suggest that CCK was released from thalamocortical terminals in response to high-frequency activation. Additionally, we directly applied HFLS to the MGB. The fluorescence intensity exhibited a substantial increase in CCK-Cre mice, whereas no significant change was observed in CCK-KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref>, red and blue traces, averaged ΔF/F0%: two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparisons adjustment, significant interaction, F [1, 39] = 12.70, p = 0.001; before vs. after HFLS in CCK-Cre: -0.003 ± 0.017 vs. 0.396 ± 0.095, p &lt; 0.001, n = 21, N = 11; before vs. after HFLS in CCK-KO: 0.000 ± 0.018 vs. -0.031 ± 0.098, ns, p = 0.723, n = 20, N = 10; After HFLS in CCK-Cre vs. CCK-KO: 0.396 ± 0.095 vs. -0.031 ± 0.098, p = 0.003).</p>
<p>In the previous experiment, the use of two different viruses in the CCK-Cre and CCK-KO mice compromises the suitability of this control. Additionally, CCK is widely distributed in the brain, raising the possibility of CCK being released from other projections via indirect mechanisms, considering the polysynaptic responses that can be elicited in ACx by MGB stimulation. Furthermore, laser stimulation of the thalamocortical projection may induce antidromic activation in MGB. To address these concerns, we specifically down-regulated Cck expression in MGB neurons and subsequently assessed CCK release after HFS of MGB. We injected the CCK sensor virus and anti-Cck/anti-Scramble shRNAs virus separately into ACx and MGB of C57 mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref> upper). After viral expression was achieved (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref> lower panel), we monitored the fluorescence intensity in the ACx before and after HFS at the MGB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref> upper panel). The fluorescence intensity significantly increased in anti-Scramble group, while no significant change was observed in anti-Cck group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2I</xref> lower, Averaged ΔF/F0%: two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparisons adjustment, significant interaction F [1,41] = 19.70, p &lt; 0.001; before vs. after HFS in anti-Scramble: -0.005 ± 0. 013 vs 0.387 ± 0.064, p &lt; 0.001, n=21 from 11 mice; before vs. after HFS in anti-Cck: -0.007 ± 0. 013 vs -0.007 ± 0.063, p = 0.999, n=22 from 11 mice; After HFS in anti-Scramble vs. anti-Cck: 0.387 ±0.064 vs -0.007 ± 0.063, p &lt; 0.001). These results indicate that HFS of MGB triggers CCK release from direct thalamocortical terminals at the ACx. Thus, HFS of MGB facilitates thalamocortical synaptic plasticity through homosynaptic CCK release.</p>

The definition of “CCK mRNA-expressing neurons” can be found in the Methods section.). In the CCK-KO young adult control group (8W), no neurons in the MGB exhibited CCK mRNA expression.

<p>To investigate the correlation between thalamocortical LTP induction and CCK expression, we conducted in-vivo electrophysiology experiments. We selected the P20, 8W, and 18M age groups for our study, excluding P14 mice due to their small body size. As expected, we observed a significant potentiation following HFS of MGB in the 8th week group (same as <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> middle panel, an increase of 30.0 ± 4.8%, p&lt;0.001). Similarly, HFS failed to induce LTP in the aged mice at 18M (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> lower panel, an increase of 2.9 ± 3.2%, P = 0.380). However, contrary to the RNAscope results, we found that thalamocortical LTP was absent in neonatal mice at P20 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> upper panel, increased by 2.2 ± 3.5%, P = 0.542; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, two-way RM ANOVA, F[2,42] = 18.7, p &lt; 0.001, pairwise comparison: before vs. after HFS in P20 mice, 100.0 ± 0.5% vs. 102.2 ± 3.6%, p = 0.542, n = 15 from 10 mice; before vs. after HFS in 8W mice, 100.7 ± 0.4% vs. 130.7 ± 4.8%, p &lt; 0.001, n = 13 from 10 mice; before vs. after HFS in 18M mice, 100.5 ± 0.4% vs. 103.3 ± 3.3%, p = 0.380, n=18 from 8 mice). Although the induction level of LTP decreased with CCK mRNA expression in mature mice (8W and 18M; The difference between 8W group and 18M group after HFS is 27.4 ± 5.1%, p &lt; 0.001), P20 mice, which exhibited the highest CCK mRNA expression, showed no LTP (difference between 8W group and P20 group after HFS is 28.5 ± 5.3%, p &lt; 0.001). This observation led us to speculate that the differential thalamocortical plasticity mechanism between neonatal and adult mice may be attributed to the expression of CCKBR. Therefore, we proceeded to examine the expression level of CCKBR in the ACx during development. As predicted, immunochemistry staining revealed minimal CCKBR signals in P20 mice, while extensive signals were detected in the 8W and 18M groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). These results indicate the maturation process of the thalamocortical projection during development. The level of HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP correlated with CCK expression in adult mice but not in the neonatal brain, likely due to the limited expression of CCKBR during the critical period.</p>
<p>However, a concern arises in our theory. Despite the low expression of CCK mRNA in aged mice, it is still present. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> right panel). In contrast, thalamocortical LTP was barely inducible in aged mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> lower panel), suggesting a lack of CCK release. It is widely recognized that mRNA level does not directly correlate with peptide level. Multiple steps, such as translation, post-translational modifications, packaging, transportation, and proteolytic processing, involving various enzymes, exist between mRNA expression and neuropeptide release. Apart from the low expression of CCK mRNA, any missing link in this chain could lead to a deficit in CCK release. To investigate whether CCK can be released from aged mice, we employed the CCK sensor to directly detect changes in CCK levels during HFS of the MGB in 18M mice. After the expression of the CCK sensor in aged mice, we monitored fluorescence intensity in the ACx. The signal did not increase following HFS of MGB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, blue). For comparison, we also attached the fluorescence intensity trace of the anti-Scramble group (from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, gray) within this Figure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>, Averaged ΔF/F0%: two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparisons adjustment, significant interaction F [1,31] = 8.61, p = 0.006; before vs. after HFS in aged mice: 0.014 ± 0. 022 vs 0.052 ±0.098, p = 0.699, n=12 from 6 mice; After HFS in aged mice vs. anti-Scramble control: 0.052 ±0.098 vs 0.387 ± 0.074, p = 0.010). This result confirms that HFS of MGB fails to trigger CCK release in the aged brain, despite the existence of CCK mRNA. The shortage of CCK could be a contributing factor to the impairment of thalamocortical plasticity in aged mice.</p>

<title>Exogenous CCK application rescues thalamocortical LTP in aged mice and enhances frequency discrimination</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that age-related impairment of synaptic plasticity, including LTP, leads to hippocampal dysfunction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and synaptic plasticity diminishes with age in the thalamocortical pathway of rats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Our findings revealed that thalamocortical LTP could not be induced in aged mice due to the absence of CCK, while CCKBR expression remained intact.</p>
<p>Considering that the loss of LTP could be attributed to decreased CCK release in the thalamocortical pathway, the exogenous infusion of CCK should rescue this age-related impairment. In the electrophysiology experiment, we infused CCK (CCK-4, 0.5 µL, 10 µM, Sigma) or ACSF into the ACx of aged mice (18M), followed by HFS at the MGB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). The slopes of evoked fEPSPs significantly potentiated after the HFS in the CCK group, but not in the ACSF group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, two-way RM ANOVA, F[1,22] = 17.9, p &lt; 0.001, pairwise comparison: CCK group, before vs. after, 100.4 ± 0.6% vs. 148.6 ± 10.4%, p &lt; 0.001, n = 13 from 6 mice; ACSF group, before vs. after, 98.8 ± 0.7% vs. 103.3 ± 4.9%, p = 0.404, n=12 from 7 mice; The difference between CCK group and ACSF group after the intervention is 45.3 ± 15.1%, p = 0.006). Exogenous application of CCK restored the lost thalamocortical LTP in the aged mice. Based on previous studies, CCK has been shown to facilitate synaptic plasticity through presynaptic and postsynaptic coactivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, we further examined whether CCK alone, without MGB stimulation, could induce thalamocortical LTP. We infused CCK-4 into the ACx of adult mice after baseline fEPSP recording. Stimulation was paused for 15 min to allow for CCK-4 degradation, after which recording was resumed. The thalamocortical LTP was not induced by the CCK injection alone (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>, one-way RM ANOVA, F[1,19] = 0.003; pairwise comparison, before vs. after CCK alone, 99.1 ± 0.4% vs. 99.2 ± 1.4%, p = 0.956, n = 20 from 5 mice). Evidently, the activation of the thalamocortical pathway is crucial for inducing thalamocortical LTP, and CCK serves as a key modulator in this process.</p>

<p>CCK administration effectively restored thalamocortical LTP in aged brains, indicating its potential therapeutic application in developmental impairments or age-related diseases. Considering that direct stimulation of the MGB is not suitable for clinical treatment, we explored whether the combination of CCK administration with a natural auditory stimulus could induce thalamocortical plasticity. Initially, we injected the AAV9-Syn-ChrimsonR-tdT virus into the MGB of C57 mice, which labeled the projection from MGB in the ACx (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In the electrophysiology experiment, we infused CCK-4 or ACSF into the ACx and delivered auditory stimulation for 200 trials (0.5 Hz) to the animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The fEPSPs in response to laser stimulation in the ACx were recorded before and after the intervention. The thalamocortical LTP was induced in the CCK group, while no significant changes were observed in the ACSF group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, two-way RM ANOVA, F[1,27] = 30.7, p &lt; 0.001, pairwise comparison: CCK group, before vs. after, 99.9 ± 0.9% vs. 146.1 ± 7.0%, p &lt; 0.001, n = 10 from 10 mice; ACSF group, before vs. after, 100.7 ± 0.7% vs. 100.0 ± 5.1%, p = 0.899, n=19 from 10 mice; The difference between CCK group and ACSF group after the intervention is 46.1 ± 8.6%, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, we investigated whether auditory stimulation was necessary for the induction of thalamocortical LTP. <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref> demonstrated that CCK-4 alone, without acoustic stimulation, failed to potentiate the neural response to laser in the ACx (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>, one-way RM ANOVA, F[1,21] = 0.546; pairwise comparison, before vs. after CCK alone, 100.3 ± 0.4% vs. 99.0 ± 1.9%, p = 0.468, n = 22 from 4 mice). Collectively, these findings suggest a promising therapeutic approach for treating diseases associated with impairments in thalamocortical connectivity.</p>
<p>Auditory thalamocortical plasticity plays a decisive role in inducing precise modifications of cortical neurons, which underlie the frequency-specific plasticity in the auditory cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Chen et al. demonstrated that optogenetic silencing of the auditory thalamocortical projection impaired auditory decision-making in a frequency-discrimination task <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In our subsequent experiment, we employed a prepulse inhibition (PPI) acoustic startle test to assess the mice’s ability to discriminate frequencies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The level of prepulse inhibition reflects the animals’ perception of frequency differences between the background tone and the prepulse tone. A higher PPI indicates a better ability to discriminate between the two frequencies, as exemplified in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>. It is known that sensory experiences, such as sound exposure, can influence thalamocortical plasticity in adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. After habituation, young adult mice were exposed to tone stimulations (9.8 or 16.4 kHz, which would serve as the background tone in PPI) in a soundproof chamber immediately following bilateral injection of either CCK or ACSF into the ACx through implanted cannulas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The frequency-discrimination ability was evaluated by comparing the PPIs between the two groups after 24 hours of exposure. As expected, in both ACSF control groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, 9.8 kHz; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, 16.4 kHz, gray lines), mice exhibited a gradual increase in PPI as the frequency difference between the background tone and the prepulse tone increased. The differences between the CCK experimental group and the ACSF control group were primarily observed in discriminating frequencies near the exposed frequency, with a &gt; 18.8% difference for both the 9.8 and 16.4 kHz groups when detecting the prepulse tone at -2% from the exposed frequency (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, 9.8 kHz, CCK group, n = 7, ACSF group, n = 7, two-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05, 32.50 ± 3.86% vs 13.67 ± 2.77%, post-hoc, Tukey test, CCK vs. ACSF, **, p&lt;0.001; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, 16.4kHz, CCK group, n=7, ACSF group, n=7, two-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05, 39.15 ± 3.01% vs 15.43 ± 4.97%, post-hoc, Tukey test, CCK vs. ACSF, **, p &lt; 0.001). The efficacy of the thalamocortical system reaches a plateau in young adult animals, potentially explaining why the behavior improvement in the CCK-treated group, compared to the control group, was only significant in discriminating the -2% difference. This phenomenon underscores the ability of the auditory thalamocortical system to implement frequency-specific plasticity in cortical function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In fact, this result can also be supported by a pilot study we conducted on rats (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2C-E</xref>). We infused CCK into the ACx and delivered a tone stimulus for 200 trials to anesthetized rats. We measured the tuning curves of auditory cortical neurons before and after the intervention. The frequency of the selected exposed tone is a non-characteristic frequency (CF) that elicited a moderate response. Although CCK did not induce a shift in the CF of the tuning curve (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>), the response threshold to exposed tone was significantly lowered. In contrast, the control group with ACSF infusion did not exhibit a lowered response threshold to the exposed tone (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref> for an example; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E</xref> for group data, 8.66 ± 1.91 dB at exposed frequency, p &lt; 0.001; 6.66 ± 2.32 dB P &lt; 0.001 and 5.33 ± 1.33 dB, p &lt; 0.05 at frequencies of 0.4 octave lower and 0.4 octave higher than the exposed frequency respectively; CCK, n = 15; ACSF n = 12, two-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001, post hoc: Tukey test, CCK-8S vs. ACSF, *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.001). The application of CCK and sound exposure led to a lowered response threshold near the exposed tone, explaining why the behavior improvement was only significant in discriminating the -2% difference.</p>

After habituation, 15 C57 aged 18M were i.p. injected with CCK-4 solution (1 mg/kg), while 15 littermate controls received saline injections.

<title><bold>Discussion</bold></title>
<p>In the present study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of CCK in age-dependent thalamocortical plasticity and explore potential therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative deficits associated with thalamocortical neuroplasticity. We demonstrated that HFS in the MGB successfully induced thalamocortical LTP in adult mice, and this LTP was shown to be dependent on CCK. The recurrence of thalamocortical LTP after the neonatal thalamocortical plasticity time window was attributed to the increased expression of CCK and its receptor, CCKBR, during development. In aged mice, the loss of thalamocortical LTP was likely due to the down-regulation of CCK expression and impaired CCK release in the thalamocortical pathway. Therefore, administration of CCK into the ACx of aged mice restored thalamocortical LTP. Notably, auditory exposure following CCK application in the ACx potentiated thalamocortical connectivity and enhanced the mice’s frequency discrimination in behavioral experiments.</p>

<p>Thalamocortical plasticity plays a crucial role in the development of sensory cortices. Based on previous studies on the development of topographical maps in sensory cortices <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, it has been proposed that the refinement of thalamocortical projections occurs through the activity-dependent thalamic axon competition for cortical neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The switching of NMDA receptor subunits (NR2B to NR2A) on thalamocortical synapses during early development indicates a critical period for NMDA-dependent LTP at these synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity contributes to the conversion of thalamocortical silent synapses into functional synapses, thereby facilitating neonatal thalamocortical development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Zhang and colleagues observed that exposing neonatal rats to pulsed monotone stimuli from P9 to P28 resulted in an expansion of the cortical area representing the exposed tones in the ACx of rats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.

<p>Consistent with the findings of Heynen and Bear (2001) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, our results demonstrated that thalamocortical LTP could be induced using the standard protocol of HFS, indicating that thalamocortical synapses retain their plasticity beyond the early critical period as defined by Malenka <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.

<title>CCK Dependence of Thalamocortical Neuroplasticity</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated the crucial role of CCK in facilitating cortical plasticity in adult rats and mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.

These findings suggest a potential involvement of CCK in thalamocortical plasticity.

In contrast, down-regulation of the Cck expression in MGB neurons resulted in the abolishment of HFS-induced CCK release and subsequent LTP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). Likewise, administration of a CCKB receptor antagonist blocked thalamocortical LTP in the wild-type mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>), providing additional evidence for the indispensability of CCK in enabling thalamocortical neuroplasticity.</p>

<title>Developmental thalamocortical LTP</title>
<p>In the mouse auditory system, MGB projections enter the subplate area and activate subplate neurons as early as P2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. These neurons in the ACx guide thalamocortical projections to layer IV during the first two postnatal weeks. As thalamocortical connections mature, the subplate neurons eventually die off around the fourth postnatal week<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Our findings indicate that CCK- dependent plasticity in the auditory thalamocortical pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) emerges with a delay of weeks after the initiation of CCK expression in the MGB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). This delay is likely attributed to the developmental timeline of the postsynaptic CCKBR in the ACx, which is also critical for thalamocortical plasticity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Our results align with previous research by Hogsden and Dringenberg (2009), showing that rats at approximately 6 weeks of age exhibited the highest level of HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP, which declined with age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.

<title>CCK administration rescued thalamocortical LTP in aged mice and improved frequency discrimination ability</title>
<p>Given that aged mice exhibited a deficiency in endogenous CCK but possessed intact CCKBR, we successfully restored the impaired thalamocortical LTP by applying exogenous CCK into the ACx of aged mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The combined application of CCK and acoustic stimulation enhanced thalamocortical connectivity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting a potential therapeutic application.</p>
<p>Auditory cortical plasticity is known to correlate with improved perceptual acuity and learning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, while thalamocortical plasticity is a determinant in the refinement of cortical neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Inhibition of thalamocortical inputs has been shown to impair frequency- discrimination ability in animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Our behavioral experiments demonstrated that a combination of passive tone stimulation and CCK infusion into the bilateral auditory cortices of young adult mice significantly increased their frequency-discrimination ability towards the exposed frequency (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>), providing further evidence for the rewiring and enhancement of adult thalamocortical connectivity through sensory experiences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.

More probably, endogenous CCK in young adult animals is sufficient to regulate thalamocortical plasticity, enabling them to adapt to environmental changes. In contrast, aged mice, lacking sufficient endogenous CCK, exhibited increased sensitivity to CCK administration, as indicated by a slightly more intense fluorescence signal in CCKKO mice than CCKCre mice after CCK injection (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2G</xref>, CCKKO is 19.3 ± 16.4% greater, although statistically non-significant).

<title>The potential role of CCK from the thalamocortical pathway in modulating corticocortical plasticity</title>
<p>Exogenous administration of CCK along with tone exposure has been shown to enhance thalamocortical connectivity and improve frequency-discrimination ability. However, it is important to note that the changes observed in ACx may not exclusively result from the alterations at thalamocortical synapses. Heterosynaptic release of CCK from entorhino- neocortical projections has been implicated in modulating corticocortical plasticity and associative memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Similarly, thalamocortical projection may also influence intracortical plasticity.</p>
<p>The released CCK activates postsynaptic CCKBR, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration through the activation of phospholipase C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. This rise in calcium levels could subsequently facilitate the recruitment of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic neuron <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. In the presence of CCK, several instances of pre- and postsynaptic co-activation can readily induce synaptic plasticity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The cortical neural response to MGB stimulation or acoustic stimulation is actually a mix of monosynaptic and polysynaptic excitation and inhibition due to the complexity of the cortical network. Hence, in addition to thalamocortical homosynaptic plasticity, the connectivity of specific intracortical microcircuitry may be modulated via CCK released from thalamocortical projection in a heterosynaptic manner during the activation. Considering the indirect activation, we specifically downregulated the expression of Cck to confirm that the released CCK was from thalamocortical projection. However, in the current study, we only recorded the fEPSPs in layer IV of ACx, and further investigations are needed to explore this heterosynaptic modulation.</p>
<p>Thalamocortical plasticity in the adult brain has been found to be induced by different methods, reversing the critical periods of the sensory cortices <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Zhou and colleagues reported that exposing juvenile or adult rats to a moderate level of noise exposure could reinstate the high susceptibility of the tonotopic map in the ACx <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In a recent study, Blundon and colleagues demonstrated that thalamocortical plasticity could be restored by restricting thalamic adenosine signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In parallel, our current study proposes another potential approach to trigger thalamocortical plasticity in the adult brain through CCK administration. The induction of CCK-mediated plasticity holds promise as a possible treatment strategy to enhance the function of late cochlear implants in prelingually deaf children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> and could serve as a foundation for the development of future non-invasive therapies for age-related hearing loss. Thalamocortical plasticity is now known to participate not only in the refinement of the sensory cortices but also in learning processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, our findings may have broader implications across different sensory modalities, including but not limited to perception, learning, and memory formation.</p>

<title>Surgery for acute electrophysiological experiments</title>
<p>Mice or rats were anesthetized with urethane sodium (1.8g /kg IP; Sigma, U.S.). Anesthesia was maintained throughout surgery. Atropine sulfate (0.05 mg/kg SC; Sigma, U.S.) was administered 15 min before the induction of anesthesia to inhibit tracheal secretion. The animal was mounted in a stereotaxic frame (Narishige, Japan) and a midline incision was made in the scalp after a liberal application of a local anesthetic (Xylocaine, 2%). A craniotomy was performed (−2 mm to −4 mm posterior and −1.5 mm to −3 mm ventral to sagittal sutur) to access the auditory cortex, and a hole was drilled in the skull according to the coordinates of the ventral division of the MGB (MGv, AP: -3.2 mm, ML: 2.1 mm, DV: 3.0 mm). The dura mater was minimally opened followed by the silicon oil application to the surface of the brain to prevent drying. The animal’s body temperature was maintained at 37-38°C with a feedback-controlled heating pad (RWD, China). After the recording, animals were sacrificed, and the brains were harvested for histological confirmation or further processing.</p>

<title>Auditory, electrical and laser stimuli</title>
<p>Auditory stimuli, including pure tones and noise bursts, were generated by Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT, U.S.) workstation and delivered through an electrostatic speaker (ED1, TDT). The speaker was placed at 20 cm away from the awake animals or directly to the ear contralateral to the implanted electrodes via a hollow ear bar for the anesthetized animals. The sound pressure level of the speaker was calibrated with a condenser microphone (B&amp;K, Denmark).</p>
<p>The electrical stimulation was generated by an ISO-Flex isolator (A.M.P.I., Israel), which was controlled by a multifunction processor (RX6, TDT). The electrical current pulses for the baseline test were 0.5 ms, 10-100 µA, and presented every 10 s. The high-frequency stimulation (HFS) contained four trains of 10 bursts at 5 Hz with an interval of 10 s between two trains, and each burst consisted of 5 pulses at 100 Hz.</p>
<p>The laser stimulation was produced by a laser generator (Wavelength, 473 nm, 620 nm, CNI laser, China) controlled by RX6 and delivered to the brain by an optic fiber (Thorlabs, U.S.) which was connected to the generator. The output power of the fiber was measured and calibrated by an optical power meter (Item# PM120A, Thorlabs, U.S.) before the insertion into the brain. The laser pulse width was 3 ms, and the interval for baseline testing was 10 s. For the high-frequency laser stimulation (HFLS), the laser stimulation was comprised of four trains of 10 bursts at 5 Hz with an interval of 10 s between the trains, and each burst consisted of five pulses at 80 Hz.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> acute electrophysiological recording</title>
<p>In HFS-induced thalamocortical LTP experiments, two customized microelectrode arrays with four tungsten electrodes each, impedance: 0.5-1.0 MΩ (recording), and 200-500 kΩ (stimulating) (FHC, U.S.), were used for the auditory cortical neuronal activity recording and MGB electrical stimulation, respectively. The electrode arrays were advanced to the brain by two micro- manipulators separately. The recording electrodes were lowered into layer IV of ACx, while the stimulation electrodes were lowered into MGB. The final stimulating and recording positions were determined by maximizing the cortical field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitude triggered by the electrical stimulation in the MGB.</p>
<p>The fEPSPs, which were elicited by 0.5 ms electrical current pulses, were amplified (× 1000) and filtered (1 Hz -5 kHz), recorded at a 25 kHz sampling rate, and stored in a PC by OpenEx software (TDT). Before the recording, an input-output function was measured. A stimulation current, which elicited a fEPSP amplitude 40% of maximum, was chosen for the baseline and after HFS recording. The fEPSPs were collected for 16 min before and 1 h after HFS, respectively. For HFS, each burst includes five 0.5-ms pulses at 100 Hz, and each block consists of 10 bursts at 5 Hz, for a total of 4 blocks with an inter-block interval of 10 s. The current of the pulses that induced 75% of the maximal response was selected from the input- output relationship. The slopes (or amplitude) of the evoked fEPSPs were calculated and normalized by customized MATLAB script, and the group data was plotted as mean ± SEM. In the experiment shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, 50 noise bursts (Intensity, 70 dB; Duration, 100 ms; Inter- stimulus-interval,10 s) were presented before and after LTP induction session, and multiunit responses to noise bursts of the ACx were recorded. A threshold of 3 standard deviations (SDs) above baseline was set to identify spikes online.</p>

<title>Optogenetic experiments</title>
<p>In the optogenetic experiments, glass pipette electrodes were placed targeting layer IV (350- 500μm) of the ACx of mice 4-6 weeks after virus injection. The optic fiber was then inserted into either the ACx next to the electrodes, or MGB. The fEPSPs evoked by laser stimulation were recorded and analyzed in this experiment. The procedure for the HF laser-induced LTP was similar as previously described in the HFS-induced LTP experiment, except the HF burst containing laser pulses in 80 Hz rather than 100 Hz.</p>

<p>A glass pipette was placed to ACx adjacent to the recording site for drug application. The tips of glass pipettes were covered by 0.1 µL silicone oil to avoid leaking.</p>
<p>In the antagonist infusion experiments, L-365,260 (250 nM in 5% DMSO, 0.5 μL, tocris) was injected by micro-injector, before the HFS, within 5 min. ACSF (5% DMSO) was injected as a control. In the CCK infusion experiments, CCK-4 (10 μM, 0.5 μL, Sigma) was injected by micro-injector within 5 min. ACSF was injected as a control.

<title>Auditory tuning curve test on rats</title>
<p>In the tuning curve test, tones spanning 6 octaves (0.75-48 kHz, 0.2-0.3 octave spacing) and 60 dB (10-70 dB, 5-10 dB spacing) of 100 ms duration were presented every 500 ms in a pseudo- random sequence before and after the infusion and LFS to measure the receptive field of cortical neurons. For the infusion and LFS protocol, CCK-8S (1 μΜ, 1 μL) or ACSF was infused locally near the recording site, and non-characteristic frequency (non-CF) pure tone stimuli, one octave within the CF, were presented once per 2 s for 200 trails, 5 mins after the infusion. The 30 ms before the onset was considered as the baseline and the 30 ms after the onset of each tone was considered as onset response. The potential tone response bins, of which the firing rates were larger than the averaged firing rate of all the baseline bins plus 3 standard deviations of the firing rates of these baseline bins (mean+3SD), were considered to have tone response. The tuning curve was determined as the lowest intensity, which had responses to the tone, and characteristic frequency (CF) was the middle frequency at that intensity. To quantify the changes in the tuning curve, we used the frequency responding threshold as the indicator of the change. The data were plotted as mean ± SEM. After the recording, animals were sacrificed, and the brains were harvested for histological confirmation or immunostaining.</p>

<title>Fiberphotometry</title>
<p>This GPCR activation-based CCK sensor, GRABCCK, was developed by inserting a circular- permutated green fluorescent protein (cpEGFP) into the intracellular domain of CCKBR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. When the endogenous or exogenous ligand (CCK) binds to the CCKBR, a conformational change in cpEGFP will happen as well as an increase in fluorescence intensity, and the CCK activity could be visualized in vivo. Six-week after CCK-sensor virus injection, a craniotomy was performed to access the auditory cortex (-2 mm to -4 mm posterior and -1.5 mm to -3 mm ventral to sagittal suture), and the dura mater was opened. An optic fiber (400 µm diameter, 0.22 NA, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) was lowered into the auditory cortex (200-300 µm from the brain surface) to record the signal of the CCK sensor. Before signal recording, the optic fiber was lowered to the brain surface at different sites to confirm the best site for the recording, where we could capture the strongest fluorescence signal of CCK sensor. This optic fiber cannula was attached to a single fluorescent MiniCube (Doric Lenses, Quebec, QC, Canada) with built-in dichroic mirrors and LED light sources through a fiber patch cord. The excitation light at 470 and 405 nm were released by two fiber-coupled LEDs (M470F3 and M405FP1, Thorlabs) and were sinusoidally modulated at 210 and 330 Hz, respectively. The 473 nm channel is the GRAB<sub>CCK</sub> channel and the 405nm channel is employed as the isosbestic control channel. An LED driver (LEDD1B, Thorlabs) coupled to the RZ5D processor (TDT, Alachua, FL) managed the excitation light’s intensity through the software Synapse. The emission fluorescence was captured and transmitted by a bandpass filter in the MiniCube. To avoid photobleaching, the excitation light intensity at the tip of the patch cord’s tip was adjusted to less than 30 µW. The fluorescent signal was then detected, amplified, and transformed into an analog signal by the photoreceiver (Doric Lenses). The analog signal was then digitalized by the RZ5D processor and subjected to a 1 kHz low-pass analysis using Synapse software.</p>
<p>The fluorescent signal was recorded 25s before and 60s after the HFLS (5∼10 mW, 635 nm) or HFS application. For the experiments in <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2G</xref>, we measured the CCK sensor activities before and after the CCK-4 i.p. application in different type of mice. CCK-4 (1 mg/kg, in 2% DMSO, 8% ethylene glycol, 1% Tween-80, 89% saline) or Saline (0.15 ∼ 0.20 mL, in 2% DMSO, 8% ethylene glycol, 1% Tween-80) was i.p. injected. The fluorescent signal was recorded 120s before and 200s after the drug administration.</p>
<sec id="s4j1">
<title>Fiber Photometry Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of the signal was done by the custom-written MATLAB (Mathworks) codes. We first extracted the signal of the 473nm and 405nm channels corresponding to the defined periods before and after each stimulus or drug injection. A fitted 405 nm signal was created by regressing the 405nm channel onto a linear fit of its respective 473 channel (MATLAB <italic>polyfit</italic> function). The fluorescence change (ΔF/F) was then calculated with the formula (473 nm signal − fitted 405 nm signal)/ fitted 405 nm signal.</p>

<p>Mice were anesthetized by an overdose of pentobarbital sodium and transcardially perfused with 30 mL cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 30 mL 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brain tissue was removed and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA in PBS at 4°C, and treated with 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS at 4°C for 2 days. Coronal sections of 50 μm thickness were cut on a cryostat (Epredia CryoStar HM525 NX Cryostat) using OCT and preserved with antifreeze buffer (20% (v/v) glycerol and 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol diluted in PBS) at −20°C.</p>
<p>Brain sections were washed 3 times with PBS before incubated in blocking buffer containing 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (or 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin if the host of primary antibody is goat) with 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 2h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 36h at 4°C. The primary antibodies used were: mouse anti-PSD95 (Invitrogen, #MA1-045, 1:500), goat anti-CCKBR (Invitrogen, #PA5-18384, 1:1000). After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated with fluorescently- conjugated secondary antibodies: donkey anti-mouse IgG(H+L) Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, #A-11058, 1:500), donkey anti-goat IgG(H+L) Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen, #A-21447, 1:500) in PBST at room temperature for 2.5h. Next, sections were incubated in DAPI (Chem Cruz, #SC3598) for 5 min, washed several times and mounted with 70% (v/v) glycerol in PBS on slides. Images of immunostained sections were acquired on Nicon confocal microscope and processed with NIS element (Nicon) and ImageJ (NIH). For the colocalization analysis in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, we firstly merged channels of virus AAV9-EFIa-DIO-ChETA-EYFP (green) and PSD95 (red) and the co-labeled yellow areas are considered as CCK-positive terminals.

<title>RNAscope in situ hybridization</title>
<p>Coronal brain sections (20 μm) were prepared with the same methods as tissue used for immunohistochemistry (see above). Using mouse specific CCK probe (ACDbio, #402271) and RNAscope reagent kit-RED (ACDbio, #322350), we performed chromogenic in situ hybridization according to the manufacturer’s instructions for fixed frozen sections. Briefly, washed sections were baked for 30min at 60°C, then fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 15min at 4°C and dehydrated in successive 5-min baths of ethanol (50, 75, 100%). After drying, three steps of pretreatment were performed, including a 10-min hydrogen peroxide treatment, a 15-min target retrieval step in boiling solution, and a 16-min protease digestion step at 40°C. After creating hydrophobic barrier around the perimeter of each section, hybridization with CCK probe was performed for 2h at 40°C, followed by six steps of amplification. Two washes of 2 min were applied after hybridization step and each amplification step. Fast Red was then used as a chromogen for the exposure step for 10 min at room temperature. After washing in water, slides were counterstained with freshly diluted hematoxylin, washed again and dried, then mounted with Vectamount (ACObio, #321584) on SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, #12-550-15).</p>
<p>We understand that the in situ hybridization using fluorescent assays can achieve higher sensitivity, however, our objective in assessing CCK mRNA expression level was to compare the differences across several developmental stages. Therefore, we applied the identical parameters for imaging and image analysis to ensure accurate comparisons. Brightfield images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E upright microscope. Semi-quantitative analysis of the images was performed employing Fiji ImageJ. ROI was delineated separately for each slice, focusing on the MGv region. The background was subtracted using the Color Deconvolution with the same user-defined values for all the calculated images. Images from the signal channel were first converted to the 8-bit grayscale before applying a threshold as a criterion for binarization, where signals equal to or above the threshold were considered positive. It should be noted that the positive cells we defined here are based on this criterion rather than an absolute definition, and the specific threshold value was appropriately chosen to identify the most of CCK positive neurons in the adult group. Overlapping cells were then separated using the Watershed segmentation function prior to running the Analyze Particles tool for cell counting. The signal intensity of each single cell was then measured on the 8-bit grayscale images, according to the location and area of the positive cells confirmed in the binary images. The CCK mRNA intensity of single cell was normalized to the average CCK expression of all the MGv neurons from 8- week mice.</p>

<title>For young adult mice group shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A-D</xref></title>
<p>Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response test was adopted to examine the frequency discrimination ability of mice in CCK-8S injection group and ACSF control group. In the test, three customized soundproof chambers equipped with vibration sensors on the bottoms for the startle reflex detection, MF-1 multi-field magnetic speakers for tone presentation and high-power tweeter speakers for startle white noise presentation. Three days after the cannula implantation surgery, mice were placed into the self-designed plastic tubes individually with open slots on both sides and front for habituation for 5-10 min every day for 3 days. The mice were then randomly separated into two groups, one CCK-8S infusion group, and one ACSF infusion control group. CCK-8S (10 nM, 1 μL) or ACSF (1 μL) was infused by microinjector at the speed of 0.2 μL/min bilaterally into the auditory cortices. Five minutes after the injection, mice were placed in the tubes and exposed to pure-tone stimulation for 0.5 h in the sound-proof chamber. For the tone exposure protocol, a pure tone of 9.8 kHz or 16.4 kHz (Intensity, 70 dB; duration, 100 ms) was used. The tone exposure consisted of 900 trains with an inter-tone interval of 2s. Each train contained 5 tones presented at 5 Hz. Mice were restrained into the tubes again for the startle test at 24 h after the exposure. The tubes were stabilized on the vibration sensors in the sound-proof chamber during the experiment. The startle reflexes were detected by the sensors and then amplified and recorded by TDT. The whole experiment was divided into 4 blocks; a background tone (9.8 kHz or 16.4 kHz) was continuously presented at 70 dB throughout the experiment. Block 1 was a 5 min acclimation period in which only the background tone was presented. Block 2 contained 9 startle-only trials in which a white noise burst of 120 dB intensity and 20 ms duration was presented. Block 3 consisted of prepulse inhibition trials in a pseudorandom order. Each prepulse trial consisted of a 80 ms prepulse at 70 dB (pure-tone frequency was 0%, 2%, 4%, 8%, 16%, or 32% lower than the background tone, Δf), followed by a 20 ms white-noise startle pulse at 120 dB, and then return to the background tone after the startle. Every trial in block 3 was presented 15 times. Block 4 was identical with Block 2, and it was used to detect any habituation within the experiment. The inter-trial interval was 10-20 s. The startle reflex was measured as the peak-to-peak amplitude of the raw waveform detected by the sensor. Prepulse inhibition percentage was calculated from block 3 data as follows: [1 – (prepulse trial/Δf=0% prepulse trial)] × 100, and the data was plotted as mean ± SEM. Startle reflex amplitude in Block 2 and Block 4 were compared with each other as an internal control for startle attenuation over the whole experiment. Mice with statistically different performance in Block 2 and Block 4 were removed from the analysis.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study demonstrating that cholecystokinin is a key modulator of auditory thalamocortical plasticity during development and in young adults but not aged mice, though the cortical application of this neuropeptide in older animals appears to go some way to restoring this age-dependent loss in plasticity. A strength of this work is the use of multiple experimental approaches, which together provide <bold>convincing</bold> support for the proposed involvement of cholecystokinin. Nevertheless, the specificity of the electrical and optical stimulation experiments requires further validation and some key details are missing in the presentation and discussion of these findings. This work is likely to be influential in opening up a new avenue of investigation into the roles of neuropeptides in sensory plasticity.</p>

<p>This study offers a valuable investigation into the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in thalamocortical plasticity during early development and adulthood, employing a range of experimental techniques. The authors demonstrate that tetanic stimulation of the auditory thalamus induces cortical long-term potentiation (LTP), which can be evoked through either electrical or optical stimulation of the thalamus or by noise bursts. They further show that thalamocortical LTP is abolished when thalamic CCK is knocked down or when cortical CCK receptors are blocked. Interestingly, in 18-month-old mice, thalamocortical LTP was largely absent but could be restored through the cortical application of CCK. The authors conclude that CCK contributes to thalamocortical plasticity and may enhance thalamocortical plasticity in aged subjects.</p>
<p>While the study presents compelling evidence, I would like to offer several suggestions for the authors' consideration:</p>
<p>(1) Thalamocortical LTP and NMDA-Dependence:</p>
<p>
It is well established that thalamocortical LTP is NMDA receptor-dependent, and blocking cortical NMDA receptors can abolish LTP. This raises the question of why thalamocortical LTP is eliminated when thalamic CCK is knocked down or when cortical CCK receptors are blocked. If I correctly understand the authors' hypothesis - that CCK promotes LTP through CCKR-intracellular Ca2+-AMPAR. This pathway should not directly interfere with the NMDA-dependent mechanism. A clearer explanation of this interaction would be beneficial.</p>
<p>(2) Complexity of the Thalamocortical System:</p>
<p>
The thalamocortical system is intricate, with different cortical and thalamic subdivisions serving distinct functions. In this study, it is not fully clear which subdivisions were targeted for stimulation and recording, which could significantly influence the interpretation of the findings. Clarifying this aspect would enhance the study's robustness.</p>
<p>(3) Statistical Variability:</p>
<p>
Biological data, including field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and LTP, often exhibit significant variability between samples, sometimes resulting in a standard deviation that exceeds 50% of the mean value. The reported standard deviation of LTP in this study, however, appears unusually small, particularly given the relatively limited sample size. Further discussion of this observation might be warranted.</p>
<p>(4) EYFP Expression and Virus Targeting:</p>
<p>
The authors indicate that AAV9-EFIa-ChETA-EYFP was injected into the medial geniculate body (MGB) and subsequently expressed in both the MGB and cortex. If I understand correctly, the authors assume that cortical expression represents thalamocortical terminals rather than cortical neurons. However, co-expression of CCK receptors does not necessarily imply that the virus selectively infected thalamocortical terminals. The physiological data regarding cortical activation of thalamocortical terminals could be questioned if the cortical expression represents cortical neurons or both cortical neurons and thalamocortical terminals.</p>
<p>(5) Consideration of Previous Literature:</p>
<p>
A number of studies have thoroughly characterized auditory thalamocortical LTP during early development and adulthood. It may be beneficial for the authors to integrate insights from this body of work, as reliance on data from the somatosensory thalamocortical system might not fully capture the nuances of the auditory pathway. A more comprehensive discussion of the relevant literature could enhance the study's context and impact.</p>
<p>(6) Therapeutic Implications:</p>
<p>
While the authors suggest potential therapeutic applications of their findings, it may be somewhat premature to draw such conclusions based on the current evidence. Although speculative discussion is not harmful, it may not significantly add to the study's conclusions at this stage.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work used multiple approaches to show that CCK is critical for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the auditory thalamocortical pathway. They also showed that the CCK mediation of LTP is age-dependent and supports frequency discrimination. This work is important because it opens up a new avenue of investigation of the roles of neuropeptides in sensory plasticity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength is the multiple approaches used to comprehensively examine the role of CCK in auditory thalamocortical LTP. Thus, the authors do provide a compelling set of data that CCK mediates thalamocortical LTP in an age-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The behavioral assessment is relatively limited but may be fleshed out in future work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cholecystokinin (CCK) is highly expressed in auditory thalamocortical (MGB) neurons and CCK has been found to shape cortical plasticity dynamics. In order to understand how CCK shapes synaptic plasticity in the auditory thalamocortical pathway, they assessed the role of CCK signaling across multiple mechanisms of LTP induction with the auditory thalamocortical (MGB - layer IV Auditory Cortex) circuit in mice. In these physiology experiments that leverage multiple mechanisms of LTP induction and a rigorous manipulation of CCK and CCK-dependent signaling, they establish an essential role of auditory thalamocortical LTP on the co-release of CCK from auditory thalamic neurons. By carefully assessing the development of this plasticity over time and CCK expression, they go on to identify a window of time that CCK is produced throughout early and middle adulthood in auditory thalamocortical neurons to establish a window for plasticity from 3 weeks to 1.5 years in mice, with limited LTP occurring outside of this window. The authors go on to show that CCK signaling and its effect on LTP in the auditory cortex is also capable of modifying frequency discrimination accuracy in an auditory PPI task. In evaluating the impact of CCK on modulating PPI task performance, it also seems that in mice &lt;1.5 years old CCK-dependent effects on cortical plasticity are almost saturated. While exogenous CCK can modestly improve discrimination of only very similar tones, exogenous focal delivery of CCK in older mice can significantly improve learning in a PPI task to bring their discrimination ability in line with those from young adult mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The clarity of the results along with the rigor multi-angled approach provide significant support for the claim that CCK is essential for auditory thalamocortical synaptic LTP. This approach uses a combination of electrical, acoustic, and optogenetic pathway stimulation alongside conditional expression approaches, germline knockout, viral RNA downregulation, and pharmacological blockade. Through the combination of these experimental configures the authors demonstrate that high-frequency stimulation-induced LTP is reliant on co-release of CCK from glutamatergic MGB terminals projecting to the auditory cortex.</p>
<p>(2) The careful analysis of the CCK, CCKB receptor, and LTP expression is also a strength that puts the finding into the context of mechanistic causes and potential therapies for age-dependent sensory/auditory processing changes. Similarly, not only do these data identify a fundamental biological mechanism, but they also provide support for the idea that exogenous asynchronous stimulation of the CCKBR is capable of restoring an age-dependent loss in plasticity.</p>
<p>(3) Although experiments to simultaneously relate LTP and behavioral change or identify a causal relationship between LTP and frequency discrimination are not made, there is still convincing evidence that CCK signaling in the auditory cortex (known to determine synaptic LTP) is important for auditory processing/frequency discrimination. These experiments are key for establishing the relevance of this mechanism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Given the magnitude of the evoked responses, one expects that pyramidal neurons in layer IV are primarily those that undergo CCK-dependent plasticity, but the degree to which PV-interneurons and pyramidal neurons participate in this process differently is unclear.</p>
<p>(2) While these data support an important role for CCK in synaptic LTP in the auditory thalamocortical pathway, perhaps temporal processing of acoustic stimuli is as or more important than frequency discrimination. Given the enhanced responsivity of the system, it is unclear whether this mechanism would improve or reduce the fidelity of temporal processing in this circuit. Understanding this dynamic may also require consideration of cell type as raised in weakness #1.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 1, an example of increased spontaneous and evoked firing activity of single neurons after HFS is provided. Yet it is surprising that the group data are analyzed only for the fEPSP. It seems that single-neuron data would also be useful at this point to provide insight into how CCK and HFS affect temporal processing and spontaneous activity/excitability, especially given the example in 1F.</p>
<p>(4) The authors mention that CCK mRNA was absent in CCK-KO mice, but the data are not provided.</p>
<p>(5) The circuitry that determines PPI requires multiple brain areas, including the auditory cortex. Given the complicated dynamics of this process, it may be helpful to consider what, if anything, is known specifically about how layer IV synaptic plasticity in the auditory cortex may shape this behavior.</p>
