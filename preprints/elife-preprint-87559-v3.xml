<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Quinidine has been used as an anticonvulsant to treat patients with KCNT1-related epilepsy by targeting gain-of-function KCNT1 pathogenic mutant variants. However, the detailed mechanism underlying quinidineâs blockade against KCNT1 (Slack) remains elusive. Here, we report a functional and physical coupling of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Slack. Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 binds to and highly sensitizes Slack to quinidine blockade. Homozygous knockout of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 reduces the sensitivity of native sodium-activated potassium currents to quinidine blockade. Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization requires the involvement of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N-and C-termini binding to Slackâs C-terminus, and is enhanced by transient sodium influx through Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. Moreover, disrupting the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction by viral expression of Slackâs C-terminus can protect against SlackG269S-induced seizures in mice. These insights about a Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 complex challenge the traditional view of âSlack as an isolated targetâ for anti-epileptic drug discovery efforts, and can guide the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for KCNT1-related epilepsy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The sodium-activated potassium (K<sub>Na</sub>) channels Slack and Slick were first identified in guinea pig cardiomyocytes, and were subsequently found to be encoded by two genes of the <italic>Slo2</italic> family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Slack channels encoded by the <italic>Slo2.2</italic> (<italic>KCNT1</italic>) gene are gated by Na<sup>+</sup>, while Slick channels encoded by the <italic>Slo2.1</italic> (<italic>KCNT2</italic>) gene are more sensitive to Cl<sup>-</sup> than Na<sup>+</sup>. Slack channels are expressed at high levels in the central nervous system (CNS), especially the cortex and brainstem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Activation of Slack channels by intracellular sodium ions forms delayed outward currents in neurons, contributes to slow afterhyperpolarization (AHP) following repeated action potentials, and modulates the firing frequency of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Mutations in the <italic>KCNT1</italic> gene have been implicated in a wide spectrum of epileptic disorders, including early-onset epilepsy (<italic>e.g.</italic>, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS), non-EIMFS developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, and autosomal dominant or sporadic sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (ADSHE))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Over 50 mutations related to seizure disorders have been identified, typically displaying a gain-of-function (GOF) phenotype in heterologous expression systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The prescribed antiarrhythmic drug, quinidine, has emerged as a precision therapy for KCNT1-related epilepsy by blocking Slack mutant variants <italic>in vitro</italic> and conferring decreased seizure frequency and improved psychomotor development in clinical treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, clinical quinidine therapy has shown limited success and contradictory therapeutic effects, probably due to poor bloodâbrain barrier penetration, dose-limiting off-target effects, phenotype-genotype associations, and rational therapeutic schedule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Slack requires high intracellular free Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations ([Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>) for its activation in neurons (K<sub>d</sub> of â¼66 mM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, previous investigations have shown that the [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> at resting states (â¼10 mM) is much lower than the [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> needed for effective Slack activation (<italic>e.g.</italic>, K<sub>d</sub> value)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, native Slack channels need to localize with Na<sup>+</sup> sources within a nanodomain to be activated and exert physiological function. Slack channels are known to be functionally coupled with sodium-permeable ion channels in neurons, such as voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channels and AMPA receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. A question arises as to whether these known Na<sup>+</sup> sources modulate Slackâs sensitivity to quinidine blockade.</p>
<p>Here, we found that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes Slack to quinidine blockade. Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 form a complex that functions in Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated transient sodium influx to sensitize Slack to quinidine blockade in HEK293 cells and in primary cortical neurons. The widespread expression of these channel proteins in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum supports that the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-Slack complex is essential for the function of a wide range of electrically excitable neurons, and moreover, that this complex can be viewed as a vulnerable target for drug development to treat KCNT1-related disorders.</p>

<title>Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes Slack to quinidine blockade</title>
<p>Slack currents are activated by sodium entry through voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channels and ionotropic glutamate receptors (<italic>e.g.</italic> AMPA receptors)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To investigate potential modulators of Slackâs sensitivity to quinidine blockade, we initially focused on the known Na<sup>+</sup> sources of Slack. Working in HEK293 cells, we co-expressed Slack with AMPA receptor subunits (GluA1, GluA2, GluA3, or GluA4) or Na<sub>V</sub> channel Î± subunits (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.6), which are highly expressed in the central nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The sensitivity of Slack to quinidine blockade was assessed based on the detected inhibitory effects of quinidine on delayed outward potassium currents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Interestingly, all neuronal Na<sub>V</sub> channels significantly sensitized Slack to 30 Î¼M quinidine blockade, whereas no effect was observed upon co-expression of Slack with GluA1, GluA2, GluA3, or GluA4 (Fig. S1).</p>
<p>When co-expressing Slack with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in HEK293 cells, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitized Slack to quinidine blockade by nearly 100-fold (IC<sub>50</sub> = 85.13 Î¼M for Slack expressed alone and an IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.87 Î¼M for Slack upon co-expression with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A,B,D,F</xref>). Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 also exhibited &gt;10-fold selectivity in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade against Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,F</xref>, and Supplementary Table 1). When we co-expressed the cardiac sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 with Slack, we observed only â¼3-fold sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E,F</xref>). These results together indicate that the apparent functional coupling between Slack and Na<sub>V</sub> channels is Na<sub>V</sub>-channel-subtype-specific, with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 being particularly impactful in Slackâs responsivity to quinidine blockade.</p>

Current traces were elicited by 600-ms step pulses to voltages varying from -120 mV to +100 mV in 20 mV increments, with a holding potential of -70 mV, and recorded with different bath solutions in the following order: Na<sup>+</sup>-based bath solution (I<sub>Control</sub>), replacement of external Na<sup>+</sup> with Li<sup>+</sup> in equivalent concentration (I<sub>Li</sub>), washout of quinidine by Na<sup>+</sup>-based bath solution (I<sub>Wash</sub>), Na<sup>+</sup>-based bath solution with 3 Î¼M quinidine (I<sub>Quid</sub>), Li<sup>+</sup>-based bath solution with 3 Î¼M quinidine (I<sub>Li+Quid</sub>).

<p>Slack and Slick are both K<sub>Na</sub> channels (with 74% sequence identity) and adopt similar structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and Slick is also blocked by quinidine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We next assessed whether Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes Slick to quinidine blockade and observed that, similar to Slack, co-expression of Slick and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in HEK293 cells resulted in a sensitization of Slick to quinidine blockade (7-fold) (Fig. S2A,B).

<p>We also asked whether Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes native K<sub>Na</sub> channels to quinidine blockade in neurons. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in primary cortical neurons from postnatal (P0-P1) homozygous Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 knockout C3HeB/FeJ mice and the wild-type littermate controls. As Lithium is a much weaker activator of K<sub>Na</sub> channels than sodium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, K<sub>Na</sub> currents (I<sub>KNa</sub>) were isolated by replacing sodium ions with equivalent lithium ions in the bath solution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G,H</xref>) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The amplitudes of I<sub>KNa</sub> remained unaffected by the homozygous knockout of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (Fig. S3A). Notably, 3 Î¼M quinidine significantly inhibited native I<sub>KNa</sub> (44%) in wild-type neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I,K</xref>) and this inhibitory effect was not limited to targeting the larger I<sub>KNa</sub> (Fig. S3B). Conversely, the same concentration of quinidine had no significant effect on I<sub>KNa</sub> in Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-knockout (Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-KO) neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J,K</xref>). These results support that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 is required for the observed high sensitivity of native K<sub>Na</sub> channels to quinidine blockade.</p>

<title>Transient sodium influx through Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 enhances Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade</title>
<p>We next investigated the biomolecular mechanism underlying Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade. Considering that Slack currents are activated by sodium influx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, we initially assessed the effects of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx on sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade. We used 100 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx (Fig. S4A,B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. In HEK293 cells expressing Slack alone, 100 nM TTX did not affect Slack currents; nor did it affect Slackâs sensitivity to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 83.27 Î¼M) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref> and Fig. S4C,D). In contrast, upon co-expression of Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in HEK293 cells, bath-application of 100nM TTX significantly reduced the effects of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 25.04 Î¼M) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>).

<p>It is known that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx involves a transient inward flux that reaches a peak before subsequently decaying to the baseline within a few milliseconds; this is termed a transient sodium current (I<sub>NaT</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. A small fraction of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents are known to persist after the rapid decay of I<sub>NaT,</sub> and these are termed persistent sodium currents (I<sub>NaP</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We isolated I<sub>NaT</sub> and I<sub>NaP</sub> to explore their potential contributions in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade. We selectively inactivated I<sub>NaT</sub> using a depolarized prepulse of -40 mV (Fig. S5A) and selectively blocked I<sub>NaP</sub> by bath-application of 20 Î¼M riluzole, which is a relatively specific I<sub>NaP</sub> blocker that is known to stabilize inactivated-state Na<sub>V</sub> channels and delay recovery from inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Our findings ultimately confirmed that the 20 Î¼M riluzole selectively blocked I<sub>NaP</sub> compared to I<sub>NaT</sub> in HEK293 cells co-expressing Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (Fig. S5B) and that 20 Î¼M riluzole had no effect on Slack currents when expressed alone (Fig. S5C,D).</p>
<p>Consistent with previous investigations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, inactivating I<sub>NaT</sub> reduced whole-cell Slack currents by 20%, and blocking I<sub>NaP</sub> reduced Slack currents by 40% at +100 mV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,D,F,G</xref>), supporting that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx activates Slack. Interestingly, inactivating I<sub>NaT</sub> resulted in a &gt; 20-fold decrease in Slackâs sensitization to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 22.26 Î¼M) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,E</xref>). In contrast, blocking I<sub>NaP</sub> had no effect on Slackâs sensitization to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.60 Î¼M) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F,H</xref>). These findings indicate that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes Slack to quinidine blockade via I<sub>NaT</sub> but not I<sub>NaP</sub>.</p>
<p>Given that Slack current amplitudes are sensitive to sodium influx, and considering that quinidine is a sodium channel blocker, we examined whether Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 has higher sensitivity to quinidine blockade than other Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtypes, which could plausibly explain the observed increased strength of sensitization. We used whole-cell patch-clamping to assess the sensitivity of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 to quinidine blockade. These sodium channels exhibited similar levels of quinidine sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub> values in the range of 35.61-129.84 Î¼M) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I,J</xref> and Supplementary Table 2), all of which were at least 40-fold lower than the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Additionally, co-expressing Slack with Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in HEK293 cells did not change the sensitivity of these Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtypes to quinidine blockade (Fig. S6 and Supplementary Table 2). Thus, differential quinidine affinity for specific Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtypes cannot explain the large observed Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade. Moreover, it is clear that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade is directly mediated by I<sub>NaT</sub>, rather than through some secondary effects related to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs higher sensitivity to quinidine blockade.</p>

<title>Slack physically interacts with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6</title>
<p>We found that the specific voltage-gated sodium channel blocker TTX did not completely abolish the effects of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 on sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), so it appears that a sodium-influx-independent mechanism is involved in the observed Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade. We therefore investigated a potential physical interaction between Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. We initially assessed the cellular distribution of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, and Slack in the hippocampus and the neocortex of mouse. Consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 were localized to the axonal initial segment (AIS) of neurons, evident as the co-localization of Na<sub>V</sub> and AnkG, a sodium channel-associated protein known to accumulate at the AIS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Slack channels were also localized to the AIS of these neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), indicating that Slack channels are located in close proximity to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels, and supporting their possible interaction. Moreover, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 was co-immunoprecipitated with Slack in homogenates from mouse cortical and hippocampal tissues and from HEK293T cells co-transfected with Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,C</xref>), supporting that Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 form protein complexes in mouse brains.</p>

<p>To assess the interaction between Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 inside living cells, we performed a FRET assay in transfected HEK293T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.

Upon imaging the emission spectra cells co-expressing Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mVenus and Slack-mTFP1 (measured at the plasma membrane region) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), we detected positive FRET signals, indicating a Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F,H</xref>). The plasma membrane regions from HEK293T cells co-transfected with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Slack showed FRET efficiency values much larger than a negative control (in which standalone mVenus and mTFP1 proteins were co-expressed) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G,H</xref>), indicating that Slack channels reside in close spatial proximity (less than 10 nm) to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels in living cells.</p>
<p>We next characterized the consequences of the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction in HEK293 cells using whole-cell recordings. Slack increased the rate of recovery from fast inactivation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (Fig. S7E), with no significant effects on the steady-state activation, steady-state fast inactivation, or ramp currents (Fig. S7C,D,F and Supplementary Table 3). Additionally, we found that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 had no significant effects on the activation rate or the current-voltage (I-V) relationship of Slack currents (Fig. S7A,B). These results indicate that the physical interaction between Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 produces functional consequences. Taken together, these findings support functional and physical coupling of Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6.</p>

<p>To investigate which interacting domains mediate Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade, we focused on Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs cytoplasmic fragments, including its N-terminus, inter domain linkers, and C-terminus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Whole-cell recordings from HEK293 cells co-expressing Slack with these Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 fragments revealed that the N-terminus and C-terminus of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 significantly enhanced the sensitivity of Slack to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 31.59 Î¼M for Slack upon co-expression with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N-terminus and IC<sub>50</sub> = 43.70 Î¼M for Slack upon co-expression with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs C-terminus); note that the inter domain linkers had no effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequent co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull down assays of HEK293T cell lysates experimentally confirmed that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N-and C-termini each interact with Slack (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and Fig. S8). Additionally, whole-cell recordings using an [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> of 5 mM again showed that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N-terminus and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs C-terminus sensitize Slack to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 27.87 Î¼M) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). And inside-out recordings using an [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> of 140 mM showed that co-expression of Slack, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N-terminus, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs C-terminus resulted in obvious sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.57 Î¼M (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>)âthus fully mimicking the aforementioned effects of full-length Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.91 Î¼M) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). These findings support that the binding of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N- and C-termini to Slack is required for Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade.</p>
<p>Recalling that Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 had the least pronounced effect in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade among all examined Na<sub>V</sub> channels (IC<sub>50</sub> = 29.46 Î¼M) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and Supplementary Table 1), we initially compared the sodium currents of Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtypes co-expressed with Slack. The results revealed no significant differences in activation time constants (Fig. S9A). Itâs worth noting that Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 exhibited significantly larger current amplitudes than Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (Fig. S9B). Subsequently, we constructed Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-1.6 chimeras to test the roles of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N- and C-termini in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade. The replacement of both the N-terminus [residues 1-131] and C-terminus [residues 1772-2016] of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N-terminus [residues 1-132] and C-terminus [residues 1766-1980] (namely Na<sub>V</sub>1.5/6<sup>NC</sup>) fully mimicked effects of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.13 Î¼M) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-I</xref>). We also found that replacement of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5âs N-terminus [residues 1-131] with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N-terminus [residues 1-132] (namely Na<sub>V</sub>1.5/6<sup>N</sup>) fully mimicked the effects of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.18 Î¼M) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-I</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, despite both Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5/6<sup>N</sup> exhibited much larger current amplitudes compared to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (Fig. S9B), only Na<sub>V</sub>1.5/6<sup>N</sup> replicated the effect of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H-I</xref>). These results suggest that the observed differences between Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in sensitizing Slack are unlikely to be attributed to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs smaller sodium current amplitudes but involve Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N-terminus. Consistently, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5âs C-terminus sensitized Slack to quinidine blockade (IC<sub>50</sub> = 37.59 Î¼M), whereas Na<sub>V</sub>1.5âs N-terminus had no effect on Slack sensitization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These findings support that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N-terminus is essential for sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade.</p>
<p>Having demonstrated that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sensitizes Slack via Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs cytoplasmic N- and C-termini, we investigated which domains of Slack interact with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and focused on Slackâs cytoplasmic fragments, including Slackâs N-terminus and C-terminus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In HEK293 cells co-expressing Na<sub>V</sub> and Slack, Na<sub>V</sub>-mediated sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade was significantly attenuated upon the additional expression of Slackâs C-terminus, but not of Slackâs N-terminus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,C</xref>), suggesting that Slackâs C-terminus can disrupt the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction by competing with Slack for binding to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. Consistently, Slackâs C-terminus co-immunoprecipitated with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N- and C-termini in HEK293T cell lysates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).

<title>Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 binds to and sensitizes epilepsy-related Slack mutant variants to quinidine blockade</title>
<p>Over 50 mutations in KCNT1 (Slack) have been identified and related to seizure disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Having established that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 can sensitize wild-type Slack to quinidine blockade, we next investigated whether Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 also sensitizes epilepsy-related Slack mutant variants to quinidine blockade. We chose 3 Slack pathogenic mutant variants (K629N, R950Q, and K985N) initially detected in patients with KCNT1-related epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.

<p>Subsequently, whole-cell recordings revealed that the examined Slack mutant variants exhibited no discernible impact on the amplitudes of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents (Fig. S10A), while pharmacologically blocking Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents using bath-application of 100 nM TTX significantly reduced the amplitudes of Slack mutant variant (Slack<sup>R950Q</sup>) currents (Fig. S10B), suggesting a Na<sup>+</sup>-mediated functional coupling between Slack mutant variant and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents. Notably, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 significantly sensitized all of the examined Slack mutant variants to quinidine blockade, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.26 to 2.41 Î¼M (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-D</xref> and Supplementary Table 4).

<title>Viral expression of Slackâs C-terminus prevents Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-induced seizures</title>
<p>Having established that blocking Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx significantly reduced Slack current amplitudes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,G</xref> and Fig. S10B), we found that the heterozygous knockout of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 significantly reduced the afterhyperpolarization amplitude in murine hippocampal neurons (Fig. S11), together indicating that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 activates native Slack through providing Na<sup>+</sup>. We therefore assumed that disruption of the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction should reduce the amount of Na<sup>+</sup> in the close vicinity of epilepsy-related Slack mutant variants and thereby counter the increased current amplitudes of these Slack mutant variants. Pursuing this, we disrupted the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub> interaction by overexpressing Slackâs C-terminus (to compete with Slack) and measured whole-cell current densities. In HEK293 cells co-expressing epilepsy-related Slack mutant variants (G288S, R398Q)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5/6<sup>NC</sup>, expression of Slackâs C-terminus significantly reduced whole-cell current densities of Slack<sup>G269S</sup> and Slack<sup>R398Q</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,B</xref>), supporting that disrupting the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction can indeed reduce current amplitudes of Slack mutant variants, which may protect against seizures induced by Slack mutant variants.</p>

<p>We next induced an <italic>in vivo</italic> epilepsy model by introducing a Slack G269S variant into C57BL/6N mice using adeno-associated virus (AAV) injection to mimic the human Slack mutation G288S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Specifically, we delivered stereotactic injections of AAV9 containing expression cassettes for Slack<sup>G269S</sup> (or GFP negative controls) into the hippocampal CA1 region of 3-week-old C57BL/6N mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C,D</xref>). At 3-5 week intervals after AAV injection, we quantified the seizure susceptibility of mice upon the induction of a classic kainic acid (KA) model of temporal lobe epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In this model, seizures with stage IV or higher (as defined by a modified Racine, Pinal, and Rovner scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>) are induced in rodents by intraperitoneal administration of 28 mg/kg KA.</p>
<p>We assessed a time course of KA-induced seizure stages at 10-min intervals and found that viral expression of Slack<sup>G269S</sup> resulted in faster seizure progression in mice compared to control GFP expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). We calculated the total seizure score per mouse to assess seizure severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-expressing mice showed significantly higher seizure severity than GFP-expressing mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). The percentage of mice with stage VIâ¼IX seizures also increased, from 9.1% in GFP-expressing control mice to 58.3% in the Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-expressing mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>). These results support that viral expression of Slack<sup>G269S</sup> significantly increases seizure susceptibility in mice.</p>
<p>To evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of disrupting the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction, we delivered two AAV9s (one for Slack<sup>G269S</sup> and one for Slackâs C-terminus [residues 326-1238]) into the CA1 region of mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Viral expression of Slackâs C-terminus in Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-expressing mice significantly decreased seizure progression, seizure severity, and the percentage of mice experiencing stage VIâ¼IX seizures (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E-G</xref>). These results support that viral expression of Slackâs C-terminus can prevent Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-induced seizures in mice, thus showcasing that using Slackâs C-terminus to disrupt the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction is a promising therapeutic intervention to treat KCNT1-related epilepsy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We here found that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6âs N- and C-termini bind to Slackâs C-terminus and sensitize Slack to quinidine blockade via Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated transient sodium currents. These results suggest that the pharmacological blocking effects of a channel blocker are not exclusively mediated by the channel <italic>per.se</italic>., but modulated by channelâs interacting proteins. Moreover, we show that viral expression of Slackâs C-terminus can rescue the increased seizure susceptibility and confer protection against Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-induced seizures in mice.</p>
<p>At resting membrane potential, the intracellular sodium concentration ([Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>) in neurons (equal to â¼10 mM) is too low to effectively activate Slack (K<sub>d</sub> of 66 mM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Slack is functionally coupled to sodium influx, which is known to be mediated by ion channels and receptors, including Na<sub>V</sub>, AMPARs, and NMDARs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Such Na<sup>+</sup> sources can provide both the membrane depolarization and the Na<sup>+</sup> entry known to be required for Slack activation, enabling Slack to contribute both to action potential repolarization during neuronal high-frequency firing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> and to regulating excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) at post-synaptic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Our results support that Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 form a channel complex, while also implying that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx increases the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in the close vicinity of Slack to activate Slack. As a low threshold Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtype, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 has been reported to dominate the initiation and propagation of action potentials in axon initial segments (AIS) in excitatory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. The activation of Slack by Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 at AIS has multiple impacts, including ensuring the timing of the fast-activated component of Slack currents, regulating the action potential amplitude, and apparently contributing to intrinsic neuronal excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The use of HEK cells and cultured primary cortical neurons in this study may not fully capture the complexity of native Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction. Future studies employing more intact systems, such as <italic>in vivo</italic> models, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the physiological relevance of the native Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction.</p>
<p>An interesting question arises from our observation that Slackâs sensitivity to quinidine blockade is enhanced by I<sub>NaT</sub> but not I<sub>NaP</sub>: what can explain the distinct I<sub>NaT</sub> and I<sub>NaP</sub> contributions? We speculate that with physical modulation by Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, I<sub>NaT</sub> may elicit a specific open conformation of Slack that brings its quinidine binding pocket into a high affinity state, which could lead to a substantial increase in Slackâs sensitivity to quinidine blockade. The possibility of this hypothetical open conformation is supported by previous reports of the presence of subconductance states detected in single-channel recordings of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing Slack channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, which implies that there are multiple open conformations of Slack. Although only one open conformation of Slack has been observed in cryo-EM, the gap between maximum conformational open probability (â¼1.0) and maximum functional open probability (â¼0.7) implies a subclass within this class of open channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Additionally, itâs worth noting that blocking of I<sub>NaP</sub> by application of riluzole has its limitation on selectivity. Riluzole has been reported to bind to Slack channels with low affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Therefore, the dual binding of riluzole to both Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 may stabilize or inhibit the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction, consequently influencing the sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, gain-of-function Slack mutant variants have been linked to a broad spectrum of epileptic disorders that are accompanied by intellectual disabilities and both psychomotor and developmental defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Given that many patients are refractory or non-responsive to conventional anticonvulsants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, and considering the limited success of quinidine in clinical treatment of KCNT1-related epilepsy, inhibitors targeting Slack are needed urgently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Several small-molecule inhibitors against Slack have been reported, providing informative starting points for drug development efforts with KCNT1-related epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. However, our discovery of the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 complex challenges the traditional view that Slack acts as an isolated target in KCNT1-related epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Indeed, our study supports that co-expression of Slack and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in heterologous cell models should be performed when analyzing clinically relevant Slack mutations and when screening anti-epileptic drugs for use in treating KCNT1-related disorders.</p>
<p>Genotype-phenotype analysis has shown that ADSHE-related mutations are clustered in the regulator of conductance of K<sup>+</sup> (RCK2) domain; while EIMFS-related mutations do not show a particular pattern of distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. All functionally tested Slack mutant variants show gain-of-function phenotypes, with increased Slack currents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Further, the epilepsy-related Slack mutant variants confer their gain-of-function phenotypes through two molecular mechanisms: increasing maximal channel open probability (P<sub>max</sub>) or increasing sodium sensitivity (K<sub>d</sub>) of Slack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Both P<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>d</sub> are highly sensitive to [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>; these are respectively analogous to the efficacy and potency of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> on Slack currents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Notably, several Slack mutant variants show gain-of-function phenotypes only at high [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> (<italic>e.g.</italic> 80 mM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. These results indicate that the gain-of-function phenotype of epilepsy-related Slack mutant variants is aggravated by high [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>. Our discovery of functional coupling between Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Slack presents a plausible basis for how Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-mediated sodium influx can increase [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> and thus apparently aggravate the gain-of-function phenotype of Slack mutant variants. Therefore, it makes sense that disruption of the Slack-Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 interaction by overexpressing Slackâs C-terminus reduces the current amplitudes of gain-of-function Slack mutant variants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,B</xref>). Our successful demonstration that viral expression of Slackâs C-terminus prevents epilepsy-related Slack<sup>G269S</sup>-induced seizures in mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E-G</xref>) warrants further translational evaluation for developing therapeutic interventions to treat KCNT1-related epilepsy.</p>

<title>Voltage-clamp recordings</title>
<p>The plasmids expressing full-length or fragments of Slack and Na<sub>V</sub> channels (excluding full-length Na<sub>V</sub>1.6) were co-transfected into HEK293 cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Introvigen). To co-express Slack with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, the plasmid expressing Slack was transfected into a stable HEK293 cell line expressing Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. 18-36 h after transfection, voltage-clamp recordings were obtained using a HEKA EPC-10 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Electronic) and PatchMaster software (HEKA Electronic). For all whole-cell patch clamp experiments in HEK cells except for data presented in Fig. S7D, the extracellular recording solution contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 1 Tetraethylammonium chloride (310 mOsm/L, pH 7.30 with NaOH). The recording pipette intracellular solution (5 mM Na) contained (in mM): 100 K-gluconate, 30 KCl, 15 Choline-Cl, 5 NaCl, 10 glucose,5 EGTA, 10 HEPES (300 mOsm/L, pH 7.30 with KOH). For data presented in Fig. S7D, the extracellular recording solution remains the same as above, the pipette intracellular solution contained (in mM): 140 CsF, 10 NaCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.30 with NaOH), indicating that the unusual right shifts (15â¼20 mV) in voltage dependence of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 were induced by components in pipette solution, not recording system errors. For primary cortical neurons, intracellular solution (0 mM Na) was used to prevent the activation of sodium-activated potassium channels by basal intracellular sodium ions. NaCl in the intracellular solution was replaced with choline chloride in an equimolar concentration. For inside out patch-clamps, the bath solution contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 1 EDTA, 10 HEPES and 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (310 mOsm/L, pH 7.30 with NaOH). Pipette solution contained (in mM): 130 KCl, 1 EDTA, 10 HEPES and 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (300 mOsm/L, pH 7.30 with KOH). The pipettes were fabricated by a DMZ Universal Electrode puller (Zeitz Instruments) using borosilicate glass, with a resistance of 1.5-3.5 MÎ© for whole-cell patch clamp recordings and 8.0-10.0 MÎ© for inside-out patch clamp recordings.</p>
<p>All experiments were performed at room temperature. The cells were exposed to the bath solution with quinidine for about one minute before applying voltage protocols. The concentration-response curves were fitted to four-parameter Hill equation:

Significance of fitted IC<sub>50</sub> values compared to control was analyzed using extra sum-of-squares F test.</p>
<p>For data presented in Fig. S7, cells were excluded from analysis if series resistance &gt; 5 MÎ© and series resistance compensation was set to 70%â¼90%.</p>

<p>where I is the current amplitude, t is time, offset represents the asymptote of the fit, and A represents the amplitude for the activation or inactivation.</p>

<title>Acute slice preparation and current-clamp recordings</title>
<p>Horizontal slices containing hippocampus were obtained from 6-8 weeks old heterozygous Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 knockout (Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup>) C3HeB/FeJ mice and the wild-type littermate controls. In brief, animals were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with ice-cold modified âcutting solutionâ containing (in mM): 110 choline chloride, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 glucose; bubbled continuously with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub> to maintain PH at 7.2. The brain was then removed and submerged in ice-cold âcutting solutionâ. Next, the brain was cut into 300 Î¼m slices with a vibratome (WPI). Slices were incubated in oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) ârecording solutionâ containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 glucose (315 mOsm/L, PH 7.4, 37Â°C) for 30 min, and stored at room temperature.</p>
<p>Slices were subsequently transferred to a submerged chamber containing ârecording solutionâ maintained at 34-36 Â°C. Whole-cell recordings were obtained from hippocampal CA1 neurons under a Ã60 water-immersion objective of an Olympus BX51WI microscope (Olympus). Pipettes had resistances of 5-8 MÎ©. For current-clamp recordings, the external solution (unless otherwise noted) was supplemented with 0.05 mM (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), 0.01 mM 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione, 0.01 mM bicuculline and 0.001 mM CGP 55845, and internal pipette solution containing (in mM): 118 KMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 15 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 EGTA, and 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 Tris-GTP, 14 Tris-phosphocreatinin (pH 7.3 with KOH).</p>
<p>In our whole-cell current-clamp recordings with an Axon 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), we initially applied a 100 ms, 20 pA test pulse to the recording neurons right after breaking into the whole-cell configuration. A fast-rising component and a slow-rising component of voltage response were clearly visible. Then we zoomed into the fast-rising component of the voltage responses and turned up the pipette capacitance neutralization slowly to shorten the rise time of the fast-rising component until the oscillations of voltage responses appeared. Subsequently, we decreased the capacitance compensation just until the oscillations disappeared. For bridge balance of current-clamp recordings, we increased the value of bridge balance slowly until the fast component of the voltage response disappeared, and the slow-rising component appeared to rise directly from the baseline. Series resistance and pipette capacitance were compensated using the bridge balance and pipette capacitance neutralization options in the Multiclamp 700B command software (Molecular Devices). The bridge balance value was between 20 and 30 MÎ© and the pipette capacitance neutralization value was between 3 and 5 pF. For in vitro experiments, the cells were selected by criteria based on hippocampal CA1 cell morphology and electrophysiological properties in the slices. Electrophysiological recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Recordings were filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at 50 kHz. Data were acquired and analyzed using pClamp10.0 (Molecular Devices). Series resistance was in the order of 10â30 MÎ© and was approximately 60â80% compensated. Recordings were discarded if the series resistance increased by more than 20% during the time course of the recordings.</p>

<title>Fluorescence Imaging and FRET Quantification</title>
<p>The spectroscopic imaging was built upon a Nikon TE2000-U microscope. The excitation light was generated by an Ar laser. The fluorescent protein mVenus fused to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and mTFP1 fused to Slack were excited by laser line at 500 and 400-440 nm, respectively. The duration of light exposure was controlled by a computer-driven mechanical shutter (Uniblitz). A spectrograph (Acton SpectraPro 2150i) was used in conjunction with a charge coupled device (CCD) camera (Roper Cascade 128B). In this recording mode two filter cubes (Chroma) were used to collect spectroscopic images from each cell (excitation, dichroic): cube I, D436/20, 455dclp; cube II, HQ500/20, Q515lp. No emission filter was used in these cubes. Under the experimental conditions, auto fluorescence from untransfected cells was negligible. Fluorescence imaging and analysis were done using the MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). User-designed macros were used for automatic collection of the bright field cell image, the fluorescence cell image, and the spectroscopic image. Emission spectra were collected from the plasma membrane of the cell by positioning the spectrograph slit across a cell and recording the fluorescence intensity at the position corresponding to the membrane region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, dotted lines in red); the same slit position applied to both the spectrum taken with the mTFP1 excitation and the spectrum taken with the mVenus excitation. Using this approach, the spectral and positional information are well preserved, thus allowing reliable quantification of FRET efficiency specifically from the cell membrane. Spectra were corrected for background light, which was estimated from the blank region of the same image.</p>
<p>FRET data was quantified in two ways. First, the FRET ratio was calculated from the increase in mVenus emission due to energy transfer as described in the previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> Briefly, mTFP1 emission was separated from mVenus emission by fitting of standard spectra acquired from cells expressiring only mVenus or mTFP1. The fraction of mVenus-tagged molecules that are associated with mTFP1-tagged molecules, Ab, is calculated as
<disp-formula id="eqn7a">
<graphic xlink:href="532982v3_eqn7a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is the dissociation constant and [Dfree] is the concentration of free donor molecules. Note that
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="532982v3_eqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Regression analysis was used to estimate Ab in individual cells. From each cell, the FRET ratio<sub>exp</sub> was experimentally determined. The predicted Ab value was then computed by adjusting two parameters, FRET Ratio<sub>max</sub> and apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>. Ab was in turn used to give a predicted FRET ratiopredicted. By minimizing the squared errors (FRET ratio<sub>exp</sub> â FRET ratio<sub>predicted</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> was determined.</p>
<p>Second, apparent FRET efficiency was also calculated from the enhancement of mVenus fluorescence emission due to energy transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> using a method as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> Briefly, Ratio A<sub>0</sub> and Ratio A were measured to calculate FRET efficiency. Ratio A<sub>0</sub> represents the ratio between tetramethylrhodamine maleimide emission intensities (in the absence of fluorescein maleimide) upon excitation at the donor and acceptor excitation wavelengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, and was calculated in the present study at the mVenus peak emission wavelength. A particular advantage of quantifying Ratio A<sub>0</sub> for FRET measurement is that changes in fluorescence intensity caused by many experimental factors can be cancelled out by the ratiometric measurement. A similar ratio, termed Ratio A, was determined in the presence of mTFP1 in the same way as Ratio A<sub>0</sub>. If FRET occurred, the Ratio A value should be higher than Ratio A<sub>0</sub>; the difference between Ratio A and Ratio A<sub>0</sub> was directly proportional to the FRET efficiency by the factor of extinction coefficient ratio of mTFP1 and mVenus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup></p>

<p>The authors report that an interaction between the sodium-activated potassium channel Slack and Nav1.6 sensitizes Slack to inhibition by quinidine. This is an <bold>important</bold> finding because it contributes to our understanding of how the antiseizure drug quinidine affects epilepsy syndromes arising from mutations in the Slack-encoding gene KCNT1. The results are largely <bold>compelling</bold> and the work will likely spark interest in further examining the proposed channel-channel interaction in neuronal cell membranes.</p>

<p>Despite numerous studies on quinidine therapies for epilepsies associated with GOF mutant variants of Slack, there is no consensus on its utility due to contradictory results. In this study Yuan et al. investigated the role of different sodium selective ion channels on the sensitization of Slack to quinidine block. The study employed electrophysiological approaches, FRET studies, genetically modified proteins and biochemistry to demonstrate that Nav1.6 N- and C-tail interacts with Slack's C-terminus and significantly increases Slack sensitivity to quinidine blockade in vitro and in vivo. This finding inspired the authors to investigate whether they could rescue Slack GOF mutant variants by simply disrupting the interaction between Slack and Nav1.6. They find that the isolated C-terminus of Slack can reduce the current amplitude of Slack GOF mutant variants co-expressed with Nav1.6 in HEK cells and prevent Slack induced seizures in mouse models of epilepsy. This study adds to the growing list of channels that are modulated by protein-protein interactions, and is of great value for future therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting paper about the coupling of Slack and Nav1.6 and the insight this brings to the effects of quinidine to treat some epilepsy syndromes.</p>
<p>Slack is a sodium-activated potassium channel that is important to hyperpolarization of neurons after an action potential. Slack is encoded by KNCT1 which has mutations in some epilepsy syndromes. These types of epilepsy are treated with quinidine but this is an atypical antiseizure drug, not used for other types of epilepsy. For sufficient sodium to activate Slack, Slack needs to be close to a channel that allows robust sodium entry, like Nav channels or AMPA receptors. but more mechanistic information is not available. Of particular interest to the authors is what allows quinidine to be effective in reducing Slack.</p>
<p>In the manuscript, the authors show that Nav, not AMPA receptors, are responsible for Slack's sensitization to quinidine blockade, at least in cultured neurons (HeK293, primary cortical neurons). Most of the paper focuses on the evidence that Nav1.6 promotes Slack sensitivity to quinidine.</p>

<p>Yuan et al., set out to examine the role of functional and structural interaction between Slack and NaVs on the Slack sensitivity to quinidine. Through pharmacological and genetic means they identify NaV1.6 as the privileged NaV isoform in sensitizing Slack to quinidine. Through biochemical assays, they then determine that the C-terminus of Slack physically interacts with the N- and C-termini of NaV1.6. Using the information gleaned from the in vitro experiments the authors then show that virally-mediated transduction of Slack's C-terminus lessens the extent of SlackG269S-induced seizures. These data uncover a previously unrecognized interaction between a sodium and a potassium channel, which contributes to the latter's sensitivity to quinidine.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<p>We appreciate the constructive comments made by the editor and the reviewers. We have corrected errors and provided additional experimental data and analysis to address the latest criticisms raised by the reviewers and provided point-by-point response to the reviewers as below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I do acknowledge the work the authors put into this manuscript and I can accept the fact that the authors decided on a minimum of additional experiments. However, I would recommend the authors to be more concise by adding more information in the method and result sections about how they performed their experiments such as which Nav and AMPAR DNA constructs they used, the age of the mice, how long time they exposed the patches to quinidine, information on how many times they repeated their pull downs etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewerâs comments. we have incorporated the suggested modifications into our revised manuscript. Specifically, we have included detailed information on the NaV and AMPAR constructs in the Methods section. The age of the homozygous NaV1.6 knockout mice and the wild-type littermate controls is postnatal (P0-P1) (see in Results and Methods section). Prior to the application of step pulses, cells were subjected to the bath solution containing quinidine for approximately one minute (see in Methods section). Additionally, the co-immunoprecipitation assays for Slack and NaV1.6 were repeated three times (see in Methods section).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor detail in line 263: &quot;...KCNT1 (Slack) have been identified to related to seizure...&quot; I guess this should have been &quot;...KCNT1 (Slack) have been identified and related to seizure...&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have corrected it in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, and again minor detail, I had a comment about the color coding in Fig 4 and by mistake, I added 4B, but I meant the use of colors in the entire figure, and mainly the use of colors in 4C, G and I.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We apologize for the confusion. We have changed the color coding of Figure 4 in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>While the paper is improved, several concerns do not seem to have been addressed. Some may have been missed because there is no response at all, but others may have been unclear because the response does not address the concern, but a related issue. Details are below.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for the criticisms. We have made changes of our manuscript to address the concerns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Original issue:</p>
<p>1. Remove the term in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. In our experiments, although we did not conduct experiments directly in living organisms, our results demonstrated the coimmunoprecipitation of NaV1.6 with Slack in homogenates from mouse cortical and hippocampal tissues (Fig. 3C). This result may support that the interaction between Slack and NaV1.6 occurs in vivo.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>New comment from reviewer:</p>
<p>The argument to use the term in vivo is not well supported by what the authors have said. Just because tissues are used from an animal does not mean experiments were conducted in vivo. As the authors say, they did not conduct experiments in living organisms. Therefore the term in vivo should be avoided. This is a minor point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have removed the term âin vivoâ in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Original:</p>
<p>1. Figure 1C Why does Nav1.2 have a small inward current before the large inward current in the inset?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We apologize for the confusion. We would like to clarify that the small inward current can be attributed to the current of membrane capacitance (slow capacitance or C-slow). The larger inward current is mediated by NaV1.2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>New comment:</p>
<p>This is not well argued. Please note why the authors know the current is due to capacitance. Also, how do they know the larger current is due to NaV1.2? Please add that to the paper so readers know too.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewerâs comment. To provide a clearer representation of NaV1.2mediated currents in Fig. 1C, we have replaced the original example trace with a new one in which only one inward current is observed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Original:</p>
<p>The slope of the rising phase of the larger sodium current seems greater than Nav1.6 or Nav1.5. Was this examined?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: Additionally, we did not compare the slope of the rising phase of NaV subtypes sodium currents but primarily focused on the current amplitudes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>New comment:</p>
<p>This is not a strong answer. There seems to be an effect that the authors do not mention and evidently did not quantify that argues against their conclusion, which weakens the presentation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewerâs comment. To assess the slope of the rising phase of NaV subtype currents, we compared the activation time constants of NaV1.2, NaV1.5, and NaV1.6 peak currents in HEK293 cells co-expressing NaV channel subtypes with Slack. The results have shown no significant differences (Author response image 1). We have included this analysis (see Fig. S9A) and the corresponding fitting equation (see in Methods section) in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Original:</p>
<p>2D-E For Nav1.5 the sodium current is very large compared to Nav1.6. Is it possible the greater effect of quinidine for Nav1.6 is due to the lesser sodium current of Nav1.6?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We would like to clarify that our results indicate that transient sodium currents contribute to the sensitization of Slack to quinidine blockade (Fig. 2C,E). Therefore, it is unlikely that the greater effect observed for NaV1.6 in sensitizing Slack is due to its lower sodium currents.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>New comment:</p>
<p>I am not sure the question I was asking was clear. How can the authors discount the possibility that quinidine is more effective on NaV1.6 because the NaV1.6 current is relatively weak?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have examined the sodium current amplitudes of NaV1.5, NaV1.5/1.6 chimeras, and NaV1.6 upon co-expression of NaV with Slack. Our analysis revealed that there are no significant differences between NaV1.5 and NaV1.5/6N, with both exhibiting much larger current amplitudes compared to NaV1.6 (Author response image 2), but only NaV1.5/6N replicates the effect of NaV1.6 in sensitizing Slack to quinidine blockade (Fig. 4H-I), suggesting the observed differences between NaV1.5 and NaV1.6 in sensitizing Slack are unlikely to be attributed to NaV1.6's lower sodium currents but may instead involve NaV1.6's Nterminus-induced physical interaction. We have included this analysis in the revised manuscript (see Fig. S9B).</p>

<p>The differences between WT and KO in G -H are hard to appreciate. Could quantification be shown? The text uses words like &quot;block&quot; but this is not clear from the figure. It seems that the replacement of Na+ with Li+ did not block the outward current or effect of quinidine.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We apologize for the confusion. We would like to clarify the methods used in this experiment. The lithium ion (Li+) is a much weaker activator of sodium-activated potassium channel Slack than sodium ion (Na+)1,2.</p>

Therefore, we replaced Na+ with Li+ in the bath solution to measure the current amplitudes of sodium-activated potassium currents (IKNa)3.</p>

</disp-formula>
<p>The quantification results were presented in Fig. 1K. The term &quot;block&quot; used in the text referred to the inhibitory effect of quinidine on IKNa.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>New comment:</p>
<p>The fact remains that the term &quot;block&quot; is too strong for an effect that is incomplete. Also, the authors should add to the paper that Li+ is a weaker activator, so the reader knows some of the caveats to the approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have added related citations and replaced the term âblockâ with âinhibitâ in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Original:</p>
<p>1. In K, for the WT, why is the effect of quinidine only striking for the largest currents?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. After conducting an analysis, we found no correlation between the inhibitory effect of quinidine and the amplitudes of baseline IKNa in WT neurons (p = 0.6294) (Author response image 3). Therefore, the effect of quinidine is not solely limited to targeting the larger currents.</p>

<p>Answer: We apologize for the confusion. We would like to clarify that the condition of prepulse potential at -90 mV is the same as the condition in Fig. 1. We only changed one experiment condition where the prepulse potential was changed to -40 mV from -90 mV.</p>

<p>Figure 7. The images need more clarity. They are very hard to see. Text is also hard to see.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We apologize for the lack of clarity in the images and text. we would like to provide a concise summary of the key findings shown in this figure.</p>
<p>Figure 7 illustrates an innovative intervention for treating SlackG269S-induced seizures in mice by disrupting the Slack-NaV1.6 interaction. Our results showed that blocking NaV1.6-mediated sodium influx significantly reduced Slack current amplitudes (Fig. 2D,G), suggesting that the Slack-NaV1.6 interaction contributes to the current amplitudes of epilepsy-related Slack mutant variants, aggravating the gain-of-function phenotype. Additionally, Slackâs C-terminus is involved in the
Slack-NaV1.6 interaction (Fig. 5D). We assumed that overexpressing Slackâs C-terminus can disrupt the Slack-NaV1.6 interaction (compete with Slack) and thereby encounter the current amplitudes of epilepsy-related Slack mutant variants.</p>
<p>In HEK293 cells, overexpression of Slackâs C-terminus indeed significantly reduced the current amplitudes of epilepsy-related SlackG288S and SlackR398Q upon co-expression with NaV1.5/6NC (Fig. 7A,B). Subsequently, we evaluated this intervention in an in vivo epilepsy model by introducing the Slack G269S variant into C57BL/6N mice using AAV injection, mimicking the human Slack mutation G288S that we previously identified (Fig. 7C-G).</p>

<p>Original:</p>
<p>It is not clear how data were obtained because injection of kainic acid does not lead to a convulsive seizure every 10 min for several hours, which is what appears to be shown. Individual seizures are just at the beginning and then they merge at the start of status epilepticus. After the onset of status epilepticus the animals twitch, have varied movements, sometime rear and fall, but there is not a return to normal behavior. Therefore one can not call them individual seizures. In some strains of mice, however, individual convulsive seizures do occur (even if the EEG shows status epilepticus is occurring) but there are rarely more than 5 over several hours and the graph has many more. Please explain.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We apologize for the confusion. Regarding the data acquisition in relation to kainic acid injection, we initiated the timing following intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid and recorded the seizure scores of per mouse at ten-minute intervals, following the methodology described in previous studies4.</p>

<p>The seizure scores were determined using a modified Racine, Pinal, and Rovner scale5,6: (1) Facial movements; (2) head nodding; (3) forelimb clonus; (4) dorsal extension (rearing); (5) Loss of balance and falling; (6) Repeated rearing and failing; (7) Violent jumping and running; (8) Stage 7 with periods of tonus; (9) Dead.</p>

<p>New comment:</p>
<p>This was clear. Perhaps my question was not clear. The question is how one can count individual seizures if animals have continuous seizures. It seems like the authors did not consider or observe status epilepticus but individual seizures. If that is true the data are hard to believe because too many seizures were counted. Animals do not have nearly this many seizures after kainic acid.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We appreciate the reviewerâs clarification. Our methodology involved assessing the maximum seizure scale during 10-minute intervals per mouse as previously described7, rather than counting individual seizures. For instance, a mouse exhibited the loss of balance and falling multiple times within 30-40 minute interval, we recorded the seizure scale as 5 for that time interval.</p>

<p>While the authors have improved the manuscript, several outstanding issues still need to be addressed. Some may have been missed because there is no response at all, but others may have been unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for the criticisms. We have added additional experimental data and analysis to address the concerns.</p>

<p>Original issue from Public Review:</p>
<p>1. Immunolabeling of the hippocampus CA1 suggests sodium channels as well as Slack colocalization with AnkG (Fig 3A). Proximity ligation assay for NaV1.6 and Slack or a super-resolution microscopy approach would be needed to increase confidence in the presented colocalization results. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation studies on the membrane fraction would bolster the functional relevance of NaV1.6-Slack interaction on the cell surface.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for good suggestions. We acknowledge that employing proximity ligation assay and high-resolution techniques would significantly enhance our understanding of the localization of the Slack-NaV1.6 coupling.</p>
<p>At present, the technical capabilities available in our laboratory and institution do not support highresolution testing. However, we are enthusiastic about exploring potential collaborations to address these questions in the future. Furthermore, we fully recognize the importance of conducting coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays from membrane fractions. While we have already completed Co-IP assays for total protein and quantified the FRET efficiency values between Slack and NaV1.6 in the membrane region, the Co-IP assays on membrane fractions will be conducted in our future investigations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>New comment from reviewer: so far, the authors have not demonstrated that Nav1.6 and Slack interact on the cell surface.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We acknowledgement that our data did not directly demonstrate interaction between NaV1.6 and Slack on the cell surface and we have removed related terminology in the revised manuscript. Notably, our patch-clamp experiments in Fig. 2D,G and Fig. S10B showed a Na+-mediated membrane current coupling of Slack and NaV1.6. Additionally, the FRET efficiency values between Slack and NaV1.6 were quantified in the membrane region. These findings suggest that membrane-near Slack interacts with NaV1.6.</p>

<p>1. Although hippocampal slices from Scn8a+/- were used for studies in Fig. S8, it is not clear whether Scn8a-/- or Scn8a+/- tissue was used in other studies (Fig 1J &amp; 1K). It will be important to clarify whether genetic manipulation of NaV1.6 expression (Fig. 1K) has an impact on sodiumactivated potassium current, level of surface Slack expression, or that of NaV1.6 near Slack.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In Fig. 1G,J,K, primary cortical neurons from homozygous NaV1.6 knockout (Scn8a-/-) mice were used. We will clarify this information in the revised manuscript. In terms of the effects of genetic manipulation of NaV1.6 expression on IKNa and surface Slack expression, we compared the amplitudes of IKNa measured from homozygous NaV1.6 knockout (NaV1.6-KO) neurons and wild-type (WT) neurons. The results showed that homozygous knockout of NaV1.6 does not alter the amplitudes of IKNa (Author response image 4). The level of surface Slack expression will be tested further.</p>

We examined the amplitudes of NaV1.6 sodium current upon expression alone or co-expression of NaV1.6 with epilepsy-related Slack mutations (K629N, R950Q, K985N).

<p>1. A reference to homozygous knockout is made in the abstract; however, only heterozygous mice are mentioned in the methods section. The genotype of the mice needs to be made clear in the manuscript. Furthermore, at what age were these mice used in the study. Since homozygous knockout of NaV1.6 is lethal at a very young age (&lt;4 wks), it would be important to clarify that point as well.</p>

<p>1. In Fig. 6B-D, it is not clear to what extent co-expression of Slack mutants and NaV1.6 increases sodium-activated potassium current.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We notice that the current amplitudes of Slack mutants exhibit a considerable degree of variation, ranging from less than 1 nA to over 20 nA (n =58). To accurately measure the effects of NaV1.6 on increasing current amplitudes of Slack mutants, we plan to apply tetrodotoxin in the bath solution to block NaV1.6 sodium currents upon coexpression of Slack mutants with NaV1.6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>New comment from reviewer: Were these experiments with TTX completed? If so, they should be added to the revised manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We compared the current amplitudes of epilepsy-related Slack mutant (SlackR950Q) before and after bath-application of 100 nM TTX upon co-expression with NaV1.6 in HEK293 cells. The results showed that bath-application of TTX significantly reduced the current amplitudes of SlackR950Q at +100 mV by nearly 40% (Author response image 6), suggesting NaV1.6 contributes to the current amplitudes of SlackR950Q. We have included this data in the revised manuscript (see Fig. S10B).</p>
