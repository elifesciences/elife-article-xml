<title>Abstract</title><p>Heat stress can cause cell death by triggering the aggregation of essential proteins. In bacteria, aggregated proteins are rescued by the canonical Hsp70/AAA+ (ClpB) bi-chaperone disaggregase. Man-made, severe stress conditions applied during e.g. food-processing represent a novel threat for bacteria by exceeding the capacity of the Hsp70/ClpB system. Here, we report on the potent autonomous AAA+ disaggregase ClpL from <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> that provides enhanced heat resistance to the food-borne pathogen enabling persistence in adverse environments. ClpL shows increased thermal stability and enhanced disaggregation power compared to Hsp70/ClpB, enabling it to withstand severe heat stress and to solubilize tight aggregates. ClpL binds to protein aggregates via aromatic residues present in its N-terminal domain (NTD) that adopts a partially folded and dynamic conformation. Target specificity is achieved by simultaneous interactions of multiple NTDs with the aggregate surface. ClpL shows remarkable structural plasticity by forming diverse higher assembly states through interacting ClpL rings. NTDs become largely sequestered upon ClpL ring interactions. Stabilizing ring assemblies by engineered disulfide bonds strongly reduces disaggregation activity, suggesting that they represent storage states.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>Lm</italic>) is a food-borne pathogen and the causative agent of listeriosis, a severe human illness that is acquired upon eating contaminated food with a mortality of 20-30 % (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bucur <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). While <italic>Lm</italic> can efficiently persist in food-producing plants it cannot grow at temperatures above 45°C, qualifying heat treatments as efficient possibility to eradicate the pathogen. However, <italic>Lm</italic> strains that show an up to 1000-fold enhanced heat resistance have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lunden <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Environmental and food-related <italic>Lm</italic> strains frequently harbor plasmids that encode for open reading frames providing protection against antibiotics, disinfectants, heavy metals, high salt concentrations, low pH and heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lebrun <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Naditz <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pontinen <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Poyart-Salmeron <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>). Heat resistance at 55°C is provided by the chaperone ClpL, which is encoded on diverse <italic>Lm</italic> plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pontinen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). ClpL presence does not increase the maximum growth temperature of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> but strongly enhances cell survival upon sudden exposure to extreme temperatures. ClpL is also encoded in the core genome of various Gram-positive bacteria including the major pathogens <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. <italic>clpL</italic> gene expression is typically upregulated upon heat shock and <italic>clpL</italic> knockout strains can exhibit increased sensitivity to heat stress suggesting a function of ClpL in cellular proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Suokko <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Suokko <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>ClpL belongs to the AAA+ (<underline>A</underline>TPase <underline>a</underline>ssociated with diverse cellular <underline>a</underline>ctivities) protein family. AAA+ proteins typically form hexameric assemblies and thread substrates through an inner channel under consumption of ATP. This threading activity of AAA+ proteins is linked to unfolding and disassembly of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Puchades <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> ClpL, originating from other Gram-positive bacteria, was shown to exhibit chaperone activity, however, which specific role ClpL plays in bacterial proteostasis remained undefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kwon <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Park <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tao &amp; Biswas, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Severe heat shock triggers massive protein aggregation, titrating crucial components of essential cellular processes including transcription, translation and cell division. Cells are therefore equipped with protein disaggregases that rescue aggregated proteins and protect cells from the deleterious consequences of protein aggregation. In bacteria the AAA+ protein ClpB cooperates with the Hsp70 (DnaK) chaperone to form the canonical and widespread bi-chaperone disaggregation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mogk <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zolkiewski, 1999</xref>). Notably, ClpB does not directly bind to protein aggregates but requires Hsp70 for aggregate targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Winkler <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). The DnaK/ClpB disaggregation activity is well adapted to temperature gradients, which allow for increasing disaggregation capacity through induction of stress responses. Surprisingly, ClpB is equipped with a reduced unfolding power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Haslberger <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), limiting its disaggregation efficiency <italic>in vitro</italic> towards tight aggregates forming at high unfolding temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Katikaridis <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Bacteria face new stress conditions in the industrial world including abrupt temperature jumps applied during e.g. food-processing to reduce the number of bacterial contaminants. Selected Gram-negative bacteria including major pathogens like <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>Pa</italic>) or <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> adapt to these man-made stress regimes by acquiring the autonomous AAA+ ClpG disaggregase, which confers extreme heat resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bojer <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boll <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). <italic>clpG</italic> is encoded on plasmids or mobile genomic islands (tLST: transmissible locus of stress resistance) together with other open reading frames linked to protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kamal <italic>et al</italic>, 2021b</xref>). The tLST cluster can be transferred to other bacteria via horizontal gene transfer. ClpG homologs are not present in Gram-positive bacteria and a disaggregase counterpart sharing mechanistic features has not been described yet. The characteristics of <italic>Lm</italic> ClpL, including its link to superior heat resistance and its presence on conjugative plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pontinen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), show remarkable similarity to ClpG.</p>
<p>Here, we characterize <italic>Lm</italic> ClpL as autonomous and general, robust disaggregase. This defines ClpL as counterpart of ClpG in Gram-positive bacteria. ClpL has higher disaggregation activity as compared to the canonical <italic>Lm</italic> DnaK/ClpB disaggregase by applying enhanced threading forces. Furthermore, ClpL shows increased thermostability compared to <italic>Lm</italic> DnaK, enabling it to withstand more severe heat stress conditions. ClpL achieves aggregate specificity via a unique N-terminal domain (NTD), which features mobile secondary structure elements and interacts with protein aggregates via patches of aromatic residues. The comparison of ClpL and ClpG allows to define mechanistic features shared by stand-alone bacterial disaggregases.</p>

<title><italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> ClpL is an autonomous disaggregase</title>
<p><italic>Lm</italic> ClpL increases heat resistance and is encoded on conjugative plasmids, thus sharing characteristic features with the autonomous, potent disaggregase ClpG from selected Gram-negative bacteria. ClpL also has a similar domain organization as compared to the stand-alone <italic>Pa</italic> ClpG and the Hsp70-dependent ClpB disaggregase, including two AAA domains, a coiled-coil M-domain (MD) and the absence of a ClpP interaction motif, implying a function independent of protein degradation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 1). We therefore asked whether ClpL represents a stand-alone disaggregase, functioning as counterpart of ClpG in Gram-positive bacteria. ClpL showed substantial disaggregation activity towards heat-aggregated Luciferase that was 0.67-fold reduced as compared to ClpG, but 3.1-fold higher as compared to the <italic>Lm</italic> Hsp70 (KJE)-ClpB bi-chaperone disaggregase, which we included as references (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Addition of <italic>Lm</italic> KJE to ClpL increased the reactivation of aggregated Luciferase 1.7-fold, however, it did hardly enhance ClpL disaggregation activity when monitored directly by turbidity measurements (Figure 1 –figure supplement 2A/B). This argues against a direct cooperation of <italic>Lm</italic> ClpL and KJE in disaggregation and points to a role of <italic>Lm</italic> KJE in supporting refolding of disaggregated Luciferase.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next tested whether ClpL acts as a general, robust disaggregase by monitoring disaggregation of other heat aggregated model substrates: GFP, α-Glucosidase and Malate Dehydrogenase (MDH). ClpL always showed high disaggregation activity that was similar to <italic>Pa</italic> ClpG and vastly superior to <italic>Lm</italic> KJE/ClpB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Figure 1 – figure supplement 2C/D). Combining ClpL with <italic>Lm</italic> KJE always led to a strong reduction in disaggregation activity, which can be explained by competition for protein aggregate binding, as observed for ClpG before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). We also compared <italic>Lm</italic> ClpL disaggregation activity with the <italic>E. coli</italic> (<italic>Ec</italic>) KJE/ClpB system, documenting similar (Luciferase, MDH) or approx. 2.5-fold enhanced (GFP, α-Glucosidase) activities (Figure 1 – figure supplement 2E). Addition of <italic>Ec</italic> KJE to ClpL reduced or abrogated protein disaggregation, again indicating competition for aggregate binding.</p>
<p>We next asked whether ClpL from other Gram-positive bacteria also exhibits high disaggregation activity. We selected <italic>Lactobacillus gasseri</italic> (<italic>Lg</italic>) ClpL, as this bacterium does not encode for the canonical disaggregase ClpB and <italic>ΔclpL</italic> cells exhibit a loss of heat resistance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Suokko <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). <italic>Lg</italic> ClpL exhibited high disaggregation activity towards aggregated Luciferase and MDH that was similar to <italic>Lm</italic> ClpL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). This explains why <italic>Lg ΔclpL</italic> cells are heat-sensitive, as they lost the central disaggregase.</p>
<p>Together our findings establish ClpL as potent, autonomous disaggregase, whose disaggregation activity is comparable to ClpG. Our findings are different from former, initial analyses on ClpL from <italic>Strepotoccus sp</italic> reporting on either no (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tao &amp; Biswas, 2013</xref>) or low disaggregation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Park <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>) towards single model substrates tested.</p>

<title>Specific features distinguish ClpL from the KJE/ClpB disaggregase</title>
<p><italic>Lm</italic> ClpL exhibits superior disaggregation activity as compared to <italic>Lm</italic> KJE/ClpB. We speculated that ClpL applies a higher threading power, enabling it to process tight protein aggregates, which are largely resistant to KJE/ClpB activity. We made use of the fusion construct Luciferase-YFP, which forms mixed aggregates at 46°C that consist of unfolded Luciferase and native YFP moieties (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Threading power can be assessed by monitoring YFP fluorescence during the disaggregation process. <italic>Ec</italic> KJE/ClpB and <italic>Lm</italic> KJE/ClpB did not unfold YFP during the disaggregation process, documenting limited unfolding power, consistent with former reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Haslberger <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Katikaridis <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). In contrast, we observed a rapid loss of YFP fluorescence in presence of ClpL that was even faster as compared to ClpG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We conclude that stand-alone disaggregases ClpL and ClpG but not the canonical KJE/ClpB disaggregase exhibit robust threading activities that allow for unfolding of tightly folded domains.</p>

<p>ClpL strongly enhances survival of <italic>Lm</italic> cells at 55°C, a temperature that is far beyond the maximum growth temperature (45°C) of <italic>Lm</italic> cells. We speculated that these high temperatures inactivate KJE/ClpB activity by thermal unfolding of one of the chaperones involved. We therefore determined the thermal stabilities of ClpL and the central components DnaK and ClpB of the bi-chaperone disaggregase by monitoring protein unfolding during temperature increase via SYPRO®Orange binding and nanoDSF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>/D). <italic>Lm</italic> ClpL and ClpB exhibited comparable melting temperatures of 60°C-63°C, while the thermal stability of <italic>Lm</italic> DnaK was much lower (T<sub>M</sub>: 47°C-50°C) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>/D). We infer that incubation at 55°C will cause unfolding of <italic>Lm</italic> DnaK, thereby abrogating KJE/ClpB disaggregation activity. The higher thermal stability of ClpL will provide disaggregation power to <italic>Lm</italic> cells at 55°C, explaining its strong protective effect on bacterial survival.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>The N-terminal domain of ClpL mediates aggregate targeting</title>
<p>We explored the mechanistic basis of ClpL disaggregation activity. We first tested for roles of its AAA1/2 domains by mutating glutamate residues of the Walker B motifs (E197A, E520A), crucial for ATP hydrolysis, and aromatic pore loop residues (Y170A, Y504A), involved in substrate threading (Figure 3 – figure supplement 1A). ClpL wild-type (WT) exhibits high, concentration-independent ATPase activity (90.1 ± 26.1 ATP/min/monomer) (Figure 3 – figure supplement 1B). ATPase activities of pore loop mutants were similar to WT, while they were strongly reduced in Walker B mutants (Figure 3 – figure supplement 1C). A ClpL pore-1 loop mutant (Y170A) retained partial disaggregation activity, while blocking ATP hydrolysis in one AAA domain (E197A, E520A) or mutating the pore-2 site (Y504A) abrogated disaggregation (Figure 3 – figure supplement 1D). These findings are similar to phenotypes of corresponding ClpB and ClpG mutants and underline that two functional AAA domains and an intact pore-2 site are crucial for disaggregation activity.</p>
<p>We next turned our interest to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of ClpL, which is distinct from the NTDs of ClpG and ClpB (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1). NTDs are connected via flexible linkers to the AAA ring structure and typically mediate substrate or partner specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kirstein <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). We deleted the NTD (ΔN: ΔA2-N61)) of ClpL and observed a total loss of disaggregation activity towards Luciferase and MDH aggregates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). ATPase activity of ΔN-ClpL was hardly affected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), excluding basic structural defects as reason for disaggregation activity loss. To explore the role of the NTD for disaggregation activity in an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, we expressed ClpL and ΔN-ClpL in <italic>E. coli ΔclpB</italic> cells and monitored the recovery of aggregated Luciferase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Expression of <italic>clpL</italic> but not <italic>ΔN-clpL</italic> allowed for regain of Luciferase activity (16.5 % (WT) vs 1.6 % (ΔN-ClpL) after 120 min at 30°C). ClpL disaggregation activity was lower than <italic>Pa</italic> ClpG activity but higher than <italic>Ec</italic> ClpB activity, which served as references. Expression of <italic>clpL,</italic> but not <italic>ΔN-clpL,</italic> also restored thermotolerance in <italic>E. coli ΔclpB</italic> and <italic>dnaK103</italic> mutant cells, lacking a functional DnaK chaperone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, Figure 1 – figure supplement 2A). Expression levels of disaggregases in <italic>ΔclpB</italic> and <italic>dnaK103</italic> were comparable (Figure 1 – figure supplement 2B/C). These data underline the robust, autonomous disaggregation activity of ClpL and document the essential role of its NTD.</p>

<p>This role of the NTD in aggregate targeting can explain the defect of ΔN-ClpL in protein disaggregation. To directly demonstrate this function, we fused the ClpL NTD to ΔN-ClpB-K476C (ΔN-ClpB*) generating L<sub>N</sub>-ClpB* (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The K476C mutation is located in the ClpB MD, abrogating ClpB repression and allowing for high ATPase activity in the absence of DnaK. L<sub>N</sub>-ClpB* exhibited high disaggregation activity, whereas ClpB* and ΔN-ClpB* relied on the presence of the cooperating DnaK (KJE) system (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). Thus, fusion of ClpL NTD converts ClpB into a stand-alone disaggregase bypassing the need of DnaK for aggregate targeting.</p>

<title>Molecular principle of aggregate recognition by ClpL</title>
<p>To understand how the ClpL NTD selectively interacts with protein aggregates we predicted its structure with AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mirdita <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) and validated this model by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). AlphaFold2 predicts a conformation of two α-helices (α1, α2) and a short anti-parallel β-sheet, while N– and C-terminal regions are disordered (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The β-sheet forms a small hydrophobic core with α2, which in turn is predicted to interact with α1, forming a second small core structure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The latter hydrophobic core is formed mostly by π-stacking interactions of four aromatic residues (F19, F23, Y36 and F48, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and the side chain methyl group of A34. The C-terminal hydrophobic core is formed by residues Y36, V38, L43, F48, Y51 and L57. Thus, Y36 and F48 would take part in the formation of both hydrophobic cores. The <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC NMR spectrum of the NTD shows several well-dispersed resonances, indicative of a folded domain (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1A). NMR secondary chemical shifts based on Cα and Cβ backbone resonance assignments confirm the formation of α2 and the β-sheet and thus validate partly the structure prediction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). However, although a certain helical propensity can be confirmed from secondary chemical shifts for α1, the formation seems rather transient compared to α2. While NOEs between relevant residues confirm the existence of the C-terminal hydrophobic core (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1B/C), long-range NOEs, expected to arise based on the predicted tertiary interactions between α1 and α2 are entirely missing and only intra-residue or sequential NOEs are visible (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1B, D). This indicates that the ClpL NTD forms one predicted folded core structure but that α1 forms only transiently and does not interact with α2. To further confirm this, we acquired <sup>15</sup>N spin relaxation data to measure residue-wise dynamics in the ps-ns time scale (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1E). Longitudinal (<italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>) and transverse (<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>) relaxation rates and heteronuclear NOE data clearly show that the N-terminal region up to residue A34 is more flexible than the hydrophobic core formed by α2 and the β-sheet. The overall low heteronuclear NOE values, rarely above 0.6 also indicate that the secondary structure elements (α1 vs. α2/β-sheet) are mobile with respect to each other in the ps-ns time scale. These observations are consistent with pLDDTs that are generally &lt;70 and partially &lt;50 in AlphaFold2 predictions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, the NTD is highly mobile and formed by a hydrophobic core between secondary structure elements α2 (D46-T54) and the β-sheet formed by residues R35-V38 and Q41-T44. The α-helix 1 forms only transiently and is mobile, i.e. does not interact with α2, thereby making several aromatic residues available for substrate binding.</p>

<p>Sequence analysis of multiple ClpL NTDs revealed a strongly increased frequency of asparagine (N) and glutamine (Q) residues, while aliphatic residues were less abundant compared to their average occurrence in bacterial proteomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). These sequence features can explain the lack of a stable compact NTD structure. We also noticed an increased frequency of phenylalanine residues. We found aromatic and N/Q residues are frequently located together in patches (A-E), which are all located outside the small α2/β-sheet core (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). To explore the role of those patches and of the high aromatic and N/Q content for substrate binding and protein disaggregation activity, we replaced aromatic and N/Q residues of individual patches with alanines (e.g. patch A: 3NFY5 to 3AAA5). Alternatively, we mutated all aromatic or all N/Q residues present in patches A-E to alanines (all Aro/Ala, all NQ/Ala). All ClpL NTD mutants showed high ATPase activities, excluding severe assembly defects or direct effects on ATP hydrolysis (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2A). We only observed a 3.6-fold reduced ATPase activity for the “all Aro/Ala” construct at low protein concentrations (0.125 μM). At the concentration used in the disaggregation assay (1 μM), no differences to ClpL WT were determined (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2A).</p>
<p>All NTD mutants were tested for disaggregation activity towards aggregated Luciferase and MDH (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Replacement of aromatic residues (all Aro/Ala) abrogated disaggregation while mutating all N/Q residues had no effect ((Figure 4 – figure supplement 2A). Patch A and C mutants exhibited reduced (Luciferase) or lost (MDH) disaggregation activities. The loss of disaggregation activity of selected NTD mutants (ΔN, all Aro/Ala) could be linked to a deficiency in binding aggregated Luciferase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating a crucial role of aromatic residues in aggregate recognition. In an additional set of experiments we combined alternative patch A-C mutants, in which only the aromatic residues were mutated and generated single point mutations of aromatic residues being part of the α2/β-sheet core (Y36A, F48A, Y51A) ((Figure 4 – figure supplement 2B). All patch combinations showed aggravated disaggregation activities as compared to single patch mutants. Furthermore, disaggregation activity of ClpL-Y51A but not Y36A and F48 was severely affected (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2B/C). None of these mutants were affected in ATP hydrolysis ((Figure 4 – figure supplement 2D).</p>
<p>We finally recapitulated the effect of key NTD mutations in the L<sub>N</sub>-ClpB* fusion construct. We confirmed the crucial function of aromatic residues in patches A – C, yet the Y51A did not exhibit the same severe phenotype as observed for ClpL, suggesting a context-specific role ((Figure 4 – figure supplement 2E/F). Defects in protein disaggregation were again linked to defects in aggregate binding, whereas ATPase activities of all mutants tested were similar to the LN-ClpB* reference (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2G/H). Together these findings indicate an important role of aromatic residues in the flexible N-terminal region of ClpL for disaggregation activity. Our data suggest that the total number of aromatic residues but also their particular identity represent crucial parameters for substrate binding.</p>
<p>We next determined how many NTDs must be present in a ClpL ring to achieve high disaggregation activity. We speculated that ClpL might utilize multiple NTDs to simultaneously contact various binding sites present in close vicinity on an aggregate surface. Such recognition principle would specifically target ClpL to an aggregate while preventing ClpL action on soluble, non-native polypeptides (e.g. nascent polypeptide chains). We performed mixing experiments using L<sub>N</sub>-ClpB* and ΔN-ClpB* as model system, since ClpB hexamers dynamically exchange subunits ensuring stochastic formation of mixed hexamers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>/B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Haslberger <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Werbeck <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). We confirmed mixing of WT and mutant subunits by showing that the presence of ATPase deficient ΔN-ClpB*-E218A/ E618A, harboring mutated Walker B motifs in both AAA domains, strongly poisoned disaggregation activity of L<sub>N</sub>-ClpB* (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1A). Similarly, presence of an excess of ΔN-ClpB* inhibited L<sub>N</sub>-ClpB* (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1B). We determined the disaggregation activities of mixed L<sub>N</sub>-ClpB*/ΔN-ClpB* hexamers formed at diverse mixing ratios. The determined activities were compared to those derived from a theoretical model assuming that a mixed hexamer only displays activity if it contains a certain number of L<sub>N</sub>-ClpB* subunits (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, Figure 5 – figure supplement 1C-E). This comparison revealed that approx. four to five ClpL NTDs domains must be present in a hexamer to confer high disaggregation activity. In a reciprocal approach we tested whether an isolated NTD can inhibit L<sub>N</sub>-ClpB* or ClpL disaggregation activity by competing for aggregate binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>/D). Addition of up to a 50-fold excess of ClpL NTD did not reduce disaggregation activities. This suggests a vast increase in binding affinities of AAA+ rings harboring multiple ClpL NTDs to protein aggregates and explains efficient outcompetition of isolated NTD by hexamers.</p>

<title>Functional relevance of diverse ClpL assembly states</title>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> ClpL has been recently described as tetradecameric species, which forms by interaction of two heptameric rings via head-to-head interactions of coiled-coil MDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). This assembly state is suggested to represent the active species of ClpL, however, it will render the NTDs largely inaccessible for aggregate binding. We therefore monitored <italic>Lm</italic> ClpL oligomerization by SEC and negative staining EM. ClpL eluted prior to ClpB in SEC runs, indicating the formation of assemblies larger than hexamers (Figure 6 – figure supplement 1A). EM analysis revealed that ATPγS-bound ClpL adopts diverse assembly states including single hexameric and heptameric rings, dimers of rings and a tetrahedral structure formed by four ClpL rings (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). A tetrahedral structure is also formed by the bacterial AAA+ member ClpC upon binding of activating compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maurer <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Morreale <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). The structural plasticity of ClpL is therefore much larger than originally anticipated. Dimers and tetramers of ClpL rings form by MD-MD interactions as ClpL-ΔM (ΔD330-Q376) or MD mutants (E352A, F354A) (Figure 6 – figure supplement 1B) only form single hexameric and heptameric rings and accordingly eluted much later in SEC runs as compared to ClpL-WT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, Figure 6 – figure supplement 1A/C). Notably, ΔN-ClpL only forms dimers of rings, suggesting that NTD presence destabilizes this assembly state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, Figure 6 – figure supplement 1C). An increased rigidity of ΔN-ClpL is also supported by a higher T<sub>M</sub>-value as compared to ClpL-WT and ClpL-ΔM (Figure 6 – figure supplement 1D). EM analysis of selected NTD point mutants revealed minor changes in the fractions of individual structural states as compared to ClpL-WT but did not resemble ΔN-ClpL (Figure 6 – figure supplement 1E), suggesting that the mere presence of the NTD destabilizes a dimer of rings through steric clashes.</p>

<p>Disaggregation activities of ClpL MD mutants were either similar to WT (E352A) or partially reduced (F354A) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>/E). ClpL-F354A also exhibited a reduced ATPase activity, particularly at low protein concentrations (Figure 6 – figure supplement 1F). <italic>Lg</italic> ClpL, which is highly active in disaggregation assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), forms hexamers as most abundant structural state (69 %) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). We infer that single ClpL rings represent functional disaggregases, questioning a specific role of ring dimers in protein disaggregation. Our data also imply that ClpL activity is not restricted to a heptameric state as suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To study the role of dimers of rings in protein disaggregation, we generated the MD mutant ClpL-T355C, which allowed for disulfide bond formation between interacting MDs under oxidizing conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). This enabled us to probe for the consequences of stabilizing ClpL ring dimers through covalent linkages on disaggregation activity. T355C purified under reducing conditions (+ DTT) exhibited slightly reduced disaggregation and ATPase activities as compared to ClpL-WT (Figure 6 – figure supplement 2A/B). Disulfide bond formation and breakage upon removal and re-addition of DTT was verified by SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>) and formation of ring dimers was confirmed by EM (Figure 6 – figure supplement 2C). Luciferase disaggregation activities of ClpL-WT and ClpL-T355C were assessed in absence and presence of DTT. The assay was in general sensitive to the presence of DTT, leading to an overall increase of Luciferase reactivation by 2.7-fold for ClpL-WT, likely due to the fact that Firely Luciferase itself possesses multiple cysteines. Importantly, we observed a much stronger activity gain of ClpL-T355C under reducing conditions as compared to ClpL-WT (2.8 ± 0.4-fold vs 6.6 ± 1.3-fold, respectively) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Re-addition of DTT strongly increased ClpL-T355C disaggregation activity, which was now similar to ClpL-WT. In an alternative approach, we monitored the unfolding activities of oxidized and reduced ClpL-WT and ClpL-T355C towards mixed Luciferase-YFP aggregates (Figure 6 – figure supplement 2D). Here, we followed the loss of YFP fluorescence as readout for disaggregation activity as we assumed that the unfolding reaction is more independent on DTT. Indeed, the activity of oxidized WT remained largely unaffected (1.4 ± 0.5-fold increase in activity with DTT). In striking contrast, ClpC-T355C showed massive loss in disaggregation activity in absence of DTT but became fully active upon DTT re-addition (18.2 ± 7.4-fold increase in activity with DTT). We infer that stabilizing ClpL ring dimers through covalent linkage strongly reduces disaggregation activity.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the presented work we describe the bacterial AAA+ member ClpL as potent and partner-independent disaggregase that confers enhanced heat resistance to <italic>Lm</italic>. The presence of ClpL on transmissible plasmids in <italic>Lm</italic> poses a severe risk on food safety as it substantially increases the survival rate of the pathogen in adverse environments like food processing plants. It also explains the high prevalence of the <italic>clpL</italic> gene in <italic>Listeria</italic> species isolated from ready-to-eat foods and dairy products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Parra-Flores <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ramadan <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>ClpL shares various features with the recently described stand-alone ClpG disaggregase, which is linked to superior thermotolerance in selected Gram-negative bacteria, qualifying ClpL as ClpG counterpart in Gram-positive species. Our analysis of ClpL and previous findings on ClpG allow to define five features shared by both novel disaggregases.</p>
<p>First, ClpL and ClpG exhibit a higher threading power as compared to the canonical ClpB disaggregase. ClpB unfolding power is repressed by intersubunit interactions of its long coiled-coil MDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Deville <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). The shortened lengths of ClpL and ClpG MDs explain why this inhibitory mechanism is not operative in the novel disaggregases. Increasing ClpB threading activity by MD mutations is linked to severe cellular toxicity, rationalizing ClpB limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lipinska <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Oguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). The increased unfolding power of ClpL/ClpG is linked to higher disaggregation activities as shown for various aggregated model proteins in this work. We suggest that an enhanced threading activity will become particularly important upon extreme heat shock, which causes more complete unfolding of proteins. This will increase the number of interactions between proteins trapped inside an aggregate, thus demanding for an enhanced threading force for efficient disaggregation.</p>
<p>Second, ClpL and ClpG are more thermostable as compared to the DnaK/ClpB bi-chaperone disaggregase present in corresponding bacterial species. The T<sub>M</sub> value (46-50°C) of <italic>Lm</italic> DnaK might represent a limiting factor for <italic>Lm</italic> survival at temperatures above 46°C as loss of DnaK by thermal unfolding will abrogate DnaK/ClpB disaggregation activity. This will leave <italic>Lm</italic> cells unprotected against severe heat stress unless they harbour plasmid-encoded ClpL, which resists unfolding up to 60°C. Notably, unfolding of DnaK at high temperatures will abrogate the observed competition between DnaK and ClpL for aggregate binding, enabling for undisturbed activity of the more powerful disaggregase. Similarly, <italic>Ec</italic> ClpG is more heat stable than <italic>Ec</italic> DnaK (T<sub>M</sub> values of 69°C and 59°C, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kamal <italic>et al</italic>, 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Palleros <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>) and dramatically increases cell survival at 65°C. We infer that increased heat resistance provided by novel disaggregases is reflected in their enhanced thermostability.</p>
<p>Third, distinct NTDs enable novel disaggregases to directly bind to protein aggregates, making them independent of partner proteins. ClpL and ClpG NTDs do neither exhibit sequence nor structural homology, however, both use hydrophobic or aromatic residues for aggregate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Katikaridis <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). The ClpL NTD only adopts a partially stable core structure with regions featuring aromatic residues being mobile and accessible, suggesting that it represents a sticky tentacle that interacts via aromatic residues with hydrophobic patches present on an aggregate surface. This binding mode is reminiscent to small heat shock proteins, which interact via disordered NTDs enriched in aromatic residues with substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kriehuber <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shrivastava <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Both, ClpL and ClpG, require simultaneous binding of multiple NTDs to protein aggregates for high disaggregation activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Katikaridis <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), indicating that they increase binding affinity through avidity effects. This principle provides substrate specificity while sparing non-aggregated protein species from potentially harmful threading and unfolding activities.</p>
<p>Forth, novel disaggregases do not cooperate with the peptidase ClpP as they lack the specific IGL/F signature motif. This feature is shared with the canonical ClpB disaggregase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Weibezahn <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and ensures that protein disaggregation is primarily linked to protein refolding. This also underlines that it is the loss of essential proteins upon heat-induced aggregation that represents the major limiting factor for bacterial viability.</p>
<p>Fifth, novel disaggregases are typically encoded on transmissible plasmids or mobile genomic islands. ClpL present in other Gram-positive bacteria is either encoded on plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>) or is part of the core genome and can be flanked by inverted repeat sequences and truncated transposase genes, suggesting acquisition via horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Suokko <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Notably, prolonged cultivation at high temperatures can lead to mobilization of chromosomal-encoded <italic>clpL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Suokko <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). We infer that novel disaggregases can be acquired by horizontal gene transfer, leading to spreading of bacterial resistance towards severe heat stress in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.</p>
<p><italic>Lm</italic> ClpL displays remarkable structural plasticity by forming hexameric and heptameric rings that can interact via MDs forming higher assembly states. This confirms and expands a former report on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> ClpL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). ClpL MD mutants, which only form single hexameric rings remain functional disaggregases and, similarly, the disaggregase <italic>Lg</italic> ClpL mostly forms single hexamers. This suggests that single rings of ClpL represent the active species. The aggregate-targeting NTDs will be obstructed in dimers and tetramers of rings precluding ClpL binding to an aggregated protein. Accordingly, stabilizing ring dimers via covalent linkage leads to a loss of ClpL disaggregation activity. The finding that ClpL-ΔN exclusively forms dimers of rings implies that NTDs destabilize such structural state and increase ring dynamics, ensuring their accessibility.</p>
<p>The formation of ring dimers is also observed for other AAA+ family members and their functional roles are currently actively discussed. p97 double rings form by ATPase ring interactions and are suggested to represent a potentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gao <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Dodecamers of the bacterial AAA+ protease Lon regulate substrate selectivity and mostly exhibit reduced proteolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vieux <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). The role of ring dimers of the human mitochondrial disaggregase Skd3 in protein disaggregation is controversial and both, higher and lower disaggregation activity has been associated with this state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cupo <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gupta <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Spaulding <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). The mechanistic role of ClpL ring assemblies remains to be explored. We speculate that they might represent storage states, reducing ClpL activity by shielding NTDs. Studying the dynamics and regulations of ClpL ring interactions will become crucial for understanding ClpL activity control.</p>

<p>All proteins were purified using Ni-IDA (Macherey-Nagel) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. In short, cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A1 (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (8 μg/mL Pepstatin A, 10 μg/mL Aprotinin, 5μg/mL Leupeptin,) and DnaseI (5 μg/mL). For ClpL purifications a higher salt concentration was used in buffer A1* (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 8.0, 1 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol), to reduce co-purification of partially cleaved monomers in assembled oligomers. After cell lysis using a French press the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 17000 g for 1 h at 4 °C and the cleared lysate was incubated with Protino IDA resin (Macherey-Nagel) for 20 min at 4° C. Afterwards the resin was transferred into a plastic column and washed with at least 5 CV buffer A1, or in the case of ClpL, washed with at least 5 CV buffer A1* and then 5 CV buffer A1. His-tagged proteins were eluted by addition of buffer A1 supplemented with 250 mM Imidazole.

<p>Except for DnaJ and the ClpL all NQ/Ala mutant all proteins were further purified via size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Prior to that SUMO-tagged proteins were incubated with Ulp1 for 1 h at room temperature to cleave off the His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO tag.

<title>Disulfide crosslinking</title>
<p>For the purification of disulfide-bond stabilized ClpL T355C-tetradecamers (and ClpL WT controls), 5 mM β-Mercapoethanol (β-Me) was present in all steps up to the SEC, to prevent unspecific disulfide-bond formation. 2 mM ATP was added during the elution step from the Ni-IDA resin and into the SEC running buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 % Glycerole) to allow for efficient and correct ring assembly. No reducing agent was added during any of the later steps, while remaining β-Μe was removed during the SEC. The samples were processed immediately and freeze/thaw steps of the reducing agent-free samples were avoided. Addition of oxidizing compounds (e.g. Cu<sup>2+</sup>-Phenanthrolin) only slightly enhanced disulfide bond formation but also led to damage of ClpL-WT and was therefore avoided. The efficiency of the crosslinking was determined via SDS-PAGE, by comparing the ratio between ClpL dimers and monomers, whereas the overall quality of the assembly was assessed via negative stain EM. ClpL T355C samples that showed a crosslinking efficiency of approx. 75 % or higher were analyzed in two activity assays, with and without prior incubation of the chaperone with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at room temperature. (I) First, in a variant of the Luciferase Refolding assay, in which the assay buffer included 5 µM β-Me instead of 2 mM DTT, increasing Luciferase refolding without breaking disulfide-bonds.

<p><sup>15</sup>N spin relaxation parameters <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, and heteronuclear NOEs were recorded on the 600 MHz Avance III spectrometer at 298 K. For <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> experiments, relaxation delays of 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 700 and 1000 were used, where the 50, 500 and 700 ms delay were acquired in duplicates to estimate peak volume uncertainties. For <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> experiments, relaxation delays of 16, 32, 64, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224 and 256 ms were used, where the 16 and 64 ms delays were acquired in duplicates to estimate peak volume uncertainties. For <sup>15</sup>N spin relaxation data analysis (peak volume, exponential fitting and calculation of relaxation rates) the program PINT was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahlner <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Niklasson <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Structural analysis of ClpL NTD. (A) <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-HSQC of ClpL NTD with resonance assignment labeled at each peak. Several residues exhibit dispersed peak position, indicative of folding. (B) <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>1</sup>H-2D NOESY in D<sub>2</sub>O of ClpL NTD confirming NOEs between aromatic ring protons of the hydrophobic core formed by α2 and the β-sheet. NOEs of the second predicted core between α1 and α2 are absent, indicating that there is no interaction between α1 and α2. (C) Selected strips of the <sup>13</sup>C-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC to illustrate that the predicted hydrophobic core between α2 and the β-sheet is present. Multiple cross-peaks (NOEs) are present between relevant residues (Y36, V38, L43, F48, Y51). (D) Selected strips of the <sup>13</sup>C-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC illustrating the absence of NOEs expected to between residues of the second hydrophobic core between α1 and α2. For these residues (F19, F23, A34, Y36) only intra-residue or sequential NOEs are visible (except for Y36, which has NOEs to residues of the first hydrophobic core). Thus, despite transient formation of the α1-helix, there is no or only transient interactions between α1 and α2. (E) <sup>15</sup>N spin relaxation data of ClpL NTD. Top: Longitudinal relaxation rates, middle: transverse relaxation rates, bottom: Heteronuclear NOEs. All three measurements show that the N-terminal region up to residue R35 is highly flexible, whereas the region of the hydrophobic core between α2 and the β-sheet higher heteronuclear NOE values and longer transverse relaxation rates indicating a higher degree of order. The altogether low heteronuclear NOE values, rarely above 0.6 indicate that the secondary structure elements (α1 vs. α2/β-sheet) are mobile with respect to each other in the ps-ns time scale. (F) Sequence alignment of ClpL NTDs. Similar and identical residues are highlighted in light and dark blue. The positions of secondary structural elements and of patches (A-E) composed of Y, F, N and Q residues are indicated.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> manuscript details the characterization of ClpL from L. monocytogenes as an effective and autonomous AAA+ disaggregase that provides enhanced heat resistance to this food-borne pathogen. The authors <bold>convincingly</bold> demonstrate that ClpL has DnaK-independent disaggregase activity towards a variety of aggregated model substrates, which is more potent than that observed with the endogenous canonical DnaK/ClpB bi-chaperone system. The work will be of broad interest to microbiologists and biochemists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This work describes the mechanism of protein disaggregation by the ClpL AAA+ protein of Listeria monocytogenes. Using several model subtrate proteins the authors first show that ClpL possesses a robust disaggregase activity that does not further require the endogenous DnaK chaperone in vitro. In addition, they found that ClpL is more thermostable than the endogenous L. monocytogenes DnaK and has the capacity to unfold tightly folded protein domains. The mechanistic basis for the robust disaggregase activity of ClpL was also dissected in vitro and in some cases, supported by in vivo data performed in chaperone-deficient E. coli strains. The data presented show that the two AAA domains, the pore-2 site and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of ClpL are critical for its disaggregase activity. Remarkably, grafting the NTD of ClpL to ClpB converted ClpB into an autonomous disaggregase, highlighting the importance of such a domain in the DnaK-independent disaggregation of proteins. The role of the ClpL NTD domain was further dissected, identifying key residues and positions necessary for aggregate recognition and disaggregation. Finally, using sets of SEC and negative staining EM experiments combined with conditional covalent linkages and disaggregation assays the authors found that ClpL shows significant structural plasticity, forming dynamic hexameric and heptameric active single rings that can further form higher assembly states via their middle domains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript is well-written and the experimental work is well executed. It contains a robust and complete set of in vitro data that push further our knowledge of such important disaggregases. It shows the importance of the atypical ClpL N-terminal domain in the disaggregation process as well as the structural malleability of such AAA+ proteins. More generally, this work expands our knowledge of heat resistance in bacterial pathogens.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There is no specific weakness in this work, although it would have helped to have a drawing model showing how ClpL performs protein disaggregation based on their new findings. The function of the higher assembly states of ClpL remains unresolved and will need further extensive research. Similarly, it will be interesting in the future to see whether the sole function of the plasmid-encoded ClpL is to cope with general protein aggregates under heat stress.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Bohl et al. is an interesting and carefully done study on the biochemical properties and mode of action of potent autonomous AAA+ disaggregase ClpL from Listeria monocytogenes. ClpL is encoded on plasmids. It shows high thermal stability and provides Listeria monocytogenes food-pathogen substantial increase in resistance to heat. The authors show that ClpL interacts with aggregated proteins through the aromatic residues present in its N-terminal domain and subsequently unfolds proteins from aggregates translocating polypeptide chains through the central pore in its oligomeric ring structure. The structure of ClpL oligomers was also investigated in the manuscript. The results suggest that mono-ring structure and not dimer or trimer of rings, observed in addition to mono-ring structures under EM, is an active species of disaggregase.</p>
<p>Presented experiments are conclusive and well-controlled. Several mutants were created to analyze the importance of a particular ClpL domain.</p>
<p>The study's strength lies in the direct comparison of ClpL biochemical properties with autonomous ClpG disaggregase present in selected Gram-negative bacteria and well-studied E. coli system consisting of ClpB disaggregase and DnaK and its cochaperones. This puts the obtained results in a broader context.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript details the characterization of ClpL from L. monocytogenes as a potent and autonomous AAA+ disaggregase. The authors demonstrate that ClpL has potent and DnaK-independent disaggregase activity towards a variety of aggregated model substrates and that this disaggregase activity appears to be greater than that observed with the canonical DnaK/ClpB co-chaperone. Furthermore, Lm ClpL appears to have greater thermostability as compared to Lm DnaK, suggesting that ClpL-expressing cells may be able to withstand more severe heat stress conditions. Interestingly, Lm ClpP can provide thermotolerance to E. coli that have been genetically depleted of either ClpB or in cells expressing a mutant DnaK103. The authors further characterized the mechanisms by which ClpL interacts with protein aggregates, identifying that the N-terminal domain of ClpL is essential for disaggregase function. Lastly, by EM and mutagenesis analysis, the authors report that ClpL can exist in a variety of larger macromolecular complexes, including dimer or trimers of hexamers/heptamers, and they provide evidence that the N-terminal domains of ClpL prevent dimer ring formation, thus promoting an active and substrate-binding ClpL complex. Throughout this manuscript the authors compare Lm ClpL to ClpG, another potent and autonomous disaggregase found in gram-negative bacteria that have been reported on previously, demonstrating that these two enzymes share homologous activity and qualities. Taken together this report clearly establishes ClpL as a novel and autonomous disaggregase.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The work presented in this report amounts to a significant body of novel and significant work that will be of interest to the protein chaperone community. Furthermore, by providing examples of how ClpL can provide in vivo thermotolerance to both E. coli and L. gasseri the authors have expanded the significance of this work and provided novel insight into potential mechanisms responsible for thermotolerance in food-borne pathogens.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The figures are clearly depicted and easy to understand, though some of the axis labeling is a bit misleading or confusing and may warrant revision. While I do feel that the results and discussion as presented support the authors' hypothesis and overall goal of demonstrating ClpL as a novel disaggregase, interpretation of the data is hindered as no statistical tests are provided throughout the manuscript. Because of this only qualitative analysis can be made, and as such many of the concluding statements involving pairwise comparisons need to be revisited or quantitative data with stats needs to be provided. The addition of statistical analysis is critical and should not be difficult, nor do I anticipate that it will change the conclusions of this report.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation. We agree with the reviewer that it will be important to test whether ClpL can bind to and process non-aggregated protein substrates. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the disaggregation activity of ClpL is most relevant in vivo, pointing to protein aggregates as main target.</p>
<p>We also agree that the role of dimers or tetramers of ClpL rings needs to be further explored. Our initial analysis suggests a function of ring dimers as a resting state. It will now be important to study the dynamics of ClpL assembly formation and test whether substrate presence shifts ClpL assemblies towards an active, single ring state.</p>
