<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The expression of eukaryotic genes relies on the precise 3’-terminal cleavage and polyadenylation of newly synthesized pre-mRNA transcripts. Defects in these processes have been associated with various diseases, including cancer. While cancer-focused sequencing studies have identified numerous driver mutations in protein-coding sequences, noncoding drivers – particularly those affecting the cis-elements required for pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation – have received less attention. Here, we systematically analysed cancer somatic mutations affecting 3’UTR polyadenylation signals using the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) dataset. We found a striking enrichment of cancer-specific somatic mutations that disrupt strong and evolutionarily conserved cleavage and polyadenylation signals within tumour suppressor genes. Further bioinformatics and experimental analyses conducted as a part of our study suggest that these mutations have a profound capacity to downregulate the expression of tumour suppressor genes. Thus, this work uncovers a novel class of noncoding somatic mutations with significant potential to drive cancer progression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most eukaryotic mRNAs are modified by the addition of a 5’-terminal 7-methylguanosine cap, splicing of intronic sequences, and 3’-terminal cleavage and polyadenylation. The cleavage and polyadenylation reactions are tightly coupled with transcription termination and the release of newly synthesized transcripts from RNA polymerase II. Therefore, precise cleavage and polyadenylation are critical for the production of mature mRNAs. Mechanistically, these reactions require a co-transcriptional assembly of a multisubunit protein complex at the corresponding cis-regulatory sequences near the pre-mRNA cleavage site (CS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. A key cis-element guiding the assembly of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery is the polyadenylation signal (PAS). The most common PAS sequences in mammals are AATAAA and ATTAAA hexamers, although their single nucleotide-substituted variants may function in some cases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Earlier studies have emphasized the importance of pre-mRNA cleavage/polyadenylation in the context of human diseases. For example, alternative cleavage/polyadenylation has been proposed to modulate the expression of oncogenes and tumour suppressors in different types of cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Germline mutations affecting polyadenylation signals can play a role in genetic disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and increase cancer susceptibility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Notably, although the role of somatic mutations affecting polyadenylation signals has been investigated for individual genes in a limited number of tumour samples <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, a systematic characterization of the role of this type of mutations in cancer has not been carried out.</p>
<p>Large-scale genome sequencing studies have identified numerous cancer driver and driver-like mutations within protein-coding sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Such mutations have also been mapped to noncoding regions; however, existing research has primarily focused on promoters, enhancers, and splicing signals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, rather than sequences regulating pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation.</p>
<p>Here, we conducted a systematic genome-wide analysis of somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) affecting the PAS elements in mRNA 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTRs) in cancer cells. Using a large tumour whole-genome sequencing dataset, the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, we found that strong and evolutionarily conserved clavage/polyadenylation signals are often disrupted by cancer-specific SNVs. Strikingly, such mutations are significantly enriched in tumour suppressor genes. We further provide evidence that such mutations can substantially decrease the expression of tumour suppressor genes in cancer cells. Overall, our work identifies a novel class of noncoding somatic mutations with driver-like properties in cancer.</p>

<title>Somatic mutations often disrupt cleavage and polyadenylation sequences in cancer</title>
<p>We first analysed SNVs neighbouring annotated human cleavage and polyadenylation positions (paSNVs) in 3’UTRs from the PolyA_DB3 database <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We considered two distinct cohorts: “Normal” paSNVs from a healthy human population (the 1000 Genomes phase 3 data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>) and “Cancer” paSNVs from the whole-genome sequencing of cancer samples (PCAWG) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For each paSNV, we calculated the change in the cleavage/polyadenylation efficiency predicted by the APARENT2 neural network mode <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and assessed the loss and gain of the two strongest polyadenylation signals, AATAAA and ATTAAA (referred to as AWTAAA throughout this study; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). As expected, paSNVs predicted to have a strong impact on cleavage/polyadenylation were often situated immediately upstream of a CS, with most of them affecting AWTAAA hexamers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then categorized all paSNVs into three groups: (1) upregulating cleavage/polyadenylation (UP-paSNVs), defined as events with a ≥1 increase in the APARENT2 score (log odds ratio, or LOR) and creating an AWTAAA hexamer; (2) downregulating cleavage/polyadenylation (DOWN-paSNVs; LOR≤-1 and disrupting an AWTAAA); and (3) the remaining annotated cleavage position-adjacent paSNVs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The latter group served as a background control (BG-paSNVs) in our subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>Consistent with the earlier studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we observed a pronounced negative selection against the DOWN-paSNVs in the Normal dataset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>). This category showed significantly decreased allele frequencies in comparison to the BG-paSNVs and was enriched for singletons (unique variants in the analysed dataset). This effect was more evident when considering changes in both the score and the hexamer composition (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, comparison of the Normal and Cancer datasets showed that cancer somatic mutations, on average, had a stronger effect on the polyadenylation efficiency in both the UP- and DOWN-paSNV groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>; LOR sample variance 0.115 in cancer vs 0.0876 in normal). DOWN-paSNVs were significantly enriched in cancer compared to the normal population data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We also observed that mutations disrupting AWTAAA hexamers in 3’UTRs tended to occur near annotated cleavage sites in cancer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, cancer-specific DOWN-paSNVs affected cleavage/polyadenylation signals with higher APARENT2 scores (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, DOWN-paSNVs tended to affect more evolutionarily conserved sequences in the Cancer dataset compared to the Normal control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). In total, we identified 1614 distinct somatic DOWN-paSNVs in the cancer dataset affecting 1570 cleavage/polyadenylation events in 1460 genes in 610 tumours, i.e. ∼23% of all tumour samples in PCAWG.</p>
<p>We concluded that mutations disrupting functional cleavage/polyadenylation signals are abundant in cancer cells despite being subject to strong purifying selection in a healthy population.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cancer-specific mutations in cleavage and polyadenylation sequences are enriched in tumour suppressor genes</title>
<p>There are two possible explanations for the enrichment of DOWN-paSNV events in cancer: (1) an increase in the overall mutation load and (2) positive selection for such mutations. Since the latter possibility may increase the incidence of mutations in cancer driver genes, we analysed the distribution of DOWN-paSNVs within genes from the Cancer Gene Census<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This revealed a remarkable over-representation of the DOWN-paSNVs in tumour suppressor genes, with the magnitude of this effect being greater than the corresponding enrichment of nonsense mutations (SNVs creating a premature translation termination codon) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-B</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="600297v1_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Overall DOWN-paSNVs were found to affect 38 tumour suppressor genes, i.e. 14.3% of all genes in this category in the Census dataset. Consistent with tumour suppressors being a major target of DOWN-paSNVs, genes with this type of mutations were strongly enriched for apoptosis-related functions (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>). DOWN-paSNVs were not enriched in the oncogenes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), in line with the disruptive nature of such mutations under normal conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Conversely, oncogenes but not tumour suppressors showed enrichment for UP-paSNVs (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-B</xref>).</p>
<p>To independently confirm the functional impact of DOWN-paSNVs in cancer, we compared the mutational excess of different types of somatic mutations using DigDriver <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, a neural network-based method that accounts for cancer-specific mutation rates. This analysis revealed a significantly higher observed-to-expected mutation rate for DOWN-paSNV events in cancer compared to the BG-paSNV group (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). DOWN-paSNVs tended to be enriched in tumour suppressor genes, consistent with positive selection for these events in cancer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). No such enrichment was detected in oncogenes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>),</p>
<p>Of note, our analysis of wild-type sequences showed that tumour suppressor 3’UTRs are characterized by stronger cleavage/polyadenylation signals compared to oncogenes and non-cancer genes (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A-B</xref>). Moreover, tumour suppressors associated with hallmarks of cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> in the Census dataset had stronger cleavage/polyadenylation signals than the rest of tumour suppressor genes (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the classical two-hit hypothesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, both alleles of tumour suppressor genes may acquire distinct damaging mutations in cancer. With this in mind, we analysed the co-occurrence of paSNVs with damaging non-synonymous mutations from the PCAWG collection (Non-syn. variants from the binarised gene-centric table in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>). DOWN-paSNV-containing tumour suppressors showed a markedly increased incidence of such additional somatic mutations in the same tumour compared to the BG-paSNV control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Furthermore, the overall frequency of damaging non-synonymous mutations in tumour suppressors affected by DOWN-paSNVs in at least one sample was significantly higher than in the DOWN-paSNV-negative tumour suppressor group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these data suggest that somatic mutations disrupting cleavage and polyadenylation can facilitate the inactivation of tumour suppressors in cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Somatic mutations in cleavage and polyadenylation signals can decrease the expression of tumour suppressor genes</title>
<p>Genetic inactivation of functional cleavage/polyadenylation sequences may negatively affect gene expression (see e.g., Ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>). To explore this possibility, we turned to the colorectal adenocarcinoma subset of PCAWG, as it contained most of the DOWN-paSNVs in tumour suppressors and the corresponding gene expression information <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. We shortlisted detectably expressed tumour suppressors that contained DOWN-paSNVs and no other damaging mutations in specific cancer samples, and were wild type in other samples. Seven genes passing these filters were involved in various aspects of tumour biology, including cell survival and DNA repair (<italic>CASP9</italic>, <italic>NDRG1</italic>, and <italic>XPA</italic>), mTOR signalling (<italic>TSC1</italic>), and transcription and RNA processing (<italic>ETV6</italic>, <italic>ISY1</italic> and <italic>SMAD2</italic>).</p>
<p>Plotting pairwise gene-specific expression differences for the aggregated tumour suppressor set, we observed a significant bias towards downregulation in the samples containing DOWN-paSNVs compared to the wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>; median downregulation of 1.25-fold). Remarkably, similar negative biases were detected for all seven individual genes, with median downregulation values ranging from 1.1-to 3.2-fold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To validate the effect of DOWN-paSNVs on gene expression, we focused on a somatic mutation that disrupts the cleavage/polyadenylation signal in the tumour suppressor <italic>XPA</italic>. This gene has been shown to promote apoptosis in response to DNA damage, in addition to its role in nucleotide excision repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Moreover, downregulation of <italic>XPA</italic> has been associated with decreased patient survival in colorectal cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The <italic>XPA</italic> mutation identified by our bioinformatics analyses alters the canonical AATAAA PAS hexamer to GATAAA near the terminal CS and significantly reduces the APARENT2 score (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). To experimentally assess the effect of this mutation on the efficiency of pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, we prepared minigene constructs where the wild-type or mutant sequences were inserted upstream of a recombinant CS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>We used the wild-type and mutant minigenes to transfect the human colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116. An RT-qPCR assay measuring the efficiency of cleavage/polyadenylation as a ratio between the CS-read-through and CS-upstream signals revealed a significant decrease in cleavage/polyadenylation efficiency in response to the <italic>XPA</italic> DOWN-paSNV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>To directly assess the effect of defective cleavage/polyadenylation on gene expression, the wild-type or the mutant 3’UTR sequences were inserted downstream of a luciferase reporter gene. Following the transfection of HCT-116 cells, we detected a significantly reduced production of luciferase protein from the mutant construct compared to the wild-type control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, somatic mutations disrupting polyadenylation signals in tumour suppressor genes can reduce the abundance of functional mRNA transcripts.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We interrogated whole-genome mutation data using recently developed machine learning approaches to systematically characterize the impact of SNVs on 3’UTR polyadenylation signals (PAS) in cancer. Our analyses confirm that germline SNVs disrupting PAS are likely deleterious, as they are subjected to strong negative selection in the normal population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that somatic mutations affecting such cis-elements in cancer are more prevalent, tend to occur near stronger CSs, and target more evolutionarily conserved PAS hexamers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, these cancer somatic SNVs disrupt PAS sequences in tumour suppressor genes with a similar enrichment pattern to well-known deleterious SNVs in protein-coding regions, such as nonsense mutations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref>). Additionally, wild-type tumour suppressors have stronger cleavage/polyadenylation signals than other groups of genes (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>), pointing to the importance of the corresponding steps of pre-mRNA processing for their expression.</p>
<p>Consistent with the two-hit hypothesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, we found that tumour suppressors with disrupted cleavage/polyadenylation signals (i.e. containing DOWN-paSNVs) are more likely to acquire other damaging somatic mutations in the same tumour (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-F</xref>). However, it is possible that DOWN-paSNVs can contribute to tumour progression even in the absence of other mutations. Indeed, tumour suppressors containing only DOWN-paSNVs are consistently expressed at lower levels compared to their wild-type counterparts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). Moreover, it is currently thought that partial inactivation of many tumour suppressors can be sufficient to promote tumorigenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Using the tumour suppressor gene <italic>XPA</italic> as an example, we directly show that a cancer-specific single-nucleotide mutation disrupting the PAS hexamer is sufficient to block pre-mRNA cleavage/polyadenylation and dampen the expression of mature mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-E</xref>). These results support our bioinformatics analyses and argue that SNVs targeting polyadenylation signals can have a profound effect on gene expression in cancer. Our data are also consistent with previous reports showing similar gene expression effects of PAS-specific germline SNVs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>It is expected that mutation of cleavage/polyadenylation signals should lead to the appearance of abnormal read-through transcripts that may be destabilized by either nuclear or cytoplasmic RNA quality control mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Alternatively, a decrease in cleavage/polyadenylation activity might dampen transcription initiation, as these two processes are known to be interconnected <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Differentiating between these possibilities will be an important next step in understanding the molecular mechanisms, which may link compromised cleavage/polyadenylation and gene expression defects in cancer. Furthermore, although we focused on annotated 3’UTR CSs in this work, similar analyses of SNVs occurring in other noncoding parts of mammalian genes (e.g. introns) might reveal an even wider impact of the loss and gain of PAS-like sequences in cancer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study reveals that the genetic inactivation of cleavage and polyadenylation in tumour suppressor genes constitutes a prevalent, yet previously overlooked category of somatic cancer mutations with driver properties. These findings emphasize the importance of pre-mRNA processing in the biology of cancer and underscore the need for improved functional annotation of single nucleotide variants in noncoding regions of the human genome.</p>

<p>Pre-mRNA cleavage site (CS) positions and the corresponding metadata were obtained from the PolyA_DB3 database <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (release 3.2 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://exon.apps.wistar.org/PolyA_DB/v3/">https://exon.apps.wistar.org/PolyA_DB/v3/</ext-link>).

Cancer somatic SNVs and indels from whole-genome sequencing of 2,583 unique tumours (PCAWG) were downloaded from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dcc.icgc.org/">https://dcc.icgc.org/</ext-link>) and the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) (project code: phs000178).

<title>Data processing</title>
<p>CSs located in 3’UTRs according to PolyA_DB3 were extended by 102 nt on both sides to generate 205-nt intervals. All SNVs from the 1000 genomes and the PCAWG datasets mapping to these intervals were kept for further analyses (paSNVs). FASTA files corresponding to wild-type and mutant 205-nt intervals analysed by the APARENT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. For each variant we estimated log odds ratio (LOR) of mutant (mut) variant isoform abundance with respect to the wild-type (wt) abundance (abundance were calculated by summing all cleavage probabilities mapping to 205-nt interval) as follows:

</disp-formula>
Incidence of PAS hexamers was quantified using the vcountPattern function from the Biostrings R/Bioconductor package (doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.Biostrings). Evolutionary conservation was calculated for either exact SNV positions or 15-nt SNV-centred windows using the GenomicScores <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and the phastCons100way.UCSC.hg19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> R/Bioconductor packages. Only unique SNV entries were kept for further analysis. In cases where a single SNV was located near more than one distinct CS, the strongest effect on cleavage/polyadenylation was used for further analyses. GO terms enrichment was analysed using the ClusterProfiler R/Bioconductor package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To analyse changes in polyadenylation scores of all mutations affecting AWTAAA sequences in 3’UTRs in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, APARENT2 scores were calculated for all SNV-centred 205-nt intervals from both datasets located within canonical UCSC 3’UTRs. SNVs disrupting AWTAAA sequence with LOR≤-1 within 100-nt intervals centred around polyA_DB3 CSs were considered “annotated”.</p>

<title>Cancer Census gene enrichment</title>
<p>Enrichment of different types of SNVs in Cancer Census genes was calculated using two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Somatic SNVs in protein-coding sequences were classified as “Nonsense”, “Missense”, or “Synonymous” based on the information provided in PCAWG maf files (“Variant_Classification” column). Tumour suppressors were defined as genes labelled as “TSG“ but not “Oncogene” in the Census dataset. A similar stringent approach was used to define oncogenes. Genes annotated as both “Tumour suppressors’’ and “Oncogenes” were excluded (most analyses), analysed as “Both” (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-B</xref>), or combined with tumour suppressors to form the extended “Tumour suppressor+” group (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>).</p>

<title>DigDriver enrichment analysis</title>

<graphic xlink:href="600297v1_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
To calculate the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of this enrichment, we performed bootstrap resampling of tumour suppressors, oncogenes and non-cancer genes in each mutation class for 1000 iterations. In each iteration, the enrichment/excess of mutations was calculated as described above. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the resampled distribution were used as the 95% confidence interval boundaries.</p>

<title>Gene expression analysis</title>
<p>To analyse possible effect of DOWN-paSNVs on transcript abundance, we selected tumour suppressor genes from the published colorectal adenocarcinoma study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, which contained DOWN-paSNVs and no other damaging SNVs (i.e. Non-syn. variants from the binarised gene-centric table in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>) in some samples, and no mutations in other samples. We normalized the available gene expression data (FPKM) to account for gene copy number variation and log<sub>2</sub>-tranformed them to obtain Log2(nFPKM) values. Gene-specific Log2(nFPKM) values for the wild-type samples were then subtracted from corresponding Log2(nFPKM) values for the DOWN-paSNVs samples to obtain distributions of gene expression differences (ΔLog2(nFPKM)). A one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyse the significance of a negative shift of ΔLog2(nFPKM) distributions compared to 0.</p>

<p>Kainov et al investigated the prevalence of mutations in 3'UTR that affect gene expression in cancer to identify noncoding cancer drivers.</p>
<p>The authors used data from normal controls (1000 genome data) and compared it to cancer data (PCAWG). They found that in cancer 3'UTR mutations had a stronger effect on cleavage than the normal population. These mutations are negatively selected in the normal population and positively selected in cancers. The authors used PCAWG data set to identify such mutations and found that the mutations that lead to a reduction of gene expression are enriched in tumor suppressor genes and those that are increased in gene expression are enriched for oncogenes. 3'UTR mutations that reduce gene expression or occur in TSGs co-occur with non-synonymous mutations. The authors then validate the effect of 3'UTR mutations experimentally using a luciferase reporter assay. These data identify a novel class of noncoding driver genes with mutations in 3'UTR that impact polyadenylation and thus gene expression.</p>
<p>This is an elegant study with fundamental insight into identifying cancer driver genes. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of data analysis need to be extended.</p>
<p>(1) It would be important for the authors to show if the findings of this study hold for metastatic cancers since most deaths occur due to metastasis and tumor heterogeneity changes when cancer progresses to metastasis. The authors should use the Hartwig data and show if metastatic cancers are enriched for 3'UTR mutations.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 2 should show the distribution of 3'UTR mutations by cancer type especially since authors go on to use colorectal cancer only for validations. It would be helpful to bring Figures S3A and S3C to this panel since these findings make the connections to cancer biology. Are any molecular functions enriched in addition to biological processes? Are kinases, phosphatases, etc more or less affected by 3'UTR mutations?</p>
<p>(3) Figure 3 looks at the co-occurrence of 3'UTR mutations with non-synonymous mutations but what about copy number change? You would expect the loss of the other allele to be enriched. Along the same line, are these data phased? Do you know that the non-synonymous mutations are in the other allele or in the same allele that shows 3'UTR mutation?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>To evaluate whether somatic mutations in cancer genomes are enriched with mutations in polyadenylation signal regions, the authors analyzed 1000 genomes data and PCAWG data as a control and experimental set, respectively. They observed increased enrichment of somatic mutations that may affect the function of polyA signals and confirmed that these mutations may influence the expression of the gene through a minigene expression experiment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study provides a systematic evaluation of polyA signal, which makes it valuable. Overall, the analytic approach and results are solid and supported by experimental validation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) This study uses APARENT2 as a tool to evaluate functional alteration in polyA signal sequences. Based on the original paper and the results shown in this paper, the algorithm appears to be of high quality. However, the whole study is dependent on the output of APARENT2. Therefore, it would be nice to</p>
<p>
(a) run and show a positive control run, which can show that the algorithm works well, and</p>
<p>
(b) describe the rationale for selecting this algorithm in the main text.</p>
<p>(2) Are there recurrent somatic mutation calls (= exactly the same mutation across different tumor samples) in the poly(A) region of certain genes?</p>
<p>(3) The authors nicely showed that the minigene with A&gt;G mutation altered gene expression. Maybe one can reach a similar conclusion by analyzing a cancer dataset that has mutation and gene expression data? That is, genes with or without polyA mutations show different expression levels.</p>
