<title>Abstract</title><p>Signaling dynamics are crucial in biological systems, and biosensor-based real-time imaging has revolutionized their analysis. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) excels over the widely used fluorescence intensity imaging by allowing the measurement of absolute signal levels independent of sensor concentration. This capability enables the comparison of signaling dynamics across different animals, body regions, and timeframes. However, FLIM’s advantage can be compromised by factors like autofluorescence in biological experiments. To address this, we introduce FLiSimBA, a flexible computational framework for realistic <underline>F</underline>luorescence <underline>Li</underline>fetime <underline>Sim</underline>ulation for <underline>B</underline>iological <underline>A</underline>pplications. Through simulations, we analyze the signal-to-noise ratios of fluorescence lifetime data, determining measurement uncertainty and providing necessary error bars for lifetime measurements. Furthermore, we challenge the belief that fluorescence lifetime is unaffected by sensor expression and establish quantitative limits to this insensitivity in biological applications. Additionally, we propose innovations, notably multiplexed dynamic imaging that combines fluorescence intensity and lifetime measurements. This innovation can transform the number of signals that can be simultaneously monitored, thereby enabling a systems approach in studying signaling dynamics. Thus, by incorporating diverse factors into our simulation framework, we uncover surprises, identify limitations, and propose advancements for fluorescence lifetime imaging in biology. This quantitative framework supports rigorous experimental design, facilitates accurate data interpretation, and paves the way for technological advancements in fluorescence lifetime imaging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and photometry (FLiP) are powerful methods for revealing the dynamics of biological signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bastiaens &amp; Squire, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Becker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brinks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Y.

X. Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Fluorescence lifetime refers to the time between excitation of a fluorophore and emission of light. Compared with intensity-based imaging, the greatest advantage of fluorescence lifetime is its insensitivity to fluorophore concentration. As a result, fluorescence lifetime can be used to compare the dynamics of biological signals across animals or over long periods of time despite changes in sensor expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Laviv et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">P. Ma et al., 2024</xref>). Furthermore, it offers the potential to quantitate absolute values of biological signals because of its quantitative nature and its insensitivity to sensor expression. Because of these advantages, FLIM-compatible sensors are being actively developed and FLIM has been increasingly adopted to elucidate the dynamics of many types of biological signals over multiple time scales.</p>
<p>Although fluorescence lifetime is independent of sensor expression when only the sensor is present, in biology experiments, this very advantage of FLIM breaks down when multiple other factors are present. These include autofluorescence (natural emission of light by biological tissue after light absorption), background light (e.g., ambient light), dark current and afterpulse of the photomultiplier tube (PMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akgun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Georgakoudi &amp; Quinn, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Malak et al., 2022</xref>). As sensor expression varies, the relative contribution of sensor fluorescence over these other sources of light or electrical noise varies correspondingly, leading to an apparent change in fluorescence lifetime. Thus, to harness the power and correctly interpret the results of FLIM and FLiP experiments in biological tissue, it is critical to quantitatively understand the regime in which fluorescence lifetime varies with sensor expression, and the range in which sensor expression does not significantly alter lifetime measurements. Furthermore, these additional factors introduce bias and noise to fluorescence lifetime measurements. As innovation pushes the technological boundary to image larger fields of view at higher speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bowman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lodder et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Raspe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shcheslavskiy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Y. Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), it is critical to understand how these factors contribute to signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, and how many photons are required to achieve a certain SNR in biological settings.</p>
<p>An effective tool for exploring how experimental parameters contribute to outcomes is simulation. Both analytical and simulation methods have provided insights into issues such as the SNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Esposito et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gerritsen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Köllner &amp; Wolfrum, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kumar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nasser &amp; Meller, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Netaev et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Philip &amp; Carlsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Roethlein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Trinh &amp; Esposito, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Turton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Walsh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yasuda, 2006</xref>). However, prior work usually assumes the presence of sensor fluorescence only, without considering the important contributions to noise and bias due to other factors, such as autofluorescence and afterpulse of the PMT. Consequently, these simulations are useful in vitro but are not readily applicable in biological settings. Therefore, to understand how experimental conditions influence lifetime estimates for biological applications, simulations with realistic and, ideally, measured data must be performed.</p>
<p>Here we introduce <underline>F</underline>luorescence <underline>Li</underline>fetime <underline>Sim</underline>ulation for <underline>B</underline>iological <underline>A</underline>pplications (FLiSimBA) and use it to quantitatively define the potential and limitations of fluorescence lifetime experiments in biological settings. FLiSimBA is a flexible platform designed for realistic simulation of fluorescence lifetime data with empirically determined parameters through time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). FLiSimBA recapitulates experimental data. Using FLiSimBA, we determined the photon requirements for minimum detectable differences in fluorescence lifetime, thus providing realistic estimates of the SNR in biological tissue and the necessary quantification of measurement uncertainty for correct data interpretation. Furthermore, we challenge the conventional view that fluorescence lifetime is insensitive to sensor expression levels and establish quantitative limits of insensitivity, defining the potential and limits of comparing fluorescence lifetime measurements in biology. Finally, we use FLiSimBA to propel innovation in FLIM by assessing the impact of hardware improvement on the SNR, quantifying the value of developing sensors with spectra unaffected by autofluorescence, and specifying sensor characteristics that would greatly expand the power of simultaneous real-time measurements of multiple signals (multiplexing) with both intensity and lifetime properties of sensors. Our results show that considering relevant contributors and noise to fluorescence lifetime measurements in biological contexts does not merely add detail. Rather, these quantitative changes produce qualitatively different conclusions that require careful consideration to avoid misinterpretation of data and to harness the potential of FLIM. Thus, we provide a versatile tool for simulating experimental conditions, a quantitative framework for evaluating fluorescence lifetime results, and insights into the potential and limitations of fluorescence lifetime measurements in biological applications.</p>

<title>Simulation of fluorescence lifetime data in biological tissue</title>
<p>To realistically mimic the fluorescence lifetime in biological tissue, we simulated contributions from sensor fluorescence, autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background, which is composed of both a small amount of light leakage and the dark current of the photon detectors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>The simulation procedure of FLiSimBA.</title>
<p>The sensor fluorescence lifetime distribution of a FRET-based sensor was modeled as a double exponential decay, as shown in <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref> (<italic>τ<sub>1</sub></italic> = 2.14 ns, <italic>τ<sub>2</sub></italic> = 0.69 ns) and the lifetimes of photons were sampled with replacement. After the sensor fluorescence was convolved with the probability density function (PDF) of the instrument response function (IRF), the following were added to produce the final simulated data: autofluorescence (autoF) empirically measured from brain tissue with photon number <italic>F<sub>autoF</sub></italic>, afterpulse of the photomultiplier tube (PMT), and background signal (consisting of the dark current of the PMT and light leak) with photon number <italic>F<sub>background</sub></italic>. The histograms of the final simulated data were similar to those of the experimental data. The simulation was repeated 500 times under each <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and sensor fluorescence photon number (<italic>F<sub>sensor</sub></italic>) condition. The fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> (based on a double exponential decay fitting of the final simulated data) and empirical lifetime were used for subsequent analyses and evaluations.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="572686v4_fig1.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>For sensor fluorescence, we sampled a specific number of photons (<italic>F<sub>sensor</sub></italic>) with replacement from an ideal distribution of photon lifetimes. In the examples in this study, we used the lifetime distribution of the FLIM-compatible A Kinase Activity Reporter (FLIM-AKAR), a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor that measures the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) in a variety of biological contexts, including brain slices and freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Y. Chen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tilden et al., 2024</xref>). The fluorescence lifetime of FLIM-AKAR follows a double exponential decay defined by the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="572686v4_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where <italic>F(t)</italic> is the number of photons that arrive at time t, <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic> is the number of photons at time 0, <italic>τ<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>τ<sub>2</sub></italic> are time constants corresponding to lifetime distributions of the donor fluorophore that is either free or undergoing FRET, and <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>2</sub></italic> are the proportions of the donor fluorophores in these two states (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Following sampling, we convolved the lifetime histogram with the probability density function (PDF) of an instrument response function (IRF) to account for instrument noise.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we added a specific number of sampled photons (<italic>F<sub>autoF</sub></italic>) from an autofluorescence curve, whose distribution was determined via fluorescence measurements in brain tissue without any sensor expression. The autofluorescence lifetime histogram exhibited faster decay than that of FLIM-AKAR (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). After that, we added the afterpulse of the PMT, long-lasting signals from ionization of residual gas inside the PMT following a photon detection event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akgun et al., 2008</xref>). The afterpulse was modeled as an even lifetime distribution with the amount of signal as a fraction of sensor fluorescence. Finally, we added a specific number of background signals (<italic>F<sub>background</sub></italic>) that was empirically determined from measurements, accounted for largely by ambient light leakage and the dark current of the PMT. We generated 500 simulated fluorescence lifetime histograms for each <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and sensor photon count (for additional details, see Materials and methods).</p>
<p>The simulated histogram closely matched the experimental histogram (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Following histogram generation, we used two commonly used fluorescence lifetime metrics to evaluate the simulated data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Y. Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Harvey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">P. Ma et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mongeon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yasuda et al., 2006</xref>). First, fluorescence lifetime data were evaluated with empirical lifetimes, defined as the average lifetime of all photons:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="572686v4_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>in which <italic>t</italic> is the lifetime of photons arriving at a specific time channel, and <italic>F(t)</italic> is the photon count from that time channel. Additionally, simulated histograms were fitted with a double exponential decay equation with Gauss-Newton nonlinear least-square fitting algorithm:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="572686v4_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Where <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> is photon count from sensor fluorescence at time 0, <italic>F<sub>background</sub></italic> is background signal, SHG is second harmonic generation that is added at time 0, and ⊗ represents convolution. Both experimental and simulated data showed good fitting (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). For subsequent analyses and evaluations, empirical lifetime and fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic>, corresponding to the proportion of slower decay (free donor fluorophore) were used (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Bias and noise introduced by different sources of signals</title>
<p>To understand how different fluorescence and electronic sources contribute to bias and noise, we analyzed the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime across a range of values for the simulated <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and sensor photon counts. Autofluorescence (autoF) decreased the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime, consistent with the faster decay of autofluorescence compared with that of FLIM-AKAR sensor fluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>: p &lt; 0.0001, sensor + autoF vs sensor only under all sensor photon number conditions for both fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime). Further addition of afterpulse and background did not significantly change the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>: p &gt; 0.6, final simulated data vs sensor + autoF condition for all sensor photon number conditions), consistent with consideration of the background term during the fitting procedure. In contrast, afterpulse and background increased the empirical lifetime, as they are evenly distributed across lifetime time channels and have a higher mean lifetime than FLIM-AKAR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>: p &lt; 0.0001, final simulated data vs sensor + autoF for all sensor photon number conditions). Afterpulse and background had a greater impact on empirical lifetime compared with autofluorescence. This is because the empirical lifetime of background/afterpulse (∼4.90 ns) deviates more from FLIM-AKAR (2 – 2.3 ns) than the empirical lifetime of autofluorescence (around 1.69 ns) does. Thus, while autofluorescence affects both the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime, only empirical lifetime is sensitive to afterpulse and background.</p>

<p>Importantly, the biases introduced by autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background were less pronounced at higher sensor photon counts, which can be explained by the relatively small contribution of these factors when sensor fluorescence is high. Notably, as the number of sensor photons increased, the biases not only decreased but also plateaued, which made fluorescence lifetime less dependent on the number of sensor photons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Furthermore, the variance also decreased at higher photon counts for both the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, higher photon counts resulted in both less bias and less noise.</p>
<p>To quantify how well our simulation matches the experimental conditions, we calculated fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime after each simulation step, with <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> matching the experimental condition.

Thus, our simulated fluorescence lifetime data recapitulated experimental data in biologically relevant settings.</p>
<p>In summary, using FLiSimBA, we realistically simulated fluorescence lifetime data in biological settings and quantitatively defined how different sources of signals contribute to bias and noise.

<title>Determination of minimum photon number requirements to achieve specific SNRs</title>
<p>How many photons do we need for a given FLIM experiment in a biology experiment? Are more photons always better? A greater number of photons translates into a better SNR but also a lower sampling rate and reduced size for the field of view. How can we quantitatively find the optimal compromise among these factors? As sensor fluorescence increases, the variances of both the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime decrease (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), and the ability to detect a specific amount of fluorescence lifetime response increases. Although the number of photons required to achieve a certain SNR was analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Esposito et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gerritsen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Köllner &amp; Wolfrum, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kumar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nasser &amp; Meller, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Netaev et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Philip &amp; Carlsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Roethlein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Trinh &amp; Esposito, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Turton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Walsh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yasuda, 2006</xref>), such analysis was not performed with consideration of biological samples in realistic experiments involving autofluorescence, background, and afterpulse.</p>
<p>To determine the minimum number of photons required for a certain SNR, we analyzed the minimum detectable differences (MDD) in both the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime for different numbers of sensor photons and repeated measurements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The MDD was calculated with 80% power and a 5% significance level. As the number of sensor photons increased, the MDDs decreased. As the number of repeated measurements increased, the MDD also decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Importantly, the MDD curves provide quantitative information on the minimum number of photons required for a certain amount of expected signal. For example, to detect a <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> change of 0.006 or a lifetime change of 5 ps with five sample measurements in each comparison group, approximately 300,000 photons are needed. As the sensor fluorescence increased, the gain in SNR decreased. Thus, MDD curves generated with FLiSimBA are instrumental for determining the optimal experimental conditions (for example, optimal imaging speed and sizes of imaging fields) necessary to detect a specific amount of lifetime change.</p>

<p>Using realistic determination of the SNR with FLiSimBA, we also quantitatively evaluated the impact of specific hardware changes on the SNR. Hybrid detectors (HBDs) are advantageous over traditional gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) PMTs because of their narrower IRF width and lack of afterpulsing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Becker et al., 2011</xref>). However, hybrid detectors are more expensive. Thus, it is valuable to quantify the benefits of HBDs over traditional GaAsP PMTs for SNRs. We generated fluorescence lifetime histograms with narrower IRFs and no afterpulses for HBDs and compared them with the simulated data for traditional GaAsP PMTs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Hybrid detectors and GaAsP PMTs displayed similar photon-dependent changes in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Furthermore, a given sensor photon number gave a comparable MDD for HBDs and GaAsP PMTs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). The similarity in the MDD curves can be explained by similar levels of variance between HBDs and PMTs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>): although HBDs with a narrower IRF introduced less noise than GaAsP detectors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-H</xref>; noise from sampling from the IRF: standard deviation (STD) of fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic>: 0.0008 for GaAsP PMTs and 0.0005 for HBDs; STD of empirical lifetime: 0.0003 for GaAsP PMTs and 0.0001 for HBDs), the noise of lifetime measurements was dominated by photon noise, and not by IRF noise (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-H</xref>; noise from sampling of photons: STD of fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic>: 0.0028 for both GaAsP PMTs and HBDs; STD of empirical lifetime: 0.0025 for both GaAsP PMTs and HBDs). Thus, although HBD can offer other advantages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Trinh &amp; Esposito, 2021</xref>), HBDs with a narrower IRF and no afterpulse yield little improvement in the SNR for fluorescent protein-based sensors in biological applications.</p>

<p>In summary, the quantitative and biologically realistic curves generated with FLiSimBA allow users to determine the appropriate tradeoff in each experiment. Given the specific sensor brightness, sensor lifetime, and expected signal amplitude in specific biological applications, FLiSimBA allows the users to select the imaging speed and size of the imaging field to achieve the desired SNR. In addition, FLiSimBA allows users to evaluate the tradeoff between performance improvement and price with specific hardware changes.</p>

<title>Expression level dependence of fluorescence lifetime estimates</title>
<p>Sensor expression levels often change over days and across animals and is usually assumed not to influence lifetime estimates because fluorescence lifetime is an intensive property of fluorophores. However, this assumption is true only if the biosensor is the only contributor to measurements. With autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background signals present in biological applications, the amount of sensor fluorescence relative to these contributing factors can lead to an apparent change in fluorescence lifetime estimates even if the biosensor is in the same conformational state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">P. Ma et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we challenge the conventional view that fluorescence lifetime is independent of sensor expression and use simulation to define the range in which sensor expression has a negligible influence on lifetime.</p>
<p>We first determined how sensor expression levels altered the relative responses in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). When <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> changed from 0.4 to 0.5, both fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime increased as expected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>; adjusted p &lt; 0.0001, <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> = 0.4 vs <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> = 0.5, under all photon number conditions for both fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime). As the sensor photon count increased, fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> increased and empirical lifetime decreased with both plateauing at high photon counts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5B</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>; p &lt; 0.05, 800,000 photons vs 550,000 photons or less for fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic>, 800,000 photons vs 700,000 photons or less for empirical lifetime, for both <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> = 0.4 and <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> = 0.5). This photon-dependent change in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or lifetime is consistent with the diminishing effect of autofluorescence, background, and afterpulse. We next determined whether the response amplitude also changed as the sensor photon count increased by comparing the changes in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime when actual <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> changed from 0.4 to 0.5. As the sensor photon count increased, the change in the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime also showed an apparent increase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>; p &lt; 0.05, 800,000 photons vs 450,000 photons or less for fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and 400,000 photons or less for empirical lifetime). The response dependence on photons approached asymptotes at high photon counts: With the parameters used in our case study, the fluorescence lifetime responses were relatively stable at sensor photon counts of 500,000 and above (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Thus, our results challenge the widely held view that relative fluorescence lifetime changes are independent of sensor expression level and define a quantitative threshold of sensor expression that allows comparison of lifetime responses across different sensor expression levels.</p>

A higher sensor photon count reduces the likelihood of significant changes in lifetime due to sensor expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Thus, we determined the minimum number of sensor photons needed for a specific change in sensor expression to have a negligible impact on lifetime measurements (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We first determined the apparent change in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime introduced by the change in sensor expression levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, purple traces). As sensor fluorescence increased, the sensor expression-induced apparent change in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> and empirical lifetime decreased. Additionally, by considering the variance associated with a specific photon count, we calculated the minimum change in fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or empirical lifetime that would result in a statistically significant difference due to sensor expression changes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, black traces, t test threshold, see Materials and methods).

As the total number of sensor photons increased, a greater difference in sensor expression was tolerated. Fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> could tolerate more photon changes than empirical lifetime for a given number of sensor photons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).

<p>If sensors could be made with emission spectra that do not overlap with tissue autofluorescence (e.g., red or far-red sensors), both the relative response and absolute values of fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> no longer depended on sensor expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref> left panels; 7A: p = 0.047 for 30,000 photons, p &gt; 0.8 for the other photon counts, vs 800,000 photons;). This expression independence can be explained by the fact that only autofluorescence contributes to the sensor expression-dependent bias of fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). With no autofluorescence, the relative response in empirical lifetime showed less dependence on sensor expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, left, p &lt; 0.05 for 150,000 photons or less, p &gt; 0.2 for the other photon counts, vs 800,000 photons), whereas the absolute empirical lifetime could tolerate less change in sensor expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, left). Thus, sensors with spectra that avoid overlap with autofluorescence are completely independent of sensor expression levels when fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> is used as the metric of evaluation.</p>
<p>When background signals were lower, both the relative response and absolute values of fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> showed a similar sensor expression dependence to that of the higher background (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>, middle panels; 7A: p &lt; 0.05 for 350,000 photons or less, p &gt; 0.1 for the other photon counts, vs 800,000 photons). This is because the background is considered in the fitting process as a mathematical term. For the empirical lifetime response, a lower background slightly reduced the sensor expression dependence (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, middle, p &lt; 0.05 for 350,000 photons or less, p &gt; 0.1 for the other photon counts, vs 800,000 photons). Notably, a lower background signal caused greater tolerance of sensor expression level changes for the measurement of absolute empirical lifetime (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>, middle). Thus, a lower background does not significantly alter the sensor level dependence when fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> is used as the metric of measurement, but it significantly reduces the sensor level dependence when empirical lifetime is used as the metric of measurement.</p>
<p>Consistent with the results above, when there was no autofluorescence and the background was lower, there was no longer sensor expression dependence for fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>, right panels; 7A: p &gt; 0.99 for all photon counts vs 800,000 photons), and the sensor expression dependence also became much less pronounced for empirical lifetime (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>, right; 7B: p &lt; 0.05 for 150,000 photons or less, p &gt; 0.3 for the other photon counts, vs 800,000 photons).</p>
<p>In summary, using FLiSimBA, we show quantitatively the benefit gained from future technological innovations: Developing sensors outside autofluorescence spectra or having a lower background can significantly reduce the dependence of fluorescence lifetime on sensor expression in biological systems, increasing the versatility of lifetime comparison across animals, brain regions, and chronic time scales, as well as allowing us to quantify the absolute levels of analytes.</p>

However, this approach was only used to distinguish sensors with different lifetimes in different spatial compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Frei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rahim et al., 2022</xref>), or fluorophores that do not change dynamically and thus do not act as sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hamilton &amp; Sanabria, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rahim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rice &amp; Kumar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Widengren et al., 2006</xref>), and there was no quantitative framework for exploring the multiplexing capacity to analyze the dynamics of biosensors. Here we investigated whether the combined signal of sensors with different lifetimes can be effectively deconvolved to quantitate the dynamic intensity change of each sensor – if this is feasible, this new approach could be used to simultaneously track the dynamics of multiple signals in the same spatial location, or in photometry experiments (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>), thus greatly enhancing our ability to understand the systems biology of signaling.</p>

<p>We modeled a multiplexed system with two sensors, each displaying a single exponential decay in its fluorescence lifetime histogram but with different decay constants. Furthermore, in response to a change in the concentration of a biological analyte, the fluorescence lifetime of each sensor remains constant whereas the fluorescence intensity is modulated. We used FLiSimBA to simulate multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging with realistic parameters and noise in biological systems. Subsequently, we deconvolved the combined histogram by fitting it with a double exponential decay equation (<xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 3</xref>, Gauss-Newton nonlinear least-square fitting algorithm), whose decay time constants corresponded to those of the two sensor species (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>).</p>
<p>We first investigated whether varying sensor intensities could be accurately deconvolved (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Deconvolution accurately recovered the photon numbers attributed to each sensor compared with the actual sensor photons inputted into the model (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). The number of fitted sensor 1 photons (with shorter lifetime) was greater than the number of simulated sensor 1 photons, consistent with the contribution of autofluorescence whose average lifetime is closer to that of Sensor 1. Furthermore, when the lifetime decay constants of the two species were further separated, the variance in the fitted sensor photons decreased (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>, STD = 0.012 for 4 ns separation and STD = 0.053-0.061 for 0.5 ns separation), indicating that further separation of lifetimes between the two sensors resulted in a better SNR.</p>
<p>To quantitatively evaluate the feasibility of multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging of sensors with the same spectra, we calculated the statistical power for detecting specific intensity changes of sensor 1 photons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). The statistical power for detecting a specific intensity change was greater when the intensity change was greater and when the difference between the lifetime constants of the two sensors was greater (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>, for any given heatmap). Furthermore, the statistical power was also greater when the number of starting sensor 1 photons was greater and the number of sensor 2 photons were lower (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>, comparing between the heatmaps). Therefore, these results were valuable for demonstrating the feasibility of using fluorescence lifetime for multiplexed imaging and for quantitatively specifying the parameter space that provided sufficient statistical power.</p>
<p>To systematically define the parameter space, we determined the minimum intensity change that was detectable under different conditions. For any given sensor 1 starting photon count, sensor 2 photon count, and lifetime separation, we fitted the statistical power versus intensity change relationship to a 5-parameter logistic curve (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). Using the fitted curve, we calculated the intensity change that would yield a statistical power of 80% and defined it as the minimum detectable ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). The minimum detectable ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> for sensor 1 decreased as the lifetime separation increased, as sensor 1 expression level increased, or as the number of sensor 2 photons decreased (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>). If the two sensors had comparable dynamic ranges and comparable expression levels, the minimum detectable ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> for sensor 2 was similar to that of sensor 1 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref>). Remarkably, only a 0.5 ns separation in lifetime constants between the two sensors could result in a minimum detectable ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> of 5% in sensor 1 if sensor 1 showed high but reasonable expression (800,000 photons or higher) and sensor 2 showed reasonable expression (500,000 photons or lower) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). These results showed how the sensitivity of the intensity response quantitatively depended on the sensor expression and differences in lifetime between the two sensors.</p>
<p>In summary, our simulation showed that multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging was feasible with small shifts in the sensor properties. Furthermore, FLiSimBA could be used to quantitatively define the parameters of the sensors to yield a desired sensitivity. Thus, these results provide sensor developers with specific sensor properties to evolve toward. With simultaneous spectral and lifetime multiplexing, our proposed method enables the detection of a much larger number of signals dynamically, opening doors to better systems understanding of signaling within the cell and physiological interactions between different organs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we provide a quantitative framework for analyzing fluorescence lifetime in realistic biological settings. We introduce FLiSimBA, a platform that accurately simulates fluorescence lifetime data for biological applications (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). With FLiSimBA, we address key questions in FLIM. First, to understand SNRs, we determined the number of photons required for different minimum detectable differences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Additionally, we assessed the impact of hardware changes on SNRs by comparing GaAsP PMTs with hybrid detectors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, we challenged the conventional view that biosensor expression levels do not affect fluorescence lifetime. We revealed how variation in sensor expression influences response amplitude (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) and identified the amount of expression level variation that does not significantly alter fluorescence lifetime estimates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Finally, we evaluated the feasibility, quantified the benefits, and specified the parameter space for FLIM innovations that minimize expression level dependence (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) or enable multiplexed imaging with lifetime and intensity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In summary, our study provides valuable insights and a quantitative framework for defining the power and limitations of fluorescence lifetime experiments in biological applications.</p>

<title>FLiSimBA as a tool for realistic simulation of FLIM and FLiP experiments</title>
<p>FLiSimBA is a necessary and useful tool for FLIM and FLiP experiments for a few reasons. First, it realistically simulates lifetime data from biological applications. Second, FLiSimBA and the quantitative framework we provide can precisely define the benefits and limitations of FLIM or FLiP experiments, enabling rigorous experimental design and data interpretation. Third, the versality of FLiSimBA allows easy adaption to different sensors, tissues, organisms, and analysis methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bajzer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Y.-I.

<p>While this study used specific parameters from FLIM-AKAR and our imaging systems to demonstrate the power of FLiSimBA, FLiSimBA allows customizable inputs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) with minimal model assumptions to suit specific experimental settings. Users should carefully select mathematical models for their fluorescence sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Y. Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Steinbach, 2012</xref>), measure autofluorescence that matches the age, brain region, and data collection conditions (e.g. ex vivo or in vivo) of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Campbell et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Morrow et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tehrani et al., 2023</xref>), as well as measure afterpulse ratio, background, and dark currents relevant to their specific FLIM or FLiP settings. While these input parameters do not alter the general insights from this study, they affect quantitative values and it is thus crucial to accurately match experimental conditions to enhance the rigor of experimental design and data interpretation.</p>

<title>Insights into measurement uncertainty of FLIM</title>
<p>Beyond providing a package to realistically simulate FLIM data, our results also provide insights into critical questions for FLIM usage in biology that were not previously available. Quantifying the uncertainty of fluorescence lifetime measurements is a key aspect of any measurement but is often neglected. Our results provide the amplitude of the error bars and reveal the sources of bias and noise in fluorescence lifetime measurements in realistic biological experiments. Therefore, these results facilitate the disambiguation of signals from noise in data interpretation and empower FLIM users to design optimal experiments by precisely evaluating the compromise between the SNR, field-of-view size, and imaging speed.</p>

<title>Insights into expression level dependence of FLIM</title>
<p>Our analysis of expression level dependence demonstrates that small quantitative changes can impact qualitative conclusions: Because of the influence of autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background, changes in sensor expression levels can lead to changes in lifetime measurements.</p>
<p>This challenges the widely held assumptions about the very advantage of fluorescence lifetime measurements: Its insensitivity to sensor expression levels. While this issue is less problematic when the same sample is compared over short periods (for example minutes), it can lead to misinterpretation when fluorescence lifetime is compared across prolonged periods (for example days or weeks) or between samples with different sensor expression levels (for example between individual animals). Thus, apparent changes in fluorescence lifetime observed over days, across cell types, or subcellular compartments may reflect variations in sensor expression levels rather than true differences in biological signals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Therefore, considering biologically realistic factors in FLiSimBA is essential, as it qualitatively impacts the conclusions.</p>
<p>Importantly, our results not only highlight this issue but also provide a solution by defining the range where expression levels do not significantly affect lifetime (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Practically, for a sensor with medium brightness delivered via in utero electroporation, adeno-associated virus, or as a knock-in gene, the brightness may not always fall within the expression level-independent regime. Therefore, these analyses are critical for identifying the conditions in which FLIM and FLiP can be reliably used to compare biosensor measurements over chronic time periods, across animals, and to quantify absolute levels of biological signals.</p>

<title>Insights into future FLIM innovation</title>
<p>Our quantitative platform demonstrates how we can improve FLIM through future innovation. First, whereas our simulations showed little advantage of hybrid detectors over GaAsP PMTs in terms of the SNR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), different types of hybrid detectors offer narrower IRFs at the cost of lower quantum efficiency (QE). FLiSimBA enables the evaluation of the tradeoff between IRF width and QE. Additionally, hybrid detectors are more advantageous for sensors with shorter fluorescence lifetimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Trinh &amp; Esposito, 2021</xref>) and FLiSimBA allows exploration of the range in which they provide clear benefits in biological settings.</p>
<p>Second, we quantified how the development of red or far-red sensors outside the autofluorescence spectrum, along with minimizing detector dark currents, can significantly reduce or eliminate the expression level dependence of lifetime measurements (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This opens exciting directions for sensor makers and hardware developers. The impact of these innovations on fluorescence lifetime consistency depends on the metrics used to measure lifetime (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Fitted parameters, such as fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic>, are preferred over empirical lifetime when the lifetime histogram can be described by multi-exponential decay equations and sufficient photons are collected for fitting, because they are less sensitive to background interference (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In contrast, empirical lifetime is used when sensor lifetime decay is too complex, or when photon counts are too low for fitting. FLiSimBA can be used to test multiple fitting methods and lifetime metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bajzer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Y.-I. Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mannam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Periasamy, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rowley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Steinbach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stringari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xiao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zickus et al., 2020</xref>), and this will be an important future direction for identifying the best analysis method for specific experimental conditions.</p>
<p>Third, we demonstrate the feasibility and specify sensor parameters that enable the use of fluorescence lifetime and color spectrum as two orthogonal axes to distinguish many biological signals through intensity-based real-time imaging of biosensors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This approach promises to open doors to enhancing the ability of multiplexed imaging by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Thus, FLiSimBA and our quantitative framework are instrumental for enabling optimal experimental design, rigorous data interpretation, and pushing the limit of FLIM imaging through innovations.</p>

Fluorescence decay histograms from 19 images of two brain slices from a single mouse were averaged. These histograms included contributions from both autofluorescence and background signals (due to dark current and ambient light leakage).

<label>4.</label><title>Afterpulse and background fluorescence</title>
<p>The afterpulse ratio of the PMT was derived from the IRF histogram and the background fluorescence measurement described above. Then the photons per channel were averaged at the end of the IRF histograms, where the distribution was even across time channels. The number was subtracted by the background fluorescence and the result was used as the afterpulse. Subsequently, the ratio between the number of photons contributing to the afterpulse and the total number of photons from the IRF histogram was calculated as the afterpulse ratio. For GaAsP PMTs, an afterpulse ratio of 0.32% was used in all figures except for <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, where a ratio of 0.40% was used to match the specific experimental data.</p>
<p>Afterpulse and background fluorescence were simulated by sampling with replacement from an even distribution across time channels. The number of photons contributing to background fluorescence (<italic>F<sub>background</sub></italic>) was determined from autofluorescence fitting. Up to 10% fluctuation was introduced to the number of photons with the random draw of an integer within the range of <italic>F<sub>background</sub></italic>*(1±5%). For the low background conditions in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, the number of photons contributing to the background was half of the background photon count for the remaining figures. The number of photons from the afterpulse was determined by the afterpulse ratio (0.32% or 0.40% for GaAsP PMTs and 0 for hybrid detectors) multiplied by the number of photons from the sensor fluorescence.</p>
<p>Please note that we used the specific parameters described above for this study, including using the double-exponential decay model and parameters for FLIM-AKAR, the measured autofluorescence amount and distribution from acute mouse brain slices at a specific age, the empirically measure IRF, afterpulse ratio, and background fluorescence for our 2pFLIM microscope. These input parameters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) should be altered to adapt to different biological applications. Although they do not change the conclusions of this study (e.g., there is expression level-dependent and -independent regime for fluorescence lifetime), the specific input parameters would alter the quantitative thresholds (e.g., the precise threshold above which fluorescence lifetime is not significantly altered by expression levels).</p>

<title>FLIM analysis</title>
<p>Two metrics were used for subsequent data visualization and analysis. First, after the fluorescence lifetime histograms were fitted with <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 3</xref>, fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic>, corresponding to the proportion of slower decay (2.14 ns), was used for data visualization and analysis. Second, the empirical lifetimes of all the photons were calculated based on <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 2</xref>.</p>
<p>For all figures except for <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, the time range from 0.489 ns to 11.5 ns was used for both <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> fitting and empirical lifetime calculations, with the first time channel within this range used as time 0.0488 ns (12.5 ns/256 time channels) in the calculation.</p>
<p>For comparison between experimental and simulated data, we determined the photon counts and <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> of experimental conditions from fluorescence lifetime histograms from whole fields of view in brain slices. We subtracted empirically collected autofluorescence (which includes dark currents, SHG, and background) and afterpulse (with an afterpulse ratio of 0.4%) from the histogram to derive the sensor histogram. Sensor histograms from seven experimental acquisitions were averaged and fitted with <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 3</xref>, using a lifetime range of 1.8 to 11.5 ns, with <italic>SHG</italic> and <italic>F<sub>background</sub></italic> set to 0.

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>For each simulated condition, the mean and STD of the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or the empirical lifetime of the 500 simulation repeats were calculated.</p>
<p>For <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the minimum detectable difference (MDD) was calculated by:
<disp-formula id="eqn6">

<p>where SE refers to the standard error, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="572686v4_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the estimated mean difference between two distributions. With a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, the z value is 2.806. which was used for the calculations in this study. Under a certain sensor photon number, the STD of the two metrics under different <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> conditions (condition 1 and condition 2) were similar. Thus, given a certain sensor photon count, the STD under <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> condition (0.5 in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) was used to calculate the MDD:
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="572686v4_eqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where n is the number of data pairs used to analyze whether there was a significant change in the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or empirical lifetime.</p>
<p>For <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, to determine whether a certain amount of sensor expression-induced apparent change in the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or empirical lifetime was significant, t tests were used to compare whether there was any statistically significant difference between two distributions with the same simulated <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> but different photon numbers. The critical value of the t statistic is z = 1.96 for a significance level of 0.05. The equation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="572686v4_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> was used to calculate the fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or empirical lifetime difference that would be statistically significant. As the photon count increased, there was an intersection where the mean fitted <italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> or empirical lifetime difference between the two distributions became less than the difference that would reach statistical significance, and this intersection point (determined by linear interpolation of the curves plotted on a log scale for both axes) was used to determine the minimum number of sensor photons required to tolerate a specific amount of change in sensor fluorescence.</p>
<p>Detailed information on the quantification, sample size, and statistical tests used are summarized in the Figure Legends, Figures, and Results. T tests were performed to test whether two distributions had equal means. For analysis of variance, one-way or two-way ANOVA was performed followed by multiple comparison tests.</p>

<title>Simulation and analysis of multiplexed imaging with fluorescence intensity and lifetime data</title>
<p>For <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>, the simulations were performed with a laser cycle of 50 ns to capture the fluorescence decay curve of Sensor 2 with a longer lifetime constant. The fluorescence lifetime histograms of sensor 1 and sensor 2 were simulated as single exponential decays:
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="572686v4_eqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where the decay constants <italic>τ</italic> for sensor 1 and sensor 2 are different.</p>
<p>To simulate the fluorescence lifetime with single exponential decay, we generated a population of photons with <xref rid="eqn8" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 8</xref> with <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>equal to 1,000,000. For sensor 1, the population was generated with <italic>τ</italic> = 2.0 ns. For sensor 2, the population was generated with <italic>τ</italic> = 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, or 6.0 ns.</p>
<p>Fluorescence lifetime histograms of sensor 1 and sensor 2 were generated by sampling from the corresponding population, followed by IRF convolution. The histograms of sensor 1 and sensor 2 were added together as the combined histogram. Autofluorescence and background signals were simulated with the same probability density function as above but with 3.2 fold of photon numbers to accommodate for the longer acquisition time needed with a longer laser cycle to reach the same number of photons. Afterpulse was added proportional to the sensor photons as described above.</p>
<p>The combined histograms were fitted by a double exponential decay (<xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 3</xref>), with fixed <italic>τ<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>τ<sub>2</sub></italic> that were used for the simulation that generated the histograms. The fitting was performed with the Gauss-Newton nonlinear least-square fitting algorithm. <italic>F<sub>0,</sub> P<sub>1</sub></italic>, and <italic>P<sub>2</sub></italic> generated from the fitting were used to calculate the number of photons that contributed to sensor 1 and sensor 2, respectively.</p>
<p>The statistical power to detect the difference between two distributions of sensor intensity was calculated as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="572686v4_eqn9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where <italic>normcdf</italic> is the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution, Δ<italic>I</italic> is the intensity (photon number) change to be detected, SE refers to the standard error, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="572686v4_inline3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the estimator of the mean difference between two distributions.</p>
<p>The relationship between the statistical power <italic>β</italic> and the intensity change ratio (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>) was fitted to a 5-parameter logistic curve:
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="572686v4_eqn10.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where A, B, C, D, and E are constants in the equation. The intensity change ratio corresponding to a statistical power of 80% is determined by solving the equation with <italic>β</italic><sub>(Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>0)</sub> = 0.8 and defined as the minimum detectable Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>.</p>

<p>This study presents an <bold>important</bold> computational framework, FLiSimBA (Fluorescence Lifetime Simulation for Biological Applications), for modeling experimental limitations in Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM). FLiSimBA is readily available in MATLAB and Python, enables users to simulate effects of noise and varying sensor expression levels, and provides practical guidance for both lifetime imaging experiments and biosensor development. The analyses are robust, and the evidence supporting the tool's utility in distinguishing between multiple lifetime signals is <bold>compelling</bold>, indicating strong potential for multiplexed dynamic imaging. However, users should also consider that the tool's effectiveness depends on the suitability of a two-component discrete exponential model.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, Ma et al. aimed to determine previously uncharacterized contributions of tissue autofluorescence, detector afterpulse, and background noise on fluorescence lifetime measurement interpretations.

<p>A major strength of the study is the effort to present results in a clear and understandable way given that most researchers do not think about these factors on a day-to-day basis. The model code is available and written in Matlab, which should make it readily accessible, although a version in other common languages such as Python might help with dissemination in the community. One potential weakness is that the model uses parameters that are determined in a</p>
<p>specific way by the authors, and it is not clear how vastly other biological tissue and microscope setups may differ from the values used by the authors.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors achieved their aims of demonstrating how common factors</p>
<p>(autofluorescence, background, and sensor expression) will affect lifetime measurements and they present a clear strategy for understanding how sensor expression may confound results if not properly considered.

This work will also point to future directions for improving experiments using fluorescence lifetime biosensors and the development of new sensors with more favorable properties.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comments and helpful suggestions. We now also include FLiSimBA simulation code in Python in addition to Matlab to make it more accessible to the community.</p>
<p>One advantage of FLiSimBA is that the simulation package is flexible and adaptable, allowing users to input parameters based on the specific sensors, hardware, and autofluorescence measurements for their biological and optical systems. We used parameters based on a FRETbased sensor, measured autofluorescence from mouse tissue, and measured dark count/after pulse of our specific GaAsP PMT in this manuscript as examples. In Discussion and Materials and methods, we now emphasize this advantage and further clarify how these parameters can be adapted to diverse tissues, imaging systems, and sensors based on individual experiments. We further explain that these input parameters will not affect the conclusions of our study, but the specific input parameters would alter the quantitative thresholds.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>By using simulations of common signal artefacts introduced by acquisition hardware and the sample itself, the authors are able to demonstrate methods to estimate their influence on the estimated lifetime, and lifetime proportions, when using signal fitting for fluorescence lifetime imaging.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They consider a range of effects such as after-pulsing and background signal, and present a range of situations that are relevant to many experimental situations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness is that they do not present enough detail on the fitting method that they used to estimate lifetimes and proportions. The method used will influence the results significantly. They seem to only use the &quot;empirical lifetime&quot; which is not a state of the art algorithm. The method used to deconvolve two multiplexed exponential signals is not given.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comments and constructive feedback. Our revision based on the reviewer’s suggestions has made our manuscript clearer and more user friendly. We originally described the detail of the fitting methods in Materials and methods. Given the importance of these methodological details for evaluating the conclusions of this study, we have moved the description of the fitting method from Materials and methods to Results. In addition, we provide further clarification and more details of the rationale of using these different methods of lifetime estimates in Discussion to aid users in choosing the best metric for evaluating fluorescence lifetime data.</p>
<p>More specifically, we modified our writing to highlight the following.</p>
<p>(1) In Results, we describe that lifetime histograms were fitted to Equation 3 with the GaussNewton nonlinear least-square fitting algorithm and the fitted P&lt;sub1 was used as lifetime estimation.</p>
<p>(2) In Results, we clarify that our simulation of multiplexed imaging was modeled with two sensors, each displaying a single exponential decay, but the two sensors have different decay constants. We also describe that Equation 3 with the Gauss-Newton nonlinear least-square fitting algorithm was used to deconvolve the two multiplexed exponential signals (Fig. 8)</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The analyses have relied on a key premise that the fluorescence lifetime in the system can be described as two-component discrete exponential decay. This means that the experimenter should ensure that this is the right model for their fluorophores a priori and should keep in mind that the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophores may not be perfectly described by a twocomponent discrete exponential (for which alternative algorithms have been implemented: e.g., Steinbach, P. J. Anal. Biochem. 427, 102-105, (2012)). In this regard, I also couldn't find how good the fits were for each simulation and experimental data to the given fitting equation (Equation 2, for example, for Figure 2C data).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback. We agree that the FLiSimBA users should ensure that the right decay equations are used to describe the fluorescent sensors. In this study, we used a FRET-based PKA sensor FLIM-AKAR to provide proof-of-principle demonstration of the capability of FLiSimBA. The donor fluorophore of FLIM-AKAR, truncated monomeric enhanced GFP, displays a single exponential decay. FLIM-AKAR, a FRET-based sensor, displays a double exponential decay. The time constants of the two exponential components were determined and reported previously (Chen, et al, Neuron (2017)).  Thus, a double exponential decay equation with known τ<sub>1</sub> and τ<sub>2</sub> was used for both simulation and fitting. The goodness of fit is now provided in Supplementary Fig. 1 for both simulated and experimental data. In addition to referencing our prior study characterizing the double exponential decay model of FLIM-AKAR in Materials and methods, we have emphasized in Discussion the versality of FLiSimBA to adapt to different sensors, tissues, and analysis methods, and the importance of using the right mathematical models to describe the fluorescence decay of specific sensors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, in Figure 2C, the 'sensor only' simulation without accounting for autofluorescence (as seen in Sensor + autoF) or afterpulse and background fluorescence (as seen in Final simulated data) seems to recapitulate the experimental data reasonably well. So, at least in this particular case where experimental data is limited by its broad spread with limited data points, being able to incorporate the additional noise factors into the simulation tool didn't seem to matter too much.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the original Fig 2C, the sensor fluorescence was much higher than the contributions from autofluorescence, afterpulse, and background signals, resulting in minimal effects of these other factors, as the reviewer noted. This original figure was based on photon counts from single neurons expressing FLIM-AKAR. For the rest of the manuscript, photon counts were based on whole fields of view (FOV). Since the FOV includes cells that do not express fluorescent sensors, the influence of autofluorescence, dark currents, and background is much more pronounced, as shown in Fig. 2B.</p>
<p>Both approaches – using photon counts from the whole FOV or from individual neurons – have their justifications. Photon counts from the whole FOV simulate data from fluorescence lifetime photometry (FLiP), whereas photon counts from individual neurons simulate data from fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). However, the choice of approach does not affect the conclusions of the manuscript, as a range of photon count values are simulated. To maintain consistency throughout the manuscript, we have revised the photon counts in this figure (now Supplementary Fig. 1C) to match those from the whole FOV.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have made some modifications in our analyses of Supplementary Fig. 1C and Fig. 2B, detailed in the “FLIM analysis” section of Materials and methods. For instance, to minimize system artifact interference at the histogram edges, we now use a narrower time range (1.8 to 11.5 ns) for fitting and empirical lifetime calculation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors report how autofluorescence was measured from &quot;imaged brain slices from mice at postnatal 15 to 19 days of age without sensor expression.&quot; However, it remains unclear how many acute slices and animals were used (for example, were all 15um x 15um FOV from a single slice) and if mouse age affects autofluorescence quantification. Furthermore, would in vivo measurements have different autofluorescence conditions given that blood flow would be active? It would help if the authors more clearly explained how reliable their autofluorescence measurement is by clarifying how they obtained it, whether this would vary across brain areas, and whether in vitro vs in vivo conditions would affect autofluorescence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added description in Materials and methods that for autofluorescence ‘Fluorescence decay histograms from 19 images of two brain slices from a single mouse were averaged.’ We have added in Discussion that users should carefully ‘measure autofluorescence that matches the age, brain region, and data collection conditions (e.g., ex vivo or in vivo) of their tissue…’, and emphasize that FLiSimBA offers customization of inputs, and it is important for users to adapt the inputs such as autofluorescence to their experimental conditions. We also clarify in Discussion that the change of input parameters such as autofluorescence across age and brain region would not affect the general insights from this study, but will affect quantitative values.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Does sensor expression level issues arise more with in-utero electroporation compared to AAV-based delivery of biosensors? A brief comment on this in the discussion may help as most users in the field today may be using AAV strategies to deliver biosensors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our experience, in-utero electroporation results in higher sensor expression than AAV-based delivery, and so pose less concern for expression-level dependence. However, both delivery methods can result in expression level dependence, especially with a sensor that is not bright. We have added in Discussion ‘For a sensor with medium brightness delivered via in utero electroporation, adeno-associated virus, or as a knock-in gene, the brightness may not always fall within the expression level-independent regime.’</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 1. Should the x-axis on the top figures be &quot;Time (ns)&quot; instead of &quot;Lifetime (ns)&quot;?</p>
<p>Similarly in Figure 8A&amp;B, wouldn't it make more sense to have the x-axis be Time not Lifetime?</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>(4) Figure 2b: why is the empirical lifetime close to 3.5ns? Shouldn't it be somewhere between</p>
<p>2.14 and 0.69?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our empirical lifetime calculation, we did not set the peak channel to have a time of 0.0488 ns (i.e. the laser cycle 12.5 ns divided by 256 time channels). Rather, we set the first time channel within a defined calculation range (i.e. 1.8 ns in Supplementary Fig. 1B) to have a time of 0.0488 ns (i.e.). Thus, the empirical lifetime exceeds 2.14 ns and depends on the time range of the histogram used for calculation.</p>
<p>For Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. 1C, we have now adjusted the range to 1.8-11.5 ns to eliminate FLIM artifacts at the histogram edges in our experimental data, resulting in an empirical lifetime around 2.255 ns. In contrast, the range for calculating the empirical lifetime of simulated data in the rest of the study (e.g. Fig. 4D) is 0.489-11.5 ns, yielding a larger lifetime of ~3.35 ns.</p>
<p>We have clarified these details and our rationale in Materials and methods.</p>

<p>(5) Figure 2b: how come the afterpulse+background contributes more to the empirical lifetime than the autofluorescence (shorter lifetime). This was unclear in the results text why autofluorescence photons did not alter empirical lifetime as much as did the afterpulse/background.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With a histogram range from 1.8 ns to 11.5 ns used in Fig. 2B, the empirical lifetime for FLIM-AKAR sensor fluorescence, autofluorescence, and background/afterpulse are: 2-2.3 ns, around 1.69 ns, and around 4.90 ns. The larger difference of background/afterpulse from FLIM-AKAR sensor fluorescence leads to larger influence of afterpulse+background than autofluorescence. We have added an explanation of this in Results.</p>

<p>(6) One overall suggestion for an improvement that could help active users of lifetime biosensors understand the consequences would be to show either a real or simulated example of a &quot;typical experiment&quot; conducted using FLIM-AKAR and how an incorrect interpretation could be drawn as a consequence of these artifacts. For example, do these confounds affect experiments involving comparisons across animals more than within-subject experiments such as washing a drug onto the brain slice, and the baseline period is used to normalize the change in signal? I think this type of direct discussion will help biosensor users more deeply grasp how these factors play out in common experiments being conducted.</p>

<p>We have added the following in Discussion, ‘…While this issue is less problematic when the same sample is compared over short periods (e.g. minutes), It can lead to misinterpretation when fluorescence lifetime is compared across prolonged periods or between samples when comparison is made across chronic time periods or between samples with different sensor expression levels. For example, apparent changes in fluorescence lifetime observed over days, across cell types, or subcellular compartments may actually reflect variations in sensor expression levels rather than true differences in biological signals (Fig. 6), Therefore, considering biologically realistic factors in FLiSimBA is essential, as it qualitatively impacts the conclusions.’</p>

<p>The paper would be improved with more detail on the fitting methods, and the use of state-of-theart methods. Consult for example the introduction of this paper where many methods are listed: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/19/7293">https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/19/7293</ext-link></p>

<p>We have moved the description of the Gauss-Newton nonlinear least-square fitting algorithm from Materials and methods to Results to enhance clarity. We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to combine FLiSimBA with various analysis methods. However, the primary focus of our manuscript is to call for attention of how specific contributing factors in biological experiments influence FLIM data, and to provide a tool that rigorously considers these factors to simulate FLIM data, which can then be used for fitting. Therefore, we did not expand the scope of our manuscript. Instead, we have added in the Discussion that ‘‘FLiSimBA can be used to test multiple fitting methods and lifetime metrics as an exciting future direction for identifying the best analysis method for specific experimental conditions’, citing relevant references.</p>

<p>I would also improve the content of the GitHub repository as it is very hard to identify to source code used for simulation and fitting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have reorganized and relabeled our GitHub repository and now have three folders labeled as ‘Simulation_inMatlab’, ‘DataAnalysis_inMatlab’, and ‘SimulationAnalysis_inPython’. We also updated the clarification of the contents of each folder in the README file.</p>

<p>(1) P. 10 &quot;For example, to detect a P1 change of 0.006 or a lifetime change of 5 ps with one sample measurement in each comparison group, approximately 300,000 photons are needed.&quot; If I am reading the graphs in Figures 3B and C, this sentence is talking about the red line. However, the intersection of 0.006 in the MDD of P1 in 3B and red is not 3E5 photons. And the intersection of 0.005 ns and red in 3C is not 3E5 photons either. Are you sure you are talking about n=1? Maybe the values are correct for the blue curve with n=5.</p>

<p>Thank you for catching our error. We have corrected the text to ‘with five sample measurements’.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 2 (B) legend: It would be helpful to specify what is being compared in the legend. For example, consider revising &quot;* p &lt; 0.05 vs sensor only; n.s. not significant vs sensor + autoF; # p &lt; 0.05 vs sensor + autoF. Two-way ANOVA with Šídák's multiple comparisons test&quot; to &quot;* p &lt;0.05 for sensor + auto F (cyan) vs sensor only; n.s. not significant for final simulated data (purple) vs sensor + autoF; # p &lt; 0.05 for final simulated data (purple) vs sensor + autoF. Twoway ANOVA with Šídák's multiple comparisons test&quot;.</p>

<p>We’ve made the change and thanks for the suggestion to make it clearer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 2 (c) Can you please show the same Two-way ANOVA test values for Experimental vs. Sensor only and for Experimental vs. Sensor + autoF? Currently, the value (n.s.) is marked only for Experimental vs. Final simulation. Given that the experimental data are sparse (compared to the simulations), it seems likely that there may be no significant difference among the 3 different simulations regarding how well they match the experimental data. Also, can you specify the P1 and P2 of the experimental data  used to generate the simulated data on this panel? Also, what is the reason why P1=0.5 was used for panels A and B, instead of the value matching the experimental value?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, we have included statistical tests in the figure (now Supplementary Fig. 1C). Please see our response to the Public Review of Reviewer 3’s comments as well as our changes in Materials and Methods on other changes and their rationale for this figure. We have now specified the P<sub>1</sub> value of the experimental data used to generate the simulated data on this panel both in Figure Legends and Materials and Methods. Based on the suggestion, we have now used the same P<sub>1</sub> value in Fig. 2B.</p>
