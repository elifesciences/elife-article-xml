<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Neuroimaging studies have provided a wealth of information about when and where changes in brain activity might be expected during reading. We sought to better understand the computational steps that give rise to such task-related modulations of neural activity by using a convolutional neural network to model the macro-scale computations necessary to perform single-word recognition. We presented the model with stimuli that had been shown to human volunteers in an earlier magnetoencephalography (<sc>meg</sc>) experiment and evaluated whether the same experimental effects could be observed in both brain activity and model. In a direct comparison between model and <sc>meg</sc> recordings, the model accurately predicted the amplitude changes of three evoked <sc>meg</sc> response components commonly observed during single-word reading. In contrast to traditional models of reading, our model directly operates on the pixel values of an image containing text. This allowed us to simulate the whole gamut of processing from the detection and segmentation of letter shapes to word-form identification, with the deep learning architecture facilitating inclusion of a large vocabulary of 10k Finnish words. Interestingly, the key to achieving the desired behavior was to use a noisy activation function for the units in the model as well as to obey word frequency statistics when repeating stimuli during training. We conclude that the deep learning techniques that revolutionized models of object recognition can also create models of reading that can be straightforwardly compared to neuroimaging data, which will greatly facilitate testing and refining theories on language processing in the brain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>W<sc>hat</sc> computational operations is the brain performing when it recognizes some splotches of ink on a piece of paper as a meaningful word? This question has been the focus of a large number of neuroimaging studies that examine brain activity during reading. Noninvasive measurement techniques such as electroencephalography (<sc>eeg</sc>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grainger and Holcomb, 2009</xref>), magnetoencephalography (<sc>meg</sc>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Salmelin, 2007</xref>) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (f<sc>mri</sc>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Price, 2012</xref>) have provided a wealth of information about when and where changes in activity might be expected during various tasks involving orthographic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carreiras et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of visual word recognition, a lot of these results come in the form of changes in the amplitude of specific components of the neural response evoked by stimuli that are designed to create interesting experimental contrasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Luck, 2014</xref>). Such evoked components reflect macro-level computations — that is, the net result of thousands of individual biological neurons working together. Taken together, the results indicate the presence of a processing pipeline, starting with the extraction of low-level visual features (e.g., edges, line segments), which are subsequently refined into more complex features (e.g., letter shapes) and further into lexical features (e.g., bigrams, words) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dehaene et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grainger and Holcomb, 2009</xref>). While neuroimaging studies provide us with information about what processing steps are performed where and when, the observed data alone yield little information as to what kind of computations are performed during these steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Poeppel, 2012</xref>). To develop such an understanding, we need to make these computations explicit, model them, and test and refine the model against the data provided by imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barber and Kutas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doerig et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Price, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to computationally reproduce the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref>, which is a representative <sc>meg</sc> study that employed experimental contrasts designed to study key processing steps throughout the entire visual word recognition pipeline. The authors catalogued the effects of the experimental contrasts on the amplitudes of all major evoked <sc>meg</sc> responses found in the data, and concluded that the significant effects could be attributed to three components that dominate the early <sc>meg</sc> time course during visual word recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jobard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Salmelin, 2007</xref>), namely:</p>
<p><bold>type-<sc>i</sc></bold> This component peaks occipitally around 100 ms after stimulus onset, is modulated by the visual complexity of the stimulus and hence thought to reflect the processing of low-level visual features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tarkiainen et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref> used a contrast between stimuli with and without added visual noise to highlight this processing stage.</p>
<p><bold>type-<sc>ii</sc></bold> This component peaks occipito-temporally around 150 ms after stimulus onset, and is modulated by whether the stimulus contains letters of the participant’s native alphabet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Parviainen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tarkiainen et al., 1999</xref>). Hence, this component is colloquially referred to as the “letter string” response and thought to reflect letter shape detection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref> used a contrast between letter strings and symbol strings (visually similar to letters but not part of the Finnish alphabet) to highlight this processing stage.</p>
<p><bold><sc>n</sc>400m</bold> This component peaks at around 400 ms after stimulus onset, and is often studied in the context of priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kutas and Federmeier, 2011</xref>), but experimental effects can also be observed when using isolated stimuli. For example, this component is modulated by the lexicality of the stimulus, hence associated with more lexical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Halgren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Helenius et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Salmelin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Service et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref> used a contrast between consonant strings, valid Finnish words and pseudowords to highlight this processing stage.</p>
<p>These three components are also observed in <sc>eeg</sc> studies (referred to as the <sc>p1, n1/n170</sc> and <sc>n400</sc> components respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brem et al., 2009</xref>)). Together, they are indicative of three processing stages during visual word recognition: basic visual analysis, orthographic analysis and lexical analysis. To explore possible cognitive computations during these stages, we sought to create a computational model that performs the macro-level computations needed to achieve visual word recognition in such a manner as to reproduce the behavior of the three evoked components when presented with the same stimuli as a human participant.</p>
<p>In past decades, several computational models have been created that successfully capture some aspects of visual word recognition. For the purposes of this study, we draw a distinction between the older “traditional-style” models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Norris, 2013</xref>) and the large artificial neural networks trained through deep learning that have been gaining popularity as models of brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Richards et al., 2019</xref>). We will show that a model will need to combine elements from both approaches if it is to be able to reproduce the stimulus-dependent modulation of all evoked components mentioned above.</p>
<p>Amongst the first models of visual word recognition, the interactive activation and competition (<sc>iac</sc>) model of letter perception by McClelland and Rumelhart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">McClelland and Rumelhart, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rumelhart and McClelland, 1982</xref>), showed how the interplay of bottom-up and top-down connections results in a system capable of “filling in the blanks” when faced with a partially obscured word. This model was later extended to model semantics as well, showing how the activation of some semantic features (“is alive”, “is a bird”) leads to the subsequent activation of more semantic features (“can fly”, “lays eggs”), in what became known as the parallel distributed processing (<sc>pdp</sc>) framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">McClelland and Rogers, 2003</xref>). Note that while models such as these consist of many interconnected units, those units and their connections do not aim to mimic a biological connectome, but are an abstract representation of macro-level computations performed by one. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coltheart et al. (2001)</xref> pointed out the benefits of explicitly defined connections in their dual-route cascaded (<sc>drc</sc>) model of visual word recognition and reading out loud, as they grant the researcher exact control over the macro-level computations. However, as the scope of the models increases, “hand-wiring” the connections in the model becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore, most current models employ back-propagation to learn the connection weights between units based on a large training dataset. Together, <sc>iac</sc>, <sc>pdp</sc> and <sc>drc</sc> models have been shown to account for many behavioral findings, such as reaction times and recognition errors, in both healthy volunteers and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">McClelland and Rogers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McLeod et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Perry et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Laszlo and Plaut (2012)</xref> demonstrated how a <sc>pdp</sc>-style model can produce an N400-like signal by summing the activity of the computational units in specific layers of the model.</p>
<p>However, none of the aforementioned models can produce detailed quantitative data that can be directly compared with neuroimaging data, leaving researchers to focus on finding indirect evidence that the same macro-level computations occur in both the model and the brain, with varying levels of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barber and Kutas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jobard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Protopapas et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the computational constrains at the time, the simulated environments in these models are extremely simplified (e.g. the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Laszlo and Plaut (2012)</xref> model operated exclusively on 3-letter words), whereas the brain data will, by nature, reflect the reading process in more varied and realistic visual settings. An even bigger limitation is the manner in which the initial visual input is presented to the model. These models make use of “letter banks”, where each letter of a written word is encoded in as a separate group of inputs. The letters themselves are encoded as either a collection of 16 predefined line segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coltheart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">McClelland and Rumelhart, 1981</xref>) or a binary code indicating the letter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Laszlo and Armstrong, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Laszlo and Plaut, 2012</xref>). This rather high level of visual representation sidesteps having to deal with issues such as visual noise, letters with different scales, rotations and fonts, segmentation of the individual letters, and so on. More importantly, it makes it impossible to create the visual noise and symbol string conditions used in the <sc>meg</sc> study we were trying to reproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al., 2011</xref>) to modulate the type-<sc>i</sc> and type-<sc>ii</sc> components. In order to model the process of visual word recognition to the extent where one may reproduce neuroimaging studies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref>, we need to start with a model of vision that is able to directly operate on the pixels of a stimulus.</p>

<p>Models of vision seem to have converged on a sequence of convolution-and-pooling operations to simulate the macro-level behavior of the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lindsay, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Serre et al., 2007</xref>). Such models have become much more powerful as advances in deep learning and its software ecosystem are rapidly changing our notion of what is computationally tractable to model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Richards et al., 2019</xref>). Convolutional neural networks (<sc>cnns</sc>) have emerged that perform scale- and rotation-invariant visual object recognition at very high levels of accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Krizhevsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, they model some functions of the visual cortex well enough that a direct comparison between network state and neuroimaging data has become possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Devereux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Schrimpf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Visual word recognition can be seen as a specialized form of object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Grainger, 2018</xref>). Developmental studies suggest that orthographic-specific neuroimaging findings such as the visual word form area (<sc>vwfa</sc>) and the type-<sc>ii</sc> evoked components emerge after part of our established vision system is reconfigured as we learn to read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cohen and Dehaene, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Parviainen et al., 2006</xref>). Studies on the visual cortex of non-human primates have shown that visual systems even without extensive exposure to written language have neural representations that carry enough information to distinguish letter and word shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rajalingham et al., 2020</xref>), even accounting for distortions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Katti and Arun, 2022</xref>), and this finding was reproduced in <sc>cnns</sc>. Therefore, <sc>cnns</sc> may very well be suitable tools for increasing the scale of traditional connectionist models of reading, thus allowing for a much more realistic modeling of the early orthographic processing steps than what has been possible so far. Indeed, earlier work has established that training a <sc>cnn</sc> to classify written words can coerce it to form a <sc>vwfa</sc>-like region on top of an existing visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hannagan et al., 2021</xref>), and cause it to form high-level orthographic representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Katti and Arun, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Testolin et al., 2017</xref>) which can be used by a linear regression algorithm to predict human <sc>meg</sc> activity in the visual cortex. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Caucheteux and King, 2022</xref>)</p>
<p>Whereas traditional-style models are typically designed to replicate a specific experimental effect in a biologically feasible manner, deep learning models are designed to perform in a more naturalistic setting, regardless of biological plausibility. Consequently, traditional-style models have been evaluated by comparing the timing and amount of the simulated activity to the amplitude of an evoked component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Laszlo and Armstrong, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Laszlo and Plaut, 2012</xref>) or human reaction times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agrawal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Norris and Kinoshita, 2012</xref>) in a tightly controlled experimental setting, and deep learning models have been evaluated using data from participants who are operating in a more challenging setting, such as watching movies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Huth et al., 2012</xref>), reading sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Caucheteux and King, 2022</xref>) or listening to stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Huth et al., 2016</xref>). For the latter type of comparisons, information-based metrics are used. For example, representational similarity analysis (rsa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>) quantifies the extent to which the inner state of a model discriminates between the same types of stimuli as a neural response, and BrainScore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Schrimpf et al., 2020</xref>) quantifies the extent to which a (usually linear) regressor or classifier can use the inner state of a model to predict brain activity. However, information-based metrics by themselves provide at best only a rough indication of how closely a model mimics the computations performed by the brain. It would be desirable to establish a more direct link between a model and the experimental results obtained in neuroscience studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bowers et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, in the current study, we evaluated the performance of a <sc>cnn</sc> in the spirit of the traditional models, namely by its ability to accurately reproduce the behavior of the type-<sc>i</sc>, type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m responses in the tightly controlled experimental setting of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref>. The resulting model combines the ability of deep learning models to operate directly on the pixels of a stimulus and to have a large vocabulary, with the ability of traditional models to replicate specific experimental results.</p>
<p>We started with a basic <sc>cnn</sc> architecture, namely <sc>vgg-11</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015</xref>), that had been pre-trained to classify images and evolved it into a model of visual word recognition by re-training it to classify written words. Different versions of the model were created by introducing slight modifications to the base architecture and using different training regimens. The performance of the trained models was evaluated by presenting them with the same set of stimuli that had been used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref> and comparing the amount of activity within its layers with the amplitude of the type-<sc>i</sc>, type-<sc>ii</sc>, and <sc>n</sc>400m components measured from the human participants.</p>

Performing minimum norm estimate, dynamic statistical parametric mapping (<sc>mne</sc>-d<sc>spm</sc>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dale et al., 2000</xref>) source analysis yielded a comprehensive map of where activity can be found (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), which is used in this study mostly to provide context for a deeper investigation into three peaks of activity that can be observed along the ventral stream. Through guided equivalent current dipole (<sc>ecd</sc>) modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Salmelin, 2010</xref>
), the high-dimensional data was summarized as a sparse set of <sc>ecds</sc>, each one capturing an isolated spatiotemporal component, allowing us to study selected components in more detail. The original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al., 2011</xref>) found three <sc>ecd</sc> groups along the ventral stream that correspond to the type-<sc>i</sc>, type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m responses, based on their location (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), timing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) and responses to the different stimulus types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Similar <sc>ecd</sc> groups were identified in the right hemisphere (Supplementary Figure 1), but the effects were clearer in the left. Therefore, in this study, we re-used the three <sc>ecd</sc> groups on the left hemisphere to serve as ground-truth for our modeling efforts.</p>

<p>To compare the evoked <sc>meg</sc> responses and model layer activity, we collected summary statistics of both, referred to as “response profiles”. For the <sc>ecd</sc> time courses, the response profiles were formed by computing for each stimulus the average signal amplitude in the time intervals indicated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, z-transformed across the stimuli, and averaged across participants to obtain grand-average response profiles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The response profile for the type-<sc>i</sc> response demonstrates how this occipital component is driven by the visual complexity of the stimulus and is characterized by a large response to noise-embedded words relative to all other stimulus types. The type-<sc>ii</sc> response, located further along the fusiform gyrus, exhibits sensitivity to whether the stimulus contains letters that are part of the participant’s native alphabet and, in contrast to the type-<sc>i</sc>, has a reduced response to the noise-embedded words. The <sc>n</sc>400m response is located in the temporal cortex and is modulated by the lexical content of the stimulus, manifested in this study as a larger response to the word-like (i.e., words and pseudowords) versus the non-word-like stimuli.</p>

<title>CNNs produce responses that are qualitatively similar to the MEG evoked components</title>
<p>As a model of the computations underlying the brain activity observed during the <sc>meg</sc> experiment, we used a <sc>vgg-11</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Szegedy et al., 2015</xref>) network architecture, pretrained on ImageNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Russakovsky et al., 2015</xref>). This architecture consists of five convolution layers (three of which perform convolution twice), followed by two densely connected layers, terminating in an output layer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Variations of the model were trained to perform visual word recognition using training sets consisting of images of written Finnish words, rendered in varying fonts, sizes and rotations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In each case, training lasted for 20 epochs, which was enough for each model to obtain a near perfect accuracy (<italic>&gt;</italic> 99%) on an independent validation set, as well as being able to correctly identify the original 118 word stimuli used in the <sc>meg</sc> experiment. During training, the models were never exposed to any of the other stimulus types used in the <sc>meg</sc> experiment (noisy words, symbols, consonant strings, and pseudowords) nor to the exact word stimuli used in that experiment. After training was complete, response profiles for all layers were created by computing the <italic>𝓁</italic>2 norm of the rectified linear unit (<sc>relu</sc>) activations of the units in each layer in response to each stimulus, followed by a z-transformation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, the response profiles of the <sc>cnn</sc> models were compared to those of the three <sc>meg</sc> evoked components, both qualitatively by comparing the effects of the experimental contrasts and quantitatively through correlation. This allowed for an iterative design approach, where the network architecture and training diet of the model were manipulated to address shortcomings in the response profiles, until a model was reached with the response profiles of the contained layers matching those of the type-<sc>i</sc>, type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m evoked <sc>meg</sc> components.</p>

<p>The design process started with an evaluation of the standard <sc>vgg-11</sc> model, trained only on ImageNet. The layer response profiles of this model showed a distinctive pattern in response to the different types of stimuli used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, top row), where the stimuli containing a large amount of noise evoke a very high level of activation in the first convolution layer, which carries over into all other layers. Thus, this model simulated the type-<sc>i</sc> component well, but it failed to simulate the type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components. This is not surprising given that this model is illiterate.</p>
<p>Next, we trained the model on a training set containing a million examples of 250 possible written words (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, second row). After the model had learned to recognize written words (regardless of size, font family and some rotation), the convolution layers still showed a response profile similar to the type-<sc>i</sc>. However, the later linear layers now had a less extreme response to the noisy stimuli and also showed a dissociation between symbols and letters, making their response profiles more similar to that of the type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components of the evoked response. Nonetheless, in this version of the model, the response to noisy stimuli is still too large to be a good fit with the type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m response profiles.</p>
<p>In vision research, having unit activations be noisy has been shown to make a system more robust against image perturbations, both in the brain and in <sc>cnns</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carandini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dapello et al., 2020</xref>). In our case, the addition of a small amount of Gaussian noise to all unit activations in the model reduced markedly the response of the later layers to the noisy stimuli, resulting in less activity to the noisy stimuli than the other stimulus types (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, third row), while the recognition accuracy of the model was not degraded. We found that in order for the model to display this behavior, both noisy unit activations and batch normalization were necessary (Supplementary Figure 2). For this model, the response profiles of the first four convolution layers match that of the type-<sc>i</sc> component, and that of the first connected layer is similar to the type-<sc>ii</sc> component in that both the noisy word stimuli and symbol stimuli evoked smaller responses than stimuli containing letters. However, this model does not contain any layers with response profiles matching that of the <sc>n</sc>400m.</p>
<p>The <sc>n</sc>400m component of the evoked <sc>meg</sc> response is modulated by the lexicality of the stimulus, as demonstrated through the contrast between consonant strings, proper words and pseudowords. Whereas consonant strings evoked a smaller <sc>n</sc>400m response than proper words, pseudowords produced a response that was equal to (or even larger than) that to proper words (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In this version of the model however, the response to pseudowords is less than that of proper words. This can be attributed to the relatively small vocabulary (250 words) of this model. The pseudowords used in the <sc>meg</sc> experiment were selected to be orthographically similar to words in the extended vocabulary of a native Finnish speaker, but not necessarily similar to any of the 250 words in the vocabulary of the model. Increasing the vocabulary size to 1000 words was enough to solve the problem regarding pseudowords and yielded a model where the response profiles of the early convolution layers matched that of the type-<sc>i</sc>, those of the two fully connected layers matched that of the type-<sc>ii</sc>, and that of the output layer matched that of the <sc>n</sc>400m (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, fourth row).</p>
<p>Further increasing the vocabulary size to 10 000 words initially had a detrimental effect on the model’s ability to simulate the <sc>n</sc>400m component, as the response to consonant strings was nearly as strong as that to words and pseudowords (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, fifth row). In order to reproduce the response profile of the <sc>n</sc>400m during all experimental conditions of the <sc>meg</sc> experiment, a model needs to hit a sweet spot regarding specificity of activation to in-vocabulary versus out-of-vocabulary letter strings. We found that this specificity can be controlled by manipulating the frequency in which words are presented to the model during training. By scaling the number of examples of a word in the training set in accordance with the frequency of occurrence of the word in a large text corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kanerva et al., 2014</xref>), a model was obtained with a large vocabulary of 10 000 and the response profiles of the convolution layers matching that of the type-<sc>i</sc>, response profiles of the fully connected layers matching that of the type-<sc>ii</sc>, and the response profiles of the output layer matching that of the <sc>n</sc>400m (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, bottom row). These response profiles were stable across different random initializations when training the model (Supplementary Figure 3).</p>
<p>Various variations in model architecture and training procedure were evaluated (Supplementary Figures 4–6). We found that reducing the number of layers by either removing convolution layers or fully connected layers, resulted in a model that did not exhibit the desired change in response to noisy stimuli from an enlarged response in the early layers to a diminished response in the later layers (Supplementary Figure 4). Increasing the number of layers resulted in a model that is very similar to the final model. As the vocabulary of the final model (10 000) exceeds the number of units in its fully-connected layers, a bottleneck is created in which a sub-lexical representation is formed. The number of units in the fully-connected layers, i.e. the width of the bottleneck, did not greatly affect the response profiles of the model (Supplementary Figure 5).</p>
<p>A model with either randomly initialized weights, or trained only on ImageNet, have response profiles in which each layer resembled that of the type-<sc>i</sc> response (Supplementary Figure 6, top rows). Training on word stimuli was required to simulate the type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components. While starting from a pre-trained model on ImageNet reduced the number of epochs necessary for the model to reach <italic>&gt;</italic>99 % accuracy, pre-training was not found to be strictly necessary in order to arrive at a good model that can simulate all three components (Supplementary Figure 6, bottom rows).</p>

<title>CNNs produce responses that correlate well with the MEG evoked components</title>
<p>Since both model layer activation and <sc>meg</sc> evoked response amplitudes are described by a single number per stimulus in the response profiles, comparison between response profiles can be performed through straightforward correlation analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The models were designed to simulate the response amplitudes of an idealized average human participant, consistently producing the same response to a given stimulus, without attempting to model inter-participant variability and variability across repetitions. These sources of variability are present in the <sc>meg</sc> data and place a boundary on the maximal obtainable correlation score, which we will refer to as the noise ceiling, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kriegeskorte et al. (2008)</xref>. Evoked <sc>meg</sc> response amplitudes can vary substantially between repetitions of the same stimulus (either when presenting it multiple times to the same participant or presenting it to multiple participants) and are hence typically studied by averaging across repetitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Luck, 2014</xref>). The need for averaging becomes apparent when looking at the estimated noise ceilings for single-participant data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The pessimistic estimate for the single-participant noise ceiling is very low for all three <sc>meg</sc> components (computed as the average correlation between the response amplitudes of a single participant versus those averaged across all remaining participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>)), indicating a large amount of inter-participant variability. When averaging across participants, the estimated noise ceilings are much higher (estimated through a procedure proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lage-Castellanos et al. (2019)</xref>), which is why we will focus on the comparison between the models and the average <sc>meg</sc> response amplitudes.</p>

<p>The amount of activity in the first convolution layer of each model we evaluated correlates with the amplitude of the type-<sc>i</sc> component up to the estimated noise ceiling, which is in line with our qualitative finding that all models produce similar response profiles in the first convolution layers. For the type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components, the illiterate model (trained only on ImageNet, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> top row) shows a strong negative correlation, which can be attributed to its invalid response to the noisy word condition. Training the model on orthographic stimuli greatly improves its correlation with these components (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, second row), but also here we see that the model without noisy unit activations, which failed to produce the proper response to the noisy word condition, has a weak correlation to the type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components. Among the models with noisy unit activations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, bottom four rows), which produced the proper response to the noisy word condition, the differences in correlation with the type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components are much smaller. Notably, the models that produced qualitatively incorrect <sc>n</sc>400m response profiles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, rows three and five) have slightly higher correlation with the <sc>n</sc>400m component than a model that produced a qualitatively correct responses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, fourth row). This shows how a poor simulation of a brain response during one experimental condition can be compensated for by a better simulation of the brain response during another. However, the final model that produces correct responses to all experimental conditions and has the largest vocabulary (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, bottom row) also has the strongest correlation with the components of the evoked response. Still, there remains a gap between the model-brain correlations and the estimated noise ceiling, indicating there might remain some reproducible variance in the type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components that the model does not capture.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination of the relationship between the response profiles of the final model and the <sc>meg</sc> evoked components (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), we see that the correlation is mostly driven by differences in response strength between the experimental conditions. Within each stimulus type, <sc>meg</sc> evoked component amplitude and model layer activation are not significantly uncorrelated (<italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05 for all components), which is not surprising as the stimuli were designed to minimize within-condition variation. To verify that the three <sc>ecd</sc> groups capture the most important correlations between the brain activity and the model, we compared the model to cortex-wide <sc>mne</sc>-d<sc>spm</sc> source estimates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). The areas with maximum correlation appear around the locations of the <sc>ecds</sc> and at a time that is close to the peak activation of the <sc>ecds</sc>.</p>
<p>To test whether a multivariate analysis would yield additional insights, we trained a linear ridge regression model to predict brain activity given the activity within the layers of a model, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Schrimpf et al. (2020)</xref> refer to as BrainScore. BrainScores where computed for both the illiterate model, trained only on ImageNet (cf. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, top row), and the final model (cf. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, bottom row). We found that for both models, every layer could be used to predict the brain activity along key locations along the ventral stream (Supplementary Figure 7). Furthermore, there was very little difference in BrainScore between the illiterate and the final model. Hence, this information-based metric was in this case not helpful for evaluating model-brain fit.</p>

<title>CNNs can reproduce experimental results beyond the original MEG study</title>
<p>The experimental contrasts employed in the <sc>meg</sc> experiment were designed to distinguish the type-<sc>i</sc>, type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components from one another. However, many more experimental contrasts have been used to study these components in the past. We explored the effect of some of these on our final model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) in order to ascertain the extent to which the model can simulate the behavior of the three components under conditions extending beyond the original <sc>meg</sc> data that guided its design.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tarkiainen et al. (1999)</xref>, the difference between the type-<sc>i</sc> and type-<sc>ii</sc> component was highlighted by contrasting stimuli that contained only noise with stimuli that contained both noise and letters. Our model successfully replicates the finding that the amplitude of both the type-<sc>i</sc> and type-<sc>ii</sc> components increase with the amount of visual noise, except when there are letters present, in which case the amplitude of the type-<sc>ii</sc> component decreases with the amount of noise while that of the type-<sc>i</sc> component is unaffected. This striking change in behavior occurs in the model when the layer type switches from convolution to fully connected linear. Furthermore, our model reproduces the finding by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tarkiainen et al. (1999)</xref> that the amplitudes of both the type-<sc>i</sc> and type-<sc>ii</sc> component increases when a stimulus contains more letters or symbols, however given two strings of equal length, the amplitude of the type-<sc>ii</sc> component is larger for the string containing letters versus a string containing symbols, while the amplitude of the type-<sc>i</sc> component is similar for both strings.</p>
<p>Basic visual features such as font family and font size have a large effect on the activity in the initial convolution layers of the model, and less so on the activity in the later layers. This roughly corresponds to findings in the masked repetition priming <sc>eeg</sc> literature, where they find that early components such as the n/p150 are affected by such properties, whereas later components are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chauncey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grainger and Holcomb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hauk and Pulvermüller, 2004</xref>). However, our results may not be directly comparable to that literature, because our model cannot do repetition priming. Even so, it is surprising that the fully connected linear layers in the model show a decrease in activity with increasing font size, rather than being unaffected.</p>
<p>Using invasive recordings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Woolnough et al. (2021)</xref> found effects of letter and bigram frequency in the occipitotemporal cortex, where we find the type-<sc>ii</sc> component in <sc>meg</sc>, but not in occipital cortex, where we find the type-<sc>i</sc> component. This result has been shown in <sc>eeg</sc> studies as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Grainger, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laszlo and Federmeier, 2014</xref>). Our model shows similar sensitivity to letter and bigram frequency in the later convolution and fully connected layers. However, we found that our model did not show any sensitivity to word frequency or orthographic neighbourhood size, even though these are known to affect later components in <sc>eeg</sc> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dambacher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Holcomb et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated how training a <sc>cnn</sc> for visual word classification results in a model that can explain key functional effects of the evoked <sc>meg</sc> response during visual word recognition, provided some conditions to enhance biological realism are met. Necessary attributes of the <sc>cnn</sc> and its training diet were found to be that unit activations should be noisy, the vocabulary should be large enough, and for very large vocabularies, the frequency of occurrence of words in the training set should follow their frequency in the language environment.</p>
<p>In contrast to traditional models of reading in the brain that operate on collections of predefined lines or letter banks (for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coltheart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Laszlo and Armstrong, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">McClelland and Rumelhart, 1981</xref>), a <sc>cnn</sc> stimulates the entire processing pipeline starting from raw pixel values of a bitmap image. This allowed us to evaluate model-brain correspondence using the same experimental contrasts as have been used in neuroimaging studies of visual word recognition. Following a neuroconnectionist approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doerig et al., 2023</xref>), we started with an illiterate <sc>cnn</sc>, trained to perform image classification, and iteratively made changes to its architecture and training diet, until it could replicate the effects of manipulating low-level visual properties such as noise levels, fonts and sizes, to mid-level orthographic properties such as symbols versus letters, and to high-level lexical properties such as consonants strings versus pseudowords versus real words. Some of these contrasts explore what we consider to be “edge cases” of visual word processing that explore what happens when the brain tries to recognize a word and fails. Symbol strings, consonant strings and pseudowords do not occur often in our natural environment and we don’t explicitly train ourselves to distinguish them from real words when we learn to read. Following this logic, we included only real words in the training set for the model, so that responses to the nonword stimuli were simulations of a computational process failing to properly recognize a word.</p>
<p>The resulting models bridge an important gap in modeling visual word recognition, by establishing a direct link between computational processes and key findings in experimental neuroimaging studies.</p>

<title>A computational process exhibiting type-<sc>i</sc>, type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m-like effects</title>
<p>In this study, the computational process of visual word recognition was taken to be a transformation from a bitmap image containing a written word (with some variation in letter shapes, size and rotation) to the identity of the word. Many network architectures can be found in the deep-learning literature that could by used to implement such a process. For this study, we chose the <sc>vgg</sc> architecture (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), where high accuracy is achieved by performing the same few operations many times, rather than many different operations or clever tricks. The operations performed by the network are: convolution, pooling, batch normalization, and linear transforms. Our rationale was to start with these operations, which already have links to the neuroscience of vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carandini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lindsay, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Serre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016</xref>) and only when they prove insufficient to explain a desired experimental effect, introduce others. This turned out to be unnecessary for explaining the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref>, but one can imagine the necessity of introducing recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kubilius et al., 2019</xref>) or attention mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Vaswani et al., 2017</xref>) in future extensions of the model into for example semantic processing.</p>
<p>The visual word recognition task itself did not prove particularly difficult for a <sc>cnn</sc>, as all variations of the network architecture and training diet that were tried resulted in a model that achieved near perfect accuracy. However, not all variations produced response profiles matching those of the evoked components (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, Supplementary Figure 4). This validates a criticism sometimes heard concerning whether deep learning models are brain-like, namely that the ability of a model to perform a task that once could only be done by a brain is not enough evidence that a model computes like a brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bowers et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, we found that task performance alone, i.e. the identification of the correct stimulus word, was a poor indicator for judging a model’s suitability as computational hypothesis for the brain. More compelling evidence was obtained by comparing the model’s internal state to measurements of brain activity. Two variations of the model, with respective vocabulary sizes of 1k and 10k words, implement the computational process in such a way that they produce amounts of activity within their layers that resemble the amplitudes of the type-<sc>i</sc>, type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components of the <sc>meg</sc> evoked response. The model with the larger vocabulary was chosen to be the final iteration of the model and subjected to a more extensive range of experimental contrasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>The computational process implemented by the final model starts with a series of convolutionand-pooling operations. Individual convolution units have a restricted receptive field, which is gradually widened through pooling operations. The units in the first layer see a patch of 3 <italic>×</italic> 3 pixels and those in the final fifth convolution layer combine information from patches of 18 <italic>×</italic> 18 pixels. This setup enforces a hierarchical representation forming in those layers, from edges to line segments and corners to (parts of) letter shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dehaene et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2018b</xref>). Hence, increasing the visual complexity, i.e. adding more edges to an image by for example introducing visual noise or adding more symbols, will increase the activity of the convolution units. This behavior corresponds closely to that of the type-<sc>i</sc> component, which is in line with the growing body of evidence of convolution-and-pooling being performed in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lindsay, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Serre et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The kind of information selected for in the later layers of the model changes through the introduction of non-relevant input signals during training, here done through noisy unit activations. Without noisy activations, the task of the computational units is limited to finding features to distinguish one letter from another. With noisy activations, their task also entails isolating letter-shape information from non-relevant information. The property of not merely having a preference for, but actively seeking to isolate certain types of information is key for producing the response profiles of the type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components. When receptive field sizes were 8 <italic>×</italic> 8 pixels and larger (fourth and fifth layers), the convolution units showed a preference for letters over symbols and a preference for more frequently used letters. This orthographic tuning is also the hallmark of the type-<sc>ii</sc> component. However, while the amplitude of this component increases with increasing visual complexity through the addition of more symbols or letters to a stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tarkiainen et al., 1999</xref>), an important aspect of the type-<sc>ii</sc> is that manipulations that reduce readability, such as the addition of visual noise, decrease its amplitude, even though the overall visual complexity of the stimulus is increased. It is in this aspect that the convolution units in our models are not necessarily a good fit for the type-<sc>ii</sc> response, since their tight receptive field strongly ties their activation to that of their counterparts in the previous layer. Increased activation in the early convolution layers tends to carry over, with the later convolution layers having only limited capabilities for filtering out noise. With small vocabularies, we did observe noise-filtering behavior in the fifth convolution layer, but less so when vocabulary size was increased from 250 to 1k and the effect was gone with a vocabulary of 10k.</p>
<p>In the model, convolution units are followed by pooling units, which serve the purpose of stratifying the response across changes in position, size and rotation within the receptive field of the pooling unit. Hence, the effect of small differences in letter shape, such as the usage of different fonts, was only present in the early convolution layers, in line with findings in the <sc>eeg</sc> literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chauncey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grainger and Holcomb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hauk and Pulvermüller, 2004</xref>). However, the ability of pooling units to stratify such differences depends on the size of their receptive field, which might explain why, in later layers, we observed a decreased response to stimuli where text was rendered with a font size exceeding the receptive field of the pooling units (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>In the final model, the convolution-and-pooling phase is followed by three fully connected layers, which pool information across the entire input image. Their large receptive fields make them more effective in isolating orthographic information from noise than the convolution layers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) and their response profile matches that of the type-<sc>ii</sc> component well, also when the model has a large vocabulary. Moreover, units in the fully connected layers can see multiple letters, making them sensitive not only to letter frequency, but also bigram frequency, allowing them to replicate these effects on the type-<sc>ii</sc> component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Woolnough et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The final fully connected layer, the output layer, represents the model’s notion of a mental lexicon: a collection of known word-forms, not yet linked to their semantic meaning (which we didn’t model at all). Since orthographic word-form and semantic meaning are generally only very loosely coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Monaghan et al., 2014</xref>), the lexicon often appears as a separate unit in computational models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Woollams, 2015</xref>). At face value, since we employed cross-entropy as loss function during training, the output layer simulates the lexicon following a localist structural approach, which harks back to the earliest models of visual word recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">McClelland and Rumelhart, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Morton, 1969</xref>). In the localist approach, each word is represented by a dedicated unit that should only be active when the sensory version of that word (in this study, a bitmap image containing the word as rendered text) is provided as input to the model, to the exclusion of all other words in the vocabulary. This is known in the machine learning literature as “one-hot” encoding. The localist approach is often contrasted with the distributed approach, wherein each word is represented by a unique combination of multiple output units that respond to subword parts (e.g., n-grams, pairings of letters in the first and final position, etc.), which is a more efficient encoding scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989</xref>). Both the localist and distributed approaches have their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to explaining experimental results, and the debate on how exactly the human lexicon is encoded in the brain is far from settled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Woollams, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, because our model covers the entire process from pixel to word-form, its simulation of the lexicon is not strictly localist, but combines both localist and distributed approaches.</p>
<p>When the input image contains a word that is present in the model’s vocabulary, it is true that the corresponding word-specific unit in the output layer will have the highest amount of activation of all units in the output layer. However, given the connectionist nature of our model, all units tuned to orthographically similar words will co-activate to some degree. This inaccuracy is important when it comes to simulating the amplitude of the <sc>n</sc>400m component in response to pseudowords, which is as large as (and sometimes even larger than) the response to real words. In the model, a pseudoword does not have a dedicated output unit, but given a large enough vocabulary, there will be enough units that respond to orthographically similar words to produce a large amount of activity nonetheless. Crucially, letter strings that are not word-like, such as consonant strings, will not activate many units in the output layer, which is an important difference between the response profiles of the <sc>n</sc>400m and the type-<sc>ii</sc>. Furthermore, in our final model, the first two fully connected layers have fewer units (4096) than the number of words in the vocabulary (10 000), which produces a distributed representation, where one unit is involved in the encoding of many words. The response profiles of both the second fully connected layer (distributed representation) and the output layer (localist representation) resemble that of the <sc>n</sc>400m response. Hence, our model does not provide direct cause for preferring a localist or distributed approach when modeling the lexicon, but shows how both approaches interact when creating a model of the entire process of sensory input to lexicon: the localist approach can function as training objective and a distributed representation emerges in the hidden layers.</p>

<title>Limitations of the current model</title>
<p>The <sc>vgg-11</sc> architecture was originally designed to achieve high image classification accuracy on the ImageNet challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015</xref>). Although we have introduced some modifications that make the model more biologically plausible, the final model is still incomplete in many ways as a complete model of brain function during reading.</p>
<p>One important limitation of the current model is the lack of an explicit mapping from the units inside its layers to specific locations in the brain at specific times. Multiple layers have a maximum correlation with the source estimate at the exact same location and time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, there is no clear relationship between the number of layers the signal needs to traverse in the model to the processing time in the brain. The signal needs to propagate through five convolution layers to reach the point where it matches the type-<sc>ii</sc> response at 140 ms to 200 ms, but only through one more additional layer to reach the point where it starts to match the <sc>n</sc>400m response at 300 ms to 500 ms. This also raises the question what the brain is doing during this time that seems to take so long. Still, cutting down on the number of times convolution is performed in the model seems to make it unable to achieve the desired suppression of noise (Supplementary Figure 4). A promising way forward may be to use a network architecture like cornet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kubilius et al., 2019</xref>), that performs convolution multiple times in a recurrent fashion, yet simultaneously propagates activity forward after each pass. The introduction of recursion into the model will furthermore align it better with traditional-style models, since it can cause a model to exhibit attractor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McLeod et al., 2000</xref>), which will be especially important when extending the model into the semantic domain.</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, our model is an important milestone for computational models of reading that leverages deep learning techniques to extend the scope of traditional-style models to encompass the entire computational process starting from raw pixels values to representations of word-forms in the mental lexicon. This allowed us to directly compare activity within the model to <sc>meg</sc> neuroimaging results and show how the stimulus-dependent amplitudes of the type-<sc>i</sc>, type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components of the <sc>meg</sc> evoked response can be computationally derived from a series of convolution-and-pooling steps, followed by several fully connected linear operations. Overall, we found that a qualitative evaluation of the response profiles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) gave a most direct path to finding ways to improve the model. It was more informative than the correlation scores (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Supplementary Figure 7), which were mostly driven by the large differences between the noise-embedded words and symbol strings versus the other stimulus types. This underlines the importance of finding ways to directly link the activity simulated within a model to measurements obtained from the brain and reason about them in both a quantitative and qualitative fashion.</p>

<title>MEG study design and data analysis</title>
<p>The <sc>meg</sc> data that had been collected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref> was re-analyzed for the current study using MNE-python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gramfort et al., 2013</xref>) and FreeSurfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dale et al., 1999</xref>). We refer to the original publication for additional details on the study protocol and data collection process.</p>
<p>Simultaneous <sc>meg</sc> and <sc>eeg</sc> was recorded from 15 participants (who gave their informed consent, in agreement with the prior approval of the Ethics Committee of the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District). The stimuli consisted of visually presented Finnish words, pseudowords (pronounceable but meaningless), consonant strings (random consonants), symbol strings (randomly formed from 10 possible shapes), and words embedded in high-frequency visual noise (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Each stimulus category contained 112 different stimuli and each stimulus contained 7–8 letters/symbols. The stimuli were presented sequentially in a block design. Each block started with a random period of rest (0 ms to 600 ms), followed by 7 stimuli of the same category. Each stimulus was shown for 300 ms with an inter-stimulus interval of 1500 ms of gray background. In addition to the five stimulus conditions (16 blocks each), there were 16 blocks of rest (12 s). An additional 5 target blocks were added, in which one stimulus appeared twice in a row, that the participants were asked to detect and respond to with a button press. The target blocks were not included in the analysis. The same paradigm was applied in an f<sc>mri</sc>-<sc>eeg</sc> recording of the same participants as well (data not used here).</p>
<p>The data were recorded with a Vector View device (Elekta Neuromag, now MEGIN Oy, Finland) in a magnetically shielded room. In addition, vertical and horizontal electrooculography (eog) were recorded. The signals were bandpass filtered at 0.03 Hz to 200 Hz and digitized at 600 Hz. For analysis, the data were further processed using the maxfilter software (MEGIN Oy, Finland) and bandpass filtered at 0.1 Hz to 40 Hz. Eye-movement and heart-beat artifacts were reduced using independent component analysis (ica): the signal was high-passed at 1 Hz, and components with correlations larger than 5 standard deviations with any of the eog channels or an estimated electro-cardiogram (based on the magnetometers without the maxfilter applied) were removed (3–7 out of 86–108 components). Epochs were cut −200 ms to 1000 ms relative to the onset of the stimulus and baseline-corrected using the pre-stimulus interval. Participant-specific noise covariance matrices of the <sc>meg</sc> sensors were estimated using the pre-stimulus interval.</p>
<p>Source estimation of the sensor-level signals was performed using two methods. The first, <sc>mne</sc>-d<sc>spm</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dale et al., 2000</xref>), yields a comprehensive map of where activity can be found, which is used in this study mostly to provide context for a deeper investigation into three peaks of activity that can be observed along the ventral stream. The second, guided <sc>ecd</sc> modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Salmelin, 2010</xref>), summarizes the high-dimensional data as a sparse set of <sc>ecds</sc>, each one capturing an isolated spatiotemporal component, allowing us to study selected components in more detail. The advantage of this sparse method over distributed source estimation techniques such as the minimum norm estimate (<sc>mne</sc>) or beamformers, is that in cases like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref>, a single <sc>ecd</sc> may conveniently capture an isolated component of the evoked response. Furthermore, this sparsity makes it straightforward to take individual differences regarding the cortical origin of the evoked component into account, since the location and orientation of the <sc>ecds</sc> were fitted to optimally explain the data of each individual. For each individual, the matching between <sc>ecds</sc> and the type-<sc>i</sc>, type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m responses was performed based on their approximate location, timing of peak activity, and behavior across the different stimulus types. The groups do not necessarily contain an <sc>ecd</sc> for each of the 15 participants, as some participants did not have an <sc>ecd</sc> to contribute that matched well enough in position and/or timing. The number of participants contributing an <sc>ecd</sc> to each group were: type-<sc>i</sc>: 14, type-<sc>ii</sc>: 14, and <sc>n</sc>400m: 15.</p>
<p>For both <sc>ecd</sc> and <sc>mne</sc>-d<sc>spm</sc> source estimation, 3-layer boundary element method (bem) forward models were used. These models were based on T1-weighted anatomical images that were acquired using a 3 T Signa excite magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scanner. FreeSurfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dale et al., 1999</xref>) was used to obtain the surface reconstructions required to compute the bem models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref> defines three groups of <sc>ecds</sc> in the left-hemisphere, associated with the type-<sc>i</sc>, type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m responses. The locations and orientations of the <sc>ecds</sc> in these groups were re-used in the current study. For each individual epoch, the signal at each of the three <sc>ecds</sc> and a cortex-wide <sc>mne</sc>-d<sc>spm</sc> source estimate was computed using the noise covariance matrices and bem forward models. Finally, the locations of the <sc>ecds</sc> and <sc>mne</sc>-d<sc>spm</sc> source points were morphed to FreeSurfer’s template brain.</p>

<title>Computational models</title>
<p>The models of the computational process underlying the brain activity observed during the <sc>meg</sc> experiment used a <sc>vgg-11</sc>  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Szegedy et al., 2015</xref>) network architecture, pretrained on ImageNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Russakovsky et al., 2015</xref>), as defined in the TorchVision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Marcel and Rodriguez, 2010</xref>) module of the PyTorch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Paszke et al., 2019</xref>) package. This architecture consists of five convolution layers (with the final three performing convolution twice), followed by two fully connected linear layers, terminating in a fully connected linear output layer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Each individual convolution step is followed by batch-normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015</xref>) and max-pooling. Every unit, including the output units, used the following non-linear activation function:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="479654v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>N</italic> denotes Gaussian distributed random noise with zero mean and standard deviation <italic>σ</italic><sub>noise</sub>. For version of the model with noisy activations <italic>σ</italic><sub>noise</sub> <italic>=</italic> 0.1, and for versions without <italic>σ</italic><sub>noise</sub> <italic>=</italic> 0.</p>
<p>The model was trained to perform visual word recognition using a training set of approximately 1 000 000 images, where each image depicted a word, rendered in varying fonts, sizes and rotations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). An independent test set containing 100 000 images was used to track the performance of the model during training. None of the images in the training or test set were an exact duplicate of the images used as stimuli in the <sc>meg</sc> experiment. Therefore, the stimulus set can be treated as an independent validation set. The task for the model was to identify the correct word (regardless of the font, size and rotation used to render the text) by setting the corresponding unit in the output layer to a high value.</p>
<p>Different versions of the model were created using vocabulary sizes of 250, 1 000 and 10 000 Finnish words. The vocabulary was compiled using the 112 words used in the <sc>meg</sc>, extended with the most frequently used Finnish words, as determined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kanerva et al. (2014)</xref>, having a length of 3–9, excluding proper names and using their lemma form. No symbol strings, consonant strings, nor pseudowords were present in the training set.</p>
<p>For the training sets that do not take word frequency into account, each word was rendered 100 times in various fonts, sizes and rotations. When word frequency was taken into account, the number of times each word occurred in the training set <italic>c</italic> was scaled by its frequency <italic>f</italic> in a large Finnish text corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kanerva et al., 2014</xref>) in the following manner:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="479654v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="479654v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> is the frequency of the least commonly occurring word in the training vocabulary, <italic>r</italic> is the frequency ratio, ∑<bold>r</bold> is the total frequency ratio of all words in the training vocabulary, <italic>N</italic> is the desired number of items in the training set, in our case 1 000 000. The actual number of items in the training set will deviate a little from <italic>N</italic>, as the floor operation causes ∑<bold>c</bold> ≈ <italic>N</italic>. The number of times a word occurred in the test set was always 10.</p>
<p>Images were assembled by overlaying the rendered text onto an image of visual noise. Visual noise was rendered by randomly selecting a gray-scale value (0 % to 100 %) for each pixel. Next, if the training image contained text, the word was rendered in uppercase letters, using a randomly chosen font (15 possible fonts), font size (14 pt to 32 pt), and rotation (−20° to 20°). The list of fonts consisted of: Ubuntu Mono, Courier, Luxi Mono Regular, Lucida Console, Lekton, Dejavu Sans Mono, Times New Roman, Arial, Arial Black, Verdana, Comic Sans MS, Georgia, Liberation Serif, Impact, and Roboto Condensed.</p>
<p>For every variation of the model, the training procedure was the same. The training objective was to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the model output and a one-hot encoded vector of a length equal to the vocabulary size, indicating the target word. Optimization of the model’s parameters was performed using stochastic gradient descend with an initial learning rate of 0.01, which was reduced to 0.001 after 10 epochs (an “epoch” in this context refers to one sequence of all 1 000 000 training images), and a momentum of 0.9. During training, the noisy-<sc>relu</sc> activation function was temporarily disabled for the output units, and re-activated during evaluation and normal operation of the model. In total, training was performed for 20 epochs, by which point the performance on the test set, for all variations of the model, had plateaued at around 99.6 %.</p>

<title>Comparison between model and MEG data</title>
<p>To compare the model with the <sc>meg</sc> responses, statistical summaries were made of the high-dimensional data, that we refer to as “response profiles”, that could be compared either qualitatively by examining the pattern of activation across stimulus types, and quantitatively by computing Pearson correlation between them.</p>
<p>To construct the response profiles for a model, it was applied to the bitmap images that were used during the <sc>meg</sc> experiment (padded to be 256 <italic>×</italic> 256 pixels with 50 % grayscale pixels). The activity at each layer of the model was quantified by recording the <sc>relu</sc> activation right before the maxpool operation, and computing the <italic>𝓁</italic><sub>2</sub> norm across the units. This yielded, for each stimulus image, a single number for each layer in the model representing the amount of activity within that layer. For each layer, the response profile was z-scored across the stimulus images.</p>
<p>To construct the response profiles for the type-<sc>i</sc>, type-<sc>ii</sc> and <sc>n</sc>400m components, the neural activity represented by the corresponding <sc>ecd</sc> was quantified by taking the mean of its timecourse during an appropriate time window (indicated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, 64 ms to 115 ms for the type-<sc>i</sc>, 140 ms to 200 ms for the type-<sc>ii</sc>, and 300 ms to 400 ms for the <sc>n</sc>400m, after stimulus onset). This yielded for each stimulus image a single number that indicates the amount of signal at the <sc>ecd</sc>. Collected across all stimuli, these numbers form the response pattern of each <sc>ecd</sc>. The response patterns were first z-scored across the stimulus images independently for each participant and later averaged across participants for the grand-average analysis.</p>
<p>The <sc>mne</sc>-d<sc>spm</sc> source estimates used 4000 source points, distributed evenly across the cortex. The response profile at each source point was computed by taking the maximum signal value of the source point’s timecourse within the same time window as the <sc>ecd</sc> analysis. This yielded for each stimulus image, a single number for each source point for each participant, indicating the amount of signal at the source point. The response patterns were first z-scored across the stimulus images independently for each participant and later averaged across participants during the grand-average analysis.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The comparisons between response profiles obtained from the models and the <sc>meg</sc> data were performed through Pearson correlation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In cases where distributions were tested for a significant difference in mean (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), this was done through two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> -tests, as implemented in SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>). In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, multiple participants contribute to each data point in the distributions, hence a linear mixed effects (lme) model was used to compare distributions, with participants modeled as random effect (both slope and intercept), as implemented in the Julia MixedModels package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bates et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The noise ceilings, indicating the maximum obtainable correlation between the response profile of a model and those of the evoked components (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), were estimated using two different methods. A noise ceiling depends on the amount of variation in repeated measurements of the same response profile. When estimating the noise ceiling for a response profile obtained from a single participant, repeated measurements were available since the same response profile could be obtained from multiple participants. Hence, the estimation procedure outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kriegeskorte et al. (2008)</xref> could be used, which yields an optimistic and pessimistic estimate, which act as upper and lower bounds for the true noise ceiling. For each evoked component, the noise estimate was computed as the mean correlation between the response profile obtained from each individual participant and the grand-average response profile. For the optimistic estimate, the individual under consideration was included in the grand-average (hence contributing data twice) and for the pessimistic estimate, the individual was not. When estimating the noise ceiling for the grand-average response profile, no repeated measurements were directly available. In this case, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lage-Castellanos et al.

<title>Post-hoc experimental contrasts</title>
<p>The final model was not only tested with the stimuli of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Vartiainen et al. (2011)</xref>, but also sets of stimuli designed with additional experimental contrasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). For each contrast, a different set of stimuli was generated. Unless mentioned otherwise, stimuli were text strings rendered on a gray background in the Arial font at a fontsize of 23 pixels.</p>
<p><bold>Pure noise</bold> 1 000 images were generated containing a gray background, which was blended with Gaussian noise with varying levels between 0 % to 100 %, with no rendered text.</p>
<p><bold>Noisy word</bold> All words of length 8 were selected from the original 10k vocabulary and rendered. They were blended with Gaussian noise at random levels between 0 % to 50 %.</p>
<p><bold>Num. letters</bold> All words in the 10k vocabulary were rendered.</p>
<p><bold>Num. symbols</bold> For each word in the 10k vocabulary, a symbol string of matching length was generated using the unicode characters “square”, “circle”, “triangle up”, “triangle down”, “diamond” and rendered.</p>
<p><bold>Word vs. symbols</bold> The stimulus lists used for the “Num. letters” and “Num. symbols” contrasts were combined. For this contrast, the model response profile was correlated with a vector containing zeros indicating symbols and ones indicating words.</p>
<p><bold>Font family</bold> All words in the 10k vocabulary were rendered in both the Impact and Comic Sans fonts. For this contrast, the model response profile was correlated with a vector containing zeros indicating stimuli rendered in the Impact font, and ones indicating stimuli rendered in the Comic Sans font.</p>
<p><bold>Font size</bold> All words of length 8 were selected from the original 10k vocabulary. Each selected word was rendered at 8 fontsizes ranging from 14–32 pixels.</p>
<p><bold>Letter freq</bold>. 10 000 random letter strings of length 8 were generated and rendered. In this contrast, the model response profile was correlated with the total letter frequency of each random letter string in the 10k vocabulary.</p>
<p><bold>Bigram freq</bold>. 10 000 strings consisting of 4 bigrams were generated and rendered. Since there is generally a strong correlation between letter and bigram frequency, the random bigrams were selected in a fashion designed to minimize this confounding factor. Bigrams were randomly selected from a set of 50 common bigrams (freq <italic>&gt;=</italic> 30 000) with the lowest letter frequency, and a set of 50 uncommon bigrams (freq <italic>&lt;</italic> 10 000) with the highest letter frequency. Bigram and letter frequencies were computed on the 10k vocabulary.</p>
<p><bold>Word freq</bold>. All words in the 10k vocabulary were rendered. The word frequency was computed as the square root of the number of times the word occured in a large corpus of Finnish text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kanerva et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Orth. neighb</bold>. All words in the 10k vocabulary were rendered. The orthographic neighbourhood size was computed as the number of words in the 10k vocabulary with a Levenshtein distance of 1 to the target word.</p>

<p>van Vliet and colleagues show a correlation between internal states of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on visual word stimuli with three specific components of evoked MEG potentials during reading in humans. The findings are <bold>useful</bold>, but the current results remain <bold>incomplete</bold>, without evidence that the CNN can produce any of the phenomena that the human visual system is known to have (e.g., feedback connections, sensitivity to word frequency), or that the model has comparable performance to human behaviour (i.e., similar task accuracy with a comparable pattern of mistakes).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study trained a CNN for visual word classification and supported a model that can explain key functional effects of the evoked MEG response during visual word recognition, providing an explicit computational account from detection and segmentation of letter shapes to final word-form identification.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper not only bridges an important gap in modeling visual word recognition, by establishing a direct link between computational processes and key findings in experimental neuroimaging studies, but also provides some conditions to enhance biological realism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The interpretation of CNN results, especially the number of layers in the final model and its relationship with the processing of visual words in the human brain, needs to be further strengthened.</p>

<p>van Vliet and colleagues present the results of a study correlating internal states of a convolutional neural network trained on visual word stimuli with evoked MEG potentials during reading.</p>
<p>In this study, a standard deep learning image recognition model (VGG-11) trained on a large natural image set (ImageNet) that begins illiterate but is then further trained on visual word stimuli, is used on a set of predefined stimulus images to extract strings of characters from &quot;noisy&quot; words, pseudowords and real words. This methodology is used in hopes of creating a model that learns to apply the same nonlinear transforms that could be happening in different regions of the brain - which would be validated by studying the correlations between the weights of this model and neural responses. Specifically, the aim is that the model learns some vector embedding space, as quantified by the spread of activations across a layer's units (L2 Norm after ReLu Activation Function), for the different kinds of stimuli, that creates a parameterized decision boundary that is similar to amplitude changes at different times for a MEG signal. More importantly, the way that the stimuli are ordered or ranked in that space should be separable to the degree we see separation in neural activity. This study shows that the activation corresponding to five different broad classes of stimuli statistically correlates with three specific components in the ERP. However, I believe there are fundamental theoretical issues that limit the implications of the results of this study.</p>
<p>As has been shown over many decades, many potential computational algorithms, with varied model architectures, can perform the task of text recognition from an image. However, there is no evidence presented here that this particular algorithm has comparable performance to human behavior (i.e. similar accuracy with a comparable pattern of mistakes). This is a fundamental prerequisite before attempting to meaningfully correlate these layer activations to human neural activations. Therefore, it is unlikely that correlating these derived layer weights to neural activity provides meaningful novel insights into neural computation beyond what is seen using traditional experimental methods.</p>
<p>One example of a substantial discrepancy between this model and neural activations is that, while incorporating frequency weighting into the training data is shown to slightly increase neural correlation with the model, Figure 7 shows that no layer of the model appears directly sensitive to word frequency. This is in stark contrast to the strong neural sensitivity to word frequency seen in EEG (e.g. Dambacher et al 2006 Brain Research), fMRI (e.g. Kronbichler et al 2004 NeuroImage), MEG (e.g. Huizeling et al 2021 Neurobio. Lang.), and intracranial (e.g. Woolnough et al 2022 J. Neurosci.) recordings. Figure 7 also demonstrates that the late stages of the model show a strong negative correlation with font size, whereas later stages of neural visual word processing are typically insensitive to differences in visual features, instead showing sensitivity to lexical factors.</p>
<p>Another example of the mismatch between this model and the visual cortex is the lack of feedback connections in the model. Within the visual cortex, there are extensive feedback connections, with later processing stages providing recursive feedback to earlier stages. This is especially evident in reading, where feedback from lexical-level processes feeds back to letter-level processes (e.g. Heilbron et al 2020 Nature Comms.). This feedback is especially relevant for the reading of words in noisy conditions, as tested in the current manuscript, as lexical knowledge enhances letter representation in the visual cortex (the word superiority effect). This results in neural activity in multiple cortical areas varying over time, changing selectivity within a region at different measured time points (e.g. Woolnough et al 2021 Nature Human Behav.), which in the current study is simplified down to three discrete time windows, each attributed to different spatial locations.</p>
<p>The presented model needs substantial further development to be able to replicate, both behaviorally and neurally, many of the well-characterized phenomena seen in human behavior and neural recordings that are fundamental hallmarks of human visual word processing. Until that point, it is unclear what novel contributions can be gleaned from correlating low-dimensional model weights from these computational models with human neural data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate the extent to which the responses of different layers of a vision model (VGG-11) can be linked to the cascade of responses (namely, type-I, type-II, and N400) in the human brain when reading words. To achieve maximal consistency, they add noisy-activations to VGG and finetune it on a character recognition task. In this setup, they observe various similarities between the behavior of VGG and the brain when when presented with various transformations of the words (added noise, font modification, etc).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The paper is well-written and well-presented.</p>
<p>- The topic studied is interesting.</p>
<p>- The fact that the response of the CNN on unseen experimental contrasts such as adding noise correlated with previous results on the brain is compelling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The paper is rather qualitative in nature. In particular, the authors show that some resemblance exists between the behavior of some layers and some parts of the brain, but it is hard to quantitively understand how strong the resemblances are in each layer, and the exact impact of experimental settings such as the frequency balancing (which seems to only have a very moderate effect according to Figure 5).</p>
<p>- The experiments only consider a rather outdated vision model (VGG).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their efforts. They have pointed out several shortcomings and made very helpful suggestions. Below, we shortly address the weak points that the reviewers brought up and outline what improvements we intend to make for the revised paper in response.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>The interpretation of CNN results, especially the number of layers in the final model and its relationship with the processing of visual words in the human brain, needs to be further strengthened.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results of our experimentation with the number of layers and the number of units in each layer can be found in the supplementary information. In the revised version, we will bring some of these results into the main text and discuss them more thoroughly.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>As has been shown over many decades, many potential computational algorithms, with varied model architectures, can perform the task of text recognition from an image. However, there is no evidence presented here that this particular algorithm has comparable performance to human behavior (i.e. similar accuracy with a comparable pattern of mistakes). This is a fundamental prerequisite before attempting to meaningfully correlate these layer activations to human neural activations. Therefore, it is unlikely that correlating these derived layer weights to neural activity provides meaningful novel insights into neural computation beyond what is seen using traditional experimental methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We very much agree with the reviewer that a qualitative analysis of whether the model can explain experimental effects needs to happen before a quantitative analysis, such as evaluating model-brain correlation scores. In fact, this is one of the key points we wished to make.</p>
<p>This starts with the observation that &quot;traditional&quot; models of reading (=those that do not rely on deep learning) cannot explain some very basic human behavioral results, such as humans being able to recognize a word regardless of exact letter shape, size, and (up to a point) rotation. This is not so much a failure on the part of traditional models as it is a difference in focus. There are models of vision that focus on these low-level things, currently dominated by deep learning, but these are rarely evaluated in the context of reading, which has its own literature and well-known experimental effects. We believe the current version of the manuscript makes insufficiently clear what the goals of our modeling effort are exactly, which is something we will attempt to correct in the revision.</p>
<p>Since our model only covers the first phase of reading, with a special focus on letter shape detection, we sought to compare it with neuroimaging data that can provide &quot;snapshots&quot; of the state of the brain during these early phases, rather than comparing it with behavioral results that occur at the very end. However, we very much make this comparison in the spirit hinted at by the reviewer. The different MEG components have a distinct &quot;behavior&quot; to them in the way they respond to different experimental conditions (Figure 2), and the model needs to replicate this behavior (Figure 4). Only then do we move on to a quantitative analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>One example of a substantial discrepancy between this model and neural activations is that, while incorporating frequency weighting into the training data is shown to slightly increase neural correlation with the model, Figure 7 shows that no layer of the model appears directly sensitive to word frequency. This is in stark contrast to the strong neural sensitivity to word frequency seen in EEG (e.g. Dambacher et al 2006 Brain Research), fMRI (e.g. Kronbichler et al 2004 NeuroImage), MEG (e.g. Huizeling et al 2021 Neurobio. Lang.), and intracranial (e.g. Woolnough et al 2022 J. Neurosci.) recordings. Figure 7 also demonstrates that the late stages of the model show a strong negative correlation with font size, whereas later stages of neural visual word processing are typically insensitive to differences in visual features, instead showing sensitivity to lexical factors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are glad the reviewer brought up the topic of frequency balancing, as it is a good example of the importance of the qualitative analysis. As the reviewer points out, frequency balancing during training only had a moderate impact on correlation scores and from that point of view does not seem impactful. However, when we look at the qualitative evaluation, we see that with a large vocabulary, a model without frequency balancing fails to properly distinguish between consonant strings and (pseudo)words (Figure 4, 5th row). Hence, from the point of view of being able to reproduce experimental effects, frequency balancing had a large impact. It is true that the model, even with frequency balancing, only captures letter- and bigram-frequency effects and not word-frequency effects, as we know the N400 is sensitive to. This could mean that N400 word-frequency effects are driven by mechanics that our current model lacks, such as top-down effects from systems further up the processing pipeline.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the late-stage sensitivity of the model to font size must be seen as a flaw. Of course, we say as much when we discuss this result in the paper. Important context for this flaw is that the main aim of the model is to reproduce the experimental effects of Vartiainen et al. (2011), which does not include manipulation of word length. The experimental contrasts in Figure 7 are meant to explore a bit beyond the boundaries of that particular study, but were never considered &quot;failure points&quot;. When presenting a model, it's important to show its limitations too.</p>

<p>Another example of the mismatch between this model and the visual cortex is the lack of feedback connections in the model. Within the visual cortex, there are extensive feedback connections, with later processing stages providing recursive feedback to earlier stages.

</disp-quote>
<p>In this study, we make a start in showing how deep learning techniques could be beneficial to enhance models of reading by showing how even a simple CNN, after a few enhancements, can account for several experimental MEG effects that we see in reading tasks, but are outside the focus of traditional models of reading. We never intended to claim that our model offers a complete view of all the processes involved. This is why we have dedicated a section in the Discussion to the various ways in which our simple CNN is incomplete as a model of reading. In this section we hint at the usage of recurrent connections, but the reviewer does an excellent job of highlighting the importance of top-down connections even in models focusing on early visual processes, which we are very happy to include in this section.</p>

<p>The CNN model we present in this study is a small piece in a bigger effort to employ deep learning techniques to further enhance already existing models of reading. For our revision, we plan to expand on the question of where to go from here and outline our vision on how these techniques could help us better model the phenomena the reviewer speaks of. We agree with the reviewer that there is a long way to go, and we are excited to be a part of it.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>The paper is rather qualitative in nature. In particular, the authors show that some resemblance exists between the behavior of some layers and some parts of the brain, but it is hard to quantitively understand how strong the resemblances are in each layer, and the exact impact of experimental settings such as the frequency balancing (which seems to only have a very moderate effect according to Figure 5).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The large focus on a qualitative evaluation of the model is intentional. The ability of the model to reproduce experimental effects (Figure 4) is a pre-requisite for any subsequent qualitative metrics (such as correlation) to be valid. The introduction of frequency balancing is a good example of this. As the reviewer points out, frequency balancing during training has only a moderate impact on correlation scores and from that point of view does not seem impactful. However, when we look at the qualitative evaluation, we see that with a large vocabulary, a model without frequency balancing fails to properly distinguish between consonant strings and (pseudo)words (Figure 4, 5th row). Hence, from the point of view of being able to reproduce experimental effects, frequency balancing has a large impact.</p>
<p>That said, the reviewer is right to highlight the value of quantitative analysis. An important limitation of the &quot;traditional&quot; models of reading that do not employ deep learning is that they operate in unrealistically simplified environments (e.g. input as predefined line segments, words of a fixed length), which makes a quantitative comparison with brain data problematic. The main benefit that deep learning brings may very well be the increase in scale that makes more direct comparisons with brain data possible. In our revision we will attempt to capitalize on this benefit more. The reviewer has provided some helpful suggestions for doing so in their recommendations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The experiments only consider a rather outdated vision model (VGG).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>VGG was designed to use a minimal number of operations (convolution-and-pooling, fully-connected linear steps, ReLU activations, and batch normalization) and rely mostly on scale to solve the classification task. This makes VGG a good place to start our explorations and see how far a basic CNN can take us in terms of explaining experimental MEG effects in visual word recognition. However, we agree with the reviewer that it is easy to envision more advanced models that could potentially explain more. For our revision, we plan to expand on the question of where to go from here and outline our vision on what types of models would be worth investigating and how one may go about doing that in a way that provides insights beyond higher correlation values.</p>
