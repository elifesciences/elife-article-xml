<abstract>
<p>An imbalanced cholesterol level is a root cause of various pathologies. However, research on the role of cholesterol homeostasis in hearing physiopathology is still in its infancy. HSD17B7 (17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7) converts zymosterone to zymosterol in the process of cholesterol synthesis. Here, we found that Hsd17b7 is highly enriched in sensory hair cells of zebrafish and mice. The deficiency of Hsd17b7 led to reduced cholesterol levels in HEI-OC1 cells and hair cells of zebrafish, resulting in compromised MET and auditory function. A heterozygous nonsense variant, c.544G&gt;T (p.E182*) in <italic>HSD17B7</italic> was identified in an individual with bilateral profound hearing loss. mRNA of HSD17B7(p. E182*) failed to rescue the impaired MET and auditory function of hsd17b7 mutants. The mutation of HSD17B7 disrupted its interaction with RER1, leading to altered localization and cholesterol distribution. This provides an explanation for the pathogenic effect of the heterozygous mutation observed in the human case and zebrafish. The current study highlights HSD17B7 as a novel gene linked to sensorineural hearing loss.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Deafness is a common and highly disabling disease in humans that has not been effectively prevented or controlled. According to a survey report by the World Health Organization, the number of people suffering from deafness worldwide reached 466 million, accounting for more than 5% of the global population. By 2050, nearly 2.5 billion people are projected to have some degree of hearing loss. Deafness has become a major concern for global health. According to the 2016 population survey in China, approximately 70 million people experienced hearing loss. Among children in Jilin, Gansu, Guangdong, and Shanxi provinces of China, the prevalence rate of disabling hearing loss is 0.85%, and it is expected that this prevalence rate will increase year by year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. According to pathogenic factors, about 60% of deafness is caused by a genetic defect known as hereditary deafness. Investigating the genetic identification and molecular mechanisms of hereditary deafness would reveal the occurrence and development of the disease, which is the cornerstone of accurate diagnosis and prevention of deafness. Geneticists estimate that the total number of genes responsible for deafness is more than 1000. So far, around 156 non-syndromic deafness genes have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], and there are still a large number of new deafness genes that need to be identified.</p>
<p>Cholesterol is the most abundant sterol molecule in mammalian cells. It constitutes the cell membrane and is crucial in synthesizing important hormones, facilitating synapse formation, and mediating cell signaling transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that dysregulated intracellular cholesterol homeostasis in auditory cells is involved in auditory development defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], hereditary hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], noise-induced hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], ototoxic hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], and age-related hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that HSD17B7 converts zymosterone to zymosterol during the cholesterol synthesis process, and is expressed in the brain, heart, eye, and ear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. However, the function of HSD17B7 in the auditory system remains unexplored. No pathogenic HSD17B7 mutations have been reported to be associated with hearing loss. Here, we show that HSD17B7 is highly expressed in sensory hair cells in mice and zebrafish. Our findings highlight the critical role of HSD17B7 in the auditory system, positioning it as a potential therapeutic target for hearing loss.</p>

<title><italic>Hsd17b7</italic> expressed in sensory hair cells of zebrafish and mice</title>
<p>To assess the role of <italic>HSD17B7</italic> in the auditory system, we first investigated the expression of the <italic>hsd17b7</italic> in the developing zebrafish. Single-cell data analysis (accession no. GSE221471) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] categorized neuromast hair cell (cluster 0), supporting cell (cluster 1), macula hair cell (cluster 2), crista hair cell 1 (cluster 3), mantle cell (cluster 4) and crista hair cell 2 (cluster 5) using the Seurat 4.0.1 platform (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The feature plot and violin plot showed that <italic>hsd17b7</italic> was expressed in sensory hair cells, especially in neuromast hair cells (NM HCs) and crista hair cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Then, NM HCs, supporting cells, and mantle cells were ordered along pseudotime using Monocle 3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>), and a heatmap was generated to visualize the expression dynamics of marker genes in NM HC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). These data indicate that the expression of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> gene was gradually increased along the NM HC development trajectory (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Consistently, whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WISH) in zebrafish showed that <italic>hsd17b7</italic> was specifically enriched in the NM HCs and crista HCs at 72 hours post-fertilization (hpf) and 96 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). To further explore the localization of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> in zebrafish HCs, we generated a <italic>hsd17b7-egfp</italic> fusion construct driven by a hair cell-specific promoter, <italic>myosin 6b</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. We injected this construct into a fertilized egg and expressed the <italic>hsd17b7-egfp</italic> fusion in the HCs. Confocal imaging analysis revealed that Hsd17b-EGFP was localized to the cytoplasm in both crista HCs and NM HCs, exhibiting a punctate distribution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to further elucidate the expression of HSD17B7 in the mammal auditory system, we analyzed the expression levels of Hsd17b7 in three single-cell data sets of the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], we found that Hsd17b7 were highly expressed in outer hair cells (OHCs), utricles hair cells, and inner hair cells (IHCs), but less in crista hair cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). Next, we assessed the expression of HSD17B7 in C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Immunostaining analysis revealed that HSD17B7 was expressed in both outer hair cells (OHCs) and inner hair cells (IHCs) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>), confirming the scRNA-seq data. These results demonstrate that HSD17B7 is highly expressed in the sensory hair cells of zebrafish and mice.</p>
<p>In addition, phylogenetic and sequence alignment analysis revealed that vertebrate HSD17B7s share a significant similarity in amino acid sequences (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). UniProt sequence alignment analysis revealed that Danio rerio Hsd17b7 (NP_001070796.1) shares 58.2% identity with Homo sapiens HSD17B7 (NP_057455.1) and 67.1% identity with Mus musculus HSD17B7 (NP_034606.3), respectively (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). These data suggest that HSD17B7 is conserved and expressed in sensory hair cells across vertebrate species.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Hsd17b7 deficiency impaired auditory and MET function in zebrafish</title>
<p>To investigate the Hsd17b7 function in the auditory system, we generated <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mutant alleles using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>). The target site fragment was PCR-amplified and sequenced (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2D</xref>). Sequence analysis revealed that the mutant alleles included a 4-bp deletion and two 6-bp deletions in exon 3 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E</xref>). Subsequently, the 4-bp deletion mutant line was chosen for further experiments, which led to a reading frame shift and premature termination of protein translation. The mutant protein is predicted to translate to 96 amino acids, then adds 4 code-shifted residues (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2F</xref>).</p>
<p>We first examined the startle response evoked by auditory stimuli to assess the hearing abilities of zebrafish larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. We found that the movement trajectory, swimming velocity, and distance of the <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mutants were significantly decreased compared to those of the controls at 5 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), indicating that depletion of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> leads to significant hearing loss. To verify that the hearing loss was specifically caused by <italic>hsd17b7</italic> deficiency, we attempted to rescue the impaired auditory function by injecting the <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mRNA into <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mutants. It was shown that the microinjection of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mRNA successfully restored the compromised movement trajectory, swimming velocity, and distance of the hsd17b7 mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), indicating that Hsd17b7 is crucial for the auditory function in zebrafish.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we designed antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (<italic>hsd17b7</italic> Mo) to block the splicing of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> RNA at the junction of exon 1/intron 1 to knock down Hsd17b7 to verify the phenotype (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3B</xref>). RT-PCR revealed that natural <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mRNA expression was significantly reduced, and mis-spliced mRNA was observed after injection of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> Mo (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>). Additionally, we evaluated the knockdown efficiency and rescue efficiency of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> by immunoblotting. As expected, the protein levels of Hsd17b7 decreased significantly after <italic>hsd17b7</italic> Mo injection, and mRNA injection effectively rescued the Hsd17b7 protein level (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>). We subsequently found that the movement trajectory, distance, and swimming velocity of the <italic>hsd17b7</italic> morphants were significantly decreased compared to those of controls at 5 dpf (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>-<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3G</xref>). Moreover, <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mRNA effectively rescued the defective startle response of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> morphants (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>-<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3G</xref>). These results demonstrate that Hsd17b7 is required for auditory function.</p>
<p>Since Hsd17b7 deficiency impaired auditory function, we investigated whether the mechanotransduction (MET) function of Hsd17b7 mutants is compromised. We generated <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mutant alleles in the <italic>Tg(Brn3c: mGFP)</italic> transgenic line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], in which the membrane of sensory HCs are labeled with GFP. Confocal microscopy imaging analysis revealed that the average number of HCs in <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mutants was decreased compared to that of controls (∼16% reduction) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). FM4-64 (N-(3-Triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-(Diethylamino) Phenyl) Hexatrienyl) Pyridinium Dibromide) is a fluorescence dye that labels HCs and can rapidly permeate HCs through traversing open mechanosensitive channels, which were commonly used as a proxy for MET function in mature HCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. We found that at 5 dpf, the labeling intensity of FM4-64 in the HCs of the lateral line neuromasts in <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mutants was markedly reduced compared with that of controls (∼40% reduction) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Meanwhile, we also used the FM4-64 staining assay to examine the MET function of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> morphants. The results showed that the FM4-64 intensity in <italic>hsd17b7</italic> morphants was also significantly decreased compared to controls at 5 dpf (∼25% reduction) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4B</xref>). Given that the reduction in HC numbers (∼16%) is much smaller than the decrease in FM4-64 labeling intensity (∼40%), these results suggest that the loss of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> function primarily affects the MET function of HCs in zebrafish rather than the number of HCs.</p>
<p>To verify that <italic>hsd17b7</italic> is essential for the MET function, we performed a rescue experiment by injecting <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mRNA. It was demonstrated that microinjection of the <italic>hsd17b7</italic> mRNA successfully restored the FM4-64 intensity and the HC numbers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4B</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that <italic>hsd17b7</italic> is critical for MET function in zebrafish.</p>

<title>HSD17B7 regulated cholesterol levels <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>HSD17B7 converts zymosterone to zymosterol, participating in cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Previous research has indicated that abnormally high and low cholesterol levels are detrimental to hearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. To further explore the physiological mechanism underlying how HSD17B7 affects auditory function, we first verified whether HSD17B7 regulates cholesterol. It was shown that <italic>HSD17B7</italic> knockdown in HEI-OC1 cells led to a decrease in total cellular cholesterol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). The minimal cholesterol-binding domain 4 (D4H) cholesterol binding probe derived from the toxin Perfringolysin O (PFO) was widely used to monitor cholesterol at the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. D4H-mCherry was used to monitor the cholesterol in HEI-OC1 cells.

<title>A nonsense Variant in <italic>HSD17B7</italic> identified in human deafness</title>
<p>Given the established role of Hsd17b7 in auditory function in zebrafish, the human <italic>HSD17B7</italic> gene was screened in individuals with hearing loss (HL) who remained undiagnosed after analysis of 201 known HL genes using whole-genome sequencing (WGS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. The proband failed the newborn hearing screening, was enrolled in a special education school during early childhood, and presented at 8 years of age with bilateral profound hearing loss. Physical examination revealed two preauricular appendages anterior to the right ear but no other systemic abnormalities. The proband Ⅱ 1’s parents had normal hearing and no family history of HL but declined genetic testing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). A heterozygous nonsense variant, c.544G&gt;T (p.E182*) in <italic>HSD17B7</italic> (NM_016371.4) was identified and confirmed by Sanger sequencing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).

<p>The multiple sequence alignment showed that Glu182 is evolutionarily conserved in eight vertebrates, from zebrafish to humans (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), implying that the nonsense mutation may have a potential pathogenetic effect on HI. According to UniProt, the encoded HSD17B7 protein contains two topological domains (extracellular domain: 1-229 aa, cytoplasmic domain: 251-341 aa) and a transmembrane region (230-250 aa). The novel nonsense mutations in the extracellular domain of HSD17B7 (c.544G&gt;T) changed residue 182 from Glu to Ter (p.E182*) and resulted in the production of truncated proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition, the three-dimensional protein structure of HSD17B7 is first modeled to predict the effect of the nonsense mutation on the protein using the SWISS-MODEL protein structure database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://swissmodel.expasy.org">https://swissmodel.expasy.org</ext-link>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

<title>Heterozygous E182* mutation of HSD17B7 has a negative effect on the auditory function</title>
<p>To explore the pathogenetic role of HSD17B7 E182* heterozygous mutation in the patient’s hearing loss, we mimicked the proband Ⅱ heterozygote <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>vivo</italic>. We transiently expressed Flag-tagged HSD17B7 wild-type (HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup>) or E182* nonsense mutation (HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup>) in HEI-OC1 cells to examine their subcellular localization. Since cholesterol synthesis mainly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], we supposed that HSD17B7, an enzyme catalyzing cholesterol synthesis, might localize in the ER. Immunostaining revealed that HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> co-localized with Calnexin (an ER marker), whereas HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> did not and instead exhibited a spot-like aggregate distribution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). These results were confirmed by matching fluorescence signal intensity profiles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Given that the patient was a heterozygote mutant, we suspected that the HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> mutant might impair the subcellular localization of HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup>. Therefore, we performed immunostaining by co-transfecting HEI-OC1 cells with Flag-HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> and HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup>-Myc expression constructs. The results showed that the presence of the HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> protein did not alter the subcellular localization of HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), as confirmed by matching two fluorescence signal intensity profiles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>

The FM4-64 assay revealed that the overexpression of HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> did not result in a significant difference in fluorescence intensity compared to the control. In contrast, the overexpression of HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> led to a significant reduction of fluorescence intensity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). In addition, HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> overexpression did not alter the startle response compared to the control.

<p>Our studies have shown that HSD17B7 regulates cholesterol in vivo and in vitro (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), and previous research has demonstrated that proper cholesterol distribution in hair cells is essential for maintaining auditory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesize that the heterozygous HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup>mutation may lead to hearing loss by altering cholesterol distribution. Next, we co-transfected HEI-OC1 cells with Flag, Flag-HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup>or Flag-HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> constructs along with D4H-mCherry (cholesterol probe). Immunostaining results revealed that in cells expressing Flag or Flag-HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup>, the cholesterol was distributed in the same way around nuclei. In contrast, the nonsense mutation HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> significantly altered the distribution of D4H-mCherry, forming spot-like aggregation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Furthermore, HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> colocalized with D4H-mCherry, verified by the fluorescence intensity profile (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref>), suggesting that HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> may bind cholesterol and alter its intracellular distribution. Altogether, these results demonstrate that HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> has a negative effect via altering cholesterol distribution in HCs, leading to compromised MET function and auditory behaviors.</p>

<title>Nonsense mutation (p.E182*) of HSD17B7 disrupted the interaction with RER1 and caused the altered localization and cholesterol distribution</title>
<p>To further explore the pathological mechanism of HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup>, we transfected HEI-OC1 cells with Flag, Flag-HSD17B7<sup>WT,</sup> or Flag-HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> constructs and captured the target proteins by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). We subsequently performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the captured proteins (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). The proteins that interact with HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> and HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup>, respectively, are shown in the Venn diagram (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). We systematically identified the proteins specifically associated with HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> and HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup>. Consistent with the role of HSD17B7, proteins specifically associated with HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> were strongly enriched for cholesterol metabolic process, while proteins specifically associated with HSD17B7 <sup>E182*</sup> were strongly enriched for chromatin remodeling (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Considering that HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> and HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> have different subcellular localizations, we examined the cellular component of HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup>-specific and HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup>-specific interacting proteins. It was found that the HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup>-specific interacting proteins were enriched in the ER, while the HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup>-specific interacting proteins were enriched in the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>), consistent with the immunostaining results (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Among these ER-associated proteins, RER1 has the top hit (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). RER1 is involved in protein retention in ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. We verified the direct interaction between HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> and RER1 by an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HSD17B7, but not GST, is bound directly to RER1 fused His (RER1-His) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>). Next, we co-transfected HEI-OC1 cells with RER1-Myc along with Flag-HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> or Flag-HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> constructs. The immunostaining results indicated that RER1 co-localized with HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup>, whereas it did not co-localize with HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G</xref>), as confirmed by the intensity profiles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8I</xref>). These data demonstrate that RER1 interacts with HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> but not with HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup>, suggesting that the localization of HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> in the ER is due to its interaction with RER1. In contrast, HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> cannot interact with RER1, resulting in abnormal subcellular localization.</p>

<p>During transfection of Flag-HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> and Flag-HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> constructs in HEI-OC1 cells, we noticed that the number of positive cells expressing HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> was very low (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref>). Additionally, the IP results also suggested that the nonsense mutation E182* in HSD17B7 led to a significant decrease in protein levels compared to HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>).</p>
<p>To explain the phenomenon, we transfected equal amounts of Flag-HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> and Flag-HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> constructs to confirm their protein levels. Immunoblotting revealed that the levels of E182* mutation protein were significantly lower compared to those of the wild-type (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref>), consistent with our aforementioned findings. Next, we measured the mRNA level of HSD17B7<sup>WT</sup> and HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup>. RT-qPCR results showed that the mRNA levels of the E182* mutation were significantly lower compared to those of the wild-type (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6C</xref>). Considering that the E182* mutation decreased not only the protein levels but also the mRNA levels, we subsequently examined the effect of the mutation on the half-life periods of mRNA (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6E</xref>). Interestingly, the E182* mutation shortened the mRNA half-life periods of <italic>HSD17B7</italic> (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6D</xref>). Overall, the E182* mutation reduced the stability of <italic>HSD17B7</italic> mRNA, resulting in significantly decreased mRNA and protein levels. The abnormally low levels of HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> cannot bind with RER1, preventing proper localization of HSD17B7 to the ER. This, in return, disrupts cholesterol synthesis and distribution, resulting in abnormalities in MET function and auditory behaviors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reveals that HSD17B7 is enriched in sensory hair cells in zebrafish and mice, regulating cholesterol levels in hair cells, and is essential for normal mechanotransduction and auditory function. Loss of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> markedly reduces cholesterol in hair cells, causing abnormal MET function and hearing behaviors, suggesting that HSD17B7 is a novel candidate gene for sensory hearing loss. This was further supported by a case of sporadic deafness, in which we identified a previously undescribed variant (c.544G&gt;T, p.E182*) in <italic>HSD17B7</italic> through whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing analyses. The residual HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> protein alters subcellular localization and disrupts normal cholesterol distribution. The E182 mutation in HSD17B7 reduces the mRNA half-life, decreases mRNA abundance, and significantly lowers protein expression levels. Collectively, our findings suggest that the heterozygous c.544G&gt;T (p.E182*) in the HSD17B7 (NM_016371.4) gene disrupts auditory function through potential pathogenic mechanisms. First, the heterozygous E182* mutation altered the intracellular distribution of cholesterol. Second, the haploinsufficiency resulting from reduced HSD17B7 protein levels disrupts cholesterol biosynthesis. These mechanistic insights highlight the critical role of cholesterol homeostasis in auditory function, providing a molecular basis for the development of potential targeted therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>HSD17B7 was first identified in the rat prolactin receptor-associated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], which is thought to play a key role in the production of estradiol E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments demonstrated that HSD17B7 participated in cholesterol synthesis by catalyzing the reduction of zymosterone to zymosterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, a deficiency of HSD17B7 leads to decreased cholesterol levels, while overexpression of HSD17B7 results in increased cholesterol levels, consistent with the pathway of cholesterol synthesis. Previous studies have shown that HSD17B7 is expressed in the liver, heart, brain, eye, and ear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Although the role of the <italic>HSD17B7</italic> gene in ovarian and breast cancer has been extensively explored in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], the role of the <italic>HSD17B7</italic> gene in auditory function remains unclear. Our study highlights that HSD17B7 is essential for normal hearing in vertebrates. This conclusion is supported by the high expression of HSD17B7 in sensory hair cells across vertebrate inner ears, as revealed by the results of whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunostaining in our current study, as well as single-cell RNA sequencing data from our previous publication and those of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Given that loss of <italic>hsd17b7</italic> causes abnormal hearing behaviors, our research identifies HSD17B7 as a novel candidate gene for sensory hearing loss.</p>
<p>Cholesterol is a component of biological membranes, and it plays both structural and functional roles in the bio-membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that abnormally high or low cholesterol levels, or abnormal cholesterol distribution, are detrimental to the auditory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. However, they have not explored the effect of cholesterol synthesis by hair cells on this system. Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a common autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene. It is characterized by multiple congenital malformations and intellectual disability resulting from an inborn error of cholesterol synthesis. The syndrome exhibits a wide spectrum of manifestations, ranging from mild behavioral and learning difficulties to perinatal lethality. Additionally, patients commonly present with sensorineural hearing loss; however, auditory function has not been thoroughly investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Our study revealed that HSD17B7, an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, is enriched in sensory hair cells and regulates cholesterol levels in these cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining normal auditory function. We found that knocking down or knocking out HSD17B7 resulted in low cholesterol levels, leading to auditory deficiency, whereas overexpressing HSD17B7, which caused elevated cholesterol, did not affect auditory behaviors. Given that the stereocilia links of hair cell kinocilia require cholesterol anchoring, we hypothesize that the hair cell function requires cholesterol to maintain a minimum critical concentration. Cholesterol may stiffen biological membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], a biophysical feature that can be directly involved in MET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Conserved protein-lipid interactions in the TMC1 and TMC2 complex structures of MET-related proteins have been highlighted by cryo-EM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Our research found the truncated variant HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> disturbed cholesterol abundance and distribution <italic>in vitro</italic>. Considering that the absence of Hsd17b7 or the overexpression of HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> can lead to abnormal MET function <italic>in vivo</italic>, we hypothesized that HSD17B7 might regulate MET function by affecting the abundance or distribution of cholesterol in hair cells. Our study suggests that cholesterol might regulate hearing function by affecting MET function. Therefore, how cholesterol abnormalities caused by HSD17B7 deficiency or mutations regulate MET function requires further investigation.</p>
<p>Dominant non-syndromic hearing loss is common in patients with hereditary deafness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Typically, the dominant allele is inherited from one parent, and <italic>de novo</italic> mutations should be considered in all cases with a negative family history. Considering that the parents of the proband Ⅱ 1 had normal hearing but were not willing to provide blood samples for sequencing analysis, and combined with the Sanger sequencing analysis of the proband Ⅱ 1, it can be inferred that the proband Ⅱ 1 may have <italic>de novo</italic> dominant non-syndromic hearing loss. However, this conclusion requires further confirmation through additional clinical cases. Some examples of dominant-negative effects in deafness have been reported, such as <italic>KCQN4</italic> and <italic>GJB2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. Here, we report a case of sporadic deafness with an <italic>HSD17B7</italic> (c.544G&gt;T, p.E182*) heterozygous mutation, characterized by bilateral profound deafness with no other clinical features. We found that the mRNA of <italic>HSD17B7</italic> (c.544G&gt;T, p.E182*) could not rescue the abnormal auditory function caused by the <italic>hsd17b7</italic> KO in a zebrafish. Interestingly, the overexpression of the <italic>HSD17B7</italic> mutant mRNA in wild-type zebrafish impaired auditory function, indicating that this nonsense mutation has a negative effect. Our results suggest that the HSD17B7<sup>E182*</sup> mutant may be due to the altered cholesterol distribution.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that Hsd17b7 is required for auditory function by regulating cholesterol synthesis in sensory hair cells. Hsd17b7 deficiency leads to cholesterol abnormalities, disrupting the MET and auditory function. Additionally, we identified a sporadic nonsense mutation in the <italic>HSD17B7</italic> gene in patients with deafness. Our research provides new insights into the critical role of cholesterol in hearing preservation and lays a molecular function for targeted therapeutic strategies.</p>

We selected five cell populations for re-analysis based on previous reports, including neuromast hair cells (cluster 0), supporting cells (cluster 1), macula hair cell (cluster 2), cirsta hair cell 1 (cluster 3), mantle cells (cluster 4), and crista hair cell 2 (cluster 5). Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the R package clusterProfiler with the marker genes identified by Seurat V4.0.1 as the input, and the results were visualized using the enrich plot method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>].</p>
<p>To construct single cell trajectories, Monocle 3 (version 1.0.1) was used to cluster cells and reduce the dimensionality of gene expression matrices using UMAP. Monocle 3 package documentation was downloaded from <italic>GitHub</italic>. Subsets of cells that lead to the hair cell lineage were chosen using the “choose_cells” function for downstream analysis. The cells were ordered in pseudotime according to their development progress using the “order_cells” function and re-clustered in Monocle 3 for pseudotime and differential expression analysis. Cell paths were predicted by the “learn_graph” function of Monocle 3. The clusters identified as mantle cells furthest from the hair cells were chosen as the ‘‘roots’’ of the trajectory. Hair cells (cluster 0), supporting cells (cluster 1), and mantle cells (cluster 2) paths were selected separately (choose_cells) to plot their marker expression along pseudotime (plot_genes_in_pseudotime). Mouse scRNA-seq data was downloaded from previous articles (GSE71982, (GSE168901, GSE202920) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. The basic procedure for single-cell integrated data analysis and correction of batch effects were carried out in the Seurat 4.0.1 platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. We selected four cell populations for re-analysis, including inner hair cells, outer hair cells, utricle hair cells and crista hair cells.</p>

<title>Whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing analyses</title>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing was performed in the proband Ⅱ 1. Genomic DNA samples were extracted from whole blood samples of the proband Ⅱ 1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>The exomes and flanking intronic regions from whole blood DNA samples were captured by Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon Kit (Agilent Technologies, USA). The captured DNA was sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform (Illumina, USA). Bioinformatics were aligned to NCBI build37/hg19 assembly using the BWA (version 0.7.12) software. Each sample was covered to an average sequencing depth of at least 100×. SNPs and indels were identified using GATK HaplotypeCaller software. Candidate pathogenic variants were defined as nonsense, missense, splice-site, and indel variants with allele frequencies of 0.001 or less in public variant databases dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, ESP6500, nci60, GnomAD and in disease database of COSMIC, Clinvar, OMIM, GWAS. Genotypes distributed in every 0.3 cM of genomic region were chosen for calculation of the logarithm of odds (LOD) scores using the Merlin v. 1.1.2 parametric linkage analysis package. The proband Ⅱ 1 was genotyped by Sanger sequencing analyses with designed primers (F: 5’-GTACTCTGATTGGTGACGGGTGAG-3’, R: 5’- GACAGTCATAGTTCATAGTTTATT-3’)</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>GraphPad Prism 9 (version 9.4.0) supported the whole statistical analysis. All data were repeated more than three times and presented as mean ± SD. An unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test was performed for two-group comparisons, while multiple comparisons were illustrated using one-way ANOVA. The p-value less than 0.05 (p ≤ 0.05) was considered as significantly different. p ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.01, p ≤ 0.001, and p ≤ 0.0001 were symbolized with “*, **, ***, and ****”, respectively, and “ns” represented no significance, p &gt; 0.05.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>valuable</bold> data on the role of Hsd17b7, a gene involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, as a potential regulator of mechanosensory hair cell function. The authors used both zebrafish and the HEI cell line to examine the effects of deletion of Hsd17b7 on hair cell function and survival. While the results do show a reduction in hair cells in the lateral line neuromasts of Hsd17b7 mutant fish, the reduction was limited. The findings are considered <bold>incomplete</bold>, with additional experiments required to confirm the conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study identifies HSD17B7 as a cholesterol biosynthesis gene enriched in sensory hair cells, with demonstrated importance for auditory behavior and potential involvement in mechanotransduction. Using zebrafish knockdown and rescue experiments, the authors show that loss of hsd17b7 reduces cholesterol levels and impairs hearing behavior. They also report a heterozygous nonsense variant in a patient with hearing loss. The gene mutation has a complex and somewhat inconsistent phenotype, appearing to mislocalize, reduce mRNA and protein levels, and alter cholesterol distribution, supporting HSD17B7 as a potential deafness gene.</p>
<p>While the study presents an interesting candidate and highlights an underexplored role for cholesterol in hair cell function, several important claims are insufficiently supported, and the mechanistic interpretations remain somewhat murky.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) HSD17B7 is a new candidate deafness gene with plausible biological relevance.</p>
<p>(2) Cross-species RNAseq convincingly shows hair-cell enrichment.</p>
<p>(3) Lipid metabolism, particularly cholesterol homeostasis, is an emerging area of interest in auditory function.</p>
<p>(4) The connection between cholesterol levels and MET is potentially impactful and, if substantiated, would represent a significant advance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The pathogenic mechanism of the E182STOP variant is unclear: The mutant protein presumably does not affect WT protein localization, arguing against a dominant-negative effect. Yet, overexpression of HSD17B7-E182* alone causes toxicity in zebrafish, and it binds and mislocalizes cholesterol in HEI-OC1 cells, suggesting some gain-of-function or toxic effect. In addition, the mRNA of the variant has a low expression level, suggesting nonsense-mediated decay. This complexity and inconsistency need clearer explanation.</p>
<p>(2) The link to human deafness is based on a single heterozygous patient with no syndromic features. Given that nearly all known cholesterol metabolism disorders are syndromic, this raises concerns about causality or specificity. The term &quot;novel deafness gene&quot; is premature without additional cases or segregation data.</p>
<p>(3) The localization of HSD17B7 should be clarified better: In HEI-OC1 cells, HSD17B7 localizes to the ER, as expected. In mouse hair cells, the staining pattern is cytosolic and almost perfectly overlaps with the hair cell marker used, Myo7a. This needs to be discussed. Without KO tissue, HSD17B7 antibody specificity remains uncertain.</p>

<p>A summary of what the authors were trying to achieve.</p>
<p>The authors aim to determine whether the gene Hsb17b7 is essential for hair cell function and, if so, to elucidate the underlying mechanism, specifically the HSB17B7 metabolic role in cholesterol biogenesis. They use animal, tissue, or data from zebrafish, mouse, and human patients.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This is the first study of Hsb17b7 in the zebrafish (a previous report identified this gene as a hair cell marker in the mouse utricle).</p>
<p>(2) The authors demonstrate that Hsb17b7 is expressed in hair cells of zebrafish and the mouse cochlea.</p>
<p>(3) In zebrafish larvae, a likely KO of the Hsb17b7 gene causes a mild phenotype in an acoustic/vibrational assay, which also involves a motor response.</p>
<p>(4) In zebrafish larvae, a likely KO of the Hsb17b7 gene causes a mild reduction in lateral line neuromast hair cell number and a mild decrease in the overall mechanotransduction activity of hair cells, assayed with a fluorescent dye entering the mechanotransduction channels.</p>
<p>(5) When HSB17B7 is overexpressed in a cell line, it goes to the ER, and an increase in Cholesterol cytoplasmic puncta is detected. Instead, when a truncated version of HSB17B7 is overexpressed, HSB17B7 forms aggregates that co-localize with cholesterol.</p>
<p>(6) It seems that the level of cholesterol in crista and neuromast hair cells decreases when Hsb17b7 is defective (but see comment below).</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>(1) The statement that HSD17B7 is &quot;highly&quot; expressed in sensory hair cells in mice and zebrafish seems incorrect for zebrafish:</p>
<p>(a) The data do not support the notion that HSB17B7 is &quot;highly expressed&quot; in zebrafish. Compared to other genes (TMC1, TMIE, and others), the HSB17B7 level of expression in neuromast hair cells is low (Figure 1F), and by extension (Figure 1C), also in all hair cells. This interpretation is in line with the weak detection of an mRNA signal by ISH (Figure 1G I&quot;). On this note, the staining reported in I&quot; does not seem to label the cytoplasm of neuromast hair cells. An antisense probe control, along with a positive control (such as TMC1 or another), is necessary to interpret the ISH signal in the neuromast.</p>
<p>(b) However, this is correct for mouse cochlear hair cells, based on single-cell RNA-seq published databases and immunostaining performed in the study. However, the specificity of the anti-HSD17B7 antibody used in the study (in immunostaining and western blot) is not demonstrated. Additionally, it stains some supporting cells or nerve terminals. Was that expression expected?</p>
<p>(2) A previous report showed that HSD17B7 is expressed in mouse vestibular hair cells by single-cell RNAseq and immunostaining in mice, but it is not cited:</p>

<p>(3) Overexpressed HSD17B7-EGFP C-terminal fusion in zebrafish hair cells shows a punctiform signal in the soma but apparently does not stain the hair bundles. One limitation is the consequence of the C-terminal EGFP fusion to HSD17B7 on its function, which is not discussed.</p>
<p>(4) A mutant Zebrafish CRISPR was generated, leading to a truncation after the first 96 aa out of the 340 aa total. It is unclear why the gene editing was not done closer to the ATG. This allele may conserve some function, which is not discussed.</p>
<p>(5) The hsd17b7 mutant allele has a slightly reduced number of genetically labeled hair cells (quantified as a 16% reduction, estimated at 1-2 HC of the 9 HC present per neuromast). On a note, it is unclear what criteria were used to select HC in the picture. Some Brn3C:mGFP positive cells are apparently not included in the quantifications (Figure 2F, Figure 5A).</p>
<p>(6) The authors used FM4-64 staining to evaluate the hair cell mechanotransduction activity indirectly. They found a 40% reduction in labeling intensity in the HCs of the lateral line neuromast. Because the reduction of hair cell number (16%) is inferior to the reduction of FM4-64 staining, the authors argue that it indicates that the defect is primarily affecting the mechanotransduction function rather than the number of HCs. This argument is insufficient. Indeed, a scenario could be that some HC cells died and have been eliminated, while others are also engaged in this path and no longer perform the MET function. The numbers would then match. If single-cell staining can be resolved, one could determine the FM4-64 intensity per cell. It would also be informative to evaluate the potential occurrence of cell death in this mutant. On another note, the current quantification of the FM4-64 fluorescence intensity and its normalization are not described in the methods. More importantly, an independent and more direct experimental assay is needed to confirm this point. For example, using a GCaMP6-T2A-RFP allele for Ca2+ imaging and signal normalization.</p>
<p>(7) The authors used an acoustic startle response to elicit a behavioral response from the larvae and evaluate the &quot;auditory response&quot;. They found a significative decrease in the response (movement trajectory, swimming velocity, distance) in the hsd17b7 mutant. The authors conclude that this gene is crucial for the &quot;auditory function in zebrafish&quot;.</p>
<p>This is an overstatement:</p>
<p>(a) First, this test is adequate as a screening tool to identify animals that have lost completely the behavioral response to this acoustic and vibrational stimulation, which also involves a motor response. However, additional tests are required to confirm an auditory origin of the defect, such as Auditory Evoked Potential recordings, or for the vestibular function, the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex.</p>
<p>(b) Secondly, the behavioral defects observed in the mutant compared to the control are significantly different, but the differences are slight, contained within the Standard Deviation (20% for velocity, 25% for distance). To this point, the Figure 2 B and C plots are misleading because their y-axis do not start at 0.</p>
<p>(8) Overexpression of HSD17B7 in cell line HEI-OC1 apparently &quot;significantly increases&quot; the intensity of cholesterol-related signal using a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor (D4H-mCherry). However, the description of this quantification (per cell or per surface area) and the normalization of the fluorescent signal are not provided.</p>
<p>(9) When this experiment is conducted in vivo in zebrafish, a reduction in the &quot;DH4 relative intensity&quot; is detected (same issue with the absence of a detailed method description). However, as the difference is smaller than the standard deviation, this raises questions about the biological relevance of this result.</p>
<p>(10) The authors identified a deaf child as a carrier of a nonsense mutation in HSB17B7, which is predicted to terminate the HSB17B7 protein before the transmembrane domain. However, as no genetic linkage is possible, the causality is not demonstrated.</p>
<p>(11) Previous results obtained from mouse HSD17B7-KO (citation below) are not described in sufficient detail. This is critical because, in this paper, the mouse loss-of-function of HSD17B7 is embryonically lethal, whereas no apparent phenotype was reported in heterozygotes, which are viable and fertile. Therefore, it seems unlikely that heterozygous mice exhibit hearing loss or vestibular defects; however, it would be essential to verify this to support the notion that the truncated allele found in one patient is causal.</p>

<p>(12) The authors used this truncated protein in their startle response and FM4-64 assays. First, they show that contrary to the WT version, this truncated form cannot rescue their phenotypes when overexpressed. Secondly, they tested whether this truncated protein could recapitulate the startle reflex and FM4-64 phenotypes of the mutant allele. At the homozygous level (not mentioned by the way), it can apparently do so to a lesser degree than the previous mutant. Again, the differences are within the Standard Deviation of the averages. The authors conclude that this mutation found in humans has a &quot;negative effect&quot; on hearing, which is again not supported by the data.</p>
<p>(13) The authors looked at the distribution of the HSB17B7 in a cell line. The WT version goes to the ER, while the truncated one forms aggregates. An interesting experiment consisted of co-expressing both constructs (Figure S6) to see whether the truncated version would mislocalize the WT version, which could be a mechanism for a dominant phenotype. However, this is not the case.</p>
<p>(14) Through mass spectrometry of HSB17B7 proteins in the cell line, they identified a protein involved in ER retention, RER1. By biochemistry and in a cell line, they show that truncated HSB17B7 prevents the interaction with RER1, which would explain the subcellular localization.</p>

<p>(15) Information and specificity validation of the HSB17B7 antibody are not presented. It seems that it is the same used on mice by IF and on zebrafish by Western. If so, the antibody could be used on zebrafish by IF to localize the endogenous protein (not overexpression as done here). Secondly, the specificity of the antibody should be verified on the mutant allele. That would bring confidence that the staining on the mouse is likely specific.</p>
