<title>Abstract</title><sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Despite its conserved basic structure, the morphology of the insect brain and the timing of its development underwent evolutionary adaptions. However, little is known on the developmental processes that create this diversity. The central complex is a brain centre required for multimodal information processing and an excellent model to understand neural development and divergence. It is produced in large parts by type-II neuroblasts, which produce intermediate progenitors, another type of cycling precursor, to increase their neural progeny. These neural stem cells are believed to be conserved among insects, but their molecular characteristics and their role in brain development in other insect neurogenetics models, such as the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> have so far not been studied.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Using CRISPR-Cas9 we created a fluorescent enhancer trap marking expression of <italic>Tribolium fez/earmuff</italic>, a key marker for type-II neuroblast derived intermediate progenitors. Using combinatorial labelling of further markers including <italic>Tc-pointed</italic>, <italic>Tc-deadpan</italic>, <italic>Tc-asense</italic> and <italic>Tc-prospero</italic> we characterized the type-II neuroblast lineages present in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo and their sub-cell-types. Intriguingly, we found 9 type-II neuroblast lineages in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo while <italic>Drosophila</italic> produces only 8 per brain hemisphere. In addition, these lineages are significantly larger at the embryonic stage than they are in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and contain more intermediate progenitors, enabling the relative earlier development of the central complex. Finally, we mapped these lineages to the domains of early expressed head pattering genes. Notably, <italic>Tc-otd</italic> is absent from all type-II neuroblasts and intermediate progenitors, whereas <italic>Tc-six3</italic> marks an anterior subset of the type-II-lineages. The placodal marker <italic>Tc-six4</italic> specifically marks the territory where anterior medial type-II neuroblasts differentiate.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Homologous type-II neuroblasts show a conserved molecular signature between fly and beetle. Enhanced activity of the embryonic beetle neuroblasts-type-II and intermediate progenitors is associated with an earlier central complex development when compared to the fly. Our findings on the differentiation of beetle type-II neuroblasts and on specific marker genes open the possibility to decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms acting at the stem cell level that contribute to evolutionary divergence in developmental timing and neural morphology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neural development of insects allows to study molecular and cellular principles in easy to manipulate invertebrate models. The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<italic>Drosophila</italic> hereafter) has mostly been used for his purpose, making it one of the best understood models for neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. However, it has remained a puzzle, how the huge ecological diversity of insects and the divergent neural anatomies adapted to different niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] evolved. Furthermore, <italic>Drosophila</italic> may in many instances not be a good representation of insect development and some processes are derived in the fly lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. For these reasons the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (<italic>Tribolium</italic> hereafter) has been introduced as an additional model for insect neural development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] and many molecular genetic manipulation and labelling methods have been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Specifically, labelling of neural cell types in <italic>Tribolium</italic> has been facilitated by the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Another factor that makes <italic>Tribolium</italic> an informative model for the understanding of insect brain development is the more conserved development of the head neuroectoderm facilitating the identification of specific neurogenic domains and allowing cross-species comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The insect central complex is an anterior, midline spanning neuropile and constitutes an important brain centre for the processing of sensory input, coordination of movement and navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Between the two insect models <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic> a temporal shift in the emergence of central complex neuropile was observed with <italic>Tribolium</italic> developing a functional larval central complex during embryogenesis whereas it develops only at the onset of adult life in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. It is however not known how these temporal differences are established during development on a cellular and molecular level. The entire insect central nervous system including the brain is produced by neural stem cells, the neuroblasts (NBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. While there are evolutionary modifications in the relative position of trunk NBs and their gene expression profiles between fly and beetle, the core determinants specifying their role as neural progenitors are conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. NBs undergo repeated divisions producing rows of ganglion mother cells (GMCs) which divide one more time to produce neurons and/or glia (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, top panel). This leads to neural cell lineages that include the neuroblast itself and its progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Several NBs of the anterior-most part of the neuroectoderm contribute to the CX and compared to the ventral ganglia produced by the trunk segments, it is of distinctively greater complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Intriguingly, a neuroblast subtype, type-II neuroblasts (type-II NBs), were found to prominently contribute to the formation of the central complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the grasshopper <italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. These specific neuroblasts generate more offspring by producing another class of neural precursors, the intermediate progenitors (INPs), which also divide in a stem cell like fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, lower panel). While type II NBs were found in both grasshopper and flies, only in <italic>Drosophila</italic> they have been characterized molecularly.</p>

<caption><title>Neuroblasts of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system.</title>
<p>Type-I neuroblasts (type-I NBs) (top panel) and type-II (type-II NBs) (lower panel). Type-I NB undergo stem-cell-like divisions with each round producing a ganglion mother cell (GMC) that divides one more time to produce two neurons or glia cells. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, all type-I NBs express <italic>dpn</italic> and <italic>ase</italic> whereas GMCs express only <italic>ase</italic>. Type-II NBs express <italic>dpn</italic> and <italic>pnt</italic> but not <italic>ase</italic>. They also undergo repeated divisions, with each round producing an intermediate progenitor cell (INP) which also is a proliferating progenitor and expresses <italic>ase</italic>. INPs undergo a maturation process during which <italic>pnt</italic> is still expressed initially, but not <italic>dpn</italic>. Mature INPs express <italic>dpn</italic>, <italic>ase</italic> and <italic>fez/erm</italic> whereas GMCs express <italic>ase</italic> and <italic>fez/erm</italic>. Type-II NB lineages are only found in the anterior brain, they produce central complex neurons and glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="592395v1_fig1.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>The dramatically increased number of neural cells that are produced by individual type-II lineages, and the fact that one lineage can produce different types of neurons, leads to the generation of increased neural complexity within the anterior insect brain when compared to the ventral nerve cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Type-II NBs have attracted a lot of attention because intermediate cycling progenitors have also been described in vertebrates, the radial glia cells, which also produce a variety of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In addition, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain tumours have been induced from type-II NBs lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], opening up the possibility of modelling tumorigenesis in an invertebrate brain, thus making these lineages one of the most intriguing stem cell model in invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on descriptions of large proliferative lineages in the grasshopper <italic>Schistocerca gregaria,</italic> a hemimetabolous insect distantly related to flies, it is widely believed that type-II NBs and INPs are conserved within insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. However, molecular characterisation of such lineages in another insect but the fly and a thorough comparison of type-II NBs lineages and their sub-cell-types between fly and beetle are still lacking.</p>
<p>The characterization of type-II NBs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has in large parts been based on a specific reporter line in which eGFP expression is driven by an <italic>earmuff (fez/erm)</italic> enhancer element and marks INP-lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. <italic>Tribolium earmuff</italic> has been first described as <italic>Tc-fez</italic>, referring to the vertebrate <italic>earmuff</italic> ortholog <italic>fez</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. We will use <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> in the following. A defined sequence of gene expression has been described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs, INPs and GMCs. The ETS-transcription factor <italic>pointed</italic> (<italic>pnt</italic>) marks type-II NBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], which do not express the type-I NB marker <italic>asense</italic> (<italic>ase</italic>) but the pro-neural gene deadpan (<italic>dpn</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Intermediate progenitors express <italic>fez/erm</italic> and <italic>ase</italic> and at a more mature stage also <italic>dpn</italic>, whereas <italic>prospero</italic> (<italic>pros</italic>) marks mature INPs and GMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. <italic>Six4</italic> is another marker for <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs and INPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present work we characterize type-II neuroblasts in <italic>Tribolium</italic> with respect to their number, their location and the conservation of the molecular markers known from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We also wanted to test, in how far the earlier emergence of the central complex in beetles would be reflected by a change of division activity of type-II NBs or intermediate progenitors. To that end, we created a <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> enhancer trap line to characterize embryonic <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> -expressing cells including INPs and GMCs of type-II NBs lineages and combined this with other labelling methods including multicolour hy<italic>bridisation chain reaction</italic> (HCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. We found that the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo produces 9 <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-expressing type-II NBs compared to only 8 type-II NB lineages in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. We show that these lineages produce central complex cells and confirm a largely conserved molecular code that differentiates INPs of distinct maturation stages and GMCs. Intriguingly, we found that lineage sizes in <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryos are considerably larger and include more mature INPs than in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], thus providing the material for the embryonic early central complex formation in <italic>Tribolium</italic>. We also show that the placodal marker gene <italic>Tc-six4</italic> characterizes the embryonic tissue that gives rise to the larger anterior group of type-II NBs, whereas <italic>Tc-six3</italic> is marking only an anterior subset of these lineages. Interestingly there is a part of the central complex precursors expressing neither <italic>Tc-six3</italic> nor <italic>Tc-otd,</italic> which is absent from all type-II NBs lineages.</p>

<title>A CRISPR-Cas9-NHEJ generated enhancer trap lines marks <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-expressing cells at the embryonic and larval stage</title>
<p>We created an enhancer trap line driving eGFP that reflects <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> gene expression in the embryo. We named the line <italic>fez magic mushrooms</italic> (fez-mm-eGFP) because it marks the mushroom bodies of the larval brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A-C). The reporter construct was inserted 160 bp upstream of the <italic>fez/erm</italic>-transcription start site using the <italic>non-homologous end joining</italic> (NHEJ) repair mechanism (see supplementary Fig. S1 for scheme). Analysis of eGFP co-expression with <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-RNA at the embryonic stage revealed that fez-mm-eGFP co-localized with most <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, panel D). The fez-mm-eGFP line marked several progenitor cell types including cells that we characterize as type-II NB-derived intermediate progenitors (see below). Based on these analyses, we use the fez-mm eGFP expression as a reporter for <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> expression.</p>

<title><italic>Tc-pointed</italic> marks a population of nine type-II NBs that are associated with fez-mm-eGFP marked INP-lineages</title>
<p>To identify type II NBs, we searched for cell groups that express the markers known from flies. The transcription factor <italic>pointed</italic> (<italic>pnt</italic>) marks type-II NBs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and is required for their correct differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. In both <italic>Tribolium</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>pnt</italic> is also expressed in other areas (this work/[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]). Therefore, we looked for <italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>pnt</italic>-expression in large cells with large nuclei (typical NB morphology) that were closely associated with <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-expressing cells (marking putative INPs). We found a total of 9 such clusters instead of the 8 expected from flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A-C). We also found that the large <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> expressing cells as well as fez-mm-eGFP expressing cells are mitotically active (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C-I). Further molecular and cell size analysis corroborated our interpretation that these cells constitute type-II NBs, intermediate progenitors (INPs) at different maturation stages and ganglion mother cells (GMCs) (see details below).</p>

<p>Looking at a series of embryonic stages we determined the emergence and further development of <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> and fez-mm-eGFP expressing lineages as well as their arrangement with respect to the embryonic head and to one another. We first detected conspicuous adjacent expression of <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> and fez-mm-eGFP at stage NS7 (not shown). At stage NS11 seven <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-clusters are present in a horse-shoe-shaped formation surrounding fez-mm-eGFP positive cells (white arrows in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A, star marks one cluster out of focus). At stage NS13 these groups are found in a position at the medial border of the head lobes and their number has increased to nine. The seven clusters that were already present at stage NS11 are arranged in an anterior group (white arrowheads in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) at stage NS13 while two additional clusters have emerged more posteriorly (yellow arrows in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-I</xref>). The clusters are in different depths (reflected by the three optical sections shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B-I to B-III, clusters out of focus are visualized by grey circles in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B’I-II, respectively). Fez-mm-eGFP expression not related to type II NB offspring was found in the lateral head lobe from NS13 onwards (blue arrowheads in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). At stage NS14 six of the anterior-medial clusters are aligned in one plane along the medial rim of the developing brain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C-I), whereas the most posterior cluster of the anterior group is located at a separate position and in a deeper plane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>-II). The posterior group is found at about the same focal plane as well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C-II). The aligned six clusters produce their <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-positive offspring towards laterally whereas the <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-positive offspring of the more posterior cluster is found medially of it (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C-II). The two most posterior clusters produce <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-cells in an anterior-lateral direction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C-II). The apparent re-arrangement of the <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-clusters from the anterior rim of the embryonic head to a medial position reflects not active migration but follows the overall tissue movements during head morphogenesis that was previously described in <italic>Tribolium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D). Based on their position by the end of embryogenesis (stage NS14) we assign the nine type-II NB clusters into two groups: one anterior median group consisting of seven type-II NBs and one posterior group consisting of two type-II NBs (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C and D).</p>

<title>Characterization of cell- and nuclear size of <italic>pnt</italic>-positive type II NBs</title>
<p>We wanted to confirm that each of the <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> and <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> expressing lineages contains a neuroblast. Neuroblasts, including type-II NBs, are larger than other cells, have larger nuclei and are mitotically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Therefore, we determined the cell size of the largest cells of the <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> cluster and compared it to a random sample of cells of the embryonic head. Both samples were taken from stage NS13 and NS14 embryos. We found that the cells that we had assigned as Type-II NBs had a significantly larger diameter (av.: 12.98 µm; n=43) than cells of the reference sample (av.: 6.75 µm; n= 1579) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).

<title>Conserved patterns of gene expression mark <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NBs, different stages of INPs and GMCs</title>
<p><italic>Drosophila,</italic> type-II NBs, INPs and GMCs express a specific sequence of pro-neural genes including <italic>asense</italic> (<italic>ase</italic>), <italic>deadpan</italic> (<italic>dpn</italic>) and <italic>prospero</italic> (<italic>pros</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. However, these markers have up to now not been tested for expression in type-II lineages in other organisms. We tested if the respective lineages express these markers in a comparable sequence in the beetle and if they mark distinctive cell types within the lineages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A-D and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A, B). We found that the large <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-positive but fez-mm-eGFP negative cells (i.e. type-II NBs) express the pro-neural gene <italic>Tc-dpn</italic>, in line with expression of this gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural precursors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, panel A). Like <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs, these cells do not express the type-I NB marker <italic>ase</italic> (yellow arrowhead in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, panel D). We further found that, like the type-II NBs itself, the youngest <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-positive but fez-mm-eGFP-negative INPs neither express <italic>Tc-ase</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, pink arrowheads). Expression of <italic>Tc-ase</italic> starts in slightly more mature (but still <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-positive) INPs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D; blue arrowhead) and is maintained in the <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-negative INPs that are marked by fez-mm-eGFP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, panel D and E). <italic>Tc-dpn</italic> is absent from the youngest <italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>pnt</italic>-positive INPs (pink arrowheads) but is expressed in more mature INPs (blue arrowheads in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, panel B). Cells that are located at the distal end of the lineages do not express <italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>dpn</italic> but are positive for fez-mm<italic>-</italic>eGFP and <italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>ase</italic> are classified as GMCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, panels B, C and E). We found the pro-neural gene <italic>Tc-pros</italic> expressed in most fez-mm-eGFP expressing cells of a lineage (in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, panel A-B) and infer from the extent of the expression that it is expressed in mature INPs (<italic>Tc-dpn</italic>+) and GMCs (<italic>Tc-dpn-</italic>). Fez-mm-eGFP positive cells at the base of the lineage that do not express <italic>Tc-pros</italic> are young INPs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A, B; blue arrowheads). In summary, the expression dynamics found in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NBs lineages are very similar to the one found in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> Therefore these neural markers can be used for a classification of type II NBs (<italic>Tc-pnt</italic>+, <italic>Tc-ase</italic>-), young INPs (<italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>pnt</italic>+, <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-, <italic>Tc-ase</italic>-), immature INPs (<italic>Tc-pnt</italic>+, <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>+, <italic>Tc-ase</italic>+), mature INPs (<italic>Tc-dpn</italic>+, <italic>Tc-ase</italic>+, <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>+, <italic>Tc-pros</italic>+), and GMCs (<italic>Tc-ase</italic>+, <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>+, <italic>Tc-pros</italic>+, <italic>Tc-dpn</italic>).

<title>The <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryonic lineages of type-II NBs are larger and contain more mature INPs than those of <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>

As type-II NBs contribute to central complex development, we asked, in how far the embryonic division pattern of these lineages would reflect this heterochronic development.

As we were not always able to distinguish between cells belonging to neighbouring INP-lineages we quantified and averaged the cell number of all lineages of the anterior medial group.

<title>Type-II NBs and their lineages are differentially marked by the head patterning transcription factors <italic>Tc-six4</italic> and <italic>Tc-six3</italic> but do not express <italic>Tc-otd</italic></title>
<p>All type II lineages show the same developmental trajectory from NB via the INP to the GMC and express the respective marker genes. However, these lineages show at least partially diverging projection patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Hence, we wondered, what genes might give type II NBs different spatial identities. We tested co-expression with previously characterized head patterning transcription factors <italic>Tc-otd</italic>, <italic>Tc-six4</italic>, <italic>Tc-six3</italic>, known to be active in the developing protocerebrum (<italic>Tc-otd</italic>) and in the anterior medial region of the neuroectoderm, where type-II NB emerge (<italic>Tc-six3</italic>, <italic>Tc-six4</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. We found no co-expression of fez-mm-eGFP marked cells of both the anterior medial and posterior lineages with <italic>Tc-otd</italic>. Rather, <italic>Tc-otd</italic> was expressed in the surrounding embryonic head tissue. <italic>Tc-otd</italic> was also absent from the type-II NBs themselves (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> panel A-B). However, <italic>Tc-otd</italic> might be expressed in neural cells derived from these lineages as we can detect expression in the central area of the brain lobes where for instance skh cells are located (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> panel A, F; 10 panel A-B). Interestingly, we found that <italic>Tc-six4</italic> is expressed specifically in that area of the head lobe in which the type-II NBs clusters 1-6 of the anterior medial group first differentiate. At stage NS13 <italic>Tc-six4</italic> marks both, type-II NBs and fez-mm-eGFP expressing INPs and some surrounding cells (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>, panel A). At the following differentiation stage (NS14) <italic>Tc-six4</italic> still marks the type-II NBs clusters of the anterior medial group but is not expressed in the fez-mm-eGFP INPs (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref> panel B). It is also not expressed in the posterior group of type-II NBs but only marks type-II NBs of the anterior medial group. Finally, we found that <italic>Tc-six3</italic> marks, and is restricted to, the anterior-most lineages 1-4 including both the type-II NBs and the fez-mm-eGFP marked INPs/GMCs (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref> panel C). These results reveal candidates for distinguishing type-II identity from type-I NBs in the brain. Only the latter is possibly marked by <italic>Tc-otd</italic> as <italic>Drosophila otd</italic> is expressed in type-I brain neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. By contrast, <italic>Tc-six4</italic> only marks type-II NB and appears to be an early determinant of the anterior medial group. <italic>Tc-six4</italic> is also a candidate for distinguishing the anterior medial from the posterior cluster. The results also reveal a subdivision of the anterior cluster by <italic>Tc-six3</italic>, which marks the four most anterior NB-type II.</p>

<title>A beetle enhancer trap lines reflects <italic>Tc-fez/earmuff</italic> expression</title>
<p>The discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has brought the possibility of performing targeted genome editing to create mutants and knock-in lines to a wide range of less traditional model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. The possibility of creating imaging lines that mark the expression of specific subsets of neural cells in the beetle greatly enhances its suitability as a model for developmental neurogenetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. We used n<italic>on-homologous end joining</italic> (NHEJ) to insert a reporter construct upstream of the Tc-<italic>fez/erm</italic>-gene and by these means created an enhancer trap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Enhancer traps sometimes only reflect parts of a gene expression pattern, which can also make them more cell type specific. However, our line shows extensive co-expression with <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> RNA at the embryonic stage, suggesting that it reflects the entire expression of <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> at least at this stage.</p>

<title>Evolutionary divergence of number and grouping of embryonic type-II NBs lineages between beetle, fly and grasshopper</title>
<p>We have identified a total of 9 type-II NBs lineages on each side of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryonic head. This is surprising as in both, the hemimetabolan grasshopper <italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic> and the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> only 8 embryonic type-II NBs were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Our finding of an additional type-II NB lineage at the embryonic stage represents a major evolutionary divergence between these insects. Further research is required to determine if this difference is associated with morphological differences of the brain. Although in the frame of this work we did not perform lineage tracing we can speculate about which NB might be lacking in fly embryos based on our data. In the hemimetabolan <italic>Schistocerca</italic> there is no obvious clustering of type-II NBs and they are all arranged in one row at the medial rim of the head lobes. In <italic>Tribolium</italic> we have observed an arrangement of the type-II NBs into two groups per side, one large anterior medial group containing seven type-II NBs clusters and one posterior group of two type-II NBs. The anterior six of the anterior medial group are arranged in one row like in the grasshopper. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> there are three described groups referred to as the anterior, the middle and the posterior cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. The posterior cluster consists of two type-II NBs and therefore most likely corresponds to the posterior two type-II NBs in <italic>Tribolium</italic>. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> middle and anterior cluster are most likely equivalent to the anterior medial group of <italic>Tribolium.</italic> However, the type-II NB 7, which is we assigned to the anterior medial group but which is a bit separated and produces offspring into the opposite direction (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C-II, white arrow) might be the one that does not have a homologue in the fly embryo The identification of more specific spatial markers for type-II NBs (in addition to <italic>Tc-six3</italic> and <italic>Tc-six4</italic>) or lineage tracing tools are required to identify the neuroblast, which is not present in fly embryos. Subsequently, it would be especially interesting to see what the role of the additional type-II NBs in the beetle is and which neuropile it contributes to.</p>
<p>Summing up, there is a tendency towards grouping of type-II NBs into subsets in the holometabolan models that was not observed in the only hemimetabolan studied so far. A ninth type-II NBs was only found in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo represents a striking developmentally divergent feature, but its role and the homologisation of individual type-II NBs between the different insects requires further studies.</p>

<title>Gene expression identifies homologous cell types and suggests conservation of gene function between fly and beetle type-II NB lineages</title>
<p>The genes defining the different stages of differentiation in type-II NB lineages have been identified and intensively studied in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> but it had remained unclear, in how far the respective patterns and mechanisms were conserved. Our results show a large degree of conservation of expression and probably also function – at least in holometabola. We identified type-II NBs by their larger than average size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] and the expression of the signature marker <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> adjacent to a group of <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> expressing cells (INPs and GMCs). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> both these factors have key functions in defining the developmental potential of type-II NBs and INPs: Pnt suppresses Ase in type-II NBs and promotes the formation of INPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Loss of <italic>pnt</italic> expression leads to a de-differentiation of INPs as <italic>fez/erm</italic> is no longer repressed in young INPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Fez/Erm controls proliferation of INPs by activating Pros and prevents dedifferentiation of INPs into type-II NBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. We show that also in <italic>Tribolium</italic> INPs undergo a maturation process, during which expression of <italic>Tc-pnt</italic> stalls and expression of <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> is switched on. Despite both factors characterising different stages of INP maturation they are not completely mutual exclusive and we observed a small window of overlap in young INPs, highly suggestive of a conserved role of Pnt in the activation of <italic>fez/erm</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>). <italic>Drosophila dpn</italic> is a neural marker expressed in type-II NBs and again in more mature INPs, leaving a gap of expression in immature INPs. <italic>Drosophila ase</italic> is repressed in type-II NBs but expressed together with <italic>fez</italic>/<italic>erm</italic> in INPs and GMCs where its expression overlaps with <italic>pros</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. We found identical dynamics of gene expression in <italic>Tribolium</italic> (see <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>) suggesting conservation of gene function within the lineages and a conserved process of INP maturation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, expression of the genes examined in this study in type-II NBs and their lineages is highly conserved in fly and beetle, which is implicit of conserved gene function and a conserved process of central complex formation.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Divergent timing of type-II NB activity and heterochronic development of the central complex</title>
<p>Previous work described a heterochronic shift in central complex formation between fly and beetle. In <italic>Tribolium</italic> parts of the central complex develop during embryogenesis. It becomes functional at the onset of the first larval stage, and is presumably required for the more complex movements of the beetle larvae using legs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic> the anterior groups of type-II NBs (anterior medial group of <italic>Tribolium</italic> and anterior and middle cluster of <italic>Drosophila</italic>) are fully present in the last 3<sup>rd</sup> of embryogenesis, with the beginning of germ band retraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. However, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo only a very limited number of INPs and GMCs are produced before they enter a resting stage prior to hatching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. By contrast, we show that <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NB lineages are much larger compared to <italic>Drosopohila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. They also include more mature, <italic>Tc-dpn</italic> expressing, cycling INPs which have the capability of driving the increase in lineage size. This increased activity very likely contributes to the embryonic development of a functional central body and protocerebral bridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. The upstream factors responsible for the different timing of NB activity and the early formation of a functional central complex neuropile in the beetle remain to be identified.</p>
<p>A number of features remain to be studied in beetle type II lineages. We do not have any information whether <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NBs, or <italic>Tribolium</italic> neuroblasts in general, also enter a stage of quiescence at the end of embryogenesis as they do in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. After preformation in the embryo <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs have their main period of activity in the 3<sup>rd</sup> larva and the lineages are much larger and contain more INPs than the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryonic lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. It is another open question if <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NB lineages are active during larval development and how that relates to the described steps of central complex development. Adult like x, y, and w tracts as well as protocerebral bridge are present at the end of the embryonic stage but a bipartite central body containing both the ellipsoid and the fan shaped body is only differentiated in the pupa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Therefore, it would be interesting to see if type-II NBs lineages are present and active in the late larval brain of <italic>Tribolium</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s3e">
<title>The placodal marker <italic>Tc-six4</italic> may be responsible for the differentiation and the spatial identity of the anterior medial group of type-II NBs</title>
<p>The different type-II NB lineages contribute to different parts of the brain. For instance, only the anterior four type-II NB lineages form the w, x, y, and z tracts of the central complex in flies and grasshoppers. Hence, there must be signals that make them different despite the conserved and well-studied sequence of neural gene expression and functional interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. In the ventral nerve cord, the different identities of the NBs are specified by the combination of spatial patterning genes expressed in the neuroectoderm at the time of delamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. However, little is known about these signals for type II NBs. In <italic>Tribolium</italic> the domains of head patterning genes in the brain neuroectoderm are well characterized and some highly conserved territories like the anterior-medial <italic>six3</italic>-positive domain were described and suggested to give respective NBs different spatial identities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. The <italic>Tc-six4</italic> expression domain is also largely coincident with an embryonic structure termed insect head placode, a neurogenic, invaginating tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] potentially homologous to the vertebrate adenohypophyseal placode marked by <italic>six4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. A placodal origin of <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NB has been shown for one type-II NB, and it is assumed that the other type-II NB also stem from placodal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Tc-six4</italic> is also a very interesting factor with regards to the specification of type-II NBs because it is expressed only in the anterior group of type-II NBs. Hence, it could contribute to distinguishing their developmental fate from the posterior group. This is however different in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. Here Six4 is expressed in all eight lineages where it prevents the formation of supernumerary type-II NBs and a premature differentiation of INPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. In the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo Six4 may have a similar rate limiting role within the anterior group type-II NBs. However, its early expression in a small part of the neuroectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] and the delamination of the anterior-medial type-II NBs group within this domain also hints at an instructive role of <italic>Tc-six4</italic> in the formation of the anterior median group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3f">
<title><italic>Tc-six3</italic> marks a subset of type-II NBs whereas <italic>Tc-otd</italic> is absent from all lineages</title>
<p>Importantly, we found that in <italic>Tribolium</italic> late embryogenesis, <italic>Tc-six3</italic> is expressed specifically within the lineages of type-II NBs 1-4 of the anterior medial group, but not in the other linages. In grasshopper and fly these anterior 4 lineages (DM1-4) give rise to the z, y, x and w tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] and contribute crucially to the development of protocerebral bridge and central body. These tracts form a major midline crossing neuropile of the central body which serves as a scaffold in the development of this structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. We conclude that the evolutionary ancient <italic>six3</italic> territory gives rise to the neuropile of the z, y, x and w tracts. Indeed, the central body is also missing in weak <italic>Tribolium Tc-six3</italic>-RNAi phenotypes, suggesting that <italic>Tribolium six3</italic> is required for the formation of this structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Given that central complex neuropile is marked by additional factors such as <italic>Tc-</italic>foxQ2 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> fd102c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]) and <italic>Tc-rx</italic>-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], it would be interesting to see the relationship of additional spatial patterning genes with regards to the type-II NB lineages in future studies.</p>
<p>The gene <italic>otd</italic> is a marker of the posterior protocerebrum and <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>otd</italic> are believed to subdivide the embryonic anterior brain into two major domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. This subdivision is also part of the recently revisited concept of an ancestral division of the insect protocerebrum into archicerebrum (<italic>six3</italic>-positive) and prosocerebrum (<italic>otd</italic>-positive) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. As discussed above, <italic>Tc-six3</italic> is expressed in the anteriormost four type-II NBs lineages, but unexpectedly, we found that <italic>Tc-otd</italic> is specifically absent from all type-II NBs lineages, suggesting that its inhibition is required for the development of all these lineages. Interestingly, the lineages of type-II NBs 5 and 6 (and presumably of type-II NB 7) of the anterior cluster and the posterior type-II NBs lineages do neither express <italic>Tc-otd</italic> nor <italic>Tc-six3</italic> showing that there are protocerebral structures expressing none of these conserved markers in development.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings are just the beginning of the quest for the genes required for the identity specification of type-II NB lineages. The genes known to be involved in head patterning are an excellent starting point for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>

<title>Creation of transgenic reporter line</title>
<p>Using CRISPR-Cas9 we have inserted a transgene into the <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> locus that includes <italic>egfp</italic> behind the <italic>Tribolium</italic> basal heat shock promoter (bhsp68), which is not active by itself but can be activated by nearby enhancer elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. The transgene also contained the coding sequence of Cre-recombinase (not used in this work) transcribed from the same promoter, and the eye pigmentation gene <italic>Tc-vermilion</italic> behind the eye-specific 3xP3 enhancer element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] (see Fig. S1 A for map of the transgene).

<p>Using CRISPR Optimal Target Finder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>] we designed three guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the genomic region 2.5 kb upstream of the <italic>Tc</italic>-<italic>fez/erm</italic> transcription start site (see table S1). We produced three plasmids where single gRNAs were transcribed from the <italic>Tribolium</italic> pU6b RNA promoter, as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. We co-injected the three gRNAs plasmids at 125µg/µl each, gRNAs targeting the <italic>Dm-yellow</italic> and <italic>Dm-ebony</italic> sequence at 125µg/µl each, Cas9 helper plasmid (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]) at 500 µg/µl and the repair plasmid at 500 µg/µl. Embryos of the white eyed <italic>Tribolium vermilion</italic>-<italic>white</italic> (<italic>vw</italic>) strain (G0) were injected, raised and then bred to <italic>vw</italic>-beetles in individual crosses.

<p>The study is a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to the question of evolutionary shifts in neuronal proliferation patterns and the timing of developmental progressions. The authors present <bold>solid</bold> support for the presence of type-II NB lineages in the beetle Tribolium with the same molecular characteristics as the counterparts in the fly Drosophila, but differences in lineage size and number. While presenting a number of interesting observations, further evidence will be required to show that the observed differences are indeed responsible for the differences in developmental timing of the central complex in the two insect species.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Insects inhabit diverse environments and have neuroanatomical structures appropriate to each habitat. Although the molecular mechanism of insect neural development has been mainly studied in Drosophila, the beetle, Tribolium castaneum has been introduced as another model to understand the differences and similarities in the process of insect neural development. In this manuscript, the authors focused on the origin of the central complex. In Drosophila, type II neuroblasts have been known as the origin of the central complex. Then, the authors tried to identify those cells in the beetle brain. They established a Tribolium fez enhancer trap line to visualize putative type II neuroblasts and successfully identified 9 of those cells. In addition, they also examined expression patterns of several genes that are known to be expressed in the type II neuroblasts or their lineage in Drosophila. They concluded that the putative type II neuroblasts they identified were type II neuroblasts because those cells showed characteristics of type II neuroblasts in terms of genetic codes, cell diameter, and cell lineage.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors established a useful enhancer trap line to visualize type II neuroblasts in Tribolium embryos. Using this tool, they have identified that there are 9 type II neuroblasts in the brain hemisphere during embryonic development. Since the enhancer trap line also visualized the lineage of those cells, the authors found that the lineage size of the type II neuroblasts in the beetle is larger than that in the fly. They also showed that several genetic markers are also expressed in the type II neuroblasts and their lineages as observed in Drosophila.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I recommend the authors reconstruct the manuscript because several parts of the present version are not logical. For example, the author should first examine the expression of dpn, a well-known marker of neuroblast. Without examining the expression of at least one neuroblast marker, no one can say confidently that it is a neuroblast. The purpose of this study is to understand what makes neuroanatomical differences between insects which is appropriate to their habitats. To obtain clues to the question, I think, functional analyses are necessary as well as descriptive analyses.</p>

<p>The authors address the question of differences in the development of the central complex (Cx), a brain structure mainly controlling spatial orientation and locomotion in insects, which can be traced back to the neuroblast lineages that produce the Cx structure. The lineages are called type-II neuroblast (NB) lineages and are assumed to be conserved in insects. While Tribolium castaneum produces a functional larval Cx that only consists of one part of the adult Cx structure, the fan-shaped body, in Drosophila melanogaster a non-functional neuropile primordium is formed by neurons produced by the embryonic type-II NBs which then enter a dormant state and continue development in late larval and pupal stages.</p>
<p>The authors present a meticulous study demonstrating that type-II neuroblast (NB) lineages are indeed present in the developing brain of Tribolium castaneum. In contrast to type-I NB lineages, type-II NBs produce additional intermediate progenitors. The authors generate a fluorescent enhancer trap line called fez/earmuff which prominently labels the mushroom bodies but also the intermediate progenitors (INPs) of the type-II NB lineages. This is convincingly demonstrated by high-resolution images that show cellular staining next to large pointed labelled cells, a marker for type-II NBs in Drosophila melanogaster. Using these and other markers (e.g. deadpan, asense), the authors show that the cell type composition and embryonic development of the type-II NB lineages are similar to their counterparts in Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, the expression of the Drosophila type-II NB lineage markers six3 and six4 in subsets of the Tribolium type-II NB lineages (anterior 1-4 and 1-6 type-II NB lineages) and the expression of the Cx marker skh in the distal part of most of the lineages provide further evidence that the identified NB lineages are equivalent to the Drosophila lineages that establish the central complex. However, in contrast to Drosophila, there are 9 instead of 8 embryonic type-II NB lineages per brain hemisphere and the lineages contain more progenitor cells compared to the Drosophila lineages. The authors argue that the higher number of dividing progenitor cells supports the earlier development of a functional Cx in Tribolium.</p>
<p>While the manuscript clearly shows that type-II NB lineages similar to Drosophila exist in Tribolium, it does not considerably advance our understanding of the heterochronic development of the Cx in these insects. First of all, the contribution of these lineages to a functional larval Cx is not clear. For example, how do the described type-II NB lineages relate to the DM1-4 lineages that produce the columnar neurons of the Cx? What is the evidence that the embryonically produced type-II NB lineage neurons contribute to a functional larval Cx? The formation of functional circuits could rely on larval neurons (like in Drosophila) which would make a comparison of embryonic lineages less informative with respect to understanding the underlying variations of the developmental processes. Furthermore, the higher number of progenitors (and consequently neurons) in Tribolium could simply reflect the demand for a higher number of cells required to build the fan-shaped body compared to Drosophila. In addition, the larger lineages in Tribolium, including the higher number of INPs could be due to a greater number of NBs within the individual clusters, rather than a higher rate of proliferation of individual neuroblasts, as suggested. What is the evidence that there is only one NB per cluster? The presented schemes (Fig. 7/12) and description of the marker gene expression and classification of progenitor cells are inconsistent but indicate that NBs and immature INPs cannot be consistently distinguished.</p>
<p>The main difference between Tribolium and Drosophila Cx development with regard to the larval functionality might be that Drosophila type-II NB lineage-derived neurons undergo quiescence at the end of embryogenesis so that the development of the Cx is halted, while a developmental arrest does not occur in Tribolium. However, this needs to be confirmed (as the authors rightly observe).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Rethemeier et al capitalize on their previous observation that the beetle central complex develops heterochronically compared to the fly and try to identify the developmental origin of this difference. For this reason, they use a fez enhancer trap line that they generated to study the neuronal stem cells (INPs) that give rise to the central complex. Using this line and staining against Drosophila type-II neuroblast markers, they elegantly dissect the number of developmental progression of the beetle type II neuroblasts. They show that the NBs, INPs, and GMCs have a conserved marker progression by comparing to Drosophila marker genes, although the expression of some of the lineage markers (otd, six3, and six4) is slightly different. Finally, they show that the beetle type II neuroblast lineages are likely longer than the equivalent ones in Drosophila and argue that this might be the underlying reason for the observed heterochrony.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- A very interesting study system that compares a conserved structure that, however, develops in a heterochronic manner.</p>
<p>- Identification of a conserved molecular signature of type-II neuroblasts between beetles and flies. At the same time, identification of transcription factors expression differences in the neuroblasts, as well as identification of an extra neuroblast.</p>
<p>- Nice detailed experiments to describe the expression of conserved and divergent marker genes, including some lineaging looking into the co-expression of progenitor (fez) and neuronal (skh) markers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Comparing between different species is difficult as one doesn't know what the equivalent developmental stages are. How do the authors know when to compare the sizes of the lineages between Drosophila and Tribolium? Moreover, the fact that the authors recover more INPs and GMCs could also mean that the progenitors divide more slowly and, therefore, there is an accumulation of progenitors who have not undergone their programmed number of divisions.</p>
<p>- The main conclusion that the earlier central complex development in beetles is due to the enhanced activity of the neuroblasts is very handwavy and is not the only possible conclusion from their data.</p>
<p>- The argument for conserved patterns of gene expression between Tribolium and Drosophila type-II NBs, INPs, and GMCs is a bit circular, as the authors use Drosophila markers to identify the Tribolium cells.</p>
<p>An appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions: Based on the above, I believe that the authors, despite advancing significantly, fall short of identifying the reasons for the divergent timing of central complex development between beetle and fly.</p>
