<title>Abstract</title><p>Loss of function mutations of Cx32, which is expressed in Schwann cells, cause X-linked Charcot Marie Tooth disease, a slowly progressive peripheral neuropathy. Cx32 is thus essential for the maintenance of myelin. During action potential propagation, Cx32 hemichannels in the Schwann cell paranode are thought to open and release ATP. As Cx32 hemichannels are directly sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub>, we have tested whether CO<sub>2</sub> produced in the axonal node, as a consequence of the energetic demands of action potential propagation, might gate Cx32 hemichannels. Using isolated sciatic nerve from the mouse, we have shown that the critical components required for intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> signalling are present (nodal mitochondria, the source of CO<sub>2</sub>; a CO<sub>2</sub>-permeable aquaporin, AQP1; paranodal Cx32; and carbonic anhydrase). We have used a membrane impermeant fluorescent dye FITC, which can permeate Cx32 hemichannels, to demonstrate the opening of Cx32 in Schwann cells in response to an external CO<sub>2</sub> stimulus or during action potential propagation in the isolated nerve. Pharmacological blockade of APQ1 or allosteric enhancement of carbonic anhydrase activity greatly reduced Cx32 gating during action potential firing. By contrast, inhibition of carbonic anhydrase with acetazolamide greatly increased Cx32 gating. Cx32 gating was unaffected by the G-protein blocker GDPβS, indicating that it was not mediated by G protein coupled receptors. This CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent opening of Cx32 also mediates an activity dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the paranode and, by increasing the leak current across the myelin sheath, slows the conduction velocity. Our data demonstrate that CO<sub>2</sub> can act via connexins to mediate neuron-to-glia signalling and that CO<sub>2</sub> permeable aquaporins and carbonic anhydrase are key components of this signalling mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Connexin32 (Cx32) is expressed in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the peripheral and central nervous system, respectively. These cells wrap around axons to form the myelin sheath, an insulating barrier that restricts voltage dependent ion fluxes to the nodes of Ranvier, thus enabling saltatory conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huxley and Stampfli, 1949</xref>). Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) disease is a slow progressing peripheral neuropathy that involves a loss of peripheral myelin integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Murakami et al., 1996</xref>). Typical symptoms of CMT include slowing of peripheral conductance velocity, loss of feeling in the extremities, <italic>pes cavus</italic> and in some cases muscle wasting. Mutations in the <italic>gjb1</italic> gene, encoding Cx32, result In the X linked version of CMT (CMTX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bergoffen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fairweather et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hattori et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Record et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>Cx32</italic>-null mice reproduce CMTX phenotypes, indicating CMTX is caused by a loss of Cx32 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scherer et al., 1998</xref>). This phenotype can be rescued by selective re-expression of Cx32 in Schwann cells, highlighting how fundamental Cx32 is to the maintenance of myelin health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Scherer et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Cx32 is a β connexin and is closely related to Cx26 and Cx30. Hemichannels of these connexin isoforms can be opened by increases in PCO<sub>2</sub>, at constant extracellular pH and physiological concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huckstepp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dospinescu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Butler and Dale, 2023</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of these β connexins is dependent on a “carbamylation motif” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Meigh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brotherton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brotherton et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nijjar et al., 2025</xref>). While the mechanism of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity has been most thoroughly studied in Cx26, Cx32 possesses the same carbamylation motif that is required for CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dospinescu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Butler and Dale, 2023</xref>). In Cx32, CO<sub>2</sub> carbamylates the primary amine of Lys124 in the motif. As this carbamylated amine is now negatively charged, it can form a salt bridge with Lys104 of the neighbouring subunit. The resulting carbamate bridges are thought to bias the hemichannel to the open state. Like most connexins, Cx32 will form gap junction channels where two hexamers of Cx32 in opposing membranes can dock together. Cx32 gap junction channels, however, are insensitive to the changes in PCO<sub>2</sub> that can open Cx32 hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dospinescu et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
    <p>Myelin expresses Cx32 as both unopposed hemichannels in the paranodal membrane and also as reflexive gap junctions in the Schmidt Lanterman incisures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bergoffen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bortolozzi, 2018</xref>). The reflexive gap junctions provide radial dibusion pathways through the layers of myelin. However, radial dibusion pathways still exist in <italic>Cx32</italic>-null mice, suggesting a mechanism of redundancy or compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balice-Gordon et al., 1998</xref>). Nevertheless, as <italic>Cx32</italic>-null mice still reproduce CMTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Scherer et al., 1998</xref>), the loss of Cx32 hemichannel function must be subicient to induce CMTX pathology.</p>
<p>Cx32 hemichannels in the paranode are thought to gate open and release ATP during action potential propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nualart-Marti et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanism underlying the opening of Cx32 hemichannels in the paranode in response to action potential propagation remains uncertain. Two hypotheses have been proposed: i) because Cx32 is intrinsically voltage sensitive, hemichannel opening could be caused by transmembrane potential excursions during action potential propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abrams et al., 2002</xref>); and ii) a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> within the Schwann cell paranode possibly downstream of activation of a G-protein coupled receptor could open Cx32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Carrer et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper we explore an alternative hypothesis: that CO<sub>2</sub>, produced in the node as a consequence of the energetic demands of restoring transmembrane ionic gradients following action potential propagation (via Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPases), dibuses into the paranode to open Cx32. We have tested our hypothesis by careful consideration of the requirements of a CO<sub>2</sub>-based signalling system: a means of production (mitochondria); a channel to allow CO<sub>2</sub> produced in the node to dibuse into the paranode as CO<sub>2</sub> does not readily cross biological membranes; and a mechanism to terminate the actions of CO<sub>2</sub> (carbonic anhydrase). We show that all of these components are present at the node/paranode and that their manipulation will alter the gating of Cx32 in ways that support our hypothesis.</p>

<title>The components for CO<sub>2</sub> signalling mediated via Cx32 are present in myelin</title>
    <p>A CO<sub>2</sub>-based signalling system in myelin requires: a means of production; a channel to allow CO<sub>2</sub> to cross the nodal and paranodal membranes; and a mechanism to terminate the actions of CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). It is already known that: mitochondria are present in the node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ohno et al., 2011</xref>); Cx32 is expressed in the paranode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bergoffen et al., 1993</xref>); AQP1, highly permeable to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Endeward et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Musa-Aziz et al., 2009</xref>), is expressed in Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Segura-Anaya et al., 2015</xref>); and carbonic anhydrase is universally present in every cell. Here we have used high resolution microscopy to examine the precise subcellular localisation of these components relative to each other.</p>

<caption><title>Hypothesised Cx32 mediated CO<sub>2</sub> signalling cascade in peripheral myelin.</title>
<p>Three fingers of a myelin paranode have been used for illustrative purposes. Restoration of transmembrane ionic gradients following action potential propagation via the actions of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPases incurs a metabolic cost and increases production of ATP and CO<sub>2</sub>. AQP1, permeable to CO<sub>2</sub>, provides a pathway for CO<sub>2</sub> to leave the node and enter the paranode and bind to Cx32 on the intracellular loop. This triggers opening of Cx32 and release ATP. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the combination of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O and ultimately the production of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> ions and ebectively competes with Cx32 for CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></caption>

<title>Mitochondria localise to the axonal node and Schwann cell paranode and may be brought in close proximity to Cx32 via SFXN1</title>
<p>SFXN1 is a mitochondrial protein that also binds to Cx32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fowler et al., 2013</xref>). Using cytochrome C (CytC), as a mitochondrial marker we found that mitochondria were localised in both the axonal node and Schwann cell paranode (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 2 fig supplement 1</xref>), in accordance with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rydmark et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ohno et al., 2011</xref>). There was colocalization between Cx32 and CytC in the Schwann cell paranode, and (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, mean; 95% confidence interval, M1: 0.314; 0.198, 0.431 and M2: 0.261; 0.165, 0.357). There was also colocalization in the Schwann cell paranode between CytC and SFXN1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, M1: 0.568; 0.441,0.695 and M2: 0.462; 0.336, 0.588). This suggests that SFXN1 may facilitate the association of Cx32 and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fowler et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, SFXN1 was also observed in the absence of CytC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fowler et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting that it has additional cellular roles unrelated to its mitochondrial function.</p>

<title>CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent dye loading of Schwann cells in sciatic nerve</title>
<p>We first examined whether Cx32 hemichannels in Schwann cells could be opened by application of hypercapnic aCSF. We exposed isolated sciatic nerves to FITC in aCSF at different levels of PCO<sub>2</sub>. As FITC is membrane impermeant but can readily move through channels with large pores such as Cx32 hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Butler and Dale, 2023</xref>), any CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent dye loading would thus indicate gating of a CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive large pore channel.</p>
<p>At 35 mmHg, a level of PCO<sub>2</sub> that is too low to open Cx32 hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huckstepp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dospinescu et al., 2019</xref>), FITC loading was not observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). However, in the presence of hypercapnic aCSF (70mmHg, sufficient to open Cx32 hemichannels) dye loading into the paranode and outer myelin layers was readily observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, p &lt; 0.0001, compared to 35 mmHg). Note that the axons did not load with FITC.</p>

<p>To demonstrate that mitochondrially produced CO<sub>2</sub> could gate Cx32, we used a mitochondrial uncoupler, FCCP, to maximise rates of endogenous CO<sub>2</sub> generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Balboni and Lehninger, 1986</xref>). We found that FCCP caused significantly increased dye loading into Schwann cell paranodes and outer myelin layers (p &lt; 0.0001) compared to nerves loaded at 35 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub> with no FCCP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub>-evoked FITC loading was abolished in the presence of carbenoxolone, indicating FITC entry occurred through a carbenoxolone sensitive hemichannel (p &lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). TRPA1 can open with intracellular acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), however FITC loading was not blocked by a specific TRPA1 antagonist, HC030031, supporting that dye entry occurred via a connexin rather than TRPA1 (p = 0.8643, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Schwann cells express two connexins: Cx32 and Cx31.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jeng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gerber et al., 2021</xref>). Cx31.3 lacks the carbamylation motif and is therefore unlikely to be CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive. To confirm this, we measured ATP release via Cx31.3 expressed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liang et al., 2011</xref>) in response to changes in PCO<sub>2</sub> and membrane depolarisation, by means of a co-expressed genetically encoded sensor, GRAB<sub>ATP</sub>. HeLa cells transfected only with GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> but not Cx31.3 did not show any fluorescent changes in response to 70 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub> or 50 mM K<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 5 fig supplement 1</xref>). However, in cells transfected with Cx31.3, 50 mM KCl induced ATP release (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 5 fig supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, a stimulus of 70 mmHg PCO<sub>2</sub> was inebective at triggering ATP release (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 5 fig supplement 1</xref>). This confirms that Cx31.3 is not sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> and makes it most likely that the CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent entry of FITC into the Schwann cells was via Cx32.</p>

<p>To test whether Cx32 might open and permit FITC entry into the paranode during action potential propagation, we bathed isolated nerves in aCSF (35 mmHg) and stimulated them electrically at 30 Hz, while measuring the compound action potential (CAP). Upon electrical stimulation, FITC entry into myelin was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). We confirmed that FITC loaded into paranodes by counterstaining with the paranode marker Caspr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Einheber et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). FITC did not load into the axons. FITC loading into myelin was correlated positively with the stimulus duration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>

<p>To test whether this activity dependent FITC loading was also CO<sub>2</sub> dependent, we first manipulated the activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA). Inhibition of CA activity, via acetazolamide, should increase the local PCO<sub>2</sub> as the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to carbonic acid will be slowed. We found that acetazolamide (100 µM) greatly increased FITC loading into the Schwann cell paranode in response 30 Hz stimulation for 1 or 3 minutes (p=0.001 and p=0.0121 respectively, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A,B</xref>).</p>
<p>L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) is an allosteric enhancer of CA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Temperini et al., 2006</xref>). Myelinating Schwann cells express SLC7A5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gerber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Karlsson et al., 2021</xref>), the gene that encodes the L-type amino acid transporter. As this transports L-Phe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>), bath application of L-Phe (1 mM) to isolated nerve, should be effective in enhancing the activity of intracellular CA in Schwann cells. The accelerated conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to carbonic acid in the presence of L-Phe would be expected to reduce activity dependent dye loading. We indeed observed that treatment with L-Phe greatly reduced activity dependent FITC loading into the Schwann cell paranode (p = 0.0159, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C,D</xref>). Neither acetazolamide nor L-Phe altered the amplitude or the current-amplitude curves of the CAP (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 7, fig supplement 1</xref>) indicating that these drugs did not affect the excitability of the axon.</p>
<p>As a final test of our hypothesis that activity dependent CO<sub>2</sub> production in the node gates Cx32 in the paranode, we used a specific blocker of AQP1, TC AQP1-1 (80 µM, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ghosh et al., 2020</xref>)). We found blockade of AQP1 greatly reduced FITC loading into the Schwann cell paranode following 5 minutes of stimulation at 30 Hz, compared to that of WT (p&lt; 0.0001, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). This supports our hypothesis and also indicates that AQP1 is a key conduit for CO<sub>2</sub> to diffuse from the axonal node to the Schwann cell paranode. TC APQ1-1 had no effect on the amplitude or the current-amplitude curves of the CAP (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 7, fig supplement 1</xref>) indicating that it did not affect the excitability of the axon.</p>

<p>While our data are consistent with activity dependent CO<sub>2</sub> production in the node gating Cx32 in the paranode, they do not eliminate the possible involvement of other signalling pathways such as those mediated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). We therefore used GDPβS (100 µM) as a general blocker G-protein mediated signalling. As a positive control we showed that application of GDPβS blocked ATP receptor mediated increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the paranode (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 8, figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the application of GDPβS had no effect on activity dependent FITC loading (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 8, figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Enhancement of FITC loading by block of CA is not mediated by pH changes</title>
<p>Inhibition of CA by acetazolamide could plausibly lead to subsequent alkalosis, as the production of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> ions will be reduced. We therefore tested whether alkalosis by itself was subicient to enhance activity dependent FITC loading by applying NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (100 µM), but this had no ebect (p = 0.1257, <xref rid="fig8s2" ref-type="fig">Fig 8 figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We quantified the changes in intracellular pH induced upon perfusion of acetazolamide or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl by using the pH sensitive dye BCECF (<xref rid="fig8s3" ref-type="fig">Fig 8 figure supplement 3</xref>). We found that NH<sub>4</sub>Cl induced greater increases in intracellular pH (change (median; 95% CI): 0.1579; 0.119, 0.1968), than did acetazolamide which had no significant ebect on intracellular pH (change: −0.0147; - 0.040, 0.011). The enhancement of activity dependent FITC loading by acetazolamide cannot therefore be explained by changes in intracellular pH.</p>

<title>A simplified model of the paranode supports CA as a key regulator of Cx32 gating</title>
<p>To gain further insight, we made a simplified model of the paranode (as a single cell that in effect incorporated the nodal mitochondrion) to explore the effects of CA activity on loading of FITC into Schwann cell paranodes (see Methods and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). The mitochondrion in this simplified “paranode” was based on a model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Matsuda et al., (2020)</xref>. The Matsuda model, which accurately replicates the experimentally observed dynamics of ATP production in mitochondria of myotubes, incorporates the concept of mitochondrial priming: that electrical activity in the myotube enhances the rate of ATP synthesis.</p>

<p>We added a rate of CO<sub>2</sub> production that was proportional to mitochondrial ATP production, endowed the “paranode” with a K<sup>+</sup> channel to give it a resting potential, Cx32 and carbonic anhydrase. The CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive gating of Cx32 was based on the published CO<sub>2</sub> dose response curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Huckstepp et al., 2010</xref>). FITC was assumed to only permeate open Cx32 hemichannels and its transmembrane concentrations were calculated according to the GHK equation assuming that FITC had a net negative charge of −1. CA activity was modelled with Michaelis-Menten kinetics with K<sub>M</sub> being based on literature values for CAII. The V<sub>max</sub> of CA was a free variable that could be altered to mimic the effect of inhibition or allosteric enhancement of CA.</p>
<p>We altered the duration of electrical stimulation of the “paranode” from 1 to 20 mins and calculated the amount of dye loading. With a V<sub>max</sub> of 15 mM/s, this gave a graph that was very similar to the experimentally obtained data (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9D</xref>, compare to <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). To simulate the effect of acetazolamide we reduced the V<sub>max</sub> of CA to 1 mM/s, and found an enhancement of dye loading that was once again very similar to the experimentally observed enhancement (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9D</xref>, compare to <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). L-Phe can enhance the activity of CA by up to 3-fold. We found that increasing the V<sub>max</sub> of CA twofold to 30 mM/s gave a very substantial reduction of dye loading that was similar to the experimentally observed effect of L-Phe (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9D</xref>, compare to <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>Our simplified model of the paranode suggests that CA is a key regulator of the local PCO<sub>2</sub> and hence Cx32 gating. We also observed that when inhibition of CA was simulated by a reduction of V<sub>max</sub> to 1 mM/s, the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> increased to a steady state value of 0.48 mM and there was a steady increase in FITC loading reaching a concentration of 0.7 µM after 30 minutes. Under the “control” conditions CO<sub>2</sub> had a steady state value of 0.05 mM and the FITC concentration after 30 minutes was only 20 pM. There is some support for this prediction of the model as we observed that acetazolamide did indeed increase the background FITC loading of nerve fibres by a small but significant amount (<xref rid="fig9s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 9, figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The Matsuda model explicitly incorporates mitochondrial priming by electrical activity, and its use in our model reproduces the experimentally observed dye loading. This suggests that mitochondrial priming might also occur in the node/paranode, although this remains to be tested directly.</p>

<title>Activity dependent entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the paranode is CO<sub>2</sub> dependent</title>
<p>Our evidence so far supports the hypothesis that Cx32 is gated during action potential propagation by activity dependent generation of CO<sub>2</sub> at the node. During electrical activity Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulates in the paranode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lev-Ram and Ellisman, 1995</xref>).

<p>To measure intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> we loaded isolated mouse sciatic nerve with Fluo4-AM. We found that exposure of the nerve to hypercapnic aCSF (70 mmHg) increased Fluo4 fluorescence in paranode-like structures indicating an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). The CO<sub>2</sub> evoked increases in Fluo4 fluorescence were blocked by carbenoxolone indicating that they were channel mediated most likely via Cx32 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>, p = 0.0087 CBX compared to control).</p>

<p>Having established the existence of CO<sub>2</sub> dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the paranode, we next determined whether we could observe Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the paranode during electrical stimulation and whether this was also CO<sub>2</sub> dependent. Using Fluo4 loaded sciatic nerves, we found that we could measure an increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into Schwann cell paranodes during electrical stimulation (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). Crucially, these transient increases depended upon CO<sub>2</sub> production: they were significantly enhanced by acetazolamide (p&lt;0.0001) and reduced by block of AQP1 by TC AQP1-1 (p&lt;0.0001) (Fig 12). Thus, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the paranode during electrical stimulation depends on CO<sub>2</sub> generated at the node entering the paranode and most likely opening Cx32. This is consistent with earlier reports that show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in the paranode requires extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lev-Ram and Ellisman, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Activity dependent slowing of conduction velocity is CO<sub>2</sub> dependent</title>
<p>We observed that hypercapnic aCSF, FCCP and electrical activity consistently induced FITC loading into the outer myelin layer, suggesting the occurrence of CO<sub>2</sub> dependent gating of Cx32 in this outermost membrane. Were this to occur, it should increase the leakage of current across the myelin sheath. Saltatory conduction depends on local current circuits travelling down the core of the axon to depolarise that next node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huxley and Stampfli, 1949</xref>). If more current were to leak through the sheath before reaching the next node there should be a small but measurable slowing of conduction velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huxley and Stampfli, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bakiri et al., 2011</xref>). We would therefore predict that during more intense electrical activity in nerve, there should be more CO<sub>2</sub> production and thus a slowing of conduction velocity.</p>
<p>To test this, we measured the CAP firstly under low frequency stimulation (1 Hz), exposed the nerve to a period of high frequency stimulation (15 Hz for 10 mins, to elevate local PCO<sub>2</sub>) and then remeasured the CAP under low frequency stimulation (1 Hz). We found high frequency stimulation increased the delay from the stimulus artefact to the peak of the CAP by 0.11 ms (0.04, 0.17) (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig 13</xref>). To demonstrate that this slowing was CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent we manipulated the components of the CO<sub>2</sub> signalling system. 100 µM acetazolamide significantly increased the delay to the peak of the CAP caused the high frequency stimulation (p = 0.0016, <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig 13</xref>). Conversely, 1 mM L-Phe or 80 µM TC AQP1-1 reduced the effect of high frequency stimulation on the delay to the peak of the CAP (respectively p = 0.0317 and p = 0.0079, <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig 13</xref>).</p>

<p>We noticed that the period of high frequency stimulation broadened the CAP and slightly reduced its amplitude. This was particularly exaggerated in the presence of acetazolamide (<xref rid="fig13s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 13, fig supplement 1</xref>). To understand this effect on the shape of the CAP, we made a simple model of the CAP based upon 2000 individual axons each having an identically shaped action potential. To reflect the distribution of fibre diameters reported in sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Assaf et al., 2008</xref>) the conduction velocities were given a normal distribution skewed to lower velocities (<xref rid="fig13s1" ref-type="fig">Fig 13, fig supplement 1</xref>). The CAP was simply the sum of all of the individual action potentials. We then slowed the velocity of each fibre by the same proportion and computed the CAP for different amounts of slowing and calculated the 10-90% rise time, the time to peak, and peak amplitude of the CAP (Fig 12, fig supplement 1). This showed that under these simplified assumptions, changes in the shape of the CAP of the type we observed experimentally would be expected from slowing the conduction velocities in all fibres by the same proportion.</p>

<title>Activity dependent gating of Cx32</title>
<p>In this paper we have investigated the mechanism of activity dependent Cx32 hemichannel gating in peripheral myelin. Previously, the opening of Cx32 has been posited to depend on either its intrinsic voltage sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abrams et al., 2002</xref>) or as a downstream consequence of an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> within the paranode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stauch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Carrer et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we have tested an alternative hypothesis: that cell-to-cell signalling mediated via CO<sub>2</sub> produced in the axonal node is the primary trigger for Cx32 gating in the paranode. Our hypothesis explicitly links Cx32 opening in the paranode to the energetic demands of action potential propagation in the node.</p>
<p>In our experiments, we assessed Cx32 gating via entry of the membrane impermeant dye, FITC. Our results support our new hypothesis in several respects. Firstly, Cx32 gating in response to axon stimulation was greatly reduced by blocking AQP1, which is CO<sub>2</sub> permeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Endeward et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Musa-Aziz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Michenkova et al., 2021</xref>) and thus provides a route for passage of CO<sub>2</sub> from node to paranode. Secondly, inhibition of CA with acetazolamide greatly increased the activity dependent gating of Cx32. Thirdly, facilitation of CA activity by applying an allosteric enhancer, L-Phe, greatly reduced activity dependent gating of Cx32. Fourthly, the effect of FCCP showed that mitochondrially generated CO<sub>2</sub> was sufficient to gate Cx32. Finally, application of GDPβS to block all GPCR based signalling had no effect on activity-dependent gating of Cx32. Together these results suggest that CO<sub>2</sub> is acting as a cell-to-cell signal and is the prime trigger for Cx32 opening during action potential propagation. In the light of these results, it is interesting that elasmobranchs, the first vertebrates to evolve a fully myelinated nervous system, have an orthologue of Cx32 that has identical CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity to human Cx32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dospinescu et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>As there are no selective pharmacological blockers for Cx32, our evidence that Cx32 is the conduit for activity and CO<sub>2</sub> dependent FITC loading into the paranode is indirect. Nevertheless, our combined evidence is compelling for the following reasons. Cx32 is the only known large-pored channel expressed in Schwann cells that is directly sensitive to gaseous CO<sub>2</sub>. We know that FITC permeates Cx32 and the CO<sub>2</sub> dose dependence of FITC loading matches that of Cx32. We have eliminated both Cx31.3 (not CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive) and TRPA1 (unaffected by a selective blocker of this channel) as the conduit. By contrast, dye entry is blocked by carbenoxolone a non-specific connexin hemichannel blocker and the entry of FITC into the Schwann cell but not the axon matches the cellular localisation of Cx32 (present in paranode and outer myelin layer).</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>The important roles of AQP1 and carbonic anhydrase</title>
<p>Our physiological evidence for CO<sub>2</sub> as a signal between the node and paranode is supported by the cellular localisation of the critical components required for this signalling. Mitochondria, the source of CO<sub>2</sub>, are located at the node. AQP1 is expressed in both the nodal and paranodal membranes. This is important as the binding site for CO<sub>2</sub> on Cx32 is intracellular and CO<sub>2</sub> must therefore cross both the nodal and paranodal membranes. Cx32 is expressed in the paranode and colocalises with AQP1. CA, which provides an ebicient removal mechanism for CO<sub>2</sub>, is also located at the paranode.</p>
<p>Whilst there has been controversy over the role of CO<sub>2</sub> permeable channels in enabling transmembrane CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes, it is now accepted that biological membranes are only poorly permeable to CO<sub>2</sub> and a channel mediated mechanism is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boron et al., 2011</xref>). Our data further support this idea, as blockade of APQ1 prevents the activity dependent gating of Cx32. Given that our data also show that CA activity limits the gating of Cx32, the colocalization of AQP1 and Cx32 may be important. As AQP1 will be the entry point for CO<sub>2</sub> into the paranode, its colocalization with Cx32 may favour CO<sub>2</sub> binding to Cx32 over capture and conversion to carbonic acid by CA.</p>
<p>Our simplified model of the paranode sheds further light on the regulation of CO<sub>2</sub> signalling and the gating of Cx32. The Matsuda model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Matsuda et al., 2020</xref>) incorporates priming of mitochondrial ATP production by electrical activity and hence this is also implicit in our paranode model. Mitochondrial priming will make CO<sub>2</sub> production more rapid than if it depended on ATP depletion to occur first. This implies that CO<sub>2</sub> production could vary relatively quickly with activity patterns and thus report the dynamics of action potential firing. It will be important to directly test this prediction by measuring the dynamics of mitochondrial ATP production in the node relative to imposed electrical activity.</p>
<p>Our model also predicts that complete inhibition of CA will give some Cx32 gating under non-stimulated conditions. We observed increased baseline loading of FITC into the nerves during acetazolamide giving support for this prediction. This suggests that an important role of CA is to prevent basal rates of CO<sub>2</sub> production being sufficient to gate Cx32. Our model also suggests that CA activity regulates the extent to which activity dependent production of CO<sub>2</sub> can gate Cx32. The effects of L-Phe and acetazolamide lend support to this prediction. Thus, the model suggests that CA regulates the dynamic range of the CO<sub>2</sub> signal and is likely to be an important regulator of CO<sub>2</sub> mediated signalling.</p>

<title>Physiological consequences of CO<sub>2</sub> dependent signalling</title>
<p>We have further shown that two other aspects of Schwann cell physiology and function depend on the CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent gating of Cx32. Firstly, the well documented increase of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the paranode evoked by nerve stimulation appears to largely depend on the opening of Cx32 and can be modified in the same way as dye loading by manipulating CA activity or blocking AQP1. Secondly, given the localisation of Cx32 in the outer myelin layer and the observation of activity- and CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent dye loading into that outer layer, we hypothesised that there should be activity dependent slowing of nerve conduction. This is because any opening of Cx32 hemichannels should reduce the resistance to current flow across the myelin sheath. We did indeed observe a small degree of activity dependent slowing of nerve conduction velocity. Crucially, this too depended upon CO<sub>2</sub> production and could be altered by manipulating CA activity or blocking AQP1.</p>

<title>Links to CMTX</title>
<p>Given our evidence suggests that the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx32 is critical for its gating during action potential propagation, we might expect that any mutations that abect this sensitivity could precipitate CMTX. We have previously examined the ebect of 14 CMTX mutations on the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Butler and Dale, 2023</xref>). We found that 5 completely removed its CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity, 3 greatly reduced its sensitivity while the remainder had no apparent ebect. It should be noted that two mutations of K124 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bone et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fattahi et al., 2017</xref>) and K104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Williams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), the critical residues for detection of CO<sub>2</sub> (K104E, K104T, K124E and K124N, not included in our published study), have also been identified as possible CMTX mutations.</p>
<p>These results, while supportive of our hypothesis, are not conclusive as several of the 8 CMTX mutations that altered CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity have been documented to also abect other facets of channel function. However, the CMTX mutation E102G stands out as causing moderate severity CMTX while still permitting the formation of gap junction channels and hemichannels with apparently normal voltage dependence and ATP permeability. Because E102G involves the loss of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of the hemichannel in the absence of other known functional ebects on the hemichannel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abrams et al., 2003</xref>) it lends some support to the hypothesis that the CO<sub>2</sub>-dependence of Cx32 may be important for the health of myelin and that its loss could precipitate CMTX. Further exploration of CO<sub>2</sub>- and Cx32-dependent signalling in myelin may suggest new strategies to treat peripheral neuropathies and peripheral nerve injury,</p>

<title>Sciatic nerve isolation</title>
<p>All mice used were C57BL/6, aged at least 6 weeks. Sciatic nerves were isolated following the protocol described in Rich et al., 2018. Placing a few drops of ice cold aCSF loosened the perineural membrane allowing its easy removal with forceps, beginning at one cut end of the nerve, and moving inward. Once the perineural membrane was removed, forceps were carefully placed in between the seams of the larger bundle of fibres before being teased apart with careful lateral movement. Removal of the perineural membrane and slight teasing was sufficient to obtain dye loading, with extensive dissection to small bundles or individual fibres only occurring post-fixation for immunohistochemistry and visualisation.</p>

<title>CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent dye loading</title>
<p>Isolated sciatic nerves were first washed in control aCSF before being superfused with either 35 mmHg aCSF or 70 mmHg aCSF containing 50 μM fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for 10 minutes. To induce endogenous CO<sub>2</sub> production via mitochondrial uncoupling isolated nerves were superfused with 35mmHg aCSF containing 10 μM FCCP (APExBIO) for 10 minutes. Following this, FITC was washed off by superfusion with 35 mmHg aCSF with no dye for 10 minutes. The nerves were then transferred through a series of vessels with 35mmHg aCSF to remove any remaining FITC.</p>

<sec id="s6c2">
<title>Dye loading triggered by electrical stimulation</title>
<p>Nerves were pre-incubated in 35 mmHg aCSF, and any desired pharmacological agent, for 10 minutes prior to recording. Polished glass suction electrodes wrapped with a silver wire and backfilled with aCSF were used for stimulation and recording. The ends of nerves were gently sucked up into the suction electrodes such that orthodromic recordings were made, described in (Rich et al., 2018).</p>
<p>The recordings of the stimulus evoked CAPs were controlled by a National Instruments A/D interface (Model PCIe 6321) using the Strathclyde electrophysiology software program, WinWCP. A stimulator, Digitimer model DS3, was used to stimulate the nerve. The signal was amplified x1000 by an A-M Systems Inc Model 3000 AC/DC differential amplifier (A-M Systems, Sequim, WA 98382, USA). The signal was filtered at 20 kHz and 1 Hz and acquired at 20 kHz. To assess the validity of the CAP, the nerve was crushed between forceps at the conclusion of the experiment, leaving only the transient artefact.</p>
<p>Once a recording of the CAP had been successfully established, nerves were exposed to FITC during electrical stimulation at (30 Hz) of different durations (1-10 minutes). They were then washed to remove FITC as described above. As each mouse possesses 2 sciatic nerves, when pharmacological agents were used, one nerve from each animal would be stimulated in the absence of any pharmacological agents as a matched control. I-V curves were recorded prior to drug pre-incubation, during pre-incubation and following stimulation, to assess any effects of the used compound on the CAP. From the CAP traces rise time, rate of rise and latency could be calculated using WinWCP.</p>

<title>Measurement of intracellular pH with BCECF</title>
<p>Mouse sciatic nerve was dissected as previously described. BCECF-AM dissolved in DMSO was diluted into 35 mmHg aCSF to a final concentration of 2.5 μM. A hypodermic needle was blunted and joined to a fine glass capillary via a short length of tubing. Etched tungsten wire was used to make a small incision in the middle on the nerve, from which the nerve was teased open slightly. Whilst holding the incision open the capillary loaded with BCECF was inserted and injected. The nerve was placed into 35mmHg aCSF to wash for 3 minutes. The nerve was then placed into a recording chamber, immobilised with a platinum wire harp and superfused with 35 mmHg aCSF. The BCECF-loaded nerves were imaged by epifluorescence (Scientifica Slice Scope, Cairn Research OptoLED illumination, 60x water Olympus immersion objective, NA 1.0, Hamamatsu ImagEM EM-SSC camera, Metafluor software). BCECF was excited using 470nm LED, with fluorescent emission being recorded every 4 seconds between 507 and 543nm.

<title>Modelling of paranode</title>
<p>The paranode was modelled as a cell with a mitochondrion, a K<sup>+</sup> leak channel, Cx32 and CA. Mitochondrial ATP production was modelled as per Matsuda et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Matsuda et al., 2020</xref>). This involves a time-dependent variable Y, that stimulates ATP production, where X is a variable that is proportional to the duration of electrical stimulation, Y<sub>0</sub> is the steady state value of Y and relaxes to that value with a time constant of τ<sub>1</sub>. K<sub>d1</sub> and n<sub>1</sub> are parameters for the Hill equation that determines how variable X alters the value of Y:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">

<p>The manuscript by Butler et al. explores a novel physiological role for connexin 32 (Cx32) hemichannels in Schwann cells at peripheral nerves. Building on the authors' prior work on CO₂-sensitive gating of connexins, this study proposes that mitochondrial CO₂ production dependent on neuronal activity promotes the opening of Cx32 hemichannels in the paranode, which in turn modulates neuronal activity by reducing conduction velocity. This hypothesis is addressed using a multifaceted approach that includes immunofluorescence microscopy, dye uptake assays, calcium imaging, computational modeling, and extracellular recordings in isolated sciatic nerves.</p>

<p>In the current state, the study has some limitations. The evidence linking Cx32 to the observed dye uptake and conduction velocity changes relies primarily on pharmacological inhibition with carbenoxolone, which lacks specificity. The imaging data show overlapping marker signals that preclude the anatomical distinction between nodes and paranodes. FITC uptake, while convincing to test Cx32 hemichannel gating, lacks spatial-temporal information and validation of distribution and localization to viable intracellular compartments. Moreover, while the findings are intriguing, functional proof that Cx32 regulates conduction velocity through ATP release or other downstream effects remains incomplete.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This article aims to demonstrate that local production of CO₂ at the axonal node opens Cx32 hemichannels in the Schwann cell paranode, and that CO₂ diffuses through the AQP1 channel to reach Cx32 and trigger its opening. The authors also present evidence supporting a physiological role for this regulatory mechanism. They propose that CO₂-dependent Cx32 activation mediates activity-dependent Ca²⁺ influx into the paranode, and by increasing the leak current across the myelin sheath, it contributes to a slowing of action potential conduction velocity.</p>
<p>The study presents a very interesting and novel mechanism for the physiological regulation of Cx32 hemichannels. The findings are relevant to the field, and the methods and results are of good quality, with some improvements in interpretation and explanation required, and some minor experimental suggestions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The article is solid in terms of the novelty of the findings and relevance for the physiology of myelinated axons. In addition, it is of major interest for the Connexin field because it explores a physiological way to open Cx32 hemichannels. The experiments are well elaborated, and most of them are sufficient for the main points described by the authors. The finding that nervous activity will trigger the mechanism of hemichannel opening by CO2 is probably the most relevant biological mechanism derived from this article.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Throughout the manuscript, the authors interpret their findings as if the described mechanism specifically occurs in the node and paranode regions. However, there is no direct evidence identifying the precise site of CO₂ production or the activation site of Cx32 hemichannels. Therefore, statements such as the one in the title (&quot;activity-dependent CO₂ production in the axonal node opens Cx32 in the Schwann cell paranode&quot;) should be reconsidered or removed, as they may be misleading and are not essential to the interpretation of the data. In addition, the participation of aquaporin AQP1 as the main conduit for CO2 diffusion through the plasma membrane could have another interpretation.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and agree that the evidence for involvement of Cx32 is indirect. We are planning to perform genetic manipulations to strengthen this link. We shall review our presentation of the morphology in terms of the node/paranode/juxtaparanode distribution and adjust accordingly. We have in the interim generated new data using GCaMP transduced into Schwann cells that provides the live-tissue imaging that the reviewer requests. This strengthens our conclusions, and we will add these data into the paper.</p>

<p>The study presents a very interesting and novel mechanism for the physiological regulation of Cx32 hemichannels. The findings are relevant to the field, and the methods and results are of good quality, with some improvements in interpretation and explanation required, and some minor experimental suggestions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The article is solid in terms of the novelty of the findings and relevance for the physiology of myelinated axons. In addition, it is of major interest for the Connexin field because it explores a physiological way to open Cx32 hemichannels. The experiments are well elaborated, and most of them are sufficient for the main points described by the authors.

<p>Throughout the manuscript, the authors interpret their findings as if the described mechanism specifically occurs in the node and paranode regions. However, there is no direct evidence identifying the precise site of CO₂ production or the activation site of Cx32 hemichannels. Therefore, statements such as the one in the title (&quot;activity-dependent CO₂ production in the axonal node opens Cx32 in the Schwann cell paranode&quot;) should be reconsidered or removed, as they may be misleading and are not essential to the interpretation of the data.

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and agree that we do not have direct evidence for the site of CO2 production or the site of activation of Cx32 hemichannels. This direct evidence is extremely difficult to obtain, and we therefore depend on indirect arguments. Mitochondria represent the major source of CO2, and their distribution will therefore indicate where CO2 is likely to be produced. We agree that this is not essential to the interpretation of the data and will adjust the text as recommended. We will add a section to the Discussion to consider this point in more detail.</p>
