<title>Abstract</title><p>The elevation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> leads to a decline in the plant mineral content, which poses a major threat to food security in the coming decades. To date, very few genes have been identified as having a role in the negative effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on plant mineral composition. Yet, several studies have shown a certain degree of diversity in the ionome’s response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, associated with genotypic variation. This suggests the existence of genetic factors controlling the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on ionome composition. However, no large-scale studies have been carried out to date to explore the genetic diversity of the ionome responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Here, we used six hundred <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accessions, representing geographical distributions ranging from worldwide to regional and local environments, to analyze the natural genetic variation underlying the negative effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on the ionome composition in plants. We show that the growth under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> leads to a global and important decrease of the ionome content whatever the geographic distribution of the population. We also observed a high range of genetic diversity in the response of the ionome composition to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and we identified sub-populations, showing effects on their ionome ranging from the most pronounced to resilience or even to a benefit in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Using genome-wide association mapping on the response of each mineral element to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> or on integrative traits, we identified a large set of QTLs and genes associated with the ionome response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the function of one of these genes can mitigate the negative effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on the plant mineral composition. Therefore, this resource will contribute to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the negative effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on the mineral composition of plants, and to the development of biofortified crops adapted to a high-CO<sub>2</sub> world.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The elevation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration leads to a decline in the mineral composition of C3 plants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The negative effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on plant mineral composition has been observed worldwide, and alters the content of nutrients that are essential for human nutrition, such as nitrogen (N) and proteins, iron (Fe) or zinc (Zn) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> thus poses a major threat to food security in the coming decades. The reasons why elevated CO<sub>2</sub> leads to the degradation of plant mineral composition are far from being well understood. To date, only a few genes with a potential regulatory effect on this mechanism have been identified <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. These elements nevertheless converge towards the fact that the adaptation of plants to future high CO<sub>2</sub> climate can be achieved through the identification and the characterization of genetic mechanisms. In addition to this, several studies suggest that exploring the natural genetic variability of plants represents a major opportunity to understand the mechanisms by which high CO<sub>2</sub> leads to a decline in plant mineral composition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Indeed, a significant diversity in the response of mineral composition to high CO<sub>2</sub> has been observed in several plant species. For protein and therefore N content, as well as for Fe or Zn content, substantial variations have been observed between small panels of genotypes from different species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. This implies the presence of a genetic diversity reservoir, which can facilitate the understanding of the ionome’s response to high CO<sub>2</sub> and subsequently provide an opportunity to alleviate this negative impact. However, in order to identify the genetic determinants of this negative response of the ionome to high CO<sub>2</sub>, large-scale approaches are necessary, but are still lacking for the moment. The objective of this work was to fill the aforementioned knowledge gap by using a large collection of natural genotypes of the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> allowing to explore in depth the natural variation of the ionome response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and to generate a resource of phenotypic data that can be used in association genetics approaches. To this end, we used several hundreds of accessions from different geographic scales of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and analyzed their mineral composition under contrasted conditions of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. This allowed us to extract the general trends in the ionome response to high CO<sub>2</sub>, and to identify a large set of genes associated with the variation in the mineral composition of plants in response to high CO<sub>2</sub>. By combining this information with genome expression data under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, we end up by functionally validating one of these genes for its importance in the reduction of Zn content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and therefore by demonstrating the relevance of this resource for future improvement of plant nutrient content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In order to explore the natural variation and identify its underlying genetic basis associated with the negative effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on plant ionome, we used three populations of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> representing different geographic scales (i.e., the worldwide REGMAP population, the LANGUEDOC regional population and the local TOU-A population from east of France) and displaying different levels of genetic diversity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). These populations were grown under ambient or elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and we measured in each accession the composition of their ionome in rosettes, including C, N, Na, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn and Cu content.</p>

<title>Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> globally decreases ionome content at the population level, whatever the geographic scale</title>
<p>In the three <italic>A. thaliana</italic> populations, we observed a global and important decrease of the ionome content when plants were grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> as compared to ambient CO<sub>2</sub>. This was particularly the case for N and Fe, for which the decrease in content was very robust and important in each of the population analyzed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). Zn, Cu and Mg content were also negatively affected to a significant extent by the growth under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in the REGMAP and in the TOU-A populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, C), although not significantly in the LANGUEDOC population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). More variability for the effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> was observed on Mn and Na content, which were decreased in the REGMAP population, but not significantly changed in the TOU-A and LANGUEDOC populations, respectively. In parallel, the C content of these populations increased under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, by very significant factors for the REGMAP and the LANGUEDOC populations. Altogether, these observations demonstrate that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> has on average a strong negative impact on the mineral content of natural genotypes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> at the population-scale, whatever their geographic distribution.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>The ionome of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> natural accessions displays a high range of phenotypic diversity in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub></title>
<p>To explore the effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in each accession, we calculated the relative change in nutrient composition of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions from the three populations in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. In agreement with the results previously mentioned, we observed that the median relative change of most nutrient content at the population-level was negatively affected by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). But the most striking observation was the genetic diversity of ionome response observed in these populations. Indeed, while most the natural accessions were negatively affected by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (with a negative relative ratio of their nutrient content between ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>), a considerable number of accessions were rather not affected by elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, or even positively affected, therefore showing an improved nutrient composition under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. For macronutrients like N, the relative change of concentration between ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> varied from 20% to -50%, and for micronutrients like Cu, Fe or Zn, the relative change of concentration between ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> varied from 100% to -60% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In addition, some differences among nutrients were observed between populations. For instance, a smaller dispersion of Fe relative change in the LANGUEDOC population, against a higher distribution of Mn relative change.</p>

</fig>
<p>In order to explore the behavior of the different elements in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and to observe the structure of phenotypic variation, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) of the relative change in the 8 elements for the accessions from the three populations. The accessions from all populations seem to have globally similar responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, as suggested by the overlap of the three populations in the two first principal components (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The first component of the PCA described a clear antagonistic trend between C content and the change of other mineral elements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting that most of the variation between accessions in term of mineral response (almost 40%) could be driven by one or a few mechanisms resulting in an inverse variation between the whole ionome and C change (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Interestingly, the second component, explaining almost 15% of the variation among accessions in term of mineral response, was mainly driven jointly by change in N and C concentration. Altogether, these results show that there is a marked and large variability among accessions in their mineral concentration in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, illustrated by accessions negatively affected by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and others positively affected by elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. In order to explore specific behavior of sub-populations, we clustered the accessions from the REGMAP panel via a k-means approach. This multivariate clustering resulted in the partitioning of accessions in three groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4</xref> – Suppl. Table 1). Cluster 1 displayed the most negative pattern of ionome response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Inversely, accessions included in Cluster 2 displayed a globally positive response, with the highest relative change for almost all mineral elements, except for C content. These accessions did not appear to be clustered geographically with respect to their collection origin in the REGMAP panel (Suppl. Fig. 1), which is in line with the high genetic diversity of response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> observed at smaller geographical scales (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>). Finally, Cluster 3 displayed a resilient pattern, with accessions showing a globally attenuated response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, the large phenotypic diversity of the ionome observed in the three populations in response to high CO<sub>2</sub>, as well as the presence of contrasted subpopulations in the REGMPA panel, suggests the presence of genetic determinants associated with this response.</p>

<title>Genetic architecture of the ionome response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and identification of genetic determinants</title>
<p>We run Genome-Wide Association (GWA) mapping to describe the genetic architecture of the ionome response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and to fine-map candidate genes underlying the detected quantitative trait loci (QTLs). We focused here on the phenotypic data collected on the REGMAP population, and used the sequencing data available for this population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. We included in this analysis the level of each mineral under ambient and under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, as well as the relative change between ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> for each element. We also included a trait corresponding for each accession to the coordinate on the first and on the second PCA axes (PCA1 and PCA2) explaining collectively more than 50% of ionomic variation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore, these values correspond to traits driving and summarizing a large part of the ionome variation under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. This resulted as a whole in running GWA mapping on 30 different single-trait GWAS. The overall approach was first validated by observing expected results for traits phenotyped under ambient CO<sub>2</sub>. For instance, we observed a very strong peak for the Na content at the locus of the <italic>HKT1</italic> gene (Suppl. Fig. 2A), which is known to be involved in the natural genetic variation of Na content in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, or a strong peak for the N content at the locus of the <italic>NIA1</italic> gene (Suppl. Fig. 2B), encoding for an isoform of the nitrate reductase required for the first step of nitrate reduction and associated with natural genetic variation of N content in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>GWA mapping revealed a polygenic architecture for each phenotypic trait, although its complexity largely differs among traits. For instance, very few and neat peaks of association were detected Na and Mn content under elevated CO2, or of Fe and Cu relative change between ambient and elevated CO2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5A</xref>, Suppl. Fig. 3). On the other hand, a more complex genetic architecture with the detection of a large number of QTLs was observed for traits related to N or C content (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5A</xref>, Suppl. Fig. 3). For each of the traits that have been analyzed under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> or corresponding to the relative change of their content between ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, we isolated the 50 SNPs with the most significant p-value, hereafter named top SNPs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, Suppl. Tables 2 and 3). In order to identify the overlap between the genetic architecture of each trait, we looked whether some of the top SNPs were shared among traits. While the large majority of SNPs were specific to one trait, 30 and 21 SNPs were shared between two traits for the content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> or for the relative change between ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B and C</xref>, Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). In addition, 8 and 2 SNPs were shared between three traits for the content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> or for the relative change between ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B and C</xref>, Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). Most of the shared SNPs were associated with micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn and Mg content) and with N and/or with the first component of the PCA axis. An interesting QTL located on chromosome 1 was notably associated with 6 traits, displaying SNPs shared between Mn, Zn and N relative change and SNPs shared between Mn, N and PC1 content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, Suppl. Tables 2 and 3). Another QTL located on chromosome 3 encompasses SNPs shared between Fe, Zn and PC1 content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, Suppl. Table 2).</p>

<p>We next identified for each trait a list of the genes located at ±25 kb from the top 50 SNPs, which corresponds to the rough estimate of the decay of linkage disequilibrium identified in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> at the worldwide scale <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This resulted in a list of genes for each element, ranging from 154 to 422 genes depending on the element (Suppl. Tables 2 and 3). Among others, several genes associated with top 50 SNPs were identified as obvious candidates of the effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on plant nutrition and ionome content. This was the case of <italic>ZINC INDUCED FACILITATOR 1</italic> (<italic>ZIF1</italic>, <italic>AT5G13740</italic>) and <italic>ZIF-LIKE1</italic> (<italic>AT5G13750</italic>), linked with SNPs identified for Zn content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and involved Zn sequestration mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We also noticed the link between SNPs identified for Zn relative change and <italic>TIP2;2</italic> (<italic>AT4G17340</italic>), known to be involved in Zn root-to-shoot translocation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Concerning N relative change, some of the top 50 SNPs were linked to <italic>ASN1</italic> (<italic>AT3G47340</italic>), which is an actor of N status and remobilization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The <italic>H+/CATION EXCHANGER 1</italic> (<italic>CAX1</italic>) gene (<italic>AT2G38170</italic>), involved in the response to Mn deficiency, was also linked to SNPs associated with Mn content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Some of the top 50 SNPs identified for Fe relative change were linked to <italic>MCO2</italic> (<italic>AT5G21100</italic>) and <italic>MCO3</italic> (<italic>AT5G21105</italic>) genes, which have been recently characterized as actors of the regulation of Fe homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Finally, it is interesting to note that the QTL located on chromosome 3 mentioned above displaying significant shared SNPs identified for Fe, Zn and PC1 content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> was associated among other genes with <italic>ISU2</italic> (<italic>AT3G01020</italic>), coding for one of the Fe-S clusters in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which are known to be essential for photosynthesis and metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Altogether, this demonstrated that genes identified through this approach represent a large and valuable reservoir of candidates to study and to counteract the effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on plant nutrition and ionome content.</p>
<p>To analyze how these genes identified by GWA mapping are regulated by elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, we performed RNA-seq from shoots and roots grown under ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Differentially expressed genes (DEG) associated to the effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> were identified from shoots and roots (Suppl. Table 4). We crossed the list of shoots or roots elevated CO<sub>2</sub>- DEG with the list of genes identified by GWA mapping for each element, which resulted in a list of 182 genes identified by GWA mapping and differentially regulated by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in shoot or in roots (Suppl. Table 5), making them strong candidates to be involved in the response of the mineral composition of plants to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Most of these genes were deregulated by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in shoot (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, B). In shoot or in roots, these genes mainly showed an association with C-, Mg- or Zn-related traits (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, B). Several of these genes, identified by GWA mapping and whose expression is deregulated in response to high CO<sub>2</sub>, were known for their role in nutrient homeostasis. This was the case for the <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>DUR3</italic> genes, encoding an asparagine synthase and a urea transporter involved in N metabolism and remobilization, both associated here with a N-related peak of association, and whose expression is modulated by high CO<sub>2</sub> in leaves (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). We also observed in the leaves an interesting profile for several genes related to C metabolism and photosynthesis. This was the case for the <italic>BGP3</italic> gene, involved in chloroplast development, or for the carbonic anhydrase <italic>CA1</italic>, both showing a decreased expression in response to high CO<sub>2</sub> and both associated with a peak in C-related GWA mapping under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). In roots, the gene most deregulated in response to high CO<sub>2</sub> was <italic>AT1G64710</italic>, encoding a GroES-type alcohol dehydrogenase, which interestingly is also deregulated in leaves (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). We also observed in the roots that the expression of the <italic>TIP2;2</italic> gene, associated here with a peak detected for Zn relative change GWA mapping, was deregulated in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>

<p>To go further, we selected one of the association peaks identified by GWA mapping, and sought to functionally validate the importance of this QTL in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, in order to demonstrate the value of our data set and GWA mapping analyses. To do so, we selected an association peak located on chromosome 4 and associated with Zn relative change (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). More precisely, this association peak displayed the SNPs with the most significant <italic>p</italic>- values and more largely three SNPs that fell into the top 10 SNPs of the trait corresponding to the Zn relative change between ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. The SNPs corresponding to the alternative alleles were associated to an increase of Zn content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). These SNPs are located very close to the <italic>TIP2;2</italic> (<italic>AT4G17340</italic>) gene, which has been recently characterized as an actor of Zn root-to-shoot translocation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. We thus selected a set of accessions from haplotype 0 (reduced Zn content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>) or haplotype 1 (increased Zn content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>), and analyze <italic>TIP2;2</italic> expression in the roots under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. This analysis revealed a haplotype-specific difference in <italic>TIP2;2</italic> expression under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, with accessions from haplotype 1 showing a reduced <italic>TIP2;2</italic> expression in the roots compared to those from haplotype 1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), correlated with a higher Zn content in the shoot (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). To validate the effect of <italic>TIP2;2</italic> expression of Zn content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, we used the <italic>tip2;2-1</italic> knock-out mutant and compared its Zn content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> to this of the WT. We observed that the <italic>tip2;2-1</italic> mutant line displayed a significant higher Zn content in the shoot under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> compared to the WT, confirming that <italic>TIP2;2</italic> expression determines Zn content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrated that these data sets generated in this study and the associated analyses are a valuable resource to identify genes able to counteract the general negative effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on the mineral composition of plants.</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>The natural variation of ionome response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> displays a high degree of genetic variation</title>
<p>In the present work, we analyzed the diversity of ionome response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> present in the natural variation of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. In agreement with several other phenotypic traits related to phenology and disease resistance {Brachi, 2013 #1232;Huard-Chauveau, 2013 #1247;Roux, 2022 #1248}, we observed a wide range of responses at complementary geographical scales, from accessions with a ionome strongly negatively affected by high CO<sub>2</sub> to accessions with a ionome benefiting from high CO<sub>2</sub>. This confirms for the first time on large and complementary sets of natural genotypes what has been observed by meta-analysis on isolated groups of plants worldwide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The global analysis of the distribution of each mineral element studied suggests firstly a trend where the whole ionome would evolve in a unified manner in response to high CO<sub>2</sub>, and in an opposite manner to C. This is in line with a number of studies that have proposed that the accumulation of carbohydrates due to the stimulation of photosynthesis by high CO<sub>2</sub> would be the cause of the decrease in plant mineral composition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, the reading of the genetic architecture performed here by a genome-wide association genetics approach suggests that the majority of the genetic mechanisms underlying the negative effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on the ionome are specific to each mineral element. Some specific cases, such as the QTL detected on chromosome 1 and associated with the natural genetic variation of 6 traits among the 20 considered, will certainly deserve a more in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>By clustering globally distributed accessions according to their ionome sensitivity to high CO<sub>2</sub>, we were able to observe that the geographic origin of the accessions likely did not determine their response to CO<sub>2</sub>. This suggests that inherent genetic factors, more than those due to local adaption, direct the response of plants to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. This seems consistent since the CO<sub>2</sub> elevation applied here to natural <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> variants does not correspond to any environment experienced by plants yet, at least for several tens of millions of years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this context of brutal and highly impactful environmental change, the presence of cryptic genetic variation often explains the appearance of relatively rapid adaptive mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Although not formally tested here, it would be interesting to examine whether the variation in the ionome in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> shows evidence of cryptic variation. In any case, the presence of high phenotypic diversity in these natural populations of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> demonstrates very clearly the possibility of taking advantage of this genetic variation to understand and alleviate the negative response of plant mineral composition to high CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>GWA mapping of ionome variation under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> identified a large number of genes to understand and mitigate the negative effect of high CO<sub>2</sub> on plant mineral composition</title>
<p>In order to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the effect of high CO<sub>2</sub> on plant mineral composition, and to enable future breeding approaches, we adopted an association genetics approach. This led to the identification of a large number of candidate genes associated to the variation of nutrients under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Several genes in this list can easily attract attention. In particular, we can note the identification of <italic>ASN1</italic> and <italic>DUR3</italic> genes in two of the loci associated with N content variation under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. <italic>ASN1</italic>, and to a lesser extent <italic>DUR3</italic>, play an important role in the remobilization and the reallocation of N within the plant, and their manipulation can lead to variation in N use efficiency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. This is interesting because for the moment, root N uptake and N assimilation seemed to be the key targets of the negative effect of high CO<sub>2</sub> on plant N content <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, but these results suggest that remobilization of N may also be involved. We also identified the <italic>CA1</italic> gene, coding for a carbonic anhydrase, in the vicinity of a QTL associated with C variation under high CO<sub>2</sub>. <italic>CA1</italic> is involved in the regulation of stomatal opening by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, and the α carbonic anhydrase family of which <italic>CA1</italic> belongs is involved in the regulation of photosynthetic efficiency, although <italic>CA1</italic> shows no significant effect under standard conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. It would be therefore interesting to assess the role of <italic>CA1</italic> natural genetic variation under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. If <italic>CA1</italic> regulates the C variation of the ionome under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, this could, according to our observations, significantly influence the global mineral composition of plants. Interestingly, the genes identified by GWA mapping in the ionome response to high CO<sub>2</sub>, including those mentioned above, showed substantial variation at the gene expression level. We ended this study with the functional validation of an association peak identified by GWA mapping for the relative change of Zn content between ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Zn is an essential element for a large number of metabolic processes in humans, and Zn deficiency, found in up to one third of the world’s population, leads to severe health problems. We demonstrated that <italic>TIP2;2</italic> gene expression varied in response to CO<sub>2</sub> in a haplotype-specific manner. Consistent with these results, we show that manipulating <italic>TIP2;2</italic> expression with a knock-out mutant can modulate the Zn loss observed under high CO<sub>2</sub>. A recent study demonstrated that TIP2;2 was responsible for Zn retention in the roots {Wang, 2022 #1177}. It therefore seems consistent that natural accessions with the lowest expression levels of this gene are those with the highest Zn content in aerial parts, due to low retention in their roots. This example illustrates the potential of the resource we have generated here towards the development of biofortified plants. The development of biofortified plants represents a considerable challenge in view of the current problems of malnutrition on a global scale, and this challenge becomes even more important in a context of rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. This reservoir of data and genes will certainly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the general negative effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on mineral composition, and to the development of crop plants adapted to forthcoming high-CO<sub>2</sub> climate.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study's abstract, introduction, and conclusions are not supported by the methods and results conducted. In fact, the results presented suggest that Arabidopsis could easily adapt to an extremely high CO2 environment.</p>
<p>This study offers good evidence pointing to a genetic basis for Arabidopsis thaliana's response to elevated CO2 (eCO2) levels and its subsequent impact on the leaf ionome. The natural variation analyses in the study support the hypothesis that genetic factors, rather than local adaptation, guide the influence of eCO2 on the ionome of rosette leaves in Arabidopsis. However, the manuscript's claim regarding its role in &quot;the development of biofortified crops adapted to a high-CO2 world&quot; (line 23) is overstated, especially given the absence of any analysis on the influence of eCO2 on the seed ionome and Arabidopsis is a poor model for harvest index for any crop. The manuscript, in its current form, necessitates massive revisions, particularly in clarifying its broader implications and in providing more substantial evidence for some of its assertions.</p>
<p>Major Drawbacks and Questions:</p>
<p>1. Evidence for the Central Premise:</p>
<p>
The foundational premise of the study is the assertion that rising atmospheric CO2 levels result in a decline in plant mineral content. This phenomenon is primarily observed in C3 plants, with C4 plants seemingly less affected. The evidence provided on this topic is scant and, in some instances, contradicts the authors' own references. The potential reduction of certain minerals, especially in grains, can be debated. For instance, reduced nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content in grains might not necessarily be detrimental for human and animal consumption. In fact, it could potentially mitigate issues like nitrogen emissions and phosphorus leaching. Labeling this as a &quot;major threat to food security&quot; (line 30) is exaggerated. While the case for microelements might be more compelling, the introduction fails to articulate this adequately. Furthermore, the introduction lacks any discussion on how eCO2 might influence nutrient allocation to grains, which would be crucial in substantiating the claim that eCO2 poses a threat to food security. A more comprehensive introduction that clearly delineates the adverse effects of eCO2 and its implications for food security would greatly enhance the manuscript.</p>
<p>2. Exaggerated Concerns:</p>
<p>
The paper begins with the concern that carbon fertilization will lead to carbon dilution in our foods. While we indeed face numerous genuine threats in the coming decades, this particular issue is manageable. The increase in CO2 alone offers many opportunities for boosting yield. However, the heightened heat and increased evapotranspiration will pose massive challenges in many environments.</p>
<p>Figure 4 in fact suggests that 43% of the REGMAP panel (cluster 3) is already pre-adapted to very high CO2 levels. This suggests annual species could adapt very rapidly.</p>
<p>3. Assumptions on CO2 Levels:</p>
<p>
The assumption of 900ppm seems to be based on a very extreme climate change scenario. Most people believe we will overshoot the 1.5{degree sign}C scenario, however, it seems plausible that 2.5 to 3{degree sign}C scenarios are more likely. This would correspond to around 500ppm of CO2. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01196-7/tables/4">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01196-7/tables/4</ext-link></p>
<p>4. Focus on Real Challenges:</p>
<p>
We have numerous real challenges, such as extreme heat and inconsistent rainfall, to address in the context of climate change. However, testing under extreme CO2 conditions and then asserting that carbon dilution will negatively impact nutrition is exaggerated.</p>
<p>In contrast, the FACE experiments are fundamental and are conducted at more realistic eCO2 levels. Understanding the interaction between a 20% increase in CO2 and new precipitation patterns is key for global carbon flux prediction.</p>
<p>As I look at the literature on commercial greenhouse tomato production, 1000ppm of eCO2 is common, but it also looks like the breeders and growers have already solved for flavor and nutrition under these conditions.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>
While the study provides valuable insights into the genetic underpinnings of Arabidopsis thaliana's response to elevated CO2 levels, it requires an entirely revised writeup, especially in its abstract, broader claims and implications. The manuscript would benefit from a more thorough introduction, a clearer definition of its scope, and a clear focus on the limits of this study.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors have conducted a large, well-designed experiment to test the response to eCO2. Overall, the experimental design is sound and appropriate for the questions about how a change in CO2 affects the ionome of Arabidopsis. Most of the conclusions in this area are well supported by the data that the authors present.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>
While the authors have done good experiments, it is a big stretch from Arabidopsis grown in an arbitrary concentration of CO2 to relevance to human and animal nutrition in future climates. Arabidopsis is a great model plant, but its leaves are not generally eaten by humans or animals.</p>
<p>The authors don't justify their choice of a CO2 concentration. Given the importance of the parameter for the experiment, the rationale for selecting 900 ppm as elevated CO2 compared to any other concentration should be addressed. And CO2 is just one of the variables that plants will have to contend with in future climates, other variables will also affect elemental concentrations.</p>
<p>Given these concerns, I think the emphasis on biofortification for future climates is unwarranted for this study.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have trouble with these conclusions:</p>
<p>-Abstract &quot;Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the function of one of these genes can mitigate the negative effect of elevated CO2 on the plant mineral composition. &quot;</p>
<p>
-Discussion &quot;Consistent with these results, we show that manipulating TIP2;2 expressions with a knock-out mutant can modulate the Zn loss observed under high CO2.&quot;</p>
<p>The authors have not included the data to support this conclusion as stated. They have shown that this mutant increases the Zn content of the leaves when compared to WT but have not demonstrated that this response is different than in ambient CO2. This is an important distinction: one way to ameliorate the reduction of nutrients due to eCO2 is to try to identify genes that are involved in the mechanism of eCO2-induced reduction. Another way is to increase the concentration of nutrients so that the eCO2-induced reduction is not as important (i.e. a 10% reduction in Zn due to eCO2 is not as important if you have increased the baseline Zn concentration by 20%). The authors identified tip2 as a target from the GWAS on difference, but their validation experiment only looks at eCO2.</p>
