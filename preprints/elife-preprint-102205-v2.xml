<title>Abstract</title><p>The most common primary malignancy of the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a heterogeneous tumor entity with high metastatic potential and complex pathophysiology. Increasing evidence suggests that tissue mechanics plays a critical role in tumor onset and progression. Here we show that plectin, a major cytoskeletal crosslinker protein, plays a crucial role in mechanical homeostasis and mechanosensitive oncogenic signaling that drives hepatocarcinogenesis. Our expression analyses revealed elevated plectin levels in liver tumors, which correlated with poor prognosis for HCC patients. Using autochthonous and orthotopic mouse models we demonstrated that genetic and pharmacological inactivation of plectin potently suppressed the initiation and growth of HCC. Moreover, plectin targeting potently inhibited the invasion potential of human HCC cells and reduced their metastatic outgrowth in the lung. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling linked plectin-dependent disruption of cytoskeletal networks to attenuation of oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/AKT signatures. Importantly, by combining cell line-based and murine HCC models, we show that plectin inhibitor plecstatin-1 (PST) is well-tolerated and potently inhibits HCC progression. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that plectin-controlled cytoarchitecture is a key determinant of HCC development and suggests that pharmacologically induced disruption of mechanical homeostasis may represent a new therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mounting evidence indicates that tissue mechanics plays a pivotal role in cancer cell and stromal cell behavior. Tumor progression is typically associated with a pathological increase of tissue stiffness caused by excessive deposition, crosslinking, and aberrant organization of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers. Increasing tissue rigidity drives tumor invasion and malignancy and correlates with poor patient survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>At the cellular level, both tumor and stromal cells respond to altered mechanical properties of the extracellular milieu by translating physical cues into mechanosensitive signaling pathways. This conversion relies on focal adhesions (FAs), clusters of integrin receptors facilitating the link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton. Integrin-mediated adhesion induces the activation of FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/AKT pathways, leading to increased cell survival, migration, and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Subsequent activation of Rho-dependent pathways results in higher cytoskeletal tension and force transmission across FAs, thus establishing a mechanical reciprocity between ECM viscoelasticity and actomyosin- generated cytoskeletal tension. Importantly, many genes encoding components of the ECM- cytoskeletal axis and their regulators (e.g. <italic>αSMA</italic>, <italic>ITGβ</italic>, <italic>LMNA</italic>, <italic>ROCK</italic>, and <italic>COL</italic>) are controlled by tension-dependent transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. This creates a difficult-to-break positive feedback loop leading to cellular and matrix stiffening, further promoting the aggressive, pro-proliferative, and invasive tumor cell phenotype.</p>
<p>Emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at tumor mechanics and mechanotransduction include the targeting of the ECM and ECM modulators (e.g. lysyl oxidase and angiotensin), depletion of stromal myofibroblasts, and integrin receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Other approaches target cytoskeleton-mediated downstream cellular response to tissue stiffening (e.g. Rho-dependent actomyosin-generated contractile forces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>). We hypothesized that another efficacious strategy could be inactivation of cytoskeletal crosslinker proteins (so-called cytolinkers)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, large proteins of the plakin protein family, responsible for maintaining cellular architecture. The best-studied example, a prototypical cytolinker plectin is a well-established regulator of cellular tensional homeostasis and mechanotransduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> which is upregulated in various tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Through its canonical actin-binding domain (ABD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>) and intermediate filament (IF)-binding domain (IFBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>), plectin crosslinks actin with IF networks and recruits them to cell adhesions, including FAs. Plectin deletion or mutation results in cytoskeletal reconfiguration accompanied by altered mechanical properties, such as cellular stiffness, stress propagation, and traction force generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, plectin-dependent changes in cell adhesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and cytoskeletal tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> are associated with aberrant integrin-mediated mechanosignaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Although multiple reports have linked plectin with tumor malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and other pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, mechanistic insights into how plectin functionally contributes to carcinogenesis remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>A malignancy with a well-known link to overproduction of ECM components is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. Repeated rounds of hepatocyte damage and renewal due to a number of etiologies, most commonly chronic viral infection, alcohol abuse, or a diet rich in fats and sugars, creates a pro-inflammatory environment in the liver. Activated hepatic stellate cells adopt a myofibroblast phenotype and increase production and deposition of ECM components leading to liver fibrosis which can eventually progress to liver cirrhosis. Up to 90% of HCC cases occur on a background of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, suggesting a causal link between increased deposition of ECM components and liver carcinogenesis. Consistent with this idea, plectin mRNA has been found to be upregulated in liver carcinomas, especially in later stages of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, changes in the interactions between the cytoskeleton and ECM may be important in HCC progression, particularly during the transition from local to metastatic malignancy.</p>
<p>Here we explore the role of plectin in the development and dissemination of HCC. Using publicly available HCC sequencing data and biopsies from HCC patients we identify plectin as a novel HCC marker associated with a malignant phenotype and poor survival. To explore the role of plectin in hepatocarcinogenesis, we use a genetic mouse model with liver-specific plectin ablation (<italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic>). In this model, plectin deficiency suppresses tumor initiation and growth. We further demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-engineered human HCC cell lines with inactivated plectin display limited migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent proliferation which correlates with their reduced metastatic outgrowth in the lung. By comprehensive proteomic analysis, we show that plectin inactivation attenuates oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/AKT signaling signatures. Finally, our work identifies the ruthenium-based plecstatin-1 (PST), as a candidate drug that can mimic the genetic ablation of plectin, thus providing a robust pre-clinical proof-of-concept for PST in the treatment of HCC. Our study implicates plectin as a potent driver of HCC, highlights its importance in metastatic spread, and points to potential novel treatment options.</p>

<p>Consistent with expression analysis, quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy of 19 human HCC tissue sections revealed a significant increase of plectin fluorescence intensities in tumor (T) compared to adjacent non-tumor (NT) tissue, with plectin perimembraneous enrichment in tumor hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement 1G). Next, we compared plectin expression levels by immunoblotting in a panel of human HCC cell lines, which represent distinct stages of HCC development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Consistent with mRNA and immunofluorescence analyses, poorly differentiated mesenchymal-like HCC cell lines (characterized by low E-cadherin and high vimentin levels) displayed elevated plectin levels, coinciding with higher migration speed when compared to well-differentiated HCC cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D,E</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate our findings in a well-established chemical carcinogen murine HCC model, we analyzed plectin expression in hepatic tumors formed 46 weeks after diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection in C57BI/6J mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Both quantitative immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses indicated elevated plectin levels in T versus NT liver tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,G</xref>,H; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement 1H). Moreover, enhanced plectin signal along hepatocyte membranes closely resembled the staining pattern found in patient HCC sections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), suggesting reliable translation from the human setting. Together, these results show that elevated plectin is associated with HCC progression both in human patients and animal model and indicates robust prognostic potential for patient survival.</p>

<p>To address plectińs role in HCC at a cellular level, we genetically manipulated endogenous plectin in well-differentiated Huh7 and poorly differentiated SNU-475 human HCC cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Using the CRISPR/Cas-9 system we generated either knockouts (KO) or cells harboring endogenous plectin with deletion of the IF-binding domain (ΔIFBD) as functional knockouts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 1B-D). Gene editing was complemented by treatment with organoruthenium-based compound PST that inactivates plectin function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. If not stated otherwise, we applied PST in the final concentration of 8 µM, which corresponds to the 25% of IC<sub>50</sub> for Huh7 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 1E). Consistent with the murine model, plectin inactivation resulted in a reduced number of Huh7 and SNU-475 colonies in a soft agar colony formation assay, with PST treatment closely mimicking the effect of genetic targeting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Moreover, KO and ΔIFBD SNU-475 colonies were significantly smaller when compared to wild-type (WT) controls, with a similar trend observed for Huh7 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 1F). Collectively, these data demonstrate the inhibitory effect of plectin inactivation on HCC progression in adhesion-independent conditions.</p>
<p>To further assess whether plectin is required for human HCC progression, we investigated the growth of subcutaneous Huh7 xenografts in immunodeficient NSG mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 1G). Cells with disabled plectin developed significantly smaller tumors when compared with untreated WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>), mirroring the results of the colony forming assay. The percentage of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells on immunolabeled xenograft sections, however, did not differ between experimental conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 1G). These results show the reduced tumorigenic potential of human HCC cells when plectin is disabled either by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene ablation or pharmacologically with PST. Hence, by combining <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches, we provide evidence that plectin promotes hepatocarcinogenesis.</p>

A comparison of KO and PST signatures using IPA revealed an overlap (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>—figure supplement 1A).

In agreement with our proteomic analyses, plectin inactivation resulted in considerable changes in expression levels of integrin adhesion receptors (integrins αV and β1) as well as other FA constituents (i.e. talin, vinculin, and paxillin). Moreover, immunoblotting revealed in cells with disabled plectin either generally altered expression (FAK, AKT, Erk1/2, ILK, and PI3K) and/or reduced phosphorylation (AKT, Erk1/2, and PI3K) of key effectors downstream of integrin-mediated adhesion. Although these alterations were not found systematically in both cell lines and condition (reflecting thus presumably their distinct differentiation grade and plectin inactivation efficacy), collectively these data confirmed plectin-dependent adhesome remodeling together with attenuation of oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt pathways upon plectin inactivation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the extent of plectin-dependent adhesome remodeling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,E</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>—figure supplement 1C), we next assessed whether plectin inactivation affects the morphology and localization of FAs in vinculin-immunolabeled SNU-475 cells. Remarkably, while FAs of micropattern- seeded WT cells were mostly located at the cell periphery, FAs of plectin-disabled cells were frequently found within the cell interior (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,E</xref>). Moreover, plectin inactivation resulted in an overall reduced number of FAs, and the FAs that remained were larger and more elongated than in WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F,G</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>—figure supplement 1H,I). To test whether the changes in actin/FA configuration affected adhesion-transmitted forces, we performed traction force microscopy (TFM; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H,I</xref>). The smaller FAs found in WT cells transmitted significantly higher contractile energy than KO, ΔIFBD, and PST- treated cells, indicating that FAs in plectin-deficient cells were less functional than in WT.</p>
<p>Functional transmission of actomyosin-generated forces across FAs constitutes a prerequisite for cellular locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, we examined the effect of plectin inactivation on the migration of HCC cells. As anticipated, both Huh7 and SNU-475 cells exhibited a decrease in migration speed upon plectin targeting in the scratch wound healing assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,B</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>—figure supplement 1A). It is noteworthy that migrating plectin-disabled SNU-475 cells exhibited more cohesive, epithelial-like features while progressing collectively. By contrast, WT SNU-475 leader cells were more polarized and found to migrate into scratch areas more frequently than their plectin-deficient counterparts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>—figure supplement 1B). Consistent with this observation, individually seeded SNU-475 cells less frequently assumed a polarized, mesenchymal-like shape upon plectin inactivation in both 2D and 3D environments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Moreover, plectin-inactivated SNU-475 cells exhibited a decrease in N- cadherin and vimentin levels when compared to WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>—figure supplement 1C).</p>

<p>In addition to slower general migration, we also found epithelial growth factor (EGF)-guided migration potential of individual KO, ΔIFBD, and PST-treated cells to be significantly reduced compared to WT cells. Consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, plectin-disabled cells traversed less linear trajectories in both random and directed scenarios (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>—figure supplement 1D,E). To determine whether plectin is involved in migration-associated cellular shape dynamics, we further investigated protrusions of SNU-475 cells using morphodynamic contour analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Our analysis revealed a higher protrusion frequency of randomly migrating WT compared to plectin-disabled cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>—figure supplement 1F), while no differences in protrusion orientation were observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-H</xref>). In sharp contrast, plectin ablation dramatically reduced the capacity of KO and ΔIFBD cells to form stable protrusions in the direction of chemotactic motion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-H</xref>), although only a marginal effect on the protrusivity was observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>—figure supplement 1F). Collectively, these results show that plectin is essential for the proper cytoskeletal configuration of HCC cells and their cytoskeleton-linked FAs. Moreover, they provide evidence that aberrant cytoarchitecture of plectin-disabled cells accounts for the failure to effectively exert traction forces and actively reconfigure body shape, both of which are required for HCC cell migration.</p>

<p>To monitor plectin effects on shape dynamics in a 3D environment, we recorded WT and KO SNU-475 cells by time-lapse video microscopy in a matrigel invasion assay. Invading WT cells exhibited polarized protrusions followed by cell body displacement in the direction of the nascent protrusion (Video 1; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). By contrast, randomly oriented thinner protrusions of KO cells were often retracted shortly after formation. Markedly thinner and branched KO protrusions were confirmed by subsequent immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Similar to what we observed in the 2D assay, KO cells failed to invade in the direction of these transient protrusions (Video 1; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Hence, plectin-controlled cytoarchitecture facilitates both 2D and 3D HCC cell migration.</p>
<p>Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification of an HCC meta-cohort with clinically annotated tumors from HCC patients (n = 978) demonstrated that high plectin mRNA expression is associated with advanced TNM stages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). To elucidate the impact of plectin inactivation on HCC dissemination, we conducted the lung colonization assay using both Huh7 and SNU-475 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>- I; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>—figure supplement 1C-F). To this end, we administered red firefly luciferase and GFP (RedFLuc-GFP)-expressing WT and KO cells intravenously (i.v.) in 5-week-old NSG mice. Whereas mice receiving WT Huh7 (but not SNU-475; data not shown) cells succumbed rapidly to disease, mice receiving KO cells exhibited prolonged survival (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). To identify early phase of metastasis formation, we next monitored the HCC cell retention in the lungs using <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). This experimental cohort was expanded for WT-injected mice which were administered PST two times a day for 5 weeks (WT+PST). Mice were sacrificed 5 weeks post-injection when the first luminescence-positive chest areas were detected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>) and cleared whole lung lobes were analyzed by lattice light sheet fluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). Although no macroscopic Huh7 nodules were visible, we found a prominent reduction in the number and volume of GFP-positive KO- and WT+PST-derived metastatic nodules. Thus, both CRISPR/Cas9-based and pharmacological plectin inactivation in HCC potently inhibits metastatic load in the lungs, identifying plectin as a potential target against tumor dissemination <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<p>HCC represents a leading cause of cancer-related death, characterized by poor long-term prognosis, high postoperative recurrence, and a high rate of metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. As chemotherapy, surgical resection, radiation, and local ablation are not effective in a large group of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic strategies to target HCC. By combining comprehensive analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered HCC cell lines with (phospho)proteomics, mouse modeling as well as human patient data, we identified the plakin family member plectin as a novel HCC marker and druggable target upstream of FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/AKT signaling. Thus, our data link plectin, a cytolinker implicated in cytoskeletal tension and mechanotransduction with a major oncogenic signaling hub controlling growth and metastasis of HCC.</p>
<p>We began this work by assessing plectin expression in publicly available HCC patient datasets. Our meta-analyses revealed plectin transcript levels to be considerably elevated in HCC irrespective of etiology or gender, whereas previous findings in HCC were inconsistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Notably, we found that patients with higher <italic>PLEC</italic> mRNA levels had significantly shorter recurrence-free survival times than those with lower <italic>PLEC</italic> mRNA levels. Strikingly, <italic>PLEC</italic> expression in publicly available datasets was significantly associated with gene signatures related to „cell survival and proliferation“, „angiogenesis“, and „hypoxia“ (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>—figure supplement 3) indicating that the <italic>PLEC</italic> level was associated with more aggressive cancer traits in HCC patients. In addition, plectin expression levels were associated with TNM staging, underscoring plectińs prognostic value for HCC patient survival. Although HCC transcriptomes appears to differ from other cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, our findings are in line with higher <italic>PLEC</italic> expression in other cancer entities such as oral squamous cell carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, testicular cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, or pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, and identify plectin as a specific marker for both early and advanced stages of HCC.</p>
<p>We and others have proposed that plectin plays a central role in tumor growth and dissemination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Here, using liver-specific <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we show that plectin ablation in hepatocytes significantly reduced tumor burden in a model of DEN-induced HCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, which mimics fundamental aspects of human disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. These mice also showed decreased hepatocarcinogenesis in a powerful model of multifocal HCC formation following hydrodynamic delivery of Myc;sgTp53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. In this model, both genetic and PST-mediated pharmacological inactivation of plectin not only reduced the number of HCC tumors formed but ultimately resulted in significantly improved survival of <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> female mice. Complementing the data from both HCC models, we found that plectin inactivation resulted in the reduced tumorigenic potential of human HCC cells, as evidenced by reduced colony growth under adhesion-independent conditions or subcutaneous xenografts in immunodeficient NSG mice. While several approaches (such as genetic manipulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, PST treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> or blocking peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>) decreasing the levels of functional plectin also lead to limited xenograft growth, to our knowledge, this is the first study showing that plectin inactivation prevents tumor progression in well-established preclinical mouse models.</p>
<p>Our previous studies demonstrated that plectin inactivation abrogates physical crosstalk between actin and IF networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, leading to the redistribution of internal tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and ultimately resulting in defects in cell adhesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, plectin-dependent cytoskeletal disruption and aberrant adhesions have been previously linked to compromised migration and invasion of many non- cancerous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> as well as cancerous cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, including HCC cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In support of this concept, we report the collapse of actin and vimentin IF networks in Huh7 and SNU-475 cells with disabled plectin. Cytoskeletal disruption was accompanied by redistribution of misshapen FAs, which exerted reduced traction forces onto the underlying substrates. As anticipated, aberrant cytoarchitecture resulted in significantly slower motility of HCC cells in both 2D and 3D environments. Consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, plectin inactivation reduced metastatic outgrowth of HCC cells in the lung. Intriguingly, morphodynamic contour analysis revealed in these cells reduced capacity to form stable protrusions implicated in driving path finding and cellular locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Collectively, our data suggest that plectin is essential for spatiotemporal cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell shape stabilization, and effective transmission of traction forces, and place plectin-mediated cytoskeletal crosstalk at the center of the processes that control the metastatic cascade.</p>
<p>Plectin-mediated cytoskeletal crosstalk at FAs facilitates their essential features such as dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, adhesion strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, and mechanotransduction capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Loss of vimentin filament-FA linkage upon plectin deletion in highly migratory dermal fibroblasts was shown to uncouple the activation of FAK from actomyosin-generated tension and attenuate downstream effectors such as Src, Erk1/2, and p38<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Here we show that plectin-dependent perturbation of the cytoskeleton-FAs interplay in invasive SNU-475 HCC cells profoundly altered (phospho)proteomic signatures of cytoskeleton- and cell adhesion-annotated proteins, thereby modulating mechanosensitive integrin- associated signaling events. Importantly, our (phospho)proteomic and immunoblot analyses identified attenuated signaling along FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt axes as a consequence of plectin inactivation in both Huh7 and SNU-475 HCC cells. Plectińs control of cytoskeletal crosstalk and its interplay with pro-oncogenic signaling pathways thus emerges as a critical determinant of the initiation and progression of HCC. It is noteworthy that plectin-dependent effects on PI3K/Akt and FAK/Erk signaling were recently described for prostate cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and head and neck squamous carcinoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, indicating that these observations have broader implications beyond liver cancer.</p>
<p>Finally, we were able to translate our findings from HCC cell lines and mouse models to HCC patients. By mining data from a large human patient cohort, we found a positive correlation between plectin expression and FA-associated FAK, Erk, and PI3K/Akt pathway gene sets. However, it is conceivable that dysregulated cytoskeletal crosstalk could affect HCC through multiple mechanisms independent from FA-associated signaling. Indeed, we and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> have shown that upon plectin inactivation, liver cells acquire epithelial characteristics that promote increased intercellular cohesion and reduced migration. Further studies will be required to identify and investigate synergistic adhesion- independent effects of plectin inactivation on HCC growth and metastasis.</p>
<p>Current systemic therapies for advanced HCC rely on a combination of multikinase inhibitors (such as sorafenib) or anti-VEGF /VEGF inhibitor (such as bevacizumab) treatment with immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Multikinase inhibitors provide only moderate survival benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> due to primary resistance and the plasticity of signaling networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, and only a subset of patients benefits from addition of immunotherapy in HCC treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Therefore, the most translationally impactful finding of this work is the ability of a small organoruthenium compound PST, a high-affinity plectin ligand, to effectivelly limit hepatocarcinogenesis in Myc;sgTp53-driven HCC mouse model as well as xenografted human HCCs, leading to the dampening of HCC burden. Using PST, we further report a marked effect on metastatic HCC outgrowth in the lung along with a reduction of the migratory potential of human HCC cells in 2D and 3D settings. Most notably, our animal models show improvement in local and metastatic survival rates. Similar to other ruthenium-based metallodrugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, PST was well-tolerated by mice and human cells, suggesting good potential for clinical utilization. We and others have previously demonstrated that PST treatment closely mimics phenotypes fostered by ablation of the plectin gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Consistently, PST-mediated inhibition of plectin attenuates FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt pathways in HCC cells with efficacy comparable to CRISPR/Cas-9-engineered functional (ΔIFBD) or full (KO) knockouts. However, despite high PST target selectivity for plectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, our data do not rule out pleiotropic effects of PST in the liver and further studies will be required to investigate whether PST mode-of-action in HCC entails molecular mechanisms other than engaging prooncogenic signaling cascades.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigated the role of PLECTIN, a cytoskeletal crosslinker protein, in liver cancer formation and progression. Using the liver-specific Plectin knockout mouse model, the authors convincingly showed that PLECTIN is critical for hepatocarcinogenesis, as functional inhibition of PLECTIN suppressed tumor formation in several models. They also provided evidence to show that inhibition of PLECTIN inhibited HCC cell invasion and reduced metastatic outgrowth in the lung. Mechanistically, they suggested that PLECTIN inhibition attenuated FAK, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors generated a liver-specific Plectin knockout mouse model. By using DEN and sgP53/MYC models, the authors convincingly demonstrated an oncogenic role of PLECTIN in HCC development. plecstatin-1 (PST), as a plectin inhibitor, showed promising efficacy in inhibiting HCC growth, which provides a basis for potentially treating HCC using PST.</p>
<p>The MIR images for tracking tumor growth in animal models were compelling. The high-quality confocal images and related qualifications convincingly showed the impact of plectin functional inhibition on contractility and adhesions in HCC cells.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>My concerns have been largely addressed. The authors did a good job in addressing the questions and clarifying the inconsistent results. I have two comments:</p>
<p>(1) The current data still cannot support the conclusion that plectin inactivation attenuates HCC oncogenic potential through FAK, Erk1/2, and PI3K/Akt axis, unless they can reactivate these signaling to restore the HCC congenic potential in plectin inactivated cells. It might be more appropriate to claim that plectin inactivation suppresses FAK, Erk1/2, and PI3K/Akt oncogenic signaling.</p>
<p>(2) I think it would be beneficial to include the H&amp;E and HNF4α staining from lung tissue of mice inoculated with WT Huh7 cells indicated in the rebuttal letter.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Plectin is a cytolinker that associates with cytoskeletal and intercellular junction proteins and is essential for epithelial integrity and cell migration. Previous reports showed that PLEC regulates tumor growth and metastasis in different cancers. In this manuscript, the authors describe PLEC as a target in initiation and growth of HCC. They show that inhibiting PLEC reduced tumorigenesis in different in vitro and in vivo HCC models, including in a xenograft model, DEN model, oncogene-induced HCC model and a lung metastasis model. A drug PST had similar effects, a purported Plectin inhibitor, suggesting that PLEC inhibition could be a tumor prevention or treatment strategy. Mechanistically, the authors show that inhibiting PLEC results in a disorganized cytoskeleton, deficiency in cell migration, and changes in cancer-relevant signaling pathways. This study demonstrates the importance of understanding mechanobiology of HCC for the development of new treatment strategies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This study used a variety of in vivo models to explore the role of Plectin in HCC formation and metastasis, which extend beyond the cell line-based studies reported in prior research.</p>
<p>
(2) Blocking PLEC disrupts pathways that promote tumors and cell migration, thus preventing tumor progression.</p>
<p>
(3) Overall, the anti-cancer phenotype is promising, strengthening the important role of PLEC and related factors in tumor growth and metastasis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There is limited novel mechanistic insights as the effect of inhibiting PLEC on the cytoskeleton, cell migration and related signaling pathways have previously been reported.</p>
<p>
(2) The results associated with PST, should be interpretated with caution. Although it is reported as an inhibitor of PLECTIN, and the phenotypes and pathways affected are similar to the knock-out, additional research is needed to support whether it will be safe and specific in treating or preventing HCC.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Outla Z et al described the analysis of Plectin in HCC pathogenesis. Specifically, it was found that elevated Plectin levels in liver tumors, correlated with poor prognosis for HCC patients. Mechanistically, it showed that Plectin-dependent disruption of cytoskeletal networks leads to the attenuation of oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/AKT signals. Finally, the authors showed that Plectin inhibitor plecstatin-1 (PST) is well-tolerated and capable of overcoming therapy resistance in HCC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The studies of Plectin are not entirely novel (Pubmed: 36613521). Nevertheless, the current manuscript provides a much more detailed mechanistic study and the results have translational implications. Additional strengths include convincing cell biology data, such as Plectin regulates cytoskeletal networks, and HCC migration/invasion.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p><bold>Point-by-point responses to the reviewers' comments:</bold></p>
<p>All three reviewers found our analysis of focal adhesion-associated oncogenic pathways (Figs 3 and S3) to be inconsistent (Reviewer 1), not convincing/consistent (Reviewer 2, #2), and too variable and not well supported (Reviewer 3, #2). This was probably the basis for the eLife assessment, which stated: “However, the study is incomplete because the downstream molecular activities of PLECTIN that mediate the cancer phenotypes were not fully evaluated.” We agree with the reviewers that the degree of attenuation of the FAK, MAP/Erk, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways differs depending on the cell line used (Huh7 and SNU-475) and the mode of inactivation (CRISPR/Cas9-generated plectin KO, functional KO (∆IFBD), and organoruthenium-based inhibitor plecstatin-1). However, we do not share the reviewers' skepticism about the unconvincing nature of the data presented.</p>
<p>Several previous studies have shown that plectin inactivation invariably leads to dysregulation of cell adhesions and associated signaling pathways in various cell systems. The molecular mechanisms driving these changes are not fully understood, but the most convincingly supported scenarios are uncoupling of keratin filaments (hemidesmosomes; (Koster et al., 2004)) and vimentin filaments (focal adhesions; (Burgstaller et al., 2010; Gregor et al., 2014)) from adhesion sites in conjunction with altered actomyosin contractility (Osmanagic-Myers et al., 2015; Prechova et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020). This results in altered morphometry (Wang et al., 2020), dynamics (Gregor et al., 2014), and adhesion strength (Bonakdar et al., 2015) of adhesions. These changes are accompanied by reduced mechanotransduction capacity and attenuation of downstream signaling such as FAK, Src, Erk1/2, and p38 in dermal fibroblasts (Gregor et al., 2014); decrease in pFAK, pSrc, and pPI3K levels in prostate cancer cells (Wenta et al., 2022); increase in pErk and pSrc in keratinocytes (Osmanagic-Myers et al., 2006); decrease in pERK1/2 in HCC cells (Xu et al., 2022) and head and neck squamous carcinoma cells (Katada et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Consistent with these published findings, we show that upon plectin inactivation, the HCC cell line SNU475 exhibits aberrant cytoskeletal organization (vimentin and actin; Figs 4A-D, S4A-F), altered number, topography and morphometry of focal adhesions (Figs 4A, E-G, S4H,I), and ineffective transmission of traction forces (Fig 4H,I). Similar, although not quantified, phenotypes are present in Huh7 with inactivated plectin (data not shown). It is worth noting, that even robust cytoskeletal (e.g. #ventral stress fibers, Fig 4A,D and vimentin architecture, Fig S4A-C) and focal adhesion (%central FA, Fig 4A,E) phenotypes differ significantly between different modes of plectin inactivation and would certainly do so if compared between cell lines. These phenotypes are heterogeneous but not inconsistent. Interestingly, both SNU-475 and Huh7 plectin-inactivated cells show similar functional consequences such as prominent decrease in migration speed (Fig 5B). This suggests that while specific aspects of cytoarchitecture are differentially affected in different cell lines, the functional consequences of plectin inactivation are shared between HCC cell lines.</p>
<p>It is therefore not surprising that the activation status of downstream effectors, resulting from different degrees of cytoskeletal and focal adhesion reconfiguration, is not identical (or even comparable) between cell lines and treatment conditions. Furthermore, we compare highly epithelial (keratin- and almost no vimentin-expressing) Huh7 cells with highly dedifferentiated (low keratin- and high vimentinexpressing) SNU-475 cells, which differ significantly in their cytoskeleton, adhesions, and signaling networks. Alternative approaches to plectin inactivation are not expected to result in the same degree of dysregulation of specific signaling pathways. Effects of adaptation (CRISPR/Cas9-generated KOs and ∆IFBDs), engagement of different binding domains (CRISPR/Cas9-generated ∆IFBDs), and pleiotropic modes of action (plecstatin-1) are expected.</p>
<p>In our study, we provide the reader with an unprecedented complex comparison of adhesion-associated signaling between WT and plectin-inactivated HCC cell lines. First, we compared the proteomes of WT, KO and PST-treated WT SNU-475 cells using MS-based shotgun proteomics and phosphoproteomics (Fig 3A-C). Second, we extensively and quantitatively immunoblotted the major molecular denominators of MS-identified dysregulated pathways (such as “FAK signaling”, “ILK signaling”, and “Integrin signaling”) with the following results. Data (shown in Figs 3D and S3C) are expressed as a percentage of untreated WT, with downregulated values are highlighted in red:</p>
<table-wrap id="sa4table1">
<label>Author response table 1.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-102205-sa4-table1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>In addition, we show dysregulated expression (mostly downregulation) of focal adhesion constituents ITGβ1 and αv, talin, vinculin, and paxilin which nicely complements fewer and larger focal adhesions in plectin-inactivated HCC cells. In light of these results, we believe that our statement that “Although these alterations were not found systematically in both cell lines and conditions (reflecting thus presumably their distinct differentiation grade and plectin inactivation efficacy), collectively these data confirmed plectin-dependent adhesome remodeling together with attenuation of oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt pathways upon plectin inactivation” (see pages 8-9) is fully supported. Furthermore, in support of the results of MS-based (phospho)proteomic and immunoblot analyses we show strong correlation between plectin expression and the signatures of “Integrin pathway” (R<sup>2</sup>=0.15, p= 2x10<sup>-45</sup>), “FAK pathway” (R<sup>2</sup>=0.11, p= 2x10<sup>-34</sup>), “PI3K Akt/mTOR signaling” (R<sup>2</sup>=0.06, p= 2x10<sup>-20</sup>) or “Erk pathway” (R<sup>2</sup>=0.10, p= 6x10<sup>-30</sup>) in HCC samples from 1268 patients (Fig S7-2C and S7-3).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we show that plectin is required for proper/physiological adhesion-associated signaling pathways in HCC cells. The HCC adhesome and associated pathways are dysregulated upon plectin inactivation and we show context-dependent varying degrees of attenuation of the FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt pathways. In our view, presenting context-dependent variability in expression/activation of pathway molecular denominators is a trade-off for our intention to address this aspect of plectin inactivation in the complexity of different cell lines, tissues, and modes of inactivation. We prefer rather this complex approach to presenting “more convincing” black-and-white data assessed in a single cell line (Qi et al., 2022) or upon plectin inactivation by a single approach (compare with otherwise excellent studies such as (Xu et al., 2022) or (Buckup et al., 2021)). In fact, unlike the reviewers, we consider this complexity (and the resulting heterogeneity of the data) to be a strength rather than a weakness of our study.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors suggest that plectin controls oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt signaling in HCC cells, representing the mechanisms by which plectin promotes HCC formation and progression. However, the effect of plectin inactivation on these signaling was inconsistent in Huh7 and SNU-475 cells (Figure 3D), despite similar cell growth inhibition in both cell lines (Figure 2G). For example, pAKT and pERK were only reduced by plectin inhibition in SNU-475 cells but not in Huh7 cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that plectin inactivation yields varying degrees of attenuation of the FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt pathways depending on the cell type (Huh7 vs SNU-475 cells) and mode of plectin inactivation (CRISPR/Cas9-generated plectin KO vs functional KO (∆IFBD) vs organorutheniumbased inhibitor plecstatin-1). This context-dependent heterogeneity in the expression/activation of molecular denominators of signaling pathways reflects different degrees of cytoskeletal (e.g. #ventral stress fibers, Fig 4A,D and vimentin architecture, Fig S4A-C) and focal adhesion (e.g. %central FA, Fig 4A,E) phenotypes under different conditions. We expect, that functional consequences (such as reduced migration and anchorage-independent proliferation) arise from a combination of changes in individual pathways. The sum of often subtle changes will result in comparable effects not only on cell growth, but also on migration or transmission of traction forces. For more detailed comment, please see our response to all Reviewers on the first three pages of this letter.</p>
<p>We believe, that our data show that both pAkt and pErk are attenuated upon plectin inactivation in both Huh7 and SNU-475 cells. The following data (shown in Figs 3D and S3C) are expressed as a percentage of untreated WT, with downregulated values are highlighted in red:</p>

<p>(2) In addition, pFAK was not changed by plectin inhibition in both cells, and the ratio of pFAK/FAK was increased in both cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that pFAK/FAK levels are either comparable or slightly higher upon plectin inactivation. However, we believe that our data convincingly show that FAK expression is downregulated in both Huh7 and Snu-475 cells. In our opinion, this results in an overall attenuation of the FAK signaling (see percentage for Normalized pFAKxNormalized FAK), which is expectedly more pronounced in migratory Snu-475 cells. The following data (shown in Figs 3D and S3C) are expressed as a percentage of untreated WT, with downregulated values are highlighted in red:</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Given these results, we feel that our statement that “inhibition of plectin attenuates FAK signaling” (pages 8-9) is well supported.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Thus, it is hard to convince me that plectin promotes HCC formation and progression by regulating these signalings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Previous studies have shown that dysregulation of cell adhesions and attenuation of adhesionassociated FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt signaling has inhibitory effects on HCC formation and progression. We show that plectin is required for the proper/physiological functioning of adhesionassociated signaling pathways in selected HCC cells. The HCC adhesome and associated pathways are dysregulated upon plectin inactivation and we show context-dependent varying degrees of attenuation of the FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt pathways. We support these conclusions by providing the reader with proteomic and phosphoproteomic comparisons of adhesion-associated signaling between WT and plectin-inactivated HCC cell lines (Figs 3B,C and S3A,B). We further validate our findings by extensive and quantitative immunoblotting analysis (Figs 3D and S3C). In addition, we show a strong correlation between plectin expression and the signatures of “Integrin pathway” (R<sup>2</sup>=0.15, p= 2x10<sup>-45</sup>), “FAK pathway” (R<sup>2</sup>=0.11, p= 2x10<sup>-34</sup>), “PI3K Akt/mTOR signaling” (R<sup>2</sup>=0.06, p= 2x10<sup>-20</sup>) or “Erk pathway” (R<sup>2</sup>=0.10, p= 6x10<sup>-30</sup>) in HCC samples from 1268 patients (Fig S7E).</p>
<p>Our data and conclusions are fully consistent with previously published studies in HCC cells. For instance, even a mild decrease in FAK levels leads to a significant reduction in colony size (see effects of KD (Gnani et al., 2017) , effects of FAK inhibitor and sorafenib in xenografts (Romito et al., 2021), or effects of inhibitors in soft agars and xenografts (Wang et al., 2016)). Similar effects were observed upon partial Akt inhibition (compare with Akt inhibitors in soft agars (Cuconati et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2020)). Of course, we cannot rule out synergistic plectin-dependent effects mediated via adhesion-independent mechanisms. To identify these mechanisms and to distinguish contribution of various consequences of cytoskeletal dysregulation to phenotypes described in this manuscript would be experimentally challenging and we feel that these studies go beyond the scope of our current study.</p>
<p>As we feel that the adhesion-independent mechanisms were not sufficiently discussed in the original manuscript, we have removed the original sentence “Given the well-established oncogenic activation of these pathways in human cancer(33), our study identifies a new set of potential therapeutic targets.” (page 15) from the Discussion and added the following text: “However, it is conceivable that dysregulated cytoskeletal crosstalk could affect HCC through multiple mechanisms independent from FA-associated signaling. Indeed, we and others (Jirouskova et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2022) have shown that upon plectin inactivation, liver cells acquire epithelial characteristics that promote increased intercellular cohesion and reduced migration. Further studies will be required to identify and investigate synergistic adhesion-independent effects of plectin inactivation on HCC growth and metastasis.” (page 15). See also our response to Reviewer 2, #4 and Reviewer 3, #3 and #4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors claimed that Plectin inactivation inhibits HCC invasion and metastasis using in vitro and in vivo models. However, the results from in vivo models were not as compelling as the in vitro data. The lung colonization assay is not an ideal in vivo model for studying HCC metastasis and invasion, especially when Plectin inhibition suppresses HCC cell growth and survival. Using an orthotopic model that can metastasize into the lung or spleen could be much more convincing for an essential claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the orthotopic <italic>in vivo</italic> model would be an ideal setting to address HCC metastasis experimentally. There are several published models of HCC extrahepatic metastasis, including an orthotopic model of lung metastasis (Fan et al., 2012; Voisin et al., 2024; You et al., 2016), but to our knowledge, none of these orthotopic models are commonly used in the field. In contrast, the administration of tumor cells via the tail vein of mice is a standard, well-established approach of first choice for modelling lung metastasis in a variety of tumor types (e.g. (Hiratsuka et al., 2011; Jakab et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2020)), including HCC (Jin et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2020; Tao et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we do not believe that the use of an orthotopic model would provide a comparable advantage in terms of plectin-mediated effects on metastatic growth compared to tail vein delivery of tumor cells. Importantly, the lung colonization model used in our study allows for the injection of a defined number of HCC cells into the bloodstream, thus eliminating the effect of the primary tumor size on the number of metastasizing cells. To distinguish between effects of plectin inhibition on HCC cell growth/survival and dissemination, we carefully evaluated both the number and volume of lung metastases (Figs 6I and S6C-F). The observed reduction in the number of metastases (Figs 6I and S6D) reflects the initiation/early phase of metastasis formation, which is strongly influenced by the adhesion, migration, and invasion properties of the HCC cells and corresponds well with the phenotypes described after plectin inactivation <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figs 4H,I; 5; 6A-E; S5; and S6A,B). The reduction in the volume of metastases (Figs 6I and S6E) reflects the effects of plectin inhibition on HCC cell growth and metastatic outgrowth and corresponds well with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data shown in Figs 2G,H and S2F,G.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Also, in Figure 6H, histology images of lungs from this experiment need to be shown to understand plectin's effect on metastasis better.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful to the reviewer for bringing our attention to the lung colonization assay results presented. The description of the experiments in the text of the original manuscript was incorrect. The animals monitored by <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging (shown in Fig 6H) are the same as the mice from which cleared whole lung lobes were analyzed by lattice light sheet fluorescence microscopy (shown in Fig. 6I). The corrected description is now provided in the revised manuscript as follows: “To identify early phase of metastasis formation, we next monitored the HCC cell retention in the lungs using in vivo bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 6H). This experimental cohort was expanded for WT-injected mice which were administered PST…” (page 11).</p>
<p>Therefore, lungs from all animals shown in Fig 6H,I were CUBIC-cleared and analyzed by lattice light sheet fluorescence microscopy. As requested by Reviewer 2, Recommendation #1, we provide in the revised manuscript (Fig S6F) “whole slide scan results for all the groups” which could help to understand plectin's effect on metastasis better”. To address the reviewer's concern, we also post-processed cleared and visualized lungs for hematoxylin staining and immunolabeled them for HNF4α. A representative image is shown as a panel A in Author response image 1. Post-processing of CUBIC-cleared and immunolabeled lung lobes resulted in partial tissue destruction and some samples were lost. In addition, as the entire experimental setup was designed for the early phase of metastasis formation, only small Huh7 foci were formed (compared to the larger metastases that developed within 13 weeks after inoculation shown in the panel B). As the IHC for HNF4α provides significantly lower sensitivity compared to the immunofluorescence images provided in the manuscript, we were only able to identify a few HNF4α-positive foci. Overall, we consider our immunofluorescence images to be qualitatively and quantitatively superior to IHC sections. However, if the reviewer or the editor considers it beneficial, we are prepared to show our current data as a part of the manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) Figure 6G, it is unclear how many mice were used for this experiment. Did these mice die due to the tumor burdens in the lungs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The number of animals is given in the legend to Fig 6G (page 34; N = 14 (WT), 13 (KO)). Large Huh7 metastases were identified in the lungs of animals that could be analyzed post-mortem by IHC (see panel B in the figure above). No large metastases were found in other organs examined, such as the liver, kidney and brain. It is therefore highly likely that these mice died as a result of the tumor burden in the lungs. A similar conclusion was drawn from the results of the lung colonization model in the previous studies (Jin et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2020).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The whole paper used inhibition strategies to understand the function of plectin. However, the expression of plectin in Huh7 cells is low (Figure 1D). It might be more appropriate to overexpress plectin in this cell line or others with low plectin expression to examine the effect on HCC cell growth and migration.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For this study, we selected two model HCC cell lines – Huh7 and SNU-475. Our intention was to investigate the role of plectin in “well-differentiated” (Huh7) and “poorly differentiated” (SNU-475) HCC cells, including thus early and advanced stages of HCC development (as categorized before (Boyault et al., 2007; Yuzugullu et al., 2009a); see also our description and rationale on page 6). As anticipated, less migratory “epithelial-like” Huh7 cells are characterized by relatively high E-cadherin, low vimentin, and low plectin expression levels (Fig 1D). In contrast, migratory “mesenchymal-like” SNU-475 cells are characterized by relatively low E-cadherin, high vimentin, and high plectin expression levels (Fig 1D). Therefore, the majority of analyses were performed in both relatively low plectin-expressing Huh7 and high plectin-expressing SNU-475 cells. It is noteworthy, that inactivation of plectin had similar (although less pronounced) inhibitory effects on growth and migration in both Huh7 and SNU-475 cells.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that “It might be more appropriate to overexpress plectin in this cell line or others with low plectin expression to examine the effect on HCC cell growth and migration”. In fact, we have received similar suggestions since we started publishing our studies on plectin. There are two reasons, which preclude the successful overexpression experiments. First, there are about 14 known isoforms of plectin (Prechova et al., 2023). Although, previous studies have analyzed the phenotypic rescue potential of some plectin isoforms using transient transfection (e.g. (Burgstaller et al., 2010; Osmanagic-Myers et al., 2015; Prechova et al., 2022)), the isoform variability precludes rescue/overexpression experiments if the causative isoform is not known. Second, plectin is a giant cytoskeletal crosslinker protein of more than 4,500 amino acids with binding sites for intermediate filaments, F-actin, and microtubules. Overexpression of the approximately 500 kDa-large crosslinker invariably leads to the collapse of cytoskeletal networks in every cell type we have tested so far. See also our response to Reviewer 3, #2.</p>

<p>(1) The annotation of mouse numbers is confusing. In Figures 2A B D E F, it should be the same experiment, but the N numbers in A are 6 and 5. In E and F they are 8 and 3. Similarly, in Figure 2H, in the tumor size curve, the N values are 4,4,5,6. In the table, N values are 8,8,10,11 (the authors showed 8,7,8,7 tumors that formed in the picture).</p>

<p>We are grateful to the reviewer for bringing our attention to the inconsistency the number of animals in DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Results from two independent cohorts are presented in the manuscript. The first cohort was used for MRI screening (Fig 2A-C) and at the second screening timepoint of 44 weeks, approximately 75% of animals died during anesthesia. Therefore, the second cohort of <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> and <italic>Ple<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice was used for macroscopic confirmation and histology (Figs 2D-F and S2A). We agree with the reviewer that the original presentation of the data may be misleading; therefore, we have rephrased the sentence describing macroscopic confirmation and histology (Figs 2D-F and S2A) as follows: “Decreased tumor burden in the second cohort of <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> mice was confirmed macroscopically…” (page 7).</p>
<p>For the experiments shown in Fig 2H, mice were injected in both hind flanks. We have added this information to the figure legend along with the correct number of tumors.</p>

<p>(2) In Figure 3D and Figure S3C, the changes in most of the proteins/phosphorylation sites are not convincing/consistent. These data are not essential for the conclusion of the paper and WB is semi-quantitative. Maybe including more plots of the proteins from proteomic data could strengthen their detailed conclusions about the link between Plectin and the FAK, MAPK/Erk, PI3K/Akt pathways as shown in 3E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that plectin inactivation yields varying degrees of attenuation of the FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt pathways depending on the cell type (Huh7 vs SNU-475 cells) and mode of plectin inactivation (CRISPR/Cas9-generated plectin KO vs functional KO (∆IFBD) vs organorutheniumbased inhibitor plecstatin-1). This context-dependent heterogeneity in the expression/activation of pathway molecular denominators reflects different degrees of cytoskeletal (e.g. #ventral stress fibers, Fig 4A,D and vimentin architecture, Fig S4A-C) and focal adhesion (e.g. %central FA, Fig 4A,E) phenotypes under different conditions. See also the detailed response to all reviewers (on the first three pages of this letter) and the responses to Reviewer 1, #1 and #2, Reviewer 3, #4.</p>
<p>Our immunoblot analysis is based on NIR fluorescent secondary antibodies which were detected and quantified using an Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). This approach allows a wider linear detection range than chemiluminescence without a signal loss and is considered to provide quantitative immunoblot detection (Mathews et al., 2009; Pillai-Kastoori et al., 2020) (see also manufacturer's website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.licor.com/bio/applications/quantitative-western-blots/">https://www.licor.com/bio/applications/quantitative-western-blots/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Following the reviewer's recommendation, we have carefully reviewed our proteomic and phosphoproteomic data. There are no further MS-based data (other than those already presented in the manuscript) to support the association of plectin with the FAK, MAPK/Erk, PI3K/Akt pathways.</p>

<p>(3) Figure S7A and B, The pictures do not show any tumor, which is different from Figure 7A and B (and from the quantification in S7A lower right). Is it just because male mice were used in Figure 7 and female mice were used in Figure S7? Is there literature supporting the sex difference for the Myc-sgP53 model?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As indicated in the Figure legends and in the corresponding text in the Results section (page 12), the Fig 7A,B shows Myc;sgTp53-driven hepatocarcinogenesis in male mice, whereas Fig S7C,D shows results from the female cohort. In general, the HDTVi-induced HCC onset and progression differs considerably between individual experiments, and it is therefore crucial to compare data within an experimental cohort (as we have done for <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> and <italic>Ple<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the influence of sexual dimorphism on the results presented. The existence of sexual dimorphism in liver cancer is supported by a substantial body of evidence derived from various studies (e.g. (Bigsby and CaperellGrant, 2011; Bray et al., 2024)). To date, no reports have specifically addressed sexual dimorphism in Myc;sgTp53 HDTVI-induced liver cancer. This is likely due to the fact that the vast majority of studies using this model have only presented data for one sex. However, a study using an HDTVI-administered combination of c-MET and mutated beta-catenin oncogenes to induce HCC in mice observed elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in males when compared to females (Bernal et al., 2024). The study suggests that estrogen may have a protective effect in female mice, as ovariectomized females had AFP levels comparable to those observed in males. Our data suggest that female hormones may have a similar effect in the Myc;sgTp53 HDTVI-induced liver cancer model.</p>

<p>(4) Figure 2F, S2A, <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> mice more frequently formed larger tumors, as reflected by overall tumor size increase. The interpretation of the authors is &quot;possibly implying reduced migration or increased cohesion of plectin-depleted cells&quot;. It is quite arbitrary to make this suggestion in the absence of substantial data or literature to support this theory.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that our statement “Notably, <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> mice more frequently formed larger tumors, as reflected by overall tumor size increase (Fig. 2F; Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), possibly implying reduced migration or increased cohesion of plectin-depleted cells(25).” (page 7) is rather speculative. As we did not further address the formation of larger tumors in <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> mice further in the current study, we wanted to provide the readers with some, even speculative, hypotheses. In support of our hypothesis, we cite our own publication (#26; Jirouskova et al., J Hepatol., 2018), where we show that plectin inactivation in <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> livers results in upregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Previous studies have shown that similar increase in E-cadherin expression levels reflects mesenchymalto-epithelial transition (e.g. (Adhikary et al., 2014; Auersperg et al., 1999; Wendt et al., 2011)) and is often associated with reduced cancer cell migration/invasion. This is consistent with our finding that “migrating plectin-disabled SNU-475 cells exhibited more cohesive, epithelial-like features while progressing collectively. By contrast, WT SNU-475 leader cells were more polarized and found to migrate into scratch areas more frequently than their plectin-deficient counterparts (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Consistent with this observation, individually seeded SNU-475 cells less frequently assumed a polarized, mesenchymal-like shape upon plectin inactivation in both 2D and 3D environments (Fig. 5C). Moreover, plectin-inactivated SNU-475 cells exhibited a decrease in N-cadherin and vimentin levels when compared to WT counterparts (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C).” (page 10).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that plectin-deficient hepatocytes express higher levels of E-cadherin and hepatocyte-derived SNU-475 cells express less N-cadherin and vimentin. In addition, we show that SNU475 cells exhibited more cohesive, epithelial-like features in scratch-wound experiments. To address the reviewer's concern and to further support our statement about the increased cohesiveness of plectindeficient HCC cells we have included the citation of the recent study #27 (Xu et al., 2022). Using the MHCC97H and MHCC97L HCC cell lines, this study shows that plectin downregulation “inhibits HCC cell migration and epithelial mesenchymal transformation”, which is fully consistent with our hypothesis. To mitigate the impression of an unsubstantiated statement, we also discuss adhesion-independent plectin-mediated mechanisms in the revised Discussion section as follows: “However, it is conceivable that dysregulated cytoskeletal crosstalk could affect HCC through multiple mechanisms independent from FA-associated signaling. Indeed, we and others (Jirouskova et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2022) have shown that upon plectin inactivation, liver cells acquire epithelial characteristics that promote increased intercellular cohesion and reduced migration. Further studies will be required to identify and investigate synergistic adhesion-independent effects of plectin inactivation on HCC growth and metastasis.” (page 15).</p>

<p>(5) Mutation or KO PLEC has been shown to cause severe diseases in humans and mice, including skin blistering, muscular dystrophy, and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. Please elaborate on the potential side effects of targeting Plectin to treat HCC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, mutation or ablation of plectin has been implicated in many diseases (collectively known as plectinopathies). These multisystem disorders include an autosomal dominant form of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, aplasia cutis congenita, and an autosomal recessive form of EBS that may be associated with muscular dystrophy, pyloric atresia, and/or congenital myasthenic syndrome. Several mutations have also been associated with cardiomyopathy and malignant arrhythmias. Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis has also been reported. In genetic mouse models, loss of plectin leads to skin fragility, extensive intestinal lesions, instability of the biliary epithelium, and progressive muscle wasting (for more details see (Vahidnezhad et al., 2022)).</p>
<p>It is therefore important to evaluate potential side effects, and plectin inactivation therefore presents challenges comparable to other anti-HCC targets. For instance, Sorafenib, the most widely used chemotherapy in recent decades, targets numerous serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (RAF1, BRAF, VEGFR 1, 2, 3, PDGFR, KIT, FLT3, FGFR1, and RET) that are critical for proper non-pathological functions (Strumberg et al., 2007; Wilhelm et al., 2006; Wilhelm et al., 2004). The combinatorial therapy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab targets also PD-L1 in conjunction with VEGF, which plays an essential role in bone formation (Gerber et al., 1999), hematopoiesis (Ferrara et al., 1996), or wound healing (Chintalgattu et al., 2003). To allow readers to read a comprehensive account of the pathological consequences of plectin inactivation, we included two additional citations (Prechova et al., 2023; Vahidnezhad et al., 2022)  and rephrased Introduction section as follows: “…multiple reports have linked plectin with tumor malignancy(12) and other pathologies (Prechova et al., 2023; Vahidnezhad et al., 2022), mechanistic insights…” (page 4-5).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 3:</bold></p>
<p>(1) The rationale for using Huh7 cells in the manuscript is not well explained as it has the lowest Plectin expression levels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For this study, we selected two model HCC cell lines - Huh7 and SNU-475. Our intention was to address the role of plectin in “well-differentiated” (Huh7) and “poorly differentiated” (SNU-475) HCC cells, thus including early and advanced stages of HCC development (as categorized before (Boyault et al., 2007; Yuzugullu et al., 2009b) see also our description and reasoning on page 6). The Huh7 cell line is also a well-established and widely used model suitable for both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings (e.g. (Du et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2018; Si et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2018).</p>
<p>As anticipated, less migratory “epithelial-like” Huh7 cells are characterized by relatively high E-cadherin, low vimentin, and low plectin expression levels (Fig 1D). In contrast, migratory “mesenchymal-like” SNU475 cells are characterized by relatively low E-cadherin, high vimentin, and high plectin expression levels (Fig 1D). Therefore, the majority of analyses were performed in both relatively low plectin-expressing Huh7 and high plectin-expressing SNU-475 cells. It is noteworthy, that inactivation of plectin had similar (although less pronounced) inhibitory effects on the phenotypes in both Huh7 and SNU-475 cells. We believe that these findings highlight the importance of plectin in HCC growth and metastasis, as plectin inactivation has inhibitory effects on both early (low plectin) and advanced (high plectin) stages of HCC.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The KO cell experiments should be supplemented with overexpression experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be helpful to complement our plectin inactivation experiments by overexpressing plectin in the HCC cell lines used in this study. In fact, we have received similar suggestions since we started to publish our studies on plectin. There are two reasons, which preclude the successful overexpression experiments. First, there is about 14 known isoforms of plectin (Prechova et al., 2023). Although previous studies have analyzed the phenotypic rescue potential of some plectin isoforms using transient transfection (e.g. (Burgstaller et al., 2010; Osmanagic-Myers et al., 2015; Prechova et al., 2022)), the isoform variability precludes rescue/overexpression experiments if the causative isoform is not known. Second, plectin is a giant cytoskeletal crosslinker protein of more than 4,500 amino acids with binding sites for intermediate filaments, F-actin, and microtubules. Overexpression of the approximately 500 kDa-large crosslinker invariably leads to the collapse of cytoskeletal networks in every cell type we have tested so far. See also our response to Reviewer 1, #7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) There is significant concern that while ablation of Ple led to reduced tumor number, these mice had larger tumors. The data indicate that Plectin may have distinct roles in HCC initiation versus progression. The data are not well explained and do not fully support that Plectin promotes hepatocarcinogenesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the DEN-induced HCC model MRI screening revealed fewer tumors and also tumor volume was reduced at 32 and 44 weeks post-induction (Fig 2A-C). Larger tumors formed in <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> compared to <italic>Ple<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> livers (Figs 2F and S2A) refer only to a subset of macroscopic tumors visually identified at necropsy. Larger <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> tumors were not observed in the Myc;sgTp53 HDTVI-induced HCC model (data not shown). In contrast, plectin deficiency reduced the size of xenografts formed in NSG mice (Fig 2H), and agar colonies grown from Huh7 and SNU-475 cells with inactivated plectin were also smaller (Fig S2F). In all <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches presented in the manuscript, plectin inactivation reduced the number of colonies/xenografts/tumors. As hepatocarcinogenesis is a multistep process including initiation, promotion, and progression (Pitot, 2001), we feel confident in concluding that plectin inactivation inhibits hepatocarcinogenesis and we consider this conclusion to be fully supported by the data presented in the manuscript.</p>
<p>However, we agree with the reviewer that larger macroscopic <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> tumors in the DEN-induced HCC model are intriguing. As we do not see similar effects (or even trends) in other approaches used in this study, we cannot exclude the contribution of plectin-deficient environment in <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> livers during longterm (44 weeks) tumor formation and growth. In our previous study (Jirouskova et al., 2018), we showed that plectin deficiency in <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> livers leads to biliary tree malformations, collapse of bile ducts and ductules, and mild ductular reaction. We could speculate that <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> livers suffer from continuous bile leakage into the parenchyma, which would exacerbate all models of long-term pathology.</p>
<p>As we did not further address the formation of larger tumors in <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> mice further in the current study, we offered the reader the hypothesis that large tumors could “…possibly implying reduced migration or increased cohesion of plectin-depleted cells25.” In support of our hypothesis, we cite our own publication (#26; Jirouskova et al., J Hepatol., 2018), where we show that plectin inactivation in <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic> livers results in upregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin.

This is consistent with our finding that “migrating plectin-disabled SNU475 cells exhibited more cohesive, epithelial-like features while progressing collectively. By contrast, WT SNU-475 leader cells were more polarized and found to migrate into scratch areas more frequently than their plectin-deficient counterparts (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Consistent with this observation, individually seeded SNU-475 cells less frequently assumed a polarized, mesenchymal-like shape upon plectin inactivation in both 2D and 3D environments (Fig. 5C). Moreover, plectin-inactivated SNU-475 cells exhibited a decrease in N-cadherin and vimentin levels when compared to WT counterparts (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C).” (page 10).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that plectin-deficient hepatocytes express higher levels of E-cadherin and hepatocyte-derived SNU-475 cells less N-cadherin and vimentin. In addition, we show that SNU-475 cells exhibited more cohesive, epithelial-like features in scratch-wound experiments. To address the reviewer's concern and to further support our claim of increased cohesiveness of plectin-deficient HCC cells we included the citation of the recent study(27).

<p>(4) Figure 3 showed that Plectin does not regulate p-FAK/FAK expression. Therefore, the statement that Plectin regulates the FAK pathway is not valid. Furthermore, there are too many variables in turns of p-AKT and p-ERK expression, making the conclusion not well supported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that pFAK/FAK levels are either comparable or slightly higher upon plectin inactivation. However, we believe that our data convincingly show that FAK expression is downregulated in both Huh7 and Snu-475 cells. In our opinion, this results in an overall attenuation of the FAK signaling (see percentage for Normalized pFAKxNormalized FAK), which is expectedly more pronounced in migratory Snu-475 cells. The following data (shown in Figs 3D and S3C) are expressed as a percentage of untreated WT, with downregulated values highlighted in red:</p>

<p>Given these results, we believe that our statement that “inhibition of plectin attenuates FAK signaling” (pages 8-9) is well supported.</p>

This context-dependent heterogeneity in the expression/activation of pathway molecular denominators reflects different degrees of cytoskeletal (e.g. #ventral stress fibers, Fig 4A,D and vimentin architecture, Fig S4A-C) and focal adhesion (e.g. %central FA, Fig 4A,E) phenotypes under different conditions.

<p>(5) The studies of plecstatin-1 in HCC should be expanded to a panel of human HCC cells with various Plectin expression levels in turns of cell growth and cell migration. The IC50 values should be determined and correlate with Plectin expression.</p>

<p>Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have included graphs showing IC50 values for Huh7 (low plectin) and SNU-475 (high plectin) cells as Fig S2E.

We refer to new data in the Results section as follows: “If not stated otherwise, we applied PST in the final concentration of 8 µM, which corresponds to the 25% of IC50 for Huh7 cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E).” (page 7).

<p>(6) One of the major issues is the mechanistic studies focusing on Plectin regulating HCC migration/metastasis, whereas the in vivo mouse studies focus on HCC formation (Figures 3 and 7). These are distinct processes and should not be mixed.</p>

<p>In our study, we investigated the role of plectin in the development and dissemination of HCC. Using DEN- and Myc;sgTp53 HDTVI-induced HCC models (Figs 2A-F, S2A, 7A-C, and S7A-D), we show the effects of plectin inactivation on HCC formation <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Using an <italic>in vivo</italic> lung colonization assay (Figs 6G-I and S6C-F), we show the effects of plectin inactivation on the metastatic potential of HCC cells. In complementary <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, we show how plectin deficiency affects migration (Figs 5 and S5) and invasion (Figs 6A-E and S6A,B).</p>
<p>Our mechanistic studies show that plectin inactivation leads to dysregulation of cytoskeletal networks, adhesions, and adhesion-associated signaling. We believe that we have provided substantial experimental data suggesting that the proposed mechanisms play a role in plectin-mediated inhibition of both HCC development and dissemination. Of course, we cannot rule out additional, adhesionindependent mechanisms for HCC formation. To clarify this, we have revised the Discussion section as follows: “However, it is conceivable that dysregulated cytoskeletal crosstalk could affect HCC through multiple mechanisms independent from FA-associated signaling.

<p>We are aware that the majority of FDR corrected p-values shown in the Fig 7D are not significant.

Following a lengthy discussion, a decision was taken to include them despite the anticipation of criticism from the reviewers. The rationale for including these data is that, despite the lack of statistical significance, the findings are consistent with those of MS/immunoblot analyses of HCC cells (Figs 3 and S3) and patient data (Figs 7E, S7-2). The lack of statistical significance observed in the presented data is a consequence of the limited number of animals included in the <italic>Ple<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Ple<sup>ΔAlb</sup></italic>, and PST-treated <italic>Ple<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cohorts, which has resulted in a high degree of variability in the MS results.

</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful to the reviewer for bringing our attention to the incorrect statement. To address the reviewer's concern, we rephrased the original part of Discussion section: “Current therapies for HCC rely on multikinase inhibitors (such as sorafenib) that provide only moderate survival benefit(60,61) due to primary resistance and the plasticity of signaling networks(62)” as follows: “Current systemic therapies for advanced HCC rely on a combination of multikinase inhibitor (such as sorafenib) or anti-VEGF /VEGF inhibitor (such as bevacizumab) treatment with immunotherapy(59). Multikinase inhibitors provide only moderate survival benefit(60,61) due to primary resistance and the plasticity of signaling networks(62), and only a subset of patients benefits from addition of immunotherapy in HCC treatment(63)” (page 15).</p>
