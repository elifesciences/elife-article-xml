<title>Abstract</title><p>During heart development, a well-characterized network of transcription factors initiates cardiac gene expression and defines the precise timing and location of cardiac progenitor specification. However, our understanding of the post-initiation transcriptional events that regulate cardiac gene expression is still incomplete. The PAF1C component Rtf1 is a transcription regulatory protein that modulates pausing and elongation of RNA Pol II, as well as cotranscriptional histone modifications. Here we report that Rtf1 is essential for cardiogenesis in fish and mammals, and that in the absence of Rtf1 activity, cardiac progenitors arrest in an immature state. We found that Rtf1’s Plus3 domain, which confers interaction with the transcriptional pausing and elongation regulator Spt5, was necessary for cardiac progenitor formation. ChIP-seq analysis further revealed changes in the occupancy of RNA Pol II around the transcription start site (TSS) of cardiac genes in <italic>rtf1</italic> morphants reflecting a reduction in transcriptional pausing. Intriguingly, inhibition of pause release in <italic>rtf1</italic> morphants and mutants restored the formation of cardiac cells and improved Pol II occupancy at the TSS of key cardiac genes. Our findings highlight the crucial role that transcriptional pausing plays in promoting normal gene expression levels in a cardiac developmental context.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Embryonic heart development is directed by an evolutionarily conserved network of transcription factors. Notably, members of the GATA, NK-2 homeobox, TBX, HAND, and MEF2 transcription factor families play crucial, conserved, and well characterized roles in specifying cardiac cells from the mesoderm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Through a careful balance of positive and negative regulatory signals, the cardiac transcription regulatory network coordinates with other transcriptional networks to ensure that the appropriate number of cardiac progenitors are specified. In zebrafish, this activity partitions the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) into multiple fates including the cardiac mesoderm, which is bounded anteriorly by blood and endothelial progenitors and posteriorly by pectoral fin progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modifications provide an additional level of transcriptional control at cardiac genes by regulating the binding of transcription factors and the binding and elongation rate of RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II). For example, the BAF (Brg1/Brm-associated factor) complex, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that actively positions nucleosomes, is critical for normal vertebrate cardiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The BAF complex directly interacts with cardiac transcription factors including Tbx5, Nkx2-5, and Gata4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and controls temporal changes in chromatin accessibility during cardiac differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, transplanted cells overexpressing the BAF component Baf60c/Smarca3b and Gata5 preferentially contribute to the embryonic zebrafish heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Similarly, forced expression of Baf60c along with Tbx5/Nkx2-5/Gata4 can induce cardiac differentiation from non-cardiac mesoderm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, suggesting that nucleosomal positioning and chromatin accessibility are key mechanisms regulating the transcription of cardiac genes.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that cardiac gene expression is also highly sensitive to the activity of transcriptional pausing and elongation factors. Spt6 (Suppressor of Ty 6) is a histone chaperone that promotes RNA Polymerase II elongation and co-transcriptionally modulates chromatin structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In zebrafish, loss of function of Spt6 disrupts cardiomyocyte differentiation and interacts genetically with the transcriptional pausing/elongation factor Spt5 (Suppressor of Ty 5) to support Nkx2.5+ cardiac progenitor specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. While both Spt6 and Spt5 promote transcription elongation, they likely do so via distinct mechanisms. Spt5 directly interacts with Spt4 to form the DSIF (DRB Sensitivity Inducing Factor) complex, which has both inhibitory and stimulatory roles in transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Unphosphorylated Spt5 fosters promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Polymerase II, but phosphorylation of Spt5’s C-terminal repeat region by Cdk9 (cyclin dependent kinase 9) produces a binding site for the Polymerase Associated Factor 1 complex (PAF1C) component Rtf1, promotes transcriptional pause release, and converts DSIF into an elongation-promoting factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. How the transcription regulatory activities of these elongation and pausing factors facilitate cardiac development is not yet understood.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that Rtf1 and other PAF1C members differentially regulate cardiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The PAF1C consists of five core proteins, Paf1, Ctr9, Cdc73, Rtf1, and Leo1, and plays wide-ranging transcription regulatory roles including promoting co-transcriptional epigenetic modification of histones, supporting both pausing and elongation of RNA Polymerase II, influencing mRNA 3’ end formation, and serving as a bridge between specific transcription factors and RNA Polymerase II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In zebrafish, Leo1 is dispensable for the specification of cardiomyocytes, but is required for differentiation of the atrioventricular boundary and maturation of the cardiac chambers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Embryos lacking Ctr9, Cdc73, or Paf1, on the other hand, exhibit a deficiency of cardiomyocytes and only form small, dysmorphic hearts. Intriguingly, loss of the Rtf1 subunit of the PAF1C results in the most dramatic defects in cardiogenesis. Rtf1 deficient embryos have severe reduction in <italic>nkx2.5</italic>+ cardiac progenitors and fail to generate any cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Given the numerous roles played by the PAF1C in transcription regulation, it remains an open question how PAF1C members mechanistically regulate cardiogenesis.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of Rtf1-dependent cardiac progenitor formation. Using CRISPR mutagenesis we showed that zygotic Rtf1 mutants, like <italic>rtf1</italic> morphants, lack expression of most cardiac progenitor marker genes and produce no cardiomyocytes. In addition, knockout of Rtf1 in the cardiogenic mesoderm of mouse embryos and knockdown of Rtf1 in mouse ESCs reduced the formation of cardiac tissue, indicating that the role of Rtf1 in specification of the cardiac lineage is conserved among vertebrates. Using FACS and single cell sequencing-based approaches, we show that differentiation of the LPM into cardiac precursors requires Rtf1 activity. We investigated which of Rtf1’s functional domains participated in cardiac development and found that its Plus3 domain is critical for cardiac progenitor formation, while its HMD (Histone modification domain) is dispensable. Consistent with the Plus3 domain’s function as an interaction point between Rtf1 and the DSIF component Spt5, Rtf1 deficient embryos display a genome-wide decrease in promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Polymerase II. Excitingly, chemical and morpholino inhibition of pause release improved pausing at cardiac genes and restored cardiac progenitor formation to Rtf1-deficient embryos. Together, our findings suggest that during development, Rtf1’s primary function in cardiac gene regulation is to support promoter proximal pausing, and that normal levels of pausing facilitate expression of many genes, including key members of the cardiac transcription program.</p>

<p>Morpholino knockdown of <italic>rtf1</italic> abolishes cardiac progenitor formation in zebrafish, indicating an essential role for Rtf1 in cardiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. To genetically corroborate this finding, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate stable <italic>rtf1</italic> mutant lines. We identified two independent lines (<italic>rtf1</italic><sup>LA2678</sup> and <italic>rtf1</italic><sup>LA2679</sup>) with small deletions in exon 3 of the <italic>rtf1</italic> gene that are predicted to result in frameshifts and early stop codons and which nearly eliminate the production of Rtf1 protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A-C</xref>). Like <italic>rtf1</italic> morphants, both <italic>rtf1</italic><sup>LA2678</sup> and <italic>rtf1</italic><sup>LA2679</sup> mutants display no cardiac tissue at 24 hours post fertilization (hpf) and lack the <italic>nkx2.5</italic>+ cardiac progenitor population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B,E,F</xref>). Rtf1 deficient embryos also fail to express normal levels of other cardiac transcription factors including <italic>mef2ca</italic> and <italic>tbx5a</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C,D,G,H</xref>), and exhibit reduced expression of <italic>tbx20</italic>, a key regulator of cardiac cell number that demarcates the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM) at the 8-somite stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I,J</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Knockdown and knockout of Rtf1 activity produced comparable changes in cardiac gene expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-J</xref>), demonstrating that morpholino knockdown faithfully recapitulates the <italic>rtf1</italic> mutant phenotype. Together, these data show that Rtf1 activity is required for the expression of multiple cardiac transcription factors and suggest that the absence of cardiomyocytes in Rtf1 deficient embryos is likely a result of this dramatic gene expression defect.</p>

<title>Conserved role of Rtf1 in mammalian cardiac development</title>
<p>The sequence of the Rtf1 protein is highly conserved among vertebrates (83% identity at the amino acid level between fish and humans) indicating that it is likely playing a fundamental role in biology. To examine whether Rtf1 activity is also needed for cardiogenesis in mammals, we expressed Cre-recombinase under the control of the Mesp1 promoter in Rtf1-flox mouse embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The Mesp1 promoter drives expression of Cre in the early cardiogenic mesoderm (E6.25)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, allowing for knockout of Rtf1 activity prior to the onset of heart development. Rtf1 Mesp1-Cre knockout embryos die prior to birth, suggesting that Rtf1 function in the cardiogenic mesoderm is essential for survival. We next examined the developing hearts of Rtf1 Mesp1-Cre knockouts and their wild type siblings by in situ hybridization using <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> and <italic>Tbx20</italic> as cardiac markers and found that while Cre+;Rtf1flox/+ and Cre-embryos display a heart tube undergoing looping at E8.5, Rtf1 Mesp1-Cre knockouts have little or no expression of these markers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Cardiac muscle, marked by expression of <italic>MLC2v</italic> at E9.5, was also dramatically reduced in Mesp1-Cre Rtf1 knockouts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). These data suggest a conservation of the critical role of Rtf1 in differentiation of the cardiac lineage from the mesoderm.</p>

<p>To further investigate Rtf1’s role in cardiac differentiation, we knocked down Rtf1 activity in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) using short hairpin RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A,B</xref>). Unmanipulated embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from mESCs are capable of differentiating into lineages representing all three germ layers, as evidenced by temporally dynamic expression of <italic>Brachyury</italic> (mesoderm), <italic>Afp</italic> (endoderm), and <italic>Ncam1</italic> (ectoderm) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E-G</xref>). Similarly, we found that Rtf1 shRNA mESCs induce expression of <italic>Brachyury</italic>, <italic>Afp</italic>, and <italic>Ncam1</italic> in a temporally appropriate manner, indicating that Rtf1 activity is dispensable for germ layer formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E-G</xref>). However, EBs derived from Rtf1-deficient mESCs produced significantly fewer beating patches (∼67% reduction) and also displayed a dramatic reduction in cardiac genes like <italic>Myh6</italic>, <italic>Nkx2.5</italic>, and <italic>ANF</italic>/<italic>Nppa</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that Rtf1 is essential for differentiation of the cardiac lineage from mesoderm in mammals, and reveal a conservation of Rtf1’s function in cardiogenesis between fish and mammals.</p>

Compared to wild type control samples, the <italic>rtf1</italic> morphant LPM displayed 1420 significantly downregulated and 1185 significantly upregulated genes (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) at the 10-12 somite stage when cardiac progenitor formation is underway in the LPM (Supplementary Data File 1). We examined the most significantly differentially expressed genes and observed that many of the significantly downregulated genes, including <italic>nkx2.5</italic>, <italic>rbfox1l</italic>, <italic>atp2a2a</italic>, <italic>tnnt2a</italic>, <italic>isl2b</italic>, <italic>mef2ca</italic>, <italic>mef2cb</italic> and <italic>wnt2bb</italic>, are cardiac-lineage markers or have critical known roles in cardiac development (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>).

<p>To further analyze the deployment of the cardiac gene program during cardiac progenitor formation from the ALPM, we performed Single Cell Multiome sequencing of control and <italic>rtf1</italic> morphant embryos at the 11-12 somite stage. Clustering of control and <italic>rtf1</italic> morphant cells based on gene expression and chromatin accessibility resolved 39 cell types corresponding to expected major cell lineages (Supplementary Data File 2, Supplementary Figures 2 &amp; 3). Interestingly, while <italic>rtf1</italic> morphant cells of each cell type were present, the frequencies of cell types differed significantly between controls and <italic>rtf1</italic> morphants (Supplementary Figure 4). Notably, we also observed that while <italic>rtf1</italic> morphant cells expressing the precardiac mesoderm marker <italic>mef2cb</italic> were present, they failed to express other cardiac marker genes including <italic>ryr2b</italic> and <italic>tnni1b</italic> (Supplementary Figure 3).</p>
<p>To examine developmental trajectories within the ALPM, we reclustered ALPM cells (<italic>sema3e</italic>+/<italic>gata5</italic>+ LPM) and ALPM derivatives (putative precardiac mesoderm, endothelial precursors, rostral blood precursors) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A,B</xref>). We next calculated pseudotime trajectories based on the assumption that undifferentiated ALPM, intermediates, and more highly differentiated derivatives are present at this developmental timepoint (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). In support of this notion, we observed a gradual increase in the expression levels of cardiac markers including <italic>ttn.2</italic>, <italic>mef2cb</italic>, <italic>tnnt2a</italic>, <italic>ryr2b</italic>, and <italic>myh7bb</italic> along the ALPM-cardiac developmental trajectory in control embryos (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D,E</xref>). Interestingly, Rtf1 deficient embryos properly downregulate expression of the ALPM marker <italic>sema3e</italic>, maintain the expression of <italic>gata5</italic> in cardiac precursors, and initiate expression of the early cardiac lineage genes <italic>bmp6</italic>, <italic>ttn.2</italic>, and <italic>mef2cb</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D-G</xref>). However, loss of Rtf1 activity prevented the activation of cardiac lineage-restricted markers that are normally expressed later in the ALPM-cardiac trajectory including <italic>tnnt2a</italic>, <italic>ryr2b</italic>, and <italic>myh7bb</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D-G</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Rtf1 activity is required for gene expression changes associated with the progression of cardiac precursors into a more mature state, and that Rtf1-deficient cardiac precursors are arresting in an immature state rather than transfating to a different cell lineage.</p>

<title>Rtf1’s Plus3 functional domain is necessary for cardiac progenitor formation</title>
<p>The Rtf1 protein is a multifunctional platform for transcription regulation: it consists of several defined functional domains that mediate its interaction with other transcription regulatory proteins and serve as additional points of contact for these proteins with the transcription apparatus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.

Rtf1’s C-terminus contains the Plus3 domain, which interacts with the C-terminal repeat region of the pausing and elongation factor Spt5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, a Pol II-interaction domain that allosterically stimulates transcription elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and a PAF1C interaction domain.</p>
<p>We found that injection of <italic>rtf1</italic> mRNA with 8 silent mutations that render it morpholino resistant (Rtf1 wt) into <italic>rtf1</italic> morphant embryos was able to robustly rescue the knockdown phenotype and support normal formation of the embryonic heart tube (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). This knockdown-rescue assay provides an in vivo platform to test whether Rtf1’s HMD and Plus3 domains are required for the formation of cardiac progenitors during development. We generated expression constructs for mutant versions of Rtf1 lacking these functional domains and tested whether they could support cardiogenesis in an <italic>rtf1</italic> morphant background. Mutant FLAG-tagged Rtf1 proteins lacking the HMD or Plus3 domain were expressed at levels comparable to Rtf1 wt and properly localized to the nucleus demonstrating that the activity of these proteins was not compromised by instability or mislocalization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Interestingly, we found that Rtf1’s HMD was dispensable for its role in cardiac progenitor formation (100% of Rtf1 wt injected <italic>rtf1</italic> morphants with <italic>nkx2.5</italic> signal, n=25 vs. 100% of Rtf1 ΔHMD <italic>rtf1</italic> morphants with <italic>nkx2.5</italic> signal, n=25) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).

<title>Rtf1 deficiency disrupts promoter-proximal transcriptional pausing</title>
<p>Given the critical role of Rtf1’s Plus3 domain in cardiac progenitor formation, we hypothesized that Rtf1 deficiency may impact the transcriptional activity of RNA Pol II at cardiac genes. We then examined the occupancy of RNA Pol II by performing ChIP-seq on embryos at the 10-12 somite stage, when cardiac progenitors are arising from the lateral plate mesoderm. We compared the occupancy of Pol II between uninjected control and <italic>rtf1</italic> morphant embryos and found that Pol II was substantially diminished at the transcription start site (TSS) of many genes compared to the remainder of the gene body (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D-I</xref> and data not shown). Pausing of RNA Pol II at the TSS is a normal aspect of transcription in vertebrates and has been hypothesized to regulate both the timing and expression level of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. To quantify transcriptional pausing at each gene, we calculated the Pause Release Ratio (PRR), a ratio of Pol II occupancy in the promoter proximal region of a gene (−300 to +300) to the occupancy in the downstream region (+301 to +1301). A higher PRR indicates increased pausing of Pol II near the transcription start site (TSS), while a lower PRR signifies that a gene is in a less paused state. We found that on a global scale, pausing is diminished upon loss of Rtf1 activity during embryonic development (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A,B</xref>). Out of 6,078 genes with substantial Pol II ChIP signal that were analyzed, 5,799 displayed a significantly decreased PRR (Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate of 10%) in Rtf1-deficient embryos compared to 37 genes that displayed a significantly increased PRR (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). The median PRR in control embryos was 3.34, while 95% (5,793/6,078) of genes had a PRR of less than 3.34 in Rtf1-deficient embryos (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>), reflecting a widespread decrease in promoter proximally paused Pol II. These changes in PRR suggest that Rtf1 is critical for normal levels of pausing at transcriptionally active genes during the developmental window when cardiac progenitor cells arise from the lateral plate mesoderm.</p>

<title>Attenuation of pause release permits cardiogenesis in an Rtf1-deficient background</title>
<p>The transition between the pausing and elongation phases of transcription is regulated by PTEF-b, a complex consisting of a cyclin (T1, T2a, or T2b) and the kinase Cdk9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation of the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex, the pausing/elongation factor Spt5, and the C-terminal tail of RNA Pol II by Cdk9 promotes changes in the factors associated with RNA Pol II and triggers a switch to processive elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Pharmacological inhibition of Cdk9 with the small molecule flavopiridol can prevent or attenuate pause release, leading to genome-wide increases in pausing at most genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We explored the effects of Cdk9 inhibition on Rtf1-dependent transcription by performing ChIP-seq for RNA Pol II in flavopiridol-treated <italic>rtf1</italic> morphant embryos at the 10-12 somite stage. Flavopiridol treatment caused a small but highly significant increase in promoter-proximal pausing in an Rtf1 deficient background (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>), with 87.1% of genes with significantly altered PRR values displaying an increase in PRR in flavopiridol-treated <italic>rtf1</italic> morphants compared to untreated <italic>rtf1</italic> morphants (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Furthermore, we found that critical LPM and cardiac genes including <italic>hand2</italic>, <italic>gata5</italic>, <italic>aplnrb</italic>, <italic>bmp4</italic>, <italic>nkx2.7</italic>, and <italic>rbfox1l</italic> exhibited reduced promoter-proximal pausing in Rtf1 deficient embryos that was partially rescued by treatment with flavopiridol (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D-I</xref>).</p>
<p>If diminished promoter-proximal pausing at genes crucial for cardiogenesis is responsible for the absence of cardiac progenitor formation in Rtf1-deficient embryos, then we would predict that reducing pause release may restore cardiogenesis in an Rtf1-deficient background. We examined expression of the cardiomyocyte marker <italic>myl7</italic> in wild type, <italic>rtf1</italic> mutant, and flavopiridol-treated <italic>rtf1</italic> mutant embryos and found that partial attenuation of Cdk9 activity (5 ug/ml dosage) potently restored cardiomyocyte formation in Rtf1-deficient embryos (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8J,K</xref>). Similarly, we found that knockdown of Cdk9 by injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> also restored the formation of <italic>myl7</italic>+ cardiomyocytes in an Rtf1-deficient background (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8L,M</xref>), confirming that decreased activity of the Cdk9 kinase is responsible for rescuing the <italic>rtf1</italic> cardiac phenotype. These dramatic results suggest that the primary role of Rtf1 in cardiac progenitor formation is regulating promoter-proximal pausing of critical members of the cardiac gene program. Altogether, our data support a model in which loss of Rtf1 causes excessive pause release, a dysregulation of the cardiac transcription program, and an arrest in the developmental trajectory of cardiac progenitors prior to the formation of mature cardiomyocytes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we investigated the molecular mechanism of the PAF1C member Rtf1’s role in cardiac progenitor formation. We found that Rtf1 plays a critical and conserved role in cardiogenesis and cardiac gene expression in vertebrate and mammalian models. Zebrafish <italic>rtf1</italic> mutants and mouse Rtf1 cardiac mesoderm <italic>Rtf1</italic> conditional knockouts do not properly initiate expression of cardiac transcription factors in the LPM and fail to generate mature cardiomyocytes. Using single cell sequencing, we found that Rtf1 deficient embryos do generate immature cardiac progenitors, but that these progenitors fail to express genes associated with progression to a more mature state. Excitingly, we also showed that the Rtf1 protein can function in a modular fashion and that its Plus3 domain, a site of interaction with the pausing/elongation factor Spt5, is essential for supporting cardiac development. In line with this finding, we showed that loss of Rtf1 diminishes promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Polymerase II, and that partially restoring normal pausing by chemical inhibition of pause release can support cardiogenesis in an Rtf1-deficient background.</p>
<p>Despite having a nearly genome-wide decrease in promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Polymerase II, Rtf1-deficient embryos display many upregulated and downregulated genes. How exactly pausing regulates gene expression is not fully understood and likely involves both general and gene/locus-specific mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. By limiting the release of RNA Polymerase II into the elongation phase of transcription, pausing can restrain gene expression. This inhibitory role of pausing on transcription allows for another layer of transcription regulation and has been shown to modulate the expression of heat shock and immune stimulus-induced genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Pausing-dependent restraint of gene expression is also important for the timing of gene expression in a developmental context. Supporting this notion, Spt5 and NELF-deficient zebrafish embryos exhibit aberrant upregulation of TGFβ signaling and a resulting inhibition of hematopoiesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, the PAF1C has also been shown in mammalian cells to restrain transcription from a subset of promoters by inhibiting nearby enhancer activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, pausing also positively regulates gene expression in some contexts. At genes where nucleosome formation is favored in promoter regions, pausing of RNA Polymerase II can promote a chromatin architecture that is permissive to transcription by competing with nucleosomes for promoter occupancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. This mechanism has been suggested to support expression of the IFN-gamma pathway during zebrafish development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Pausing may also positively regulate gene expression during neural crest development. Loss of Paf1 activity disrupts neural crest differentiation, but this defect can be partially rescued by inactivation of Cdk9. Interestingly, zygotic loss of Cdk9 alone is sufficient to expand the neural crest population in zebrafish embryos, suggesting that promoter-proximal pausing promotes the neural crest gene program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent work using a rapid protein degradation system in human cell culture has shed light on the mechanisms by which the PAF1C regulates transcriptional pausing and gene expression outputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. In DLD-1 cells, acute depletion of PAF1 destabilizes the PAF1C and stimulates pause release. Loss of PAF1 also decreases chromatin recruitment of INTS11, a component of the Integrator-PP2A complex (INTAC) which interacts with PAF1C and counteracts the activity of P-TEFb. This disruption in the balance of INTAC and P-TEFb activities at transcribed genes results in hyperphosphorylation of SPT5 and likely explains the increase in pause release caused by PAF1 depletion. Similar to our finding that Rtf1-deficiency positively and negatively regulates gene expression, depletion of PAF1 resulted in both upregulation and downregulation of many genes. Intriguingly, the gene expression changes caused by PAF1 depletion correlated with the release frequency and processivity of RNA Polymerase II at a given gene, with genes exhibiting low levels of release frequency tending to display decreases in their expression level. These observations suggest that the combined regulatory functions of pausing and elongation determine the transcriptional output of PAF1C-regulated genes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study reveals that the cardiac gene program is highly sensitive to loss of promoter-proximal pausing. Future studies focused on the chromatin architecture of cardiac gene promoters and other regulatory regions, and the dynamics of pause release and elongation at cardiac genes are needed to provide a complete picture of the manner by which promoter-proximal pausing fosters their expression.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study conducts genetic analyses utilizing zebrafish, mouse, and mouse embryonic stem cell models to elucidate the role of Rtf1, a component of the PAF1 complex, in early cardiac development. By combining marker gene expression analysis, single-cell transcriptomics, ChIP-seq, and chemical inhibition, the study provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that Rtf1-mediated RNAPII (Pol2) transcriptional pausing is required for early cardiac development and that attenuation of pause release by pharmacological inhibition of Cdk9, a component of the PTEF-b complex that regulates the transition between the pausing and elongation phases of transcription, can partially restore transcriptional pausing and cardiogenesis in zebrafish rtf1 mutants. The work will be of broad interest to developmental biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript submitted by Langenbacher et al., entitled &quot; Rtf1-dependent transcriptional pausing regulates cardiogenesis&quot;, describes very interesting and highly impactful observations about the function of Rtf-1 in cardiac development. Over the last few years, the Chen lab has published novel insights into the genes involved in cardiac morphogenesis. Here, they used the mouse model, the zebrafish model, cellular assays, single cell transcription, chemical inhibition, and pathway analysis to provide a comprehensive view of Rtf1 in RNAPII (Pol2) transcription pausing during cardiac development. They also conducted knockdown-rescue experiments to dissect the functions of Rtf1 domains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The most interesting discovery is the connection between Rtf1 and CDK9 in regulating Pol2 pausing as an essential step in normal heart development. The design and execution of these experiments also demonstrate a thorough approach to revealing a previously underappreciated role of Pol2 transcription pausing in cardiac development. This study also highlights the potential amelioration of related cardiac deficiencies using small molecule inhibitors against cyclin dependent kinases, many of which are already clinically approved, while many other specific inhibitors are at various preclinical stages of development for the treatment of other human diseases. Thus, this work is impactful and highly significant.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Langenbacher at el. examine the requirement of Rtf1, a component of the PAF1C, which regulates transcriptional pausing in cardiac development. The authors first confirm their previous morphant study with newly generated rtf1 mutant alleles, which recapitulate the defects in cardiac progenitor and differentiation gene expression observed previously in morphants. They then examine the conservation of Rtf1 in mouse embryos and embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Conditional loss of Rtf1 in mesodermal lineages and depletion in murine ESCs demonstrates a failure to turn on cardiac progenitor and differentiation marker genes, supporting conservation of Rtf1 in promoting cardiac development. The authors subsequently employ bulk RNA-seq on flow-sorted hand2:GFP+ cells and multiomic single-cell RNA-seq on whole Rtf1-depleted embryos at the 10-12 stage. These experiments corroborate that genes associated with cardiac and muscle development are lost. Furthermore, the differentiation trajectories suggest that the expression of genes associated with cardiac maturation is not initiated. Structure-function analysis supports that the Plus3 domain is necessary for its function in promoting cardiac progenitor formation. ChIP-seq for RNA Pol II on 10-12 somite stage embryos suggests that Rtf1 is required for proper promoter pausing. This defect can partially be rescued through use of a pharmacological inhibitor for Cdk9, which inhibits elongation, can partially restore elongation in rtf1 mutants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Many aspects of the data are strong, which support the basic conclusions of the authors that Rtf1 is required for transcriptional pausing and has a conserved requirement in vertebrate cardiac development. Areas of strength include the genetic data supporting the conserved requirement for Rtf1 in promoting cardiac development, the complementary bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches providing some insight into the gene expression changes of the cardiac progenitors, the structure-function analysis supporting the requirement of the Plus3 domain, and the pharmacological epistasis combined with the RNA Pol II ChIP-seq, supporting the mechanism implicating Cdk9 in the Rtf1 dependent mechanism of RNA Pol II pausing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While most of the basic conclusions are supported by the data, there are a number of analyses that are confusing as to why they chose to perform the experiments the way they did and some places where the interpretations presently do not support the interpretations. One of the conclusions is that the phenotype affects the maturation of the cardiomyocytes and they are arresting in an immature state. However, this seems to be mostly derived from picking a few candidates from the single cell data in Fig. 6. If that were the case, wouldn't the expectation be to observe relatively normal expression of earlier marker genes required for specification, such as Nkx2.5 and Gata5/6? The in situ expression analysis from fish and mice (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) and bulk RNA-seq (Fig. 5) seems to suggest that there are pretty early specification and differentiation defects. While some genes associated with cardiac development are not changed, many of these are not specific to cardiomyocyte progenitors and expressed broadly throughout the ALPM. Similarly, it is not clear why a consistent set of cardiac progenitor genes (for instance mef2ca, nkx2.5, and tbx20) was analyzed for all the experiments, in particular with the single cell analysis.</p>
<p>The point of the multiomic analysis is confusing. RNA- and ATAC-seq were apparently done at the same time. Yet, the focus of the analysis that is presented is on a small part of the RNA-seq data. This data set could have been more thoroughly analyzed, particularly in light of how chromatin changes may be associated with the transcriptional pausing. This seems to be a lost opportunity. Additionally, how the single cell data is covered in Supplemental Fig. 2 and 3 is confusing. There is no indication of what the different clusters are in the Figure or the legend.</p>
<p>While the effect of Rtf1 loss on cardiomyocyte markers is certainly dramatic, it is not clear how well the mutant fish have been analyzed and how specific the effect is to this population. It is interpreted that the effects on cardiomyocytes are not due to &quot;transfating&quot; of other cell fates, yet supplemental Fig. 4 shows numerous effects on potentially adjacent cell populations. Minimally, additional data needs to be provided showing the live fish at these stages and marker analysis to support these statements. In some images, it is not clear the embryos are the same stage (one can see pigmentation in the eyes of controls that is not in the mutants/morphants), causing some concern about developmental delay in the mutants.</p>
<p>With respect to the transcriptional pausing defects in the Rtf1 deficient embryos, it is not clear from the data how this effect relates to the expression of the cardiac markers. This could have been directly analyzed with some additional sequencing, such as PRO-seq, which would provide a direct analysis of transcriptional elongation.</p>
<p>Some additional minor issues include the rationale that sequence conservation suggests an important requirement of a gene (line 137), which there are many examples this isn't the case, referencing figures panels out of order in Figs. 4, 7, and 8) as described in the text, and using the morphants for some experiments, such as the rescue, that could have been done in a blinded manner with the mutants.</p>
