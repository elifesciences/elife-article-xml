<title>Abstract</title><p>Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are essential for continuous spermatogenesis and male fertility. The underlying mechanisms of alternative splicing (AS) in mouse SSCs are still largely unclear. We demonstrated that SRSF1 is essential for gene expression and splicing in mouse SSCs. Crosslinking immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CLIP-seq) data revealed that spermatogonia-related genes (e.g., <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Id4</italic>, <italic>Setdb1, Stra8</italic>, <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic>, <italic>Bcas2</italic>, <italic>Ddx5</italic>, <italic>Srsf10</italic>, <italic>Uhrf1</italic>, and <italic>Bud31</italic>) were bound by SRSF1 in the mouse testes. Specific deletion of <italic>Srsf1</italic> in mouse germ cells impairs homing of precursor SSCs leading to male infertility. Whole-mount staining data showed the absence of germ cells in the testes of adult cKO mice, which indicates Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS) in cKO mice. The expression of spermatogonia-related genes (<italic>Gfra1</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Dnd1</italic>, <italic>Stra8</italic>, and <italic>Taf4b</italic>) was significantly reduced in the testes of conditional knockout (cKO) mice. Moreover, multiomics analysis suggests that SRSF1 may affect survival of spermatogonia by directly binding and regulating <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> expression through AS. In addition, immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) data showed that SRSF1 interacts with RNA splicing-related proteins (SART1, RBM15, and SRSF10). Collectively, our data reveal the critical role of SRSF1 in spermatogonia survival, which may provide a framework to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the posttranscriptional network underlying homing of precursor SSCs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>SCOS, also known as del Castillo syndrome or germ cell aplasia, is one of the most common causes of severe non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). SCOS is the presence of only Sertoli cells in the testicular tubules of the testes, with no germ cells present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Juul et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). It is well known that abnormal self-renewal and differentiation of SSCs leads to SCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">La and Hobbs, 2019b</xref>). In mice, gonocytes begin homing at 0 to 3 days postpartum (dpp) and then develop into SSCs at 4 to 6 dpp for continuous self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lee and Shinohara, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">McLean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tan and Wilkinson, 2020</xref>). The mechanisms regulating homing of precursor SSCs are hence crucial for forming SSC pools and establishing niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>). Spermatogonia migrate to form two distinct subtypes in mice. The first subtype develops into precursor SSCs that provide an SSC population for adult spermatogenesis, whereas the second subtype transitions directly to differentiated spermatogonia that contribute to the first round of spermatogenesis but do not self-renew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kluin and de Rooij, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Law et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, homing of precursor SSCs to establish niches is essential for SSC self-renewal and differentiation.</p>
<p>Many transcription factors (e.g., FOXO1, PLZF, POU5F1, TAF4B, CHD4, BCL6B, BRACHYURY, ETV5, ID4, LHX1, POU3F1, DMRT1, NGN3, SOHLH1, SOHLH2, SOX3, and STAT3) promote SSC self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Cafe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Song and Wilkinson, 2014</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of the posttranscriptional network underlying homing of precursor SSCs are not sufficiently clear. Previous studies have identified the key RNA-binding proteins DND1 and DDX5 in SSCs with a unique and dominant role in posttranscriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Legrand et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yamaji et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, recent studies have found that the RNA-binding proteins SRSF10, UHRF1, BUD31, and BCAS2 regulate AS in mouse spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Qin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). It is well known that testes are rich in AS events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mazin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Venables, 2002</xref>). Thus, understanding the mechanisms of AS in human reproduction can provide new insights into clinical diagnosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of how AS functions in homing of precursor SSCs are still largely unclear.</p>
<p>Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1; previously SF2/ASF) is a widely studied and important splicing factor involved in cancer progression, heart development, and thymus development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Du et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Katsuyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Katsuyama and Moulton, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lv et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Qi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Our previous work has shown that SRSF1 deficiency impairs primordial follicle formation during meiotic prophase I and leads to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sun et al., 2023b</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms by which SRSF1 regulates pre-mRNA splicing in mouse SSCs remain unknown. A mouse model with <italic>Srsf1</italic> conditional deletion can effectively address this uncertainty. This study showed that specific deletion of <italic>Srsf1</italic> in mouse germ cells leads to NOA by impairing homing of mouse precursor SSCs. We further verified that SRSF1 directly binds and regulates <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> expression via AS, which may be critical for homing of mouse precursor SSCs.</p>

<title>SRSF1 may have a vital role in posttranscriptional regulation in the testes</title>
<p>To investigate the role of SRSF1 in spermatogenesis, the dynamic localization of SRSF1 in the testis was evaluated. Fascinatingly, the results of SRSF1 and γH2AX co-staining revealed that SRSF1 was expressed during spermatogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>). RT‒qPCR and Western blotting results showed that the expression of SRSF1 fluctuated during the developmental stages of the testes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Concurrently, the results of SRSF1 and PLZF co-staining revealed that SRSF1 was highly expressed in the nuclei of spermatogonia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To further explore the function of SRSF1 in regulating SSC self-renewal and differentiation, CLIP-seq was performed in adult mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sun et al., 2023a</xref>). GO enrichment analyses of the SRSF1 peak-containing genes revealed that spermatogenesis-related genes were regulated by SRSF1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and Table S1). In combination with previous studies, we found that spermatogonia-related genes (<italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Id4</italic>, <italic>Setdb1, Stra8</italic>, <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic>, <italic>Bcas2</italic>, <italic>Ddx5</italic>, <italic>Srsf10</italic>, <italic>Uhrf1</italic>, and <italic>Bud31</italic>) were bound by SRSF1. To provide in-depth insight into the binding of spermatogonia-associated genes, the SRSF1-binding peaks of the gene transcripts were shown by using IGV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The co-staining results showed localization and expression of the spermatogonia-related protein in mouse testes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these results suggested that SRSF1 may have a vital role in posttranscriptional regulation in the testes, particularly during spermatogonium development.</p>

<title>SRSF1 deficiency leads to SCOS</title>
<p>To define the specific involvement of SRSF1 in spermatogonia, we studied the physiological roles of SRSF1 in vivo using a mouse model. Considering that global SRSF1 knockout is lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), we used a conditional allele of <italic>Srsf1</italic> (<italic>Srsf1</italic><sup>Fl</sup>) in which exons 2, 3, and 4 of <italic>Srsf1</italic> are flanked by two <italic>loxP</italic> sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). By crossing <italic>Srsf1</italic><sup>Fl</sup> and <italic>Vasa</italic>-Cre mice, we obtained <italic>Vasa</italic>-Cre <italic>Srsf1</italic><sup>Fl/del</sup> mice with <italic>Srsf1</italic> deletion in germ cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). We verified the absence of the SRSF1 protein in germ cells by co-immunofluorescence analyses with SRSF1 and PLZF antibodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Subsequently, the breeding experiment indicated that cKO mice had a standard mating capacity but that the absence of <italic>Srsf1</italic> led to complete infertility in males (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Histological examination of cKO epididymides revealed that sperm could not be found in the cauda epididymis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Considering the limitations of sectioning, the cauda epididymal sperm count further validated this conclusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). It was clear that spermatogenesis in the testes was severely impaired. Therefore, we focused our attention on the testes. The adult cKO mice were normal in size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). However, the sizes of cKO mouse testes were significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Histological examination of cKO testis sections showed that no germ cells could be visualized, and only a large number of Sertoli cells were observed in the testes of cKO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Together, these results demonstrated that SRSF1 is critical for spermatogenesis and that its absence leads to SCOS.</p>

<title>Loss of SRSF1 impairs spermatogonia survival</title>
<p>To further confirm the absence of germ cells in the testes of cKO mice, PLZF and γH2AX co-staining was performed in adult mouse testes. These data suggested that SRSF1 deficiency impaired germ cell survival (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The results of VASA and TRA98 co-staining further confirmed this phenotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Considering the limitations of sectioning, we used whole-mount immunostaining to perform a comprehensive analysis and found that germ cells were indeed absent in the testes of adult cKO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). To dynamically analyse the loss of germ cells, we collected testes from 5 dpp, 7 dpp, and 14 dpp mice. Morphological results showed that the testes of 7 dpp and 14 dpp cKO mice were much smaller than those of Ctrl mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). To determine the presence of germ cells in cKO testes, VASA staining was performed in 5 dpp, 7 dpp, and 14 dpp Ctrl and cKO testes. The results showed that germ cells were still present in cKO mice but were significantly reduced in 7 dpp and 14 dpp cKO testes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The germ cell count per tube showed a significant reduction in the number of 7 dpp and 14 dpp cKO testes, especially 14 dpp cKO testes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition, TUNEL results showed that apoptosis significantly increased in cKO testes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These data suggested that the absence of SRSF1 causes apoptosis in a large number of spermatogonia that are unable to survive.</p>

<p>To further investigate the reason for the failure of spermatogonia to survive, we observed homing of precursor SSCs in the testes of mice at 5 dpp. Interestingly, the results of VASA and SOX9 co-staining showed that partial germ cells could not complete homing in 5 dpp cKO testes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). In mice, starting at 3 dpp, cytoplasmic FOXO1 in some gonocytes begins to enter the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Goertz <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). These cells further develop into prospermatogonia, which are expected to develop into spermatogonial stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Goertz <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Thus, immunohistochemical staining for FOXO1 was performed on 5 dpp mouse testis sections (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Further, germ cell statistics of FOXO1 expression in the nucleus showed a reduced number of prospermatogonia in cKO mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). And germ cells in which FOXO1 is expressed in the nucleus similarly undergo abnormal homing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).

<title>SRSF1 is essential for gene expression in spermatogonia</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms of SRSF1 in spermatogonia, we isolated mRNA from 5 dpp cKO and Ctrl mouse testes and performed RNA-seq (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). RNA-seq and RT‒qPCR results showed a significant reduction in the expression of <italic>Srsf1</italic> in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Western blotting results showed that SRSF1 expression was significantly reduced in the testes of cKO mice at 5 dpp (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Hence, for Ctrl and cKO samples, the confidence level of the RNA-seq data was high. The volcano map and cluster heatmap showed 715 downregulated and 258 upregulated genes identified by RNA-seq data in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, 7D and Table S2).

<title>SRSF1 directly binds and regulates the expression and AS of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic></title>
<p>Multiomics analyses were carried out in a subsequent study to identify the molecular mechanisms by which SRSF1 regulates spermatogonia survival. Considering that the CLIP-seq data were obtained from adult mouse testis, the set of genes bound by CLIP-seq was restricted to those expressed only in the 5 dpp mouse testis RNA-seq data. we found that 3543 of the 4824 genes bound by SRSF1 were expressed in testes at 5 dpp. Venn diagram data revealed that nine out of 715 down-regulated genes were bound by SRSF1 and underwent abnormal AS (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). And one out of 258 upregulated genes was bound by SRSF1 and underwent abnormal AS (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that 39 stabilized genes were bound by SRSF1 and underwent abnormal AS (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). The AS genes were subsequently investigated in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes using transcriptomic analyses. RNA-seq analyses showed that 162 AS events were significantly affected (FDR&lt;0.05) in cKO mouse testes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref> and Table S3). Most of the 133 affected AS events (162) were classified as skipped exons (SEs), with ten AS events categorized as retained introns (RIs), thirteen as mutually exclusive exons (MXEs), four as alternative 5’ splice sites (A5SSs), and two as alternative 3’ splice sites (A3SSs) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Additionally, the overall analysis of aberrant AS events showed that SRSF1 effectively promotes the occurrence of SE and MXE events and inhibits the occurrence of RI events. (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Then, GO enrichment analyses of AS genes revealed that four genes concerning germ cell development were altered in AS forms (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). It has been shown that <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> affects the survival of primordial germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Beck et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> is one of 39 stabilizing genes that are bound by SRSF1 and undergo abnormal AS. Thus, multiomics analyses suggested that <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> were posttranscriptionally regulated by SRSF1. Next, we investigated the mechanism by which SRSF1 regulates the AS of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic>, RT–PCR results showed that the pre-mRNA of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes exhibited abnormal AS (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). We then visualized the different types of AS based on RNA-seq data by using IGV (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>). The results of RIP–qPCR showed that SRSF1 could bind to the pre-mRNA of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G</xref>). Interestingly, RNA-seq analyses showed that the FPKM of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> was stabilized in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref>). RT‒qPCR results showed that <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> transcript levels were not inhibited (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8I</xref>). However, Western blotting showed that expression levels of TIAL1/TIAR isoform X2 were significantly suppressed (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8J</xref>). In summary, the data indicate that SRSF1 is required for TIAL1/TIAR expression and splicing in spermatogonia survival.</p>

<title>SRSF1 recruits AS-related proteins to modulate AS in testes</title>
<p>To identify the interacting proteins for which SRSF1 exerts its AS role, we performed MS analyses of IP samples from 5 dpp mouse testis extracts. The silver-stained gel of SRSF1 and normal IgG showed several SRSF1-interacting proteins from 5 dpp mouse testis extracts (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). The IP results indicated that SRSF1 was able to effectively IP the testis extracts of 5 dpp mice (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>). IP-MS data demonstrated the efficient enrichment of SRSF1 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref> and Table S4). These data showed that the two samples were highly reproducible, especially for SRSF1 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>). Then, GO enrichment analyses of the IP proteins revealed that AS-related proteins could interact with SRSF1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). A circular heatmap showed that SRSF1 could interact with AS-related proteins (e.g., SRSF10, SART1, RBM15, SRRM2, SF3B6, and SF3A2) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref>). The Co-IP results indicated that FLAG-SRSF1 interacted with HA-SART1, HA-RBM15 and HA-SRSF10 in 293T cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9G</xref>). In addition, the fluorescence results showed complete co-localization of mCherry-SRSF1 with eGFP-SART1, eGFP-RBM15 and eGFP-SRSF10 in 293T cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9H</xref>). Co-IP suggested that the RRM1 domain of SRSF1 interacted with both HA-TRA2B and HA-U2AF2 in 293T cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9I</xref>).

<p>Disturbed spermatogenesis can cause SCOS and ultimately male sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Jiao et al., 2021</xref>).

Mouse models are still of great significance and reference for human SCOS studies, and they will provide a better understanding of how SCOS occurs and develops over time. Interestingly, our mouse model had SCOS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-I</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The absence of germ cells represents classical SCOS in adult mouse testes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). In addition, we found abnormal expression of spermatogonia-related genes (<italic>Gfra1</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Plzf</italic>, <italic>Dnd1</italic>, <italic>Stra8</italic>, and <italic>Taf4b</italic>) in cKO mouse testes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F-H</xref>). These differentially expressed genes regulate SSC self-renewal and differentiation in mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">La and Hobbs, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tan and Wilkinson, 2020</xref>). Thus, this provided an opportunity for us to better study the underlying molecular mechanisms. These data indicate that SRSF1 deficiency impairs spermatogonia survival, leading to SCOS in male mice.</p>

<title>The formation of SSC pools and the establishment of niches are essential for spermatogenesis</title>
<p>The earliest event in the development of the SSC population is the migration of prospermatogonia from the centre of seminiferous cords where they have resided since sex determination of the embryonic gonad to the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>). In mice, this process is also known as homing of precursor SSCs, which occurs in the first 3 dpp and then develops into SSCs at 4 to 6 dpp for continuous self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lee and Shinohara, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">McLean <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tan and Wilkinson, 2020</xref>). Therefore, homing analysis of precursor SSCs was performed in 5 dpp cKO mouse testes. Interestingly, the VASA and SOX9 co-staining results demonstrated that partial germ cells could not complete homing in 5 dpp cKO testes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). Further, immunohistochemical staining for FOXO1 and statistical results indicated that germ cells in which FOXO1 is expressed in the nucleus similarly undergo abnormal homing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-E</xref>). Germ cells that do not migrate to the basement membrane are unable to form SSC pools and establish niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">McLean <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). These SSCs that lose their ecological niche will cease to exist. In our data, TUNEL results showed that apoptosis significantly increased in 7 dpp cKO mouse testes. At once, the germ cell count per tube showed a significant reduction in 7 dpp and 14 dpp cKO testes, especially 14 dpp cKO testes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). In conclusion, SRSF1 is crucial for the formation of SSC pools and the establishment of niches through homing of precursor SSCs.</p>

UHRF1 interacts with snRNAs and regulates AS of <italic>Tle3</italic> in mouse SSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Mettl3-mediated m6A regulates AS of <italic>Sohlh1</italic> and <italic>Dazl</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). We found that SRSF1 acts as an alternative RNA splicing regulator and directly interacts with <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> transcripts to regulate splicing events in spermatogonia (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E-G</xref>). Additionally, expression levels of TIAL1/TIAR isoform X2 were significantly suppressed (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8J</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> transcript levels were not inhibited (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8H</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8I</xref>). These results suggested that SRSF1 explicitly regulates the expression of <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> via AS. Studies have reported that TIAL1/TIAR is essential for primordial germ cell development in mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Beck <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). <italic>Tial1/Tiar</italic> deletion impairs spermatogonia survival leading to SCOS, consistent with our phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-I</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>-C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Beck <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Taken together, SRSF1 may affect spermatogonia survival by directly binding and regulating <italic>Tial1</italic>/<italic>Tiar</italic> expression through AS.</p>
<p>We found that SRSF1 could interact with AS-related proteins (e.g., SRSF10, SART1, RBM15, SRRM2, SF3B6, and SF3A2) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref>). A recent study reported that SRSF10 deficiency impaired spermatogonia differentiation but did not affect homing of precursor SSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). However, our data showed that SRSF1 is essential for homing of mouse precursor SSCs. Therefore, this suggests that SRSF1 has a specific function in the homing of precursor SSCs that are not bound by SRSF10.</p>

<title>SRSF1-mediated posttranscriptional regulation during homing of precursor SSCs provides new insights into the treatment of human reproductive diseases</title>
<p>Aberrant homing of precursor SSCs often lead to gametogenic failure or produce aneuploid gametes, resulting in subfertility or infertility, miscarriage, or congenital disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Jiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">La and Hobbs, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Song and Wilkinson, 2014</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in humans and corresponding knockout/mutated mice have been extensively researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Jiao <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). However, AS-related posttranscriptional regulation during meiosis has not been well studied. In recent years, there have been reports that the RNA-binding proteins SRSF10, UHRF1, BUD31, and BCAS2 regulate AS in mouse SSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Qin <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). This study used a multiomics approach to perform in-depth analyses of SRSF1-mediated posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms to enrich the field. It also provides new ideas and insights for clinical diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>In summary, this study demonstrates that SRSF1 plays a critical role in posttranscriptional regulation to implement homing of precursor SSCs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9K</xref>). Thus, the posttranscriptional regulation of SRSF1- mediated splicing is resolved during the formation of SSC pools and the establishment of niches.</p>

<title>Immunostaining and histological analyses</title>
<p>Mouse testes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, P6148-500G, Sigma–Aldrich) in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4°C overnight, dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, vitrified with xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Testis sections were cut at a 5-μm thickness for immunostaining and histologic analyses. For histological analyses, sections were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated in a graded ethanol solution, and stained with haematoxylin-eosin. After sealing the slides with neutral resin, a Ventana DP200 system was used for imaging. For immunofluorescence analyses, antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving the sections with sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). After blocking with 10% normal goat serum at room temperature for 1 hour, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (Table S6) in 5% normal goat serum overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies (Table S6) at room temperature in the dark for 1 hour. The slides were mounted in an antifade mounting medium with DAPI (P0131, Beyotime). Photographs were taken with a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope and a Zeiss OPTOME fluorescence microscope. For immunohistochemistry analyses, antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving the sections with sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). 5 dpp testis sections were prepared as described in the instructions for Immunohistochemistry Kit (PV-9001, ZSGB-BIO).

<title>RT–PCR and RT–qPCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted by using RNAiso Plus (9109, Takara), and the concentration was measured with a Nano-300 ultramicro spectrophotometer (Allsheng). cDNA was obtained according to the instructions of a TIANScript II RT kit (KR107, TIANGEN). The expression of transcripts of the target gene was measured by using a LightCycle® 96 instrument (Roche) with Hieff UNICON SYBR green master mix (11198ES08, Yeasen). AS analyses were performed on a RePure-A PCR instrument (BIO-GENER). Primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Table S5). The expression level of <italic>Gapdh</italic> or <italic>Actb</italic> was used as the control, and this value was set as 1.

<title>RNA-seq</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from mouse testes according to the above protocol at 5 dpp. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. After fragmentation, we established a transcriptome sequencing library and assessed library quality on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using a TruSeq PE Cluster kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq platform, and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. After quality control, all downstream analyses were performed on clean, high-quality data. The reference genome index was built, and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using HISAT2 software (version 2.0.5). FeatureCounts (version 1.5.0) counted the reads mapped to each gene. Then, the fragments per kilobase million (FPKM) value of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and the read count mapped to this gene. Differential expression analyses of cKO/Ctrl mouse testes (three biological replicates per condition) were performed using the DESeq2 R package (version 1.20.0). Genes with a padj ≤ 0.05 identified by DESeq2 were considered differentially expressed.</p>

<title>AS analyses</title>
<p>rMATS software (version 3.2.5) was used to analyse the AS events in cKO mouse germ cells based on RNA-seq data. Five types of AS events (SE, RI, MXE, A5SS, and A3SS) were revealed by rMATS software. Our threshold for screening differentially significant AS events was a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. Splicing events with an FDR less than 0.05 and an inclusion-level difference with a significance of at least 5% (0.05) were considered statistically significant. Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV, 2.16.0) software was used to visualize and confirm AS events based on RNA-seq data.</p>

<p>In this <bold>valuable</bold> study, the authors characterize the role of splicing factor SRSF1 during spermatogenesis with a conditional knockout for Srsf1 in male mouse germ cells. The requirement of SRSF1 for maturation of postnatal gonocytes into spermatogonia, and the molecular role of SRSF1 in regulating alternative splicing in juvenile testes are <bold>convincingly</bold> supported. The paper also provides strong evidence that the mRNA encoding Tial, a factor relevant for spermatogonial maintenance and male fertility, is alternatively spliced in testis and that this splicing is regulated by SRSF1. The work will be of interest to reproductive biologists and stem cell biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, the authors seek to characterize the role of splicing factor SRSF1. Using a conditional deletion of Srsf1 in germ cells, they find that SRSF1 is required for male fertility. Via immunostaining and RNA-seq analysis of the Srsf1 conditional knockout (cKO) testes, combined with SRSF1 CLIP-seq and IP-MS data from the testis, they conclude that Srsf1 is required for homing of precursor spermatogonial stem cells (SCCs) due to alternative splicing of Tial1. They further show that spermatogonia-related genes (Plzf, Id4, Setdb1, Stra8, Tial1/Tiar, Bcas2, Ddx5, Srsf10, Uhrf1, and Bud31) were bound by SRSF1 in the mouse testes by CLIP-seq. They show that SRSF1 coordinates with other RNA splicing-related proteins to directly bind and regulate the expression of several spermatogonia-related genes, including Tial1/Tiar, via alternative splicing Ultimately, the study shows that SRSF1's effects on alternative splicing are required to establish spermatogenesis. In the absence of Srsf1, the postnatal gonocytes do not properly mature into spermatogonia and consequently never initiate spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study shows a role of SRSF1-mediated alternative splicing in establishment and survival of precursor SSCs, which may provide a framework to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the posttranscriptional network underlying the formation of SSC pools. The histological analysis of the Srsf1 cKO traces the origins of the fertility defect to the postnatal testis, and the authors have generated interesting CLIP-seq, IP-MS, and RNA-seq datasets characterizing SRSF1's RNA targets and interacting proteins specifically in the testis. Together, this study provides detailed phenotyping of the Srsf1 cKO, which convincingly supports the Sertoli Cell Only phenotype, establishes the timing of the first appearance of the spermatogonial defect, and provides new insight into the role of splicing factors and SRSF1 specifically in spermatogenesis. The experiments are well-designed and conducted, the overall methods and results are robust and convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
This study does not provide a full mechanistic explanation connecting altered splicing with defects in SSC precursors. The claim that altered splicing of the Tial1 transcript mediates the effect of SRSF1 loss is not convincingly supported. In addition, some regions of the text suggest that misregulated splicing of Tial1 disrupts spermatogonial survival; while Tial1 is required for primordial germ cell survival in embryonic gonads (E11.5-13.5; Beck et al 1998), it is unclear if Tial1 is required for germline development beyond this embryonic stage.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects need to be corrected.</p>
<p>1. Line 99. The title is not suitable for summarizing this part of the results. In this paragraph, the results mainly describe SRSF1 expression pattern and binding of spermatogonia-associated gene's transcripts in testes. There is no functional assay to conclude SRSF1 has an essential role in mouse testes. The data only indicate that SRSF1 may have a vital role in posttranscriptional regulation in the testes.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the professional comments and suggestions. Following this advice, we performed co-transfection and co-IP to verify the protein-protein interactions in 293T cells, the results showed that the RRM1 domain of SRSF1 interacted with SART1, RBM15 and SRSF10 in 293T cells. In addition, the fluorescence results showed complete co-localization of mCherry-SRSF1 with eGFP-SART1, eGFP-RBM15 and eGFP-SRSF10 in 293T cells. Therefore, we have incorporated the data into the Figure 9G-J. Meanwhile, these have been incorporated into the text, given descriptions, and highlighted (Page 17, Lines 338-347).</p>

<p>Major</p>
<p>1. I find the use of &quot;SSC homing&quot; misleading/confusing because this &quot;homing&quot; or relocation of postnatal gonocytes/nascent spermatogonia to the basement membrane precedes the maturation of the nascent spermatogonia into SSCs. In addition, &quot;SSC homing&quot; is commonly used in the SSC transplantation field to describe a transplanted SSC's ability to find and colonize its niche within the seminiferous tubules. I appreciate that &quot;postnatal gonocytes/nascent spermatogonia homing&quot; is not easily grasped by a broader audience. Perhaps &quot;homing of precursor SSCs&quot; is more appropriate.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the helpful comments and suggestions. Following this advice, we have corrected the text in this revised version (Line 1-2, 39, 44, 49, 54-55, 68, 70, 72-73, 77, 84, 93-95, 191, 201, 240, 384-387, 397, 417-422, and 433)</p>

<p>1. If I am misunderstanding the description of the Srsf1 cKO phenotype, and the authors truly believe SSCs have formed in the Srsf1 cKO testis, I strongly recommend immunostaining to show that the cKO germ cells robustly express SSC markers, not just markers of undifferentiated spermatogonia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the professional suggestions. We fully agree with the reviewer. Immunohistochemical staining for FOXO1 and statistical results indicated a reduced number of prospermatogonia (Figure 6C-E). So, we have corrected the text in this revised version (Line 1-2, 39, 44, 49, 54-55, 68, 70, 72-73, 77, 84, 93-95, 191, 201, 240, 384-387, 397, 417-422, and 433).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. If the authors have the available resources, the significance of this report would be enhanced by additional characterization of the cKO phenotype at the transition from gonocyte to nascent spermatogonia. Do any cKO germ cells exhibit defects in maturing from gonocytes to nascent spermatogonia at the molecular level? I.e., by P5-7, do all cKO germ cells express PLZF and localize FOXO1 to cytoplasm, as expected of nascent spermatogonia? If the cKO germ cells are actually a heterogenous population of gonocytes and nascent spermatogonia, what is the distribution of each subpopulation in the lumen vs basement membrane?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the professional suggestions. Following this advice, immunohistochemical staining for FOXO1 was performed on 5 dpp mouse testis sections (Figure 6C). Further, germ cell statistics of FOXO1 expression in the nucleus showed a reduced number of prospermatogonia in cKO mice (Figure 6D). And germ cells in which FOXO1 is expressed in the nucleus similarly undergo abnormal homing (Figure 6E). Thus, all the above data indicated that SRSF1 has an essential role in the homing of precursor SSCs. we have incorporated the data into the Figure 6C-E. Meanwhile, these have been incorporated into the text, given descriptions, and highlighted (Page 9, Lines 191-201; Page 20, Lines 389-391).</p>

<p>1. Could the authors clarify why Tial1 exon exclusion in the cKO results in reduced protein expression? Is it creating a transcript isoform that undergoes nonsense-mediated decay?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the professional suggestions. Following this advice, we analyzed Tial1 transcripts again, and we found that Tial1 exon exclusion resulted in reduced expression of protein isoform X2 (Figure 8J). Since this region is not in the CDS, no clear evidence of nonsense-mediated decay was found in the analysis.</p>

I would refrain from using IGV visualization as the basis for the differential abundance of a transcript.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the helpful comments and suggestions. Tial1/Tiar is one of 39 stabilizing genes that are bound by SRSF1 and undergo abnormal AS.

<p>Suggestions for improving the data and analysis</p>
<p>1. The claim that TIAL1 mediates SRSF1 effects is not well supported; this claim should be adjusted or additional supporting data should be provided. To support a claim that alternative splicing of Tial1 mediates the effects of SRSF1, at least two additional pieces of data are needed: first, a demonstration that the two alternative protein isoforms have different molecular functions, either in vitro or in vivo; and second, a better quantitation of the levels and ratios of expression of the two different isoforms in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the helpful comments and suggestions. Following this advice,
we quantified the expression levels and ratios of two different isoforms in vivo, and we found that Tial1 exon exclusion resulted in reduced expression of protein isoform X2 (Figure 8J). However, it is not possible to prove that the two alternative protein isoforms have different molecular functions. So, this claim has been adjusted in the text. these have been incorporated into the text, given descriptions, and highlighted (Lines 1-2, 43-45, 95, 306, 323-325, 408, 413-414).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Likewise, the claim that &quot;SRSF1 is required for &quot;homing and self-renewal&quot; of SSCs should be adjusted or better supported. As of now, the data supports a claim that SRSF1 is required for the establishment of the SSC population in the testis after birth. This could be due to defects in homing, self-renewal, or survival. To support claims about homing and self-renewal, these phenotypes should be tested more directly, for example by quantitating numbers of spermatogonia at the basal membrane in juvenile testes (homing) and expression of SSC markers in addition to the pan-germ cell marker VASA across early postnatal time points.</p>

<p>Major comments</p>
<p>1. In Fig 1D, it appears that SRSF1 is expressed most strongly in spermatogonia by immunofluorescence, but this is inconsistent with the sharp rise in expression detected by RT-qPCR at 20 days post partum (dpp) (Fig. 1B), which is when round spermatids are first added; this discrepancy should be explained or addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the important comments from the reviewer. In another of our studies, we showed that SRSF1 expression is higher in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids (Sun et al., 2023). So, it is normal for the sharp rise in expression detected by RT-qPCR at 20 days post partum (dpp).</p>

<p>1. It is important to provide a more comprehensive basic description of the CLIP-seq datasets beyond what is shown in the tracks shown in Fig. 2B. This would allow a better assessment of the data quality and would also provide information about the transcriptome-wide patterns of SRSF1 binding. No information or quality metrics are provided about the libraries, and it is not stated how replicates are handled to maximize the robustness of the analysis. The distribution of peaks across exons, introns, and other genomic elements should also be shown.</p>

<p>1. The claim that SRSF1 is required for &quot;homing and self-renewal&quot; of SSCs is made in multiple places in the manuscript. However, neither homing nor self-renewal is ever directly tested. A single image is shown in Fig. 5E of a spermatogonium at 5dpp that does not appropriately sit on the basal membrane, potentially indicating a homing defect, but this is not quantified or followed up. There is good evidence for depletion of spermatogonia starting at 7 dpp, but no further explanation of how homing and/or self-renewal fit into the phenotype.</p>

<p>1. In Fig. 6A (lines 258-260) very few genes downregulated in the cKO are bound by SRSF1 and undergo abnormal splicing. The small handful that falls into this overlap could simply be noise. A much larger fraction of differentially spliced genes are CLIP-seq targets (~33%), which is potentially interesting, but this set of genes is not explored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the helpful comments. Following this advice, this was specifically indicated by the fact that 39 stabilizing genes were bound by SRSF1 and underwent abnormal AS. In our study, Tial1/Tiar is one of 39 stabilizing genes that are bound by SRSF1 and undergo abnormal AS. Therefore, we fully agree with the reviewers' comments. These have been added in this revised version (Page 14, Lines 279-280; Page 15, Lines 296-300).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The background gene set for Gene Ontology analyses is not specified. If these were done with the whole transcriptome as background, one would expect enrichment of spermatogenesis genes simply because they are expressed in testes. The more appropriate set of genes to use as background in these analyses is the total set of genes that are expressed in testis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the professional comments and suggestions. All expressed genes (TPM sum of all samples &gt;=1) are listed background for GO enrichment analyses.

<p>1. In general, the model is over-claimed: aside from interactions by IP-MS, little is demonstrated in this study about how SRSF1 affects alternative splicing in spermatogenesis, or how alternative splicing of TIAL1 specifically would result in the phenotype shown. It is not clear why Tial1/Tiar is selected as a candidate mediator of SRSF1 function from among the nine genes that are downregulated in the cKO, are bound by SRSF1, and undergo abnormal splicing. Although TIAL1 levels are reduced in cKO testes by Western blot (Fig. 7J), this could be due just be due to a depletion of germ cells from whole testis. The reported splicing difference for Tial1 seems very subtle and the ratio of isoforms does not look different in the Western blot image.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for the helpful comments and suggestions. In our study, Tial1/Tiar is one of 39 stabilizing genes that are bound by SRSF1 and undergo abnormal AS. However, Western blotting showed that expression levels of TIAL1/TIAR isoform X2 were significantly suppressed (Figure 8J). So, the data indicate that SRSF1 is required for TIAL1/TIAR expression and splicing.</p>
