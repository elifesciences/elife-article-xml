<title>Abstract</title><p>Transition metals, such as iron and zinc, are indispensable trace elements for eukaryotic life, acting as co-factors in essential processes ranging from respiration and metabolism to DNA replication. These metals can be transported into cells by an evolutionary-conserved family of metal transporters; however, how the ubiquitous mammalian parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> acquires essential metals has been unknown. Here, we have identified and characterised the first iron and zinc importer in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. This transporter, named ZFT, localised to the parasite plasma membrane and is essential for the parasite’s life cycle. We find ZFT is regulated by iron availability and overexpression sensitises cells to excess iron and zinc. Using a conditional knockdown system, we find that knockdown of ZFT leads to reduction in mitochondrial respiration and a switch to a more quiescent lifecycle stage. To confirm transport activity, we find that knockdown of ZFT leads to a reduction is parasite-associated zinc and iron, and ZFT expression complements loss of zinc transporter activity in a yeast model. Overall, we have identified the first metal uptake transporter in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and demonstrated the importance of iron and zinc to the parasite. This finding advances our understanding how this obligate intracellular parasite acquires nutrients from its host.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Iron, and other transition metals such as zinc, manganese and copper, are essential nutrients for almost all life, playing vital roles in biological processes including DNA replication, translation, cellular respiration and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Teh et al., 2024</xref>). As metals cannot diffuse across membranes, organisms have developed a range of strategies to take up metals, e.g. through endocytosis of iron-bound transferrin by mammalian cells, or siderophore uptake systems in bacteria. However, iron and other transition metals can catalyse reactive oxygen species, and so intracellular levels are tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Galaris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Imlay et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite which chronically infects around 30% of the world’s population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bisetegn et al., 2023</xref>). Although typically asymptomatic, Toxoplasmosis can be dangerous in immunocompromised individuals and to the developing foetus, resulting in severe congenital defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Desmonts and Couvreur, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wong and Remington, 1994</xref>). Unusually among the Apicomplexa, <italic>T. gondii</italic> is promiscuous, capable of infecting all nucleated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tenter et al., 2000</xref>) and all warm-blooded species, causing significant losses in sheep and goats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stelzer et al., 2019</xref>). Iron is essential for the parasite where it is used in essential cellular processes, including haem biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bergmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kloehn et al., 2021</xref>) and iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Aw et al., 2021</xref>) and depletion of iron using chelators restricts parasite replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aghabi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ferrer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mahmoud, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Raventos-Suarez et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>). Beyond iron, the role of other transition metals in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> biology is less well understood. It is predicted at least 800 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> proteins require zinc, several of which have already been shown to be essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gissot et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Semenovskaya et al., 2020</xref>) and loss of zinc storage leads to mild parasite defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chasen et al., 2019</xref>). However, the transport pathways, use of zinc and effects of zinc depletion have not been investigated. Further, although both iron and zinc are essential for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, the mechanisms of their uptake in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> have not yet been established.</p>
<p>The ZIP (Zrt-/Irt-like protein)-domain containing proteins represent a large, highly conserved family of metal transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Guerinot, 2000</xref>). ZIP-domain proteins mediate both iron and zinc uptake and intracellular trafficking in mammalian, plant and fungal cells. ZIP-domain containing proteins have also been utilised in eukaryotic parasites; a <italic>Leishmania</italic> ZIP-domain containing protein was identified as the major iron importer and was essential for intracellular replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huynh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jacques et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Plasmodium,</italic> the plasma membrane-localised ZIP-domain containing protein ZIPCO was shown to be essential only in the liver stage of the parasite and was identified as a potential iron and zinc transporter based on partial rescue of a growth phenotype with iron and zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sahu et al., 2014</xref>). In the blood stages, iron appears to be transported from the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> food vacuole to the cytosol by DMT1, where it could be utilised by the apicoplast and mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Loveridge and Sigala, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhong and Zhou, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> encodes four predicted ZIP-domain containing proteins: TGME49_261720, TGME49_254080, TGME49_500163 and TGME49_225530, none of which have been previously characterised. Our previous work identified that TGME49_261720 mRNA was stabilised under low iron by the presence of a stem-loop structure in the 3’ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>). Loss of this regulation inhibited parasite survival under low iron, however the function of the protein was not investigated. Here, we characterise TGME49_261720, named <bold>Z</bold>n and <bold>F</bold>e <bold>T</bold>ransporter (ZFT), in detail. We find ZFT localisation and abundance is dynamic and dependent on parasite replication, vacuolar stage and iron availability. ZFT is essential for the parasite’s lytic lifecycle and knockdown leads to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, changes to apicoplast biogenesis and initiation of stage conversion. Unlike in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, ZFT knockdown cannot be rescued by addition of exogenous metals. By quantifying parasite-associated metals, we show ZFT knockdown parasites have significantly less iron and zinc, and expression of ZFT rescues zinc uptake in mutant yeast. These data strongly support the role of ZFT as the major iron and zinc transporter in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>.</p>

<title>Iron transport in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic></title>
<p>We examined the genome of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and identified four genes encoding predicted ZIP-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Amos et al., 2022</xref>). Of these, both TGME49_254080 and TGME49_500163 were predicted to contain insufficient transmembrane domains (6 and 3 respectively, rather than 8 or 9) and the ZIP domain of TGME49_254080 was relatively poorly conserved and were not considered further. Both TGME49_261720 and TGME49_225530 encoded ZIP-domains with high predicted confidence (E value &lt; 7×10<sup>-30</sup>), are predicted to have 8 transmembrane domains and share limited sequence homology with PfZIPCO (21% and 26% identity respectively). We examined the sequence conservation at the binuclear metal centres (BNC) M1 and M2 in transmembrane domains α4 and α5, which have been shown to be required for metal binding in a bacterial ZIP homolog (BpZIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wiuf et al., 2022</xref>). At M1, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> TGME49_261720 contains an unusual HGxxEG motif, which we found only in coccidian ZIPs and in some marine organisms (e.g. <italic>Branchiostoma floridae</italic>), the impact of which is not clear (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast, TGME49_225530 contains a HAxxEG motif, also found in prokaryotic ZIP9-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hu, 2021</xref>). Interestingly, all parasite ZIP-domain proteins examined have a HK motif at the M2 metal binding site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>), characteristic of the ZIPI family of ZIP-domain proteins, shared in HsZIP1 and HsZIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dufner-Beattie et al., 2003</xref>). This lysine likely prevents metal binding at this site, however has been shown to be required for transport activity in HsZIP2, possibly with a role in pH-responsivity of the transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gyimesi et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the unusual conserved motif, the predicted plasma membrane localisation, essentiality in tachyzoites and our previous results demonstrating iron-mediated regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>), we decided to functionally characterise the role of TGME49_261720. We constructed a structural prediction of TGME49_261720 as a dimer (in common with other reported ZIP-domain containing proteins). TGME49_261720 had 8 transmembrane domains with a large, unstructured loop between helices 3 and 4, predicted to be on the outer lumen, the role of which is unclear. The highly conserved metal binding residues H314 and E318 are indicated within the core of the predicted sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>

<title>ZFT localisation is dynamic and vacuolar stage dependent</title>
<p>We have previously shown that the 3’ UTR of ZFT plays an important role in iron-mediated regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>) and so we tagged ZFT with a 3xHA epitope tag with the endogenous 3’ UTR (ZFT-3HA<italic><sub>zft</sub></italic>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Western blot demonstrated the protein ran at the expected size of around 50 kDa, although with multiple, non-specific lower bands (asterisks) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). Using immunofluorescence, we found that ZFT localised to the periphery of the parasite with a second foci at the basal pole of the cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>). To determine if changing the UTR affected ZFT localisation, we also tagged it with a 3xHA epitope tag followed by the <italic>sag1</italic> 3’ UTR (ZFT-3HA<italic><sub>sag1</sub></italic>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1a</xref>) and saw a similar localisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1b</xref>). Interestingly, localisation was highly dependent on the number of parasites per vacuole. In early stages (2-4 parasites/vacuole) ZFT localised peripherally, however this shifted to basal localisation in larger vacuoles (&gt;8 parasites) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1e, f</xref>). Accompanying this change in localisation, we quantified the amount of ZFT-3HA<italic><sub>zft</sub></italic> and found that the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of ZFT/parasite was significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, one-way ANOVA, Tukey corrected for multiple comparisons) higher in vacuoles with fewer parasites, compared to larger vacuoles with 8 parasites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>). This suggests that ZFT is degraded in a vacuolar stage-dependent manner. Previously, we showed that ZFT levels are regulated by low iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>). To determine if the localisation of ZFT was affected under iron starvation, we treated the parasites with the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) for 24 h. Under low iron conditions, ZFT-3HA<italic><sub>zft</sub></italic> localisation was maintained at the parasite periphery, although some intracellular vesicles could be observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1c</xref>).</p>
<p>These data show ZFT expression and localisation is dynamic depending on vacuolar stage.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>ZFT expression is regulated by excess iron</title>
<p>The localisation and expression of transporters is often regulated by substrate availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Conte and Walker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gao and Dubos, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), and we have previously shown the iron transporter VIT is regulated by iron in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aghabi et al., 2023</xref>). We have previously demonstrated the <italic>zft</italic> 3’ UTR is sufficient to stabilise the mRNA under low iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>), however expression under excess iron was not examined. To determine if ZFT-3HA<italic><sub>zft</sub></italic> is regulated by excess iron, we treated parasites with exogenous ferric ammonium chloride (FAC). At 18 h post treatment, ZFT-3HA<italic><sub>zft</sub></italic> levels were slightly (to around 87% of the untreated) but significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.028, two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test) reduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2a, b</xref>). However, by 24 h post treatment we found that ZFT-3HA<italic><sub>zft</sub></italic> expression was reduced to around 40% of the untreated (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0041, two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2c, d</xref>). We confirmed loss of ZFT-3HA<italic><sub>zft</sub></italic> expression under excess iron by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2e, f</xref>), demonstrating ZFT expression is significantly reduced under excess iron.</p>

<title>Overexpression of ZFT leads to a change in iron sensitivity</title>
<p>Initial attempts to overexpress ZFT were unsuccessful, suggesting that overexpression was toxic. However, we were able to stably overexpress ZFT by coupling a second copy of ZFT-Ty expressed from a strong promotor, pTUB8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Frénal et al., 2010</xref>) with DHFR using a P2A-slip peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Markus et al., 2019</xref>) and maintaining the line in pyrimethamine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>). We validated the presence of second copy by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2a</xref>), and the protein by western blotting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>). To determine the effect of overexpression of ZFT on parasite fitness, we performed a plaque assay of both parental and ZFT-Ty parasites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i</xref>). Parasites overexpressing ZFT form significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0027, unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test) fewer plaques than parental parasites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2j</xref>), with significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test with Welch’s correction) smaller area (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2k</xref>), confirming that overexpression of ZFT inhibits parasite replication. Overexpression of metal transporters can alter the sensitivity to environmental metal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Connolly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li and Kaplan, 1998</xref>). To test this, we quantified the effects of ZFT overexpression on iron sensitivity. Our data show parasites overexpressing ZFT-Ty are significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0027, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test) more sensitive (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.386 mM, 95% C.I. 0.315 to 0.479 mM) to excess iron, compared to the parental line (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.29 mM, 95% C.I. 0.813 to 2.01 mM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2l</xref><bold>, S2b</bold>). Excess iron leads to parasite death largely through oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aghabi et al., 2023</xref>). To confirm that parasites were not more sensitive based on non-specific increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, we treated parasites with sodium arsenite (Ars), which has previously been used to induce oxidative stress in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aghabi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Augusto et al., 2021</xref>). However, overexpression of ZFT does not lead to any significant change in oxidative stress sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2c, d</xref>), suggesting the phenotype is specific to iron. We then tested how ZFT-Ty overexpression affected sensitivity to iron starvation using DFO. We found parasites overexpressing ZFT are significantly (<italic>p =</italic> 0.0246, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test) more resistant (EC<sub>50</sub> = 22.81 µM, 95% C.l. 16.8 to 30.6 µM) to iron chelation, compared to the parental line (EC<sub>50</sub> = 8.18 µM, 95% C.l. 6.94 to 9.71 µM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2m</xref><bold>, S2e</bold>). These data suggest that overexpression of ZFT leads to alterations in parasite iron sensitivity.</p>

<title>ZFT is essential for parasite survival</title>
<p>To determine the importance of ZFT in parasite replication, an inducible knockdown line was generated by replacing the promotor of ZFT with the T7S4 promoter which is inhibited in the presence of ATc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sheiner et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>), which was validated by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3a</xref>). To verify conditional knockdown, we performed RT-qPCR as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>). By 24 h post induction with ATc, we found that <italic>zft</italic> mRNA was significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0032, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test with Welch’s correction) reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). We epitope tagged ZFT in the T7S4-ZFT background (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>) and confirmed integration by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3b</xref>). Western blotting demonstrated that swap of the promotor led to a significant (around 5 times) overexpression of ZFT in the T7S4-ZFT cell line, compared with the endogenous promotor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3c, d</xref>). We validated the ATc-induced inhibition of expression by western blot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>) and show that there is a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test) drop in ZFT-3HA<italic><sub>sag1</sub></italic> expression levels by 24 h post induction. At 48 h after adding ATc, only around 10% of the protein remained (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0131, two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). Moreover, we found that ZFT-3HA<italic><sub>sag1</sub></italic> was undetectable by immunofluorescence by 48 h post induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>). Previous studies on both bacterial and eukaryotic ZIPs suggest that these proteins function in either homodimers or heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ahern et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>).

<p>To examine the role of ZFT, a plaque assay was performed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>). Replacement of the ZFT promotor alone led to a significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0052, two-way ANOVA, Tukey corrected for multiple comparisons) defect in plaque number and area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3h, i, j</xref>). This, combined with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>), demonstrates that correct expression of ZFT is important for parasite fitness. Addition of ATc renders T7S4-ZFT parasites unable to form plaques in the host cell monolayer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3h, i, j</xref>), confirming that expression of ZFT is essential for the parasite. In <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the growth defect upon loss of DMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Loveridge and Sigala, 2024</xref>) or ZIPCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sahu et al., 2014</xref>) was able to be rescued by addition of exogenous substrate. To determine if loss of ZFT could be rescued by addition of iron, we treated ZFT knockdown cells with 200 μM FAC and quantified growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3k</xref>). We found that replacing the ZFT promoter alone led to a significant reduction in plaque area (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test with Welch’s correction) in high iron conditions (200 μM FAC) compared to untreated conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3l</xref>), potentially due to the overexpression of ZFT under the T7S4 promotor. However, exogenous iron was unable to rescue the growth defect, either by plaque number or area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3k, m, n</xref>). To determine if iron could restore growth when some ZFT remained, we also performed a plaque assay with half the standard concentration of ATc (0.25 µM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3e</xref>). We find that in these conditions, ZFT KD parasites are still unable to form any plaques, even in the presence of excess iron (200 μM FAC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S3e, f, g</xref>). This suggests a strong, irreversible growth defect and the essentiality of ZFT as the major iron transporter.</p>

<title>ZFT knockdown alters organellar function</title>
<p>Iron is required for proteins essential in parasitic organelles such as the apicoplast and mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Maclean et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pamukcu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Renaud et al., 2022</xref>) and disruption of organellar function can lead to morphological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mallo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). To determine if ZFT knockdown was associated with changes in the apicoplast, we initially imaged at 24 h and 48 h of ATc, however saw no clear morphological defects (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). To determine if there is a defect in apicoplast protein import post-ZFT depletion, we examined CPN60 processing at 48 h treatment and saw no change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4a</xref>). We also examined protein lipoylation, as the apicoplast contains the essential Fe-S-protein LipA, which is required for lipoylation of the apicoplast-localised pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pamukcu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Crawford et al., 2006</xref>). Using an anti-lipoic acid antibody, we were able to detect lipoylated PDH-E2 at 48 h post ATc treatment, suggesting that at this time point, apicoplast functions are maintained (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Given the previously established delayed-death phenotype of the apicoplast, we determined the effects of ZFT knockdown on apicoplast maintenance after a further round of mechanical release and invasion. Here, we observed a small but significant increase (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04, two way ANOVA, Tukey corrected for multiple comparisons) in elongated apicoplasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c, d</xref>). We also quantified parasite replication and found a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0055 at the 1, 2, 4, and 8 parasites/vacuole, two way ANOVA with Šidák correction) decrease in parasites/vacuole in the second round of invasion, compared to untreated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>).</p>

<p>Iron is also required within the parasite mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Maclean et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pamukcu et al., 2021</xref>). We first examined gross parasite mitochondrial morphology by light microscopy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref>) and saw no significant alterations. To assess if ZFT knockdown affects mitochondrial respiration, oxygen consumption rate was quantified using a Seahorse assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hayward et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4g</xref>). We found that 48 h of ZFT knockdown significantly reduced basal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h</xref>) and maximal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4i</xref>) mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (mOCR) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0233, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0054 respectively, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test with Welch’s correction), compared to untreated parasites. Interestingly, we find ZFT knockdown does not significantly change the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a proxy for glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hayward et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4b</xref>) and the metabolic map suggests that ZFT knockdown leads to a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation and a more quiescent phenotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4j</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the mitochondrion, iron is incorporated in proteins of the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Maclean et al., 2021</xref>). A decrease in mitochondria respiration could be caused by a depletion of proteins in the electron transport chain or the activity of complexes within the electron transport chain. To determine how these are affected by depletion of ZFT, we firstly examined the expression of the key mitochondrial protein succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB). SDHB has essential roles both in the TCA cycle and in complex III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Maclean et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Silva et al., 2023</xref>) and contains three Fe-S clusters. We endogenously tagged SDHB (TGME49_215280) in the T7S4-ZFT background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4c</xref>), confirmed integration by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4d</xref>), and quantified protein levels following 48 h of ZFT knockdown. Upon depletion of ZFT, SDHB-3HA expression levels were significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0205, two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test) reduced to around 34%, compared to untreated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4k, l</xref>). As a control, we also tagged the essential cytosolic Fe-S protein ABCE1 (TGME49_216790) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Maclean et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4e</xref>) and confirmed integration by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4f</xref>). However, ABCE1-3HA expression levels remained unchanged at 48 h upon ZFT knockdown (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1758, two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4g, h</xref>), confirming the lack of a global effect on Fe-S proteins upon ZFT knockdown. We also examined the activity of complex IV, which is predicted to contain both Fe-S proteins and haemoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Leonard et al., 2023</xref>), by in gel activity assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lacombe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Silva et al., 2023</xref>). We find that ZFT knockdown reduced complex IV activity at 48 h post ZFT knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4m</xref>). Changes in mitochondrial respiration have previously been linked to changes in cristae morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Huet et al., 2018</xref>). Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 72 h post ATc treatment, we saw no clear changes in cristae morphology, compared to untreated parasites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4i</xref>).</p>
<p>These data demonstrate ZFT knockdown inhibits apicoplast replication and reduces mitochondrial respiration, potentially due to loss of iron-containing proteins in the mitochondrial electron transport chain.</p>

<p>To examine the effects of loss of ZFT in more detail, we imaged parasites by TEM. Although there were no obvious morphological changes, at 5 days post knockdown we observed a heavily vesiculated parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) with the accumulation of small vesicles in the intravacuolar space. In contrast, the PVM of untreated parasites appeared smooth, with no vesicular accumulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). Further, we observed multiple enlarged, electron-lucent vesicles upon ZFT knockdown which were not presented in the untreated cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). Similar large vesicles have previously been reported to contain materials that form the cyst wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tomita et al., 2013</xref>), a characteristic of <italic>T. gondii</italic> conversion to bradyzoites. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that loss of iron is sufficient to drive bradyzoite conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Renaud et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Ying et al., 2024</xref>). To determine if iron depletion could mimic this phenotype, parental parasites were treated with DFO for 5 days. As with the knockdown of ZFT, iron-depleted parasites also exhibit similar large vesicles close to the PV membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4j</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if loss of ZFT is sufficient to induce stage conversion, we examined the expression of bradyzoite specific markers upon ZFT knockdown. BAG1 is bradyzoite specific protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kannan et al., 2019</xref>) and DBL is a lectin which binds to the heavily glycosylated cyst wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tomita et al., 2013</xref>). At 72 and 96 h post ATc addition we saw vacuoles expressing BAG1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>) and with peripheral DBL staining around the vacuole (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>). We quantified this and saw a significantly higher percentage of vacuoles expressing BAG1 and DBL (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0013, <italic>p =</italic> 0.0001 respectively, two-way ANOVA, Tukey corrected for multiple comparisons) upon ZFT knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5f, g</xref>). These data demonstrate ZFT depletion leads to the expression of the bradyzoite-specific markers BAG1 and DBL.</p>
<p><italic>T. gondii</italic> differentiation allows cells to survive otherwise fatal stresses, and parasites can reactivate upon removal of the stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cerutti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Soete et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Sullivan and Jeffers, 2012</xref>). To determine if parasites initiating conversion upon ZFT knockdown remained viable, we quantified parasite survival. Parasites were treated with ATc for 72 h, washed, then incubated without ATc for a further 6 days. After ATc washout, plaques formed, indicating that some parasites remained viable (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5h</xref>). Upon quantification, around 40 % of parasites were able to reestablish growth after 72 h ZFT knockdown (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5i</xref>), a similar proportion to those expressing the bradyzoite marker BAG1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f</xref>). These results imply that although many Rh parasites are unable to survive a transient loss of ZFT, around 40% of vacuoles initiate transition to bradyzoites and can survive transient loss of ZFT.</p>

<title>ZFT knockdown cannot be rescued by excess zinc</title>
<p>As ZIP-domain proteins commonly transport zinc, we next aimed to assess if ZFT also plays a role in zinc uptake in <italic>T. gondii.</italic> Similar to addition of excess iron, excess zinc was also unable to rescue plaque number (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6a, b</xref>) or area (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>) in the absence of ZFT. As with iron, changing the promoter alone significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, ordinary one-way ANOVA, Tukey corrected for multiple comparisons) sensitised the parasites to excess zinc, leading to a decrease in plaque size (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>). We also tested a zinc ionophore (2-Mercaptopyridine N-oxide), however the zinc ionophore was also unable to rescue the growth phenotype upon knockdown of ZFT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S5a, b</xref>). As we had previously examined the role of iron, we next tested if both excess iron (200 µM FAC) and zinc (25 µM ZnSO<sub>4</sub>) were required to rescue the growth phenotype upon ZFT knockdown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>). However, addition of both metals was also unable to rescue the T7S4-ZFT growth defect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6a, b</xref>). Interestingly, changing the promoter alone leads a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, Tukey corrected for multiple comparisons) decrease in plaque numbers (to around ∼20%) compared to parental parasites in the iron and zinc conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S5c</xref>), suggesting that overexpressing ZFT makes the parasites hypersensitive to both iron and zinc. We also tested the sensitivity of the ZFT-Ty overexpression line to zinc. As suggested by the plaque assays, overexpression of ZFT lead to a small but significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test) increase in zinc sensitivity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6e</xref><bold>, S5d</bold>).</p>

<title>ZFT expression complements lack of zinc transport in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title>
<p>To investigate whether ZFT has a functional role in zinc uptake in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, we first codon optimized the full length ZFT sequence for expression in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> This was then constitutively expressed in either the parental strain (DY1457) or a strain lacking both the low and high affinity zinc transporters, Δ<italic>zrt1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Ullah et al., 2018</xref>). Under standard conditions, expression of TgZFT complemented the mild growth defect of the Δ<italic>zrt1/2</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6j</xref>). Upon chelation of zinc by EGTA, the Δ<italic>zrt1/2</italic> mutant is unable to grow, however this is rescued by expression of TgZFT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6k</xref>). These data demonstrate ZFT expression complements the loss of zinc transport in the Δ<italic>zrt1/2</italic> line, confirming ZFT as a functional zinc transporter. Based on this success, we also attempted to complement an iron uptake (Δ<italic>fet2/3</italic>) yeast mutant. However, despite multiple attempts, we were unable to express codon-optimised ZFT in the Δ<italic>fet2/3</italic> yeast mutant. The reason for this was not clear, but it is possible that the Δ<italic>fet2/3</italic> yeast strain is less able to survive transformation, or that in this background, expression of ZFT is toxic.</p>

<title>Knocking down ZFT results in a decrease in parasite associated metal</title>
<p>To determine if loss of ZFT led to changes in the metal content of parasites, we used the fluorescence iron indicator FerroOrange, which increases fluorescence in the presence of labile iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Weber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). To validate its use, we pre-treated parasites with 200 µM FAC intracellularly for 48 h before live imaging (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>). Parasites preloaded with iron have a significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test with Welch’s correction) higher MFI of FerroOrange compared to untreated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>), validating the sensitivity of this indicator. Upon 48 h KD of ZFT, the MFI of FerroOrange was significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0027, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test with Welch’s correction) reduced, compared to untreated parasites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>).

<p>To further examine the effect of knocking down ZFT on parasite-associated metal levels, we performed inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), an elemental analysis technique used to quantify elemental abundance from complex environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Al-sandaqchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hare et al., 2012</xref>). At both 24 h and 48 h ATc treatment, we saw no significant changes in the amount of iron in the parasites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>). However, iron levels were very close to the limit of detection, even in untreated cells, and iron detection by ICP-MS can be challenging due to interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Segura et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, zinc levels were notably higher, and at both 24 h and 48 h ATc treatment, ZFT knockdown parasites had significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0062, and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0073, two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test) reduced parasite associated zinc (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7f</xref>).</p>
<p>Iron can also be quantified at subcellular resolution using X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aghabi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Miller and Ralle, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Paunesku et al., 2021</xref>), which allows both spatial and quantitative data. Using XFM we were able to detect iron in extracellular parasites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7g</xref>), which frequently appeared localised to distinct foci in the parasites, which we believe to be the PLVAC, based on our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aghabi et al., 2023</xref>). However, by 48 h post ATc induction we were no longer able to detect iron within the parasites. We also assessed zinc localisation. In untreated cells, zinc localised to what we believe is the parasite nucleus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7h</xref>), as has been seen in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Olea-Flores et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>We also saw specific foci of zinc within the cells, which, based on previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chasen et al., 2019</xref>), we assume to be the PLVAC. Indeed, we found that iron and zinc, along with phosphorus frequently colocalised in extracellular parasite (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7i</xref>), as previously has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chasen et al., 2019</xref>). As with iron, depletion of ZFT led to a decrease in parasite associated zinc, with a loss of zinc both within the nuclei and within foci, which was very evident by 48 h post knockdown (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7h</xref>).</p>
<p>Parasite associated metals were quantified in untreated parasites and at both 24 and 48 h post ZFT knockdown by XFM. At both timepoints, knockdown parasites have significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, ordinary one-way ANOVA, Tukey corrected for multiple comparisons) less parasite-associated iron, from ∼250 nM in untreated, to ∼150 nM at 24 h and ∼95 nM at 48 h (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7j</xref>). At both 24 h and 48 h KD of ZFT, <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites have significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, ordinary one-way ANOVA, Tukey corrected for multiple comparisons) less parasite associated zinc, from ∼6 µM in untreated, to ∼3.5 µM at 24 h and ∼1.7 µM at 48 h (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7k</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the concentrations of both sulphur (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0014, ordinary one-way ANOVA, Tukey corrected for multiple comparisons) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S6a</xref>), and phosphorus (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008, ordinary one-way ANOVA, Tukey corrected for multiple comparisons) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S6b</xref>), were also significantly reduced at 48 h following ZFT knockdown, although the magnitude of the decrease was much smaller. Comparison of the changes demonstrated a clear, time-dependent depletion of both iron and zinc, with much smaller drops (around 10-20%) in sulphur and phosphorus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7l</xref>). Both sulphur and phosphorus are highly abundant in cellular macromolecules, and this small decrease may speak to defects in protein synthesis or DNA replication upon ZFT knockdown.</p>
<p>Together, these data validate the role of ZFT as the major iron and zinc transporter of <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have identified and characterised the first ZIP-domain containing protein in <italic>Toxoplasma,</italic> demonstrating that ZFT is the major iron and zinc importer for the parasite. Sequence analysis of ZFT shows conservation of essential metal coordinating residues and identified a new motif, conserved in coccidia, in the M1 metal binding domain, although with an unknown role in transport. ZFT also encodes a leucine at position 403, previously associated with broad substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gyimesi et al., 2019</xref>), which fits with our data that ZFT transports both iron and zinc. However, future studies will examine the substrate preference and kinetics of this transporter in greater detail.</p>
<p>ZIP proteins mediate metal transport both across the plasma membrane, and from vesicles into the cytosol. The localisation of ZFT appears highly dynamic through the parasite’s intracellular replication, moving from the plasma membrane to basally clustered intracellular vesicles, after 2-3 rounds of replication. This vacuole stage-dependent localisation is highly unusual in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and has not previously been observed. Unfortunately, fluorescent tags led to significant miss-localisation of ZFT to the ER (not shown), so we were unable to observe this trafficking in live cells. Currently, our working model is that ZFT is most active at the plasma membrane, enabling rapid metal incorporation into new vacuoles, and is then internalised and later degraded, presumably to prevent toxic metal overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aghabi et al., 2023</xref>). This may explain the persistence of plasma-membrane localised ZFT in iron starvation, and its degradation in excess iron. However, from our current results, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that the parasite is taking up extracellular material in digestive vesicles, and ZFT transports metals freed from digested proteins into the cytosol. Future studies examining the kinetics of metal uptake, and the localisation dynamics of ZFT in intracellular parasites in more detail may be able to address this remaining question.</p>
<p>In <italic>Toxoplasma,</italic> vacuolar iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aghabi et al., 2023</xref>) and zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chasen et al., 2019</xref>) transporters have been identified with roles in metal storage and detoxification. However, ZFT is the first <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> metal uptake transporter identified and characterised. This transporter is essential, highlighting the essential role of iron and zinc to the parasite. Interestingly, and unlike in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Loveridge and Sigala, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sahu et al., 2014</xref>), we were unable to complement the loss of this transporter by addition of exogenous metals. One possible explanation could be lack of metal access to the PV, however our metal dye experiments and the growth phenotype after treatment increases our confidence that exogenous metals reach the vacuole. A more compelling argument is that ZFT is both essential and sufficient for iron and zinc transport, and in its absence, there are no other transporters able to complement for its loss. As there are three other predicted ZIP transporters in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, this raises the questions of their functions within the cell, which will be addressed in future studies.</p>
<p>Knockdown of ZFT triggers differentiation into bradyzoites, which complements previous studies demonstrating a similar phenotype upon iron chelation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Renaud et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Ying et al., 2024</xref>). The pathway of iron-starvation triggering differentiation is not yet known, although it is compounded by the action of BFD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>). Interestingly, loss of ZFT leads to a significant inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, with the depletion of the essential, iron-bound protein SDHB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Maclean et al., 2021</xref>) and reduction of complex IV activity. Inhibition of respiration has previously been linked to bradyzoite conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tomavo and Boothroyd, 1995</xref>), however we do not yet know the signalling factors linking iron, zinc or mitochondrial function to bradyzoite differentiation. Iron is known to be required in the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Renaud et al., 2022</xref>), although a potential role for zinc in this organelle has not yet been established. We see a delayed phenotype on the apicoplast, suggesting that metal import is also required in this organelle, although no apicoplast metal transporters have yet been identified. While the use of iron within the parasite has been previously examined, the role of zinc in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is largely unknown. XFM suggests a concentration of zinc within the nucleus, where it is expected to play a role in DNA replication and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Olea-Flores et al., 2022</xref>). Beyond the nucleus, zinc is clearly concentrated within one or two foci, in agreement with zinc storage in the PLVAC, as previously hypothesised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chasen et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies will be needed to unpick both the specific roles of zinc in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, and the parasite’s response to zinc starvation, as these are likely highly heterogenous.</p>
<p>ZFT appears to be highly regulated by iron availability, at the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>), protein, and localisation levels. However, ZFT is not regulated by excess zinc, although zinc-mediated ZIP-protein degradation has been observed in other organisms (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pang et al., 2023</xref>)). Interestingly, there is evidence from other organisms that excess zinc modulates both iron uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Blaby-Haas and Merchant, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Xu et al., 2019</xref>) and copper homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible that excess zinc leads to a decrease in iron acquisition, stabilising ZFT expression, however this has not yet been assessed. Previously, we have shown that ZFT is stabilised under iron starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sloan et al., 2025</xref>), however we did not see the same effect after treatment with the zinc chelator TPEN. There has not yet been any investigation into potential zinc-mediated regulation in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, and so we are currently unable to say if this is due to a lack of zinc sensing and response in these parasites, or the treatment or timings we used was insufficient to trigger such a pathway.</p>
<p>The use of XFM to quantify parasite-associated metals has been vital in this work. Beyond localising iron, zinc and phosphorus to an overlapping compartment in extracellular parasites, we were able to show that knockdown of ZFT lead to significant decreases in parasite-associated iron and zinc. There are some limitations of XFM, e.g. we were unable to quantify copper or manganese using this approach, probably due to low concentrations within the parasite. Further, for technical reasons we worked with chemically fixed parasites which may have led to an underestimate of metal concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). However, this provides direct evidence of changes in the elemental composition of parasites in the absence of ZFT.</p>
<p>In summary, here we characterise the first iron and zinc uptake transporter in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. ZFT is indispensable, highlighting the importance of iron and zinc uptake for the parasite. The identification of this transporter opens new avenues for future investigation into the essential metallobiology of these parasites.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Aghabi et al. present a comprehensive characterization of ZFT, a metal transporter located at the plasma membrane of the eukaryotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The authors provide convincing evidence that ZFT plays a crucial role in parasite fitness, as demonstrated by the generation of a conditional knockdown mutant cell line, which exhibits a marked impact on mitochondrial respiration, a process dependent on several iron-containing proteins. Consistent with previous reports, the authors also show that disruption of mitochondrial metabolism leads to conversion into the persistent bradyzoite stage. The study then employed advanced techniques, such as inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM), to demonstrate that ZFT depletion results in reduced parasite-associated metals, particularly iron and zinc. Additionally, the authors show that ZFT expression is modulated by the availability of these metals, although defects in the transporter could not be compensated for by exogenous addition of iron or zinc.</p>
<p>While the manuscript does not directly investigate the transport function of ZFT through biochemical assays, the authors indirectly support the notion that ZFT can transport zinc by demonstrating its ability to compensate for a lack of zinc transport in a yeast heterologous system. Furthermore, phenotypic analyses suggest defects in iron availability, particularly with regard to Fe-S mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial function. Overall, the manuscript provides a solid, well-rounded argument for ZFT's role in metal transport, using a combination of complementary approaches. Although direct biochemical evidence for the transporter's substrate specificity and transport activity is lacking, the converging evidence, including changes in metal concentrations upon ZFT depletion, yeast complementation data, and phenotypic changes linked to iron deficiency, presents a convincing case. Some aspects of the results may appear somewhat unbalanced, particularly since iron transport could not be confirmed through heterologous complementation, while zinc-related phenotypes in the parasites have not been thoroughly explored (which is challenging given the limited number of zinc-dependent proteins characterized in Toxoplasma). Nevertheless, given that metal acquisition remains largely uncharacterized in Toxoplasma, this manuscript provides an important first step in identifying a metal transporter in these parasites, and the data presented are generally convincing and insightful.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii scavenges metal ions such as iron and zinc to support its replication; however, mechanistic studies of iron and zinc uptake are limited. This study investigates the function of a putative iron and zinc transporter, ZFT. In this paper, the authors provide evidence that ZFT mediates iron and zinc uptake by examining the regulation of ZFT expression by iron and zinc levels, the impact of altered ZFT expression on iron sensitivity, and the effects of ZFT depletion on intracellular iron and zinc levels in the parasite. The effects of ZFT depletion on parasite growth are also investigated, showing the importance of ZFT function for the parasite.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength of the study is the use of multiple complementary approaches to demonstrate that ZFT is involved in iron and zinc uptake. Additionally, the authors build on their finding that loss of ZFT impairs parasite growth by showing that ZFT depletion induces stage conversion and leads to defects in both the apicoplast and mitochondrion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Excess zinc was shown not to alter ZFT expression, but a cation chelator (TPEN) did lead to decreased expression. While TPEN is often used to reduce zinc levels, does it have any effect on iron levels? Could the reduction in ZFT after TPEN treatment be due to a reduction in the level of iron or another cation?</p>
<p>(2) ZFT expression was found to be dynamic depending on the size of the vacuole, based on mean fluorescence intensity measurements. Looking at protein levels by Western blot at different times during infection would strengthen this finding.</p>
<p>(3) ZFT localization remained at the parasite periphery under low iron conditions. However, in the images shown in Figure S1c, larger vacuoles (containing 4-8 parasites) are shown for the untreated conditions, and single parasite-containing vacuoles are shown for the low iron condition. As ZFT localization is predominantly at the basal end of the parasite in larger PV and at the parasite periphery for smaller vacuoles, it would be better to compare vacuoles of similar size between the untreated and low-iron conditions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Aghabi et al set out to characterize a T. gondii transmembrane protein with a ZIP domain, termed ZFT. The authors investigate the consequences of ZFT downregulation and overexpression for parasite fitness. Downregulation of ZFT causes defects in the parasite's endosymbiotic organelles, the apicoplast and the mitochondrion. Specifically, lack of ZFT causes a decrease in mitochondrial respiration, consistent with its role as an iron transporter. This impact on the mitochondria appears to trigger partial differentiation to bradyzoites. The authors furthermore demonstrate that expression of TgZFT can rescue a yeast mutant lacking its zinc transporter and perform an array of direct metal ion measurements, including X-ray fluorescence microscopy and inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). These reveal reduced metal ions in parasites depleted in ZFT. Overall, the data by Aghabi et al. reveal that ZFT is a major metal ion transporter in T. gondii, importing iron and zinc for diverse essential processes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study's strength lies in the thorough characterization of the transporter. The authors combine a number of techniques to measure the impact of ZFT depletion, ranging from the direct measurement of metal ions to determining the consequences for the parasite's metabolism (mitochondrial respiration), as well as performing a yeast mutant complementation. This work is very thorough and clearly presented, leaving little doubt about this protein's function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study offers no major novel insights into the biology of T. gondii. The transporter was already annotated as a zinc transporter (ToxoDB), was deemed essential (PMID: 27594426), and localized to the plasma membrane (PMID: 33053376). This study mostly confirms and validates these previous datasets. The authors identify three other proteins with a ZIT domain. Particularly, the role of TGME49_225530 is intriguing, as it is likely fitness-conferring (score: -2.8, PMID: 27594426) and has no subcellular localization assigned. Characterizing this protein as well, revealing its localization, and identifying if and how these transporters coordinate metal ion transport would have been worthwhile.</p>
<p>Another weakness is the data related to the impact of ZFT downregulation on the apicoplast in Figure 4. The authors show that downregulation of ZFT causes an increase in elongated apicoplasts (Figure 4d). The subsequent panels seem to show that the parasites present a dramatic growth defect at that time point. This growth arrest can directly explain the elongated apicoplast, but does not allow any conclusion about an impact on the organelle. In any case, an assessment of 'delayed death' as presented in Figure 4c seems futile, since the many other processes affected by zinc and iron depletion likely cause a rapid death, masking any potential delayed death.</p>
