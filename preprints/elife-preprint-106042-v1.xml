<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Understanding the developmental changes in neuronal lineages is crucial to elucidate how they assemble into functional neural networks. Studies investigating nervous system development in model systems have focused on only on a few regions of the central nervous system due to the limited availability of genetic drivers that target specific neuronal lineages throughout development and adult life. This has hindered our understanding of how distinct neuronal lineages interconnect to form neuronal circuits during development. Here, we present a split-GAL4 library composed of genetic driver lines, which we generated via editing the genomic locus of lineage-specific transcription factors and demonstrate that we can use this library to specifically target most individual neuronal hemilineages in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ventral nerve cord (VNC) throughout development and into adulthood. Using these genetic driver lines, we found striking morphological changes in neuronal processes within a lineage during metamorphosis. We also demonstrated how neurochemical features of neuronal classes can be quickly assessed. Lastly, we documented behaviors elicited in response to optogenetic activation of individual neuronal lineages and generated a comprehensive lineage-behavior map of the entire fly VNC. Looking forward, this lineage-specific split-GAL4 driver library will provide the genetic tools needed to address the questions emerging from the analysis of the recent VNC connectome and transcriptome datasets.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuronal circuits underlie nervous system functions ranging from perception and movement to cognition and emotion. Most neurons found in the adult central nervous system (CNS) of animals are generated and assembled into circuits during development. Investigating the formation of these circuits provides valuable insights into the functional organization and operation of the nervous system, both in health and disease.</p>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> has served as a powerful model system to investigate how neuronal circuits function due to its medium complexity, yet rich repertoire of behaviors, and unprecedented genetic toolkit. High-resolution electron microscopy data of the adult fly brain and ventral nerve cord (VNC) reveal individual neuronal morphologies and their synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The integration of these morphological data with single-cell transcriptome profiles has placed the adult fly CNS at the forefront of studies of circuit operations at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other model systems, less attention has been given to how neuronal circuits develop compared to how they function, limiting our understanding of the developmental processes that instruct newly born neurons to assemble functional circuits. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the same set of neural stem cells, called neuroblasts (NB), sequentially form the larval and adult CNS, with the adult CNS having 10 to 20-fold more neurons and a greater complexity. Some of the embryonic-born neurons, which function in the larval CNS, are remodeled to integrate into adult circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Most of the adult neurons are born post-embryonically during larval and early pupal stages. These neurons fully differentiate and assemble into circuits during metamorphosis into the adult, which lasts several days. This extended window of neurogenesis and neuronal maturation during the formation of the adult VNC facilitates experimental manipulations that are not feasible during the brief period of neurogenesis in the embryo, such as temporal gene silencing studies to discriminate axon guidance and synapse formation.</p>
<p>The fly VNC, like its vertebrate analog, the spinal cord, is functionally compartmentalized into lineally related groups of neurons, called neuronal lineages. In flies, Notch-mediated asymmetric cell division divides the neuronal population of each NB into two subclasses, called hemilineages: “A” hemilineages are composed of Notch ON cells and “B” hemilineages are composed of notch OFF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The adult fly VNC is composed of ~15,000 neurons, most of which are in the three thoracic segments. Each thoracic hemisegment contains 34 major post-embryonic hemilineages, with some segment-specific variation in the type of hemilineages and their morphology. Recent studies identified these hemilineages in the VNC Electron Microscopy (EM) volume dataset and showed that neurons within a given hemilineage exhibit a stereotyped pattern of connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). This revealed that hemilineages display a propensity to form synaptic connections with neurons from other specific hemilineages, revealing a macro-connectivity among hemilineages. Hemilineage-based compartmentalization of the VNC is also observed at the level of gene expression. Allen <italic>et al</italic>., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) assessed the transcriptome of the entire adult VNC via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and showed that hemilineage identity correlates highly with unique clusters of cells, which are partitioned solely based on gene expression via dimensionality reduction. Lastly, several studies employing hemilineage-restricted neuronal manipulations showed that the VNC hemilineages represent functional modules that control animal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Indeed, like the cardinal classes of interneurons in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), hemilineages in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> VNC are functional units, each contributing to aspects of control of specific behaviors. Thus, taking a hemilineage-based approach is essential to for systematic and comprehensive understanding of the assembly of the behavioral circuits during development in complex nervous systems.</p>
<p>Addressing the question of how neurons in individual hemilineages develop into functional circuits requires genetic tools to manipulate individual hemilineages throughout development. Existing genetic driver lines (GAL4, Split-GAL4, and LexA libraries) are often limited in their use for developmental studies, because they drive gene expression only during specific life stages, such as only in the larval or adult. Consequently, they lack the temporal stability required for comprehensive developmental analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). A critical need then exists for developmentally stable and hemilineage specific driver lines, which will allow us to track and measure individual hemilineages as well as activate or inactivate specific genes and neuronal functions in these hemilineages, thereby facilitating the identification of fundamental principles underlying circuit development.</p>
<p>Here, we describe a split-GAL4 library that targets unique hemilineages in a developmentally stable manner. To achieve this, we used published scRNAseq data of the VNC, and extended the work of Allan <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). This work had assigned a part of the scRNAseq cell clusters to hemilineages. We analyzed the gene expression patterns of the remaining clusters for combinations of significantly enriched transcription factors, referred to as cluster markers, and tested the expression patterns of these genes with genetic reporter lines and antibody staining. We were able to assign 33 of the 34 major hemilineages to scRNAseq clusters with this approach. Then, we generated gene-specific split-GAL4 lines for 28 of these transcription factors via genome editing and recombination techniques. We performed a thorough analysis of the expression patterns of binary combinations of split-GAL4 AD and split-GAL4 DBD lines using combinations of the 28 transcription factor-specific hemidrivers we present in this study and split-GAL4 lines generated previously (REF). We report 44 combinations that target 32 of the 34 VNC hemilineages; most of these drivers do this specifically and in a developmentally stable manner. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of this library to map neurotransmitter expression to individual hemilineages and to map specific behaviors to defined neuronal lineages.</p>

<title>Intersecting the expression of <italic>acj6</italic> and <italic>unc-4</italic> with the split-GAL4 method faithfully marks hemilineage 23B throughout development and adult life</title>
<p>Most transcription factors in the CNS are expressed in hemilineage specific manners, and their expression is generally maintained throughout the lifetime of the neurons that express them. We asked whether we could generate specific and temporally stable driver lines by hijacking the expression of such transcription factors. We initially focused on Acj6 and Unc-4, which are transcription factors expressed in numerous neuronal cell clusters in the brain and VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Our prior work demonstrated that these proteins are co-expressed exclusively in hemilineage 23B neurons in both the larva and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). To develop a genetic set-up that targets only the 23B neurons in a developmentally stable manner, we leveraged this unique co-expression pattern. We combined two techniques: the Trojan-exon-based driver for target gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and the split-GAL4 method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The split-GAL4 method works by reconstituting GAL4 function through the interaction of GAL4’s DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an activation domain (AD) in cells where both transgenes are expressed. Here we used the <italic>unc-4</italic> split-GAL4 AD and DBD lines that we had previously generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) and created <italic>acj6</italic> split-GAL4 lines by replacing the MIMIC insertion in the <italic>acj6</italic> coding intron with a Trojan exon encoding either p65.AD or GAL4-DBD via recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE).</p>

<p>By combining <italic>unc-4</italic>-GAL4<sup>AD</sup> and <italic>acj6</italic>-GAL4<sup>DBD</sup> transgenes in the same animal with a nuclear expression reporter gene, UAS-nls-tdTomato, we specifically visualized the thoracic clusters of 23B neurons in the adult CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Small clusters of neurons were evident in the suboesophageal zone and their projections suggest that they are the labial homologs of hemilineage 23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 1 - figure supplement-1D, E</xref>). Membranous GFP expression (UAS-myr-GFP) also highlighted axonal projections of a few leg, gustatory and antennal sensory neurons which are missed with nuclear-based methods such as immunostaining for nuclear transcription factor or nuclear GFP reporter genes, since sensory cell bodies are located outside of the CNS. The reverse combination (<italic>unc-4</italic>-GAL4<sup>DBD</sup> and <italic>acj6</italic>-GAL4<sup>AD</sup>) exhibited an almost identical expression pattern (not shown).</p>
<p>To verify that these gene-specific split-GAL4 drivers recapitulate the intersected expression patterns of <italic>unc-4</italic> and <italic>acj6</italic>, we performed immunostaining with antibodies against Acj6 and Unc-4 on embryos carrying the described transgenes and evaluated the overlap with the GFP signal. Robust GFP expression was observed in the late-stage embryo and marked segmentally repeated clusters of neurons in the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 1 - figure supplement-1A, B</xref>). All GFP-positive cells were also positive for Acj6 and Unc-4 immunostaining, indicating that these cells correspond to the embryonic progeny of NB7-4, embryonic 23B neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Occasionally, one-to-two cells per segment expressed both transcription factors but not GFP (not shown). These cells, located ventrally, are likely late-born, immature neurons and their GFP expression may lag endogenous gene expression of Acj6 and Unc-4 due to the additional round of transcription and translation required for GFP expression. Outside the CNS, GFP-positive sensory neurons were found in the embryonic head region, where taste organs are located (not shown). Overall, the embryonic expression analysis confirmed that the <italic>acj6</italic>-GAL4<sup>DBD</sup> and <italic>unc-4</italic>-GAL4<sup>AD</sup> split-GAL4 combination accurately recapitulates co-expression of Acj6 and Unc-4 proteins and target embryonic 23B neurons. To test whether this combination of split-GAL4 driver lines also specifically marks 23B hemilineage during larval, pupal, and adult life, we carried out similar analysis during these stages. Like in the embryo, the intersection of <italic>acj6</italic>-GAL4<sup>DBD</sup> and <italic>unc-4</italic>-GAL4<sup>AD</sup> specifically marked 23B neurons in the larva, pupa, and adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 1– figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Thus, this split-GAL4 combination effectively targets reporter expression specifically to the 23B neurons in the VNC from the early larva through to the adult.</p>

<title>Identifying new marker genes for hemilineages and assigning hemilineages to scRNAseq clusters of the VNC transcriptome</title>
<p>The example described above demonstrated that combining the Trojan exon method with the split-GAL4 approach holds the potential to generate temporally stable, lineage-specific driver lines for every hemilineage in the VNC, provided suitable pairs of genes are identified. Our prior work created a map of the expression of 20 transcription factors, each of which is expressed from early larval stages to the adult in most or all neurons of a small number of hemilineages in the adult VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). When overlapped in a binary manner with each other, these transcription factor uniquely identify more than half of the 34 adult VNC hemilineages, rendering them ideal genomic targets from which to create a library of split-GAL4 driver lines.</p>
<p>To identify unique binary gene combinations that can selectively label each of the remaining hemilineages we further analyzed scRNAseq data from the adult VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). This work defined 120 t-SNE clusters based on unique combinations of significantly enriched genes, referred to as cluster markers. By comparing these cluster markers to established lineage markers, the Goodwin group assigned 18 hemilineages to one or more clusters, leaving 16 hemilineages unassigned. For example, they assigned grouped clusters 67, 93, 35 and 51 to lineage 23B. In agreement with our immunostaining that revealed that cluster markers <italic>acj6</italic> and <italic>unc-4</italic> mark this hemilineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>), we report that also the expression patterns of <italic>acj6</italic> and <italic>unc-4</italic> expression overlap in this grouped scRNAseq cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We continued this approach and tested whether other cluster-specific marker genes were expressed in their corresponding hemilineages. For instance, Allen <italic>et al</italic>., assigned clusters 0 and 100 to hemilineage 4B. Both clusters express <italic>fkh, HLH4C</italic>, and <italic>oc</italic> genes in addition to three additional genes: <italic>hb9 (</italic>also known as <italic>exex), HGTX</italic>, and <italic>ap</italic> that we had previously showed to be expressed in 4B neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Using GFP-tagged BAC reporter lines for <italic>fkh</italic>, <italic>oc</italic>, and <italic>HLH4C</italic> combined with immunostaining for Hb9 we demonstrate that cluster markers <italic>fkh</italic>, <italic>oc and HLH4C</italic> are indeed expressed in 4B neurons in the larval and adult VNC, consistent with the scRNAseq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, data not shown). In addition to hemilineage 4B, Hb9 marks hemilineage 10B and 16B neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Hemilineage 10B was assigned to clusters 39, 68, and 91 and hemilineage 16B to clusters 5 and 46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Knot (Kn) is a marker for clusters 39 and 91, and Sp1 for clusters 5 and 46. Reporters for both genes show that Knot and Sp1 are expressed in lineage 10B and 16B neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). Therefore, when a cluster marker, or marker combination, is uniquely associated with a hemilineage, it accurately marks this hemilineage.</p>

</fig>
<p>To identify the clusters that correspond to the remaining 16 hemilineages not assigned by Allen <italic>et al</italic>., we focused on the orphan clusters, which have not been assigned to any hemilineage. For example, glutamatergic clusters 15 and 86, which are adjacent in the t-SNE plot, are the only glutamatergic clusters that express Sox21a. To map these clusters to a hemilineage, we studied the morphology of the Sox21a-positive neurons in the VNC by expressing membrane-bound GFP under the control of a CRIMIC line reporting Sox21a expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This marked a group of ventral and anterior Sox21a-positive neuronal cell bodies situated near the midline in each hemisegment of the larval and adult VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Their processes project dorsally and then sharply turn upon reaching the dorsal surface of the neuropil. Based on their glutamatergic neurotransmitter identity and their unique morphology, which that of 2A interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), we assigned these clusters to hemilineage 2A.</p>
<p>Another example is cluster 58, which among all the VNC hemilineages, uniquely co-expresses <italic>unc-4</italic> and <italic>islet</italic> (also known as tup) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). We had previously studied Unc-4-positive hemilineages and had identified that hemilineage 17A is the only Unc-4-positive lineage that expresses Islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). To verify that cluster 58 identified hemilineage 17A neurons, we examined the expression pattern of another transcription factor, Hmx, which is a cluster marker for cluster 58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) Visualization of Hmx-positive neurons with a CRIMIC line reporting <italic>Hmx</italic> expression revealed that their cell bodies are located on the dorsal surface of the VNC and their processes project into the ipsilateral ventromedial neuropil, and then loop dorsally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This morphology is typical of 17A neurons. Additionally, we found that cluster 77 is marked with the combination of <italic>Hmx</italic> and <italic>tup</italic> and is directly adjacent to cluster 58 in the adult VNC t-SNE plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Thus, neurons of <italic>Hmx</italic>-positive clusters 58 and 77 likely belong to lineage 17A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, we noted that some transcription factors are expressed in a subset of neurons within a hemilineage and appeared to correspond to one of the multiple scRNAseq clusters assigned to a hemilineage. For example, hemilineage 0A contains clusters 22, 88 and 112. Of these three, Tj expression is only significant in cluster 88. We generated wild-type MARCM clones of lineage 0A, and one can see that Tj is expressed in a subset of neurons only, presumably cluster 88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In contrast, other transcription factors (Fkh, Inv, Mab21a, HLH3b and En) mark all clusters that belong to hemilineage 0A, as revealed by scRNAseq analysis and our immunostaining-based transcription factor expression analysis (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; data not shown). In hemilineage 21A, that is composed of only one scRNAseq cluster, Tj marks nearly all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Taken together, these data illustrate how cluster markers identified by scRNAseq data can be used to target individual hemilineages and even distinct subclasses within hemilineages.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we assessed the expression of 23 novel cluster-specific marker genes, all transcription factors, through immunohistochemistry with antibodies against the proteins of interest and/or reporter lines that accurately recapitulate target gene expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This effort allowed us to assign at least one cluster to 15 of the 16 previously unassigned hemilineages in the scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This implies that we now have transcription profiles for 33 of the 34 major hemilineages in the VNC, which facilitates the design of lineage-specific split-GAL4 combinations. The only exception is hemilineage 18B, which remains unassigned to any scRNAseq clusters.</p>

<title>Building specific and temporally stable driver lines for hemilineages in the VNC</title>
<p>To create a split-GAL4 library that uniquely marks essentially all major hemilineages, we generated gene-specific split-GAL4 driver lines by editing the genomic locus of the transcription factors identified above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Key Resources Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). To edit the transcription factor locus, we exchanged the intronic cassette of previously engineered MIMIC or CRIMIC lines with a split-GAL4 coding Trojan exon of 13 genes (See Methods). For 11 genes lacking established MIMIC or CRIMIC lines, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing via homology directed repair (HDR) to insert a Trojan exon carrying either DBD or AD split-GAL4 into a coding intron of the target gene and introduced attP sites to facilitate future cassette exchange with any other designer exon via phiC31 mediated cassette exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 3 – figure supplement 2</xref>). In select cases, we inserted a Trojan exon directly in frame at the 3’ end of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 3 – figure supplement 3</xref>). In total, we generated 334 split-GAL4 lines for 24 genes, 19 using the MiMIC method and 15 using CRISPR editing (Key Resources Table).

<title>Morphological changes of 4B neurons during development</title>
<p>To show the applicability of our driver lines for developmental studies, we characterized the morphological changes in the neuronal processes during metamorphosis. Neurons of hemilineage 4B are excitatory cholinergic local interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), and their arborizations are restricted to the ipsilateral leg neuropils and directly synapse with leg motor neurons in addition to many interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). We have built three different combinations of split-GAL4 lines, each of which specifically target most, if not all, postembryonic 4B neurons. Two of these drivers, <italic>ap</italic>-GAL4<sup>AD</sup> with <italic>fkh</italic>-GAL4<sup>DBD</sup> and <italic>ap</italic>-GAL4<sup>AD</sup> with <italic>HLC4C-</italic>GAL4-<sup>DBD</sup>, drive reporter expression in 4B neurons starting from early larval stages while <italic>ap</italic>-GAL4<sup>AD</sup> with <italic>HGTX</italic>-GAL4<sup>DBD</sup> drive robust expression beginning at the white pupal stage (data not shown). Due to its stronger and earlier expression pattern, we used <italic>ap</italic>-GAL4<sup>AD</sup> with <italic>fkh</italic>-GAL4<sup>DBD</sup> to mark the morphology of 4B neurons at 0, 3, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Like all the other postembryonic neurons, 4B neurons extend an initial simple neurite bundle after they are born and do not show any further arborization until metamorphosis. As seen in the VNC of a 0-hour APF animal, this initial 4B neurite bundle projects dorsally away from the cell bodies and innervates the leg neuropil diagonally across the dorso-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, A’</xref>). At 3-hour APF, multiple growth cones that point at different directions are visible on the tip of the 4B bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, B’</xref>). At 12-hour APF, these growth cones transform into three distinct branches, extending medially, laterally, or dorsally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, C’</xref>). At 24-hour APF, finer processes extend from these branches and puncta-like staining are visible, which suggests that synapse are being formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, D’</xref>). At 48-hour APF, the crowded, finer processes are resolved into more refined and discreet processes and the synaptic puncta-like staining becomes more extensive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, E’</xref>). At 72-hour APF, the synaptic puncta appear to increase in size and to take a bouton-like shapes, resembling the adult morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, F’</xref>). In summary, by employing a developmentally stable driver line specific to hemilineage 4B, we documented stepwise morphological changes in the outgrowth of neuronal processes of 4B neurons throughout metamorphosis. These changes occur in distinct phases: initial neurite bundle expansion through new branch additions, followed by the formation and refinement of finer processes and synapses, and concluding with synaptic growth.</p>

<title>Neurochemical mapping</title>
<p>Another advantage of having split-GAL4 lines for lineage specific transcription factors is the ability to assess neurochemical features of a neuronal population expressing this specific transcription factor in wildtype animals or animals mutants for this transcription factor. To do that, we simply combine the transcription factor-specific split-GAL4 line with another gene-specific split-GAL4 line marking a specific neurochemical feature. For example, to identify neurotransmitter identity of Acj6-positive neurons, we combined our Acj6 split-GAL4 line with a split-GAL4 line reporting the expression of one of the neurotransmitter marker genes, Gad1, ChAT, or VGlut to visualize GABAergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic Acj6-positive neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Acj6 is known to be expressed in glutamatergic 9B and cholinergic 8B and 23B hemilineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). As expected, in each thoracic hemisegment of the VNC, these split-GAL4 combinations marked a single cluster of glutamatergic Acj6-positive neurons corresponding to 9B neurons (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), two clusters of cholinergic Acj6-positive neurons corresponding to 8B and 23B neurons (arrowhead and arrows, respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and no GABAergic Acj6-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In each hemibrain, the same split-GAL4 combinations identified one glutamatergic cluster with local projections, several cholinergic clusters with long projections, and two GABAergic clusters with long projections. Additionally, we detected cholinergic Acj6-positive leg and antennal sensory neurons and optic lobe neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>). To test whether Acj6 has any role in the neurotransmitter identity of these neurons, we repeated the same experimental procedure in an acj6 mutant background and found no apparent differences in neurotransmitter expression, concluding that Acj6 is dispensable for neurotransmitter identity (not shown). In conclusion, we show that one can quickly assay neuronal identity features such as neurotransmitters and their receptors in specific population of neurons in the entire CNS by simply using the split-GAL4 system and intersecting the expression patterns of a lineage specific gene with the expression of another gene coding for neuronal identity.</p>

<title>Behavioral analysis with targeted lineage manipulation</title>
<p>Understanding the functional roles of specific hemilineages in the VNC is crucial for unraveling the neural circuits that govern behavior, yet the tools to study these lineages in detail have been limited. Harris <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) developed genetic tools to mark and track a small subset of VNC hemilineages through metamorphosis into the adult. This work used thermogenetic methods to stimulate neuronal activity of specific hemilineages to assess their function. This was done with decapitated flies to remove the effect of driver line expression in the brain. However, for many hemilineages, either no driver line existed or only a small portion of a hemilineage was targeted. To overcome these issues, we use our new split-GAL4 combinations to manipulate eight hemilineages for which no drivers previously existed (0A, 1B, 4B,8B, 9B, 14A, 16B, 17A) and to target 16 lineages studied by <italic>Harris et al</italic>., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) with better coverage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We evaluate lineage-coupled behavior with optogenetic activation, a method that is more robust and has a better time resolution compared to thermogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). We show below how this approach is compatible with genetic methods to remove unwanted GAL4-mediated gene expression in the brain by applying a teashirt/FLP based genetic intersection with the LexA/LexAop system to restrict GAL4 expression to the VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). A major advantage of such layered genetic set-up is that behavior can be evaluated in intact flies without the need for decapitation. The lineage-behavior analysis of the 26 hemilineages are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. Recordings of intact and decapitated are available as Supplementary Videos and the video number corresponds to the hemilineage name. In the sections below we summarize four examples.</p>

This contribution is significant, as it is even higher than the 8.7% of synaptic output connections that a GF dedicates to innervating the tergotrochanter motor neuron (TTMn), which innervates the jump muscle. We next compared if those 8B neurons that are downstream partners of the GF also provide input to the GF. Surprisingly, the majority of 8B neurons that connect to the GF are both downstream and upstream synaptic partners. These 9 neurons make up 21.5%. and 9.1% of total GF synaptic inputs and outputs, respectively. Taken together our behavioral data and the connectome analysis suggest that a subset of 8B neurons function in the GF circuit and elicit take-off behavior.</p>

We also observed the following behavioral phenotypes in response to optogenetic activation, but we did not dissect the animals to further identify the lineage clone: high frequency wing beating, backward walking immediately after the stimulus termination, and abdominal extension and bending.

A total of 24 driver lines targeted clusters of neurons in the subesophageal zone (SEZ) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The SEZ processes mechanosensory and gustatory sensory input and controls motor output related to feeding behavior.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ability to trace neuronal lineages across their developmental journey and to manipulate their function is essential to investigate how neurons interconnect to form neuronal circuits and regulate specific behaviors. To address these questions, most studies have focused on a few specific regions of the CNS, e.g., the mushroom body in flies, for which specific genetic tools exist to target defined neuronal populations during developmental and adult life. In this study, we utilized scRNAseq data from the VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) completed its annotation for all but one hemilineage, and analyzed the transcriptome of individual hemilineages. Through this effort, we identified new marker genes for hemilineages, verified their expression patterns in the VNC, and created split-GAL4 driver lines for 24 lineage-specific marker genes lines by editing their genomic loci. By employing binary combinations of these new lines amongst each other or with driver lines established previously, we constructed a comprehensive split-GAL4 library that targets 32 out of 34 hemilineages during development and adult life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), enabling the genetic dissection of how each hemilineage contributes to circuit development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>)</p>

<title>Mapping and manipulating morphological outgrowth patterns of hemilineages during development</title>
<p>The driver line combinations presented here are developmentally stable and most combinations label both embryonic and post-embryonic neurons of the target hemilineage. This makes them a valuable resource for lineage-based dissection of larval nervous system development and function. Furthermore, they target individual hemilineages throughout metamorphosis and adult life. This is critical as the formation and maturation of adult neuronal circuits takes place during metamorphosis and last several days. This time window is greatly prolonged compared to the rapid development of larval circuits that occurs within a few hours during embryogenesis, and offers greater opportunities for experimental manipulation. By layering temperature or light controlled genetic effectors, like shibere<sup>TS</sup>, channelrhodopsins, LACE-Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), with our toolkit, researchers can manipulate neuronal and gene activity with high temporal resolution. This makes it possible to investigate dynamic processes such as synapse formation, circuit assembly, and functional maturation. For example, recent studies demonstrated that developing neuronal circuits exhibit patterned calcium activities during metamorphosis and these activities likely regulate the synaptic connectivity among neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Shibere<sup>TS</sup> expression driven by our driver lines can inhibit the developmentally observed neuronal activity in a specific hemilineage during a specific time window to test whether this manipulation alters the synaptic connectivity of the hemilineage.</p>

<title>8B neurons likely function in the giant-fiber escape circuit</title>
<p>Our work here demonstrated that the activation of 8B neurons elicits robust take-off behavior that closely resembles the GF induced take-off response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). This observation raises an intriguing question: do 8B neurons function in the GF escape circuit? Interestingly, although 8B neurons do not appear to connect directly to TTMns, the primary output neurons of the escape circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), we report that they do form a complex synaptic relationship with the GF. Specifically, a subset of 8B neurons is both upstream and downstream synaptic partners of the GF, accounting for 25% of GF’s synaptic input and 12.5% of GF’s output. This synaptic loop centered around the GF neurons suggests a recurrent feedback mechanism within the GF circuit. Given that hemilineage 8B neurons exhibit interconnectivity with each other and receive leg proprioceptive input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), we speculate that lineage 8B may function as an integrator in and amplifier of the GF circuit. This example underscores that our split-GAL4 library provides an excellent resource for further exploration of lineage-coupled behavior.</p>

<title>Addressing lineage differentiation by studying cell heterogeneity within hemilineages</title>
<p>Our lineage annotation of the VNC transcriptome revealed that most hemilineages are represented by more than one RNAseq cluster, which reflects heterogeneity within a hemilineage and indicates that hemilineages can be further subdivided into subclasses of neurons. Indeed, we found that such subclasses express specific transcription factors, which can be considered subclass-defining factors, for example Tj in hemilineage 0A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The tools we present here form a starting point to visualize or manipulate neuronal subclasses within a hemilineage. For example, one can use the split-GAL4 driver line combinations express an UAS transgene preceded by an FRT-flanked stop codon in a specific lineage. Flipase expression can be easily restricted to a subclass of neurons in a hemilineage with the LexA/LexAop system under control of the subclass-defining transcription factor. As a result, the transgene will only be expressed in a subclass of neurons in a hemilineage. Instead of working with subclass-defining transcription factors, one can also use birth-order marking temporal genes such as <italic>chinmo</italic>, <italic>mamo</italic>, or <italic>broad-c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) to restrict driver activity to a group of neurons born in a specific temporal window within a hemilineage. Thus, with a strategic combination of orthogonal gene specific driver system (e.g., split-GAL4, LexA, and QF), one can now dissect the neuronal circuit formation with unprecedented precision.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study underscores the potential of temporally stable driver lines to target hemilineages in the VNC during development and adult life. This approach enables future studies investigating how neurons acquire their specific fates and integrate into the broader networks of neural networks that control intricate animal behaviors.</p>

<title>Insertion of gene-specific Trojan split-GAL4 construct with CRISPR</title>
<p>Guide RNAs (gRNA) were selected to target all expressed isoforms in an amendable intronic region or to the 3’ end of the gene if no suitable intron was present (e.g., <italic>fer3 and ems</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Key resources Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">Supplementary Table 4</xref>. gRNAs were identified with CRISPR target’ Finder for vas-Cas9 flies, BDSC#51324 with maximum stringency and minimal off-target effects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). gRNA targeting <italic>hb9, vg,</italic> and <italic>H15</italic> were cloned into pCFD4 together with a guide RNA to linearize the donor vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). The remainder of the guides were synthesized into pUC57_GW_OK2 (Genewiz/Azenta (Burlington, MA)).</p>
<p>CRISPR donors were generated using a modified version of the strategy developed by Kanca <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). We used the Genewiz company to synthesize a DNA fragment into the EcoRV site of the pUC57-GW-OK2 vector. This fragment is made of the left and right homology arms (HA) which are immediately adjacent to the gRNA cut site and restriction enzyme sites (SacI-KpnI) between these arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 3 -– figure supplement 2A</xref>). We then directionally cloned the Sac1-attP-FRT-splitGAL4-FRT-attP-KpnI fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure – figure supplement 2B</xref>) in between the left and right HAs using the SacI and KpnI sites. Note that SacI and Kpn should only be chosen when the homology arms do not have these cut sites. To facilitate this last step, we generated universal plasmids in each reading frame for each hemi driver, DBD and p65.AD in the original Trojan vector backbones, referred to as pBS-KS-attP2FRT2-SA-T2AGAL4[AD or DBD (0,1,2)]-Hsp70 with Gibson assembly, combining the following fragments:

The gRNA and entire donor region (a LHA-GAL4-DBD-RHA fragment, without attP and FRT sequences) were synthesized in pUC57_gw_OK2, and injected into vas-Cas9 flies (w[1118]; PBac(y[+mDint2]=vas-Cas9)VK00027) by Rainbow transgenics (Camarillo, CA). Transformed animals were crossed to flies carrying Tubulin-GAL4-AD, UAS-TdTomato and offspring was scored for TdTomato expression to identify positive lines. The expression pattern of the reporter served as a verification for correct editing events; no further verification was performed.</p>

<p>This work presents an <bold>important</bold> genetic toolkit for Drosophila neurobiologists to access and manipulate neuronal lineages during development and adulthood. The evidence supporting the fidelity of this toolkit is <bold>convincing</bold>. This work will interest Drosophila neurobiologists in general, and some of the genetic tools may be used outside the nervous system. The conceptual approaches used in this paper are likely transferable to other fields as comparable data and genomic methods are obtained.</p>

<p>The ventral nerve cord (VNC) of organisms like Drosophila is an invaluable model for studying neural development and organisation in more complex organisms. Its well-defined structure allows researchers to investigate how neurons develop, differentiate, and organise into functional circuits. As a critical central nervous system component, the VNC plays a key role in controlling motor functions, reflexes, and sensory integration.</p>
<p>Particularly relevant to this work, the VNC provides a unique opportunity to explore neuronal hemilineages - groups of neurons that share molecular, genetic, and functional identities. Understanding these hemilineages is crucial for elucidating how neurons cooperate to form specialized circuits, essential for comprehending normal brain function and dysfunction.</p>
<p>A significant challenge in the field has been the lack of developmentally stable, hemilineage-specific driver lines that enable precise tracking and measurement of individual VNC hemilineages. The authors address this need by generating and validating a comprehensive, lineage-specific split-GAL4 driver library.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p>The authors select new marker genes for hemilineages from previously published single-cell data of the VNC. They generate and validate specific and temporally stable lines for almost all the hemilineages in the VNC. They successfully achieved their aims, and their results support their conclusions. This will be a valuable resource for investigating neural circuit formation and function.</p>

<p>It is my pleasure to review this manuscript from Stoffers, Lacin, and colleagues, in which they identify pairs of transcription factors unique to (almost) every ventral nerve cord hemilineage in Drosophila and use these pairs to create reagents to label and manipulate these cells. The advance is sold as largely technical-as a pipeline for identifying durably expressed transcription factor codes in postmitotic neurons from single cell RNAseq data, generating knock-in alleles in the relevant genes, using these to match transcriptional cell types to anatomic cell types, and then using the alleles as a genetic handle on the cells for downstream explication of their function. Yet I think the work is gorgeous in linking the expression of genes that are causal for neuron-type-specific characteristics to the anatomic instantiations of those neurons. It is astounding that the authors are able to use their deep collective knowledge of hemilineage anatomy and gene expression to match 33 of 34 transcriptional profiles. Together with other recent studies, this work drives a major course correction in developmental biology, away from empirically identified cell type &quot;markers&quot; (in Drosophila neuroscience, often genomic DNA fragments that contain enhancers found to be expressed in specific neurons at specific times), and towards methods in which the genes that generate neuronal type identity are actually used to study those neurons. Because the relationship between fate and form/function is built into the tools, I believe that this approach will be a trojan horse to integrate the fields of neural development and systems neuroscience.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Soffers et al. developed a comprehensive genetic toolkit that enables researchers to access neuronal hemilineages during developmental and adult time points using scRNA-seq analysis to guide gene cassette exchange-based or CRISPR-based tool building. Currently, research groups studying neural circuit development are challenged with tying together findings in the development and mature circuit function of hemilineage-related neurons. Here, authors leverage publicly available scRNA-seq datasets to inform the development of a split-Gal4 library that targets 32 of 34 hemilineages in development and adult stages. The authors demonstrated that the split-Gal4 library, or genetic toolkit, can be used to assess the functional roles, neurotransmitter identity, and morphological changes in targeted cells. The tools presented in this study should prove to be incredibly useful to Drosophila neurobiologists seeking to link neural developmental changes to circuit assembly and mature circuit function. Additionally, some hemilineages have more than one split-Gal4 combination that will be advantageous for studies seeking to disrupt associated upstream genes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Informing genetic tool development with publicly available scRNA-seq datasets is a powerful approach to creating specific driver lines. Additionally, this approach can be easily replicated by other researchers looking to generate similar driver lines for more specific subpopulations of cells, as mentioned in the Discussion.</p>
<p>The unification of optogenetic stimulation data of 8B neurons and connectomic analysis of the Giant-Fiber-induced take-off circuit was an excellent example of the utility of this study. The link between hemilineage-specific functional assays and circuit assembly has been limited by insufficient genetic tools. The tools and data present in this study will help better understand how collections of hemilineages develop in a genetically constrained manner to form circuits amongst each other selectively.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although cell position, morphology (to some extent), and gene expression are good markers to track cell identity across developmental time, there are genetic tools available that could have been used to permanently label cells that expressed genes of interest from birth, ensuring that the same cells are being tracked in fixed tissue images.</p>
<p>Although gene activation is a good proxy for assaying neurochemical features, relying on whether neurochemical pathway genes are activated in a cell to determine its phenotype can be misleading given that the Trojan-Gal4 system commandeers the endogenous transcriptional regulation of a gene but not its post-transcriptional regulation. Therefore, neurochemical identity is best identified via protein detection. (strong language used in this section of the paper).</p>
<p>The authors mainly rely on the intersectional expression of transcription factors to generate split-Gal4 lines and target hemilineages specifically. However, the Introduction (Lines 97-99) makes a notable point about how driver lines in the past, which have also predominantly relied on the regulatory sequences of transcription factors, lack the temporal stability to investigate hemilineages across time. This point seems to directly conflict with the argument made in the Results (Lines 126-127) that states that most transcription factors are stably expressed in hemilineage neurons that express them. It is generally known that transcription factors can be expressed stably or transiently depending on the context. It is unclear how using the genes of transcription factors in this study circumvents the issue of creating temporally stable driver lines.</p>
