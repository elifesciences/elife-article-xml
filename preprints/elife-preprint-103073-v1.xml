<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cellular senescence, characterized by a permanent state of cell cycle arrest and a secretory phenotype contributing to inflammation and tissue deterioration, has emerged as a target for age-related interventions. Accumulation of senescent cells is closely linked with intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, a prevalent age-dependent chronic disorder causing low back pain. Previous studies have highlighted that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) mitigated IVD degeneration through anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, and pro-anabolism. However, its impact on IVD cell senescence remains elusive. In this study, human NP and AF cells derived from aged, degenerated IVDs were treated with recombinant human (rh) PDGF-AB/BB for 5 days and changes of transcriptome profiling were examined through mRNA sequencing. NP and AF cells demonstrated similar but distinct responses to the treatment. However, the effects of PDGF-AB and BB on human IVD cells were comparable. Specifically, PDGF-AB/BB treatment resulted in downregulation of gene clusters related to neurogenesis and response to mechanical stimulus in AF cells while the downregulated genes in NP cells were mainly associated with metabolic pathways. In both NP and AF cells, PDGF-AB and BB treatment upregulated the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, mesenchymal cell differentiation, and response to reduced oxygen levels, while downregulating the expression of genes related to senescence associated phenotype, including oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondria dysfunction. Network analysis revealed that PDGFRA and IL6 were the top hub genes in treated NP cells. Furthermore, in irradiation-induced senescent NP cells, PDGFRA gene expression was significantly reduced compared to non-irradiated cells. However, rhPDGF-AB/BB treatment increased PDGFRA expression and mitigated the senescence progression through increased cell population in the S phase, reduced SA-β-Gal activity, and decreased expression of senescence related regulators including P21, P16, IL6, and NF-κB. Our findings reveal a novel anti-senescence role of PDGF in the IVD, demonstrating its ability to alleviate the senescent phenotype and protect against the progression of senescence. This makes it a promising candidate for preventing or treating IVD degeneration by targeting cellular senescence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Low back pain (LBP), ranked as the first cause of years lived with disability, is a prevalent condition. Although the etiology of LBP is multifactorial, a major contributor of LBP is intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, which is increasing exponentially due to a growing aged population worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Current treatments, such as medicine, physical therapy, and surgical excision of the herniated tissues, only temporally alleviate painful symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). In fact, patients often experience persistent LBP after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The fundamental cause of this is the inadequate knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology mechanisms leading to IVD degeneration. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration and develop novel therapeutic interventions to mitigate the degenerative processes.</p>
<p>The IVD consists of three compartments: the gelatinous nucleus pulposus (NP), fibrous annulus fibrosus (AF), and cartilaginous endplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). NP and AF tissues play distinct yet complementary roles in maintaining the spinal function. The NP has high content of proteoglycans and water, absorbing and distributing mechanical forces. In contrast, AF consists of multiple layers of concentric lamellae, which provides strength and stability to the disc and withstands compressive forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). To date, the main focus of IVD cell studies has been on the NP. It is often the first site impacted during aging and degeneration, indicating the crucial role of NP cells in the initiation of IVD degeneration. In contrast, degenerated alterations in the AF are more closely linked to pain and disability. As a result, effective therapeutic strategies for IVD degeneration should aim to restore the functionality of the entire disc unit.</p>
<p>Cellular senescence, triggered by normal cells in response to various intrinsic and extrinsic stressors, is a fundamental mechanism underlying age-related chronic diseases. Senescent cells are featured by irreversible growth arrest and acquire a senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue-damaging proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Activation of P53/P21 and P16 pathways play a critical role in regulating senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In addition, NF-κB pathway is a major pathway involved in the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Factors within the SASP can act in an autocrine manner to reinforce the senescent state and induce senescence in neighboring cells via paracrine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). This mechanism elucidates the accumulation of senescent cells with aging and its associated detrimental effects. In the IVD, it has been well established that the number of senescent cells increases with aging and IVD degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), as demonstrated by increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) positive cells and decreased cell proliferation. Growing research also demonstrates that targeting cellular senescence holds promise in alleviating the progression of IVD degeneration. Long-term systemic or local clearance of senescent cells by senolytic drugs mitigated the age-related IVD degeneration in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix proteases and restored IVD structure in an injury-induced IVD degeneration model in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Cherif et al. and Mannarino et al. demonstrated that in humans, senolytic drugs o-Vanillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) and RG-7112 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) attenuated NP cellular senescence, where a combination of these two senolytic drugs reduced the release of inflammatory factors and pain mediators in degenerated NP cells from low back pain patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>PDGF is a major constituent of platelet rich plasma (PRP), which is widely used in the clinical setting for tissue regeneration and repair. It can be made of a homodimer of A, B, C, and D polypeptide chains, or an AB heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Among these, PDGF-AB and -BB are the predominant forms in PRPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Two types of PDGFR (PDGFRA and PDGFRB) were identified that differ in ligand-binding specificity. PDGFRA binds to all PDGF chains but D chain while PDGFRB only binds to B and D chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Upon binding, PDGF-PDGFR network induces a cascade of phosphorylation in pathways including cell proliferation, migration, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). We previously demonstrated that recombinant human PDGF-BB (rhPDGF-BB) inhibited cell apoptosis while promoting cell proliferation and matrix production in human IVD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Furthermore, when delivered via hydrogel, rhPDGF-BB successfully inhibited IVD degeneration and restored IVD biomechanical function in a rabbit preclinical model of puncture-induced IVD degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). In the current study, we hypothesize that PDGF-AB and -BB mitigated IVD degenerating through targeting cellular senescence. To test it, aged, degenerated human IVD cells were treated with rhPDGF-AB or -BB and transcriptome profiling was performed on treated NP and AF cells. We found similar but distinct responses to the treatment between NP and AF cells. In NP cells, PDGF-AB and -BB treatment upregulated the expression of PDGFRA and genes involved in cell cycle progression while downregulating the expression of genes related to ROS production, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. The alterations in these pathways indicated that the senescent phenotype was alleviated in human degenerated IVD cells treated with PDGF-AB/BB. Interestingly, in human senescent NP cells induced by irradiation, PDGFRA was significantly reduced while PDGF-AB/BB treatment prevented the progression of senescence through increased cell cycle progression and reduced SA-β-Gal staining and the expression of P21, P16, NF-κB, and IL6. In contrast, AF cells treated with PDGF-AB/BB showed alleviated senescent phenotype independent of PDGFRA.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Sample collection and cell extraction</title>
<p>This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. All experiments and procedures were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of Emory University (IRB #00099028) approval. Human degenerated NP and AF tissues (Grade IV or V on Pfirrman grade) were obtained from donors after discectomy surgeries for discogenic pain, with each donor providing written informed consent. Healthy NP and AF cells were gifted by Professor Lisbet A. Haglund from McGill University (Tissue Biobank #2019-4896). The donor information was listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. NP and AF cells were extracted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Isolated cells were expanded in growth medium containing low glucose DMEM, 10% FBS, 1X antibiotic-antimycotic (Thermofisher Scientific, 15240062), and 50 µg/ml L-Ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma, A8960). Cells were grown at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 20% O<sub>2</sub>. To minimize the variability between experiments that may be caused by changes in cell behavior with each passage, cells of passage 3 were used for each experiment.</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>RNA-sequencing</title>
<p>To synchronize cells and enhance the sensitivity of cells to PDGF stimulation, degenerated NP (n =5/each group) and AF cells (n =6/each group) were serum-deprived in low glucose medium containing 0.2% FBS for 1 day before treating with PDGF-AB (40ng/ml) or -BB (20ng/ml) for 5 days. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (ThermoFisher Scientific, 15596018) and purified using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, 217084). Genomic DNA contamination was eliminated through on-column DNase digestion. The concentration and quality of RNA were determined using Nanodrop and RNA integrity was assessed by Agilent 2200 Bioanalyzer. RNA samples (NP: n = 5, AF: n = 6) with RIN &gt; 7 were shipped in dry ice to Novogene for RNA-sequencing, which was carried out using NovaSeq 6000 (Novogene Corporation Inc). Libraries were constructed from 0.2μg RNA using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Quality control was performed for distribution of sequencing error rate and GC content and data filtering was performed to remove the low-quality reads and reads containing adapters. The resulting sequences were uploaded into the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (PRJNA1150962). The clean reads were mapped to human reference genome sequence using DNASTAR.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<label>2.3</label><title>Differential gene expression analysis of RNA-seq data</title>
<p>Unnormalized raw counts exported from DNASTAR were used for pairwise gene expression comparison between untreated and PDGF-AB/BB samples. Differential expression genes (DEGs) were identified using DESeq2 package in R and DEGs with fold change greater than 1.5 and adjusted p value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Heatmap and volcano plots and principal component analysis were performed to visualize the DEGs between untreated and PDGF-AB/BB samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<label>2.4</label><title>Pathway enrichment analysis</title>
<p>To identify the biological process that DEGs were enriched, Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using upregulated and downregulated DEGs separately in R. The significantly enriched GO terms were visualized by dot plot analysis. GeneRatio in X-axis was calculated by the ratio of gene counts enriched in a particular GO term to all the gene counts annotated in the GO term.</p>
<p>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed on all the genes to determine whether a predefined set of genes is significantly enriched in untreated or PDGF-BB samples. GSEA was conducted based on KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database using clusterProfiler package in R(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) and a gene set was considered significantly enriched when the false discovery rate (FDR) was less than 0.05. Enrichment score (ES) was calculated to reflect the degree to which a gene set is overrepresented in our dataset, which was ranked based on fold change. Normalized enrichment score (NES) is the ES normalized to the gene set size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<label>2.5</label><title>Protein-protein interaction network analysis</title>
<p>The interactions among DEGs were performed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database (v12.0) with an interaction score greater than 0.4. Discrete proteins were removed, and the node files were exported and visualized in Cytospace (v3.10.0). To identify essential nodes in the interaction network, the betweenness centrality among the nodes was calculated using CytoNCA plugin (v2.1.6) in Cytospace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) and the top 10 hub nodes were identified using CyoHubba plugin (v0.1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).</p>

In contrast, NP cells had 563 downregulated and 423 upregulated genes in rhPDGF-AB treated group and 409 downregulated and 404 upregulated genes in rhPDGF-BB treated group. The top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were annotated according to FDR and most of these genes exhibited similarity between treatment groups in both AF and NP cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A+B</xref>). Furthermore, a heat map visualizing the top 50 DEGs by fold change revealed variability among donors while demonstrating an overall consistent response to rhPDGF-AB/BB treatment across the samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C+D</xref>). Tissue-specific changes were observed in AF and NP cells when treated with rhPDGF-AB/BB. For example, <italic>SLC26A4</italic> (Pendrin) and <italic>CA2</italic>, regulators of the process of transporting and producing bicarbonate, are involved in the homeostatic control of pH in various type of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and their expression was upregulated in NP cells when treated with rhPDGF-AB/BB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). <italic>MAMDC2</italic> and <italic>COL21A1</italic>, involved in extracellular matrix organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), were also upregulated in NP cells while <italic>WISP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and <italic>RARRES2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), modulators of the induction of inflammatory mediators and immune response, were downregulated after treatment. In contrast, in addition to the commonly upregulated <italic>CA2, MDMC2</italic> and <italic>RARRES2</italic>, AF cells showed alterations in genes involved in mechanical stress, pain sensation, and angiogenesis, such as <italic>CSRP3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), <italic>PI16</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), <italic>EFEMP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) and <italic>SLC26A4-AS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).

<p>To investigate the enriched biological processes (BP) induced by rhPDGF-AB/BB treatment in AF cells, gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using upregulated and downregulated DEGs separately. As expected, the biological processes between rhPDGF-AB and -BB treated samples were mostly overlapping (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A+B</xref>). In AF cells, upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in biological processes including regulation of cell cycle and chromosome segregation. Furthermore, AF cells demonstrated upregulated pathways including mesenchymal cell differentiation and response to oxygen levels and downregulated pathways including response to ROS and oxidative stress (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, the treatment downregulated groups of genes related to neurogenesis and response to mechanical stimulus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In line with the results of GO analysis, GSEA analysis revealed an overrepresentation of cell cycle pathway in rhPDGF-AB/BB treated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, the ErbB signaling pathway, proteasome pathway, and cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway were enriched, suggesting that PDGF-AB/BB treatment promoted cell growth, protein turnover, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

<p>To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of PDGF-AB/BB in degenerated NP cells, DEGs between untreated and treated groups were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks through STRING and Cytoscape software. The network of the top 10 hub nodes based on betweenness was demonstrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and it revealed the strong correlation between <italic>PDGFRA (</italic>PDGF receptor alpha) and <italic>IL6, MDM2</italic>, <italic>MDM2</italic>, <italic>CCND1, PIK3R1, NOP53, FN1,</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic>.

PDGF-AB/BB increased the gene expression of PDGFRA in only NP cells and reduced the IL6 gene expression in both type of cells. Taken together, NP and AF cells responded differently to PDGF-AB/BB treatment, but both cell types showed a positive regulation of cell cycle and inhibited inflammation, response to ROS, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, indicating a role of PDGF-AB/BB in IVD cell senescence.</p>

<label>3.4</label><title>Induction of NP cellular senescence through X-ray radiation</title>
<p>To test our hypothesis that PDGF-AB/BB provides protection against the progression of cellular senescence in the IVD, we first created a cellular senescence model using X-ray radiation. The healthy NP cells were exposed to 5, 10 and 15 Gy of irradiation and cultured for 7-10 days to develop senescent phenotype. SA-β-gal staining was performed to detect senescent cells. We found that non-irradiated, proliferating NP cells showed elongated, spindle-shaped morphology and faint SA-β-gal staining at day 7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, cells exposed to 5 and 10 Gy of irradiation developed characteristics of a senescent cell phenotype — enlarged cell size, low cell number, and a higher percentage of SA-β-gal positive cells. However, cells exposed to 15 Gy of radiation underwent significant cell death, showing negligible SA-β-gal staining. As a result, we excluded the 15 Gy dosage group in subsequent studies. To quantify cell growth, MTT assay was performed, which revealed reduced cell proliferation under 5 and 10 Gy of irradiation compared to the non-irradiated group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the expression of senescence related markers — Lamin B1, P21 and P16. Lamin B1 is a structural component of the nucleus, and its loss is a senescence-associated biomarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Non-irradiated cells displayed nuclear Lamin B1 expression while its expression was lost in healthy NP cells exposed to 5 and 10 Gy of irradiation for 7 days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Meanwhile, nuclear localization of P21 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and P16 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) was observed in irradiated cells, with little immunopositivity in non-irradiated cells at day 7. However, the transcripts of <italic>P21</italic> and <italic>P16</italic> were not significantly decreased until day 10 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E+F</xref>).

Furthermore, the gene expression of <italic>PDGFRA</italic> was significantly decreased in cells under 10 Gy of irradiation at day 10.

<p>To investigate the protective effects of PDGF-AB/BB against cell senescence in the IVD, healthy human NP and AF cells were exposed to 10Gy of irradiation, followed by immediate treatment with 20 ng/ml rhPDGF-AB/BB for 10 days.

In rhPDGF-AB treated cells, the percentage of cell population in the S phase was increased in AF cells, but not significantly in NP cells. These findings suggested that PDGF-AB/BB rescued IVD cells from cell cycle arrest in irradiation induced senescent cells. Additionally, SA-β-gal staining demonstrated an increase in the number of senescent cells after irradiation at day 10, whereas a decrease was examined in rhPDGF-AB/BB treated NP and AF cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study has shown for the first time that PDGF-AB and -BB treatment not only alleviated the senescent phenotype, but also suppressed the progression of cellular senescence in the IVD. Specifically, in aged, degenerated human NP and AF cells, PDGF-AB/BB treatment suppressed the ROS accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the resultant oxidative stress, while stimulating cell cycle progression. In the NP, PDGFRA was among the top hub genes that showed strong interaction with other genes. Moreover, its expression was significantly reduced in irradiation induced senescent cells. Importantly, immediate PDGF-BB treatment after irradiation promoted the expression of <italic>PDGFRA</italic> and provided protection to IVD cells against acquiring senescence associated phenotype. This novel function of PDGF-BB/PDGFRA signaling is likely linked to their ability to inhibit NF-κB, P16, and P21 pathways in NP cells. In contrast, PDGF-AB/BB alleviated the senescent phenotype in AF cells independent of PDGFRA.</p>
<p>Senescence is a key contributor to the onset and the progression of IVD degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). It can occur naturally with aging or can be triggered by growth factor deficiency, radiation, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and inflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Senescent cells exit the cell cycle and cannot divide; their accumulation reduce the IVD’s ability to generate new cells to replace apoptotic or necrotic cells. It has been well established that increased number of senescent cells was positively correlated with the IVD aging and the severity of degeneration while negatively correlated with the percentage of proliferating cells in human NP and AF tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Since PDGF is a mitogenic growth factor and promotes cell proliferation in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), it is intriguing to explore whether PDGF-AB/BB could mitigate or prevent against the cellular senescence in IVDs. We observed groups of upregulated genes regulating cell cycle progression and cell proliferation in PDGF-AB/BB treated NP cells. AF cells also had an upregulation of chromosome segregation and mitotic nuclear division pathways, suggesting that these cells were actively proliferating. Cell cycle progression is controlled by cyclins, and the expression of cyclin D1 and B1, regulators of the G1/S and G2/M phase transition respectively, was increased in degenerated NP cells after PDGF-AB/BB treatment. Transcriptomic analysis also revealed that increased cyclin D1 was among the top hub nodes, tightly regulated by PDGF-AB and BB. In addition, cell cycle analysis confirmed that PDGF-AB/BB induced the transition from G1 to S1 phase in senescent IVD cells. Our data suggested that PDGF treatment led to an increase in the proliferation of senescent IVD cells in the S phase likely through cyclin D1 and B1. These findings were in accordance with previous studies showing that PDGF stimulated cell proliferation and cyclin D1 expression in rat mesangial cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), rat adventitial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), and human vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>).</p>
<p>The antisenescence of PDGF has been demonstrated in several studies. For example, PDGF-BB decreased SA-β-gal positive cells and the expression of P53 and P21 while enhancing proliferative potential in senescent human dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from immune thrombocytopenia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). PDGF exerts its function by binding to its receptors, thereby triggering a cascade of intracellular signaling events, such as cell proliferation and survival. The PDGF-PDGFRA signaling is often suppressed in premature aged or senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), suggesting that PDGF signaling dysfunction might be involved in senescence or aging. Notably, our transcriptome data has shown that both PDGF-AB and -BB induced the expression of <italic>PDGFRA</italic> in aged, degenerated NP cells. This autoregulatory loop caused IVD cells to become more sensitive to PDGF treatment and augmented the signaling cascades triggered by PDGF binding, including senescence-associated P21, P16, P53, and NF-κB pathways. In line with this thought, PPI analysis revealed that <italic>PDGFRA</italic> closely interacted with upregulated <italic>MDM2</italic>, a negative regulator of P53. NF-κB signaling is a major signaling pathway that is involved in inflamm-aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) and induces the onset of SASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), such as IL6, IL8, and CXCL1. In our study, irradiation in NP cells led to decreased <italic>PDGFRA</italic> expression, which impaired the activity of PDGF/PDGRFA signaling. However, PDGF-BB treatment promoted the expression of <italic>PDGFRA</italic> and decreased the expression of <italic>P21, P16,</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> in senescent NP cells, likely by inhibiting NF-κB signaling. These findings support the idea that PDGF treatment could stimulate the expression of <italic>PDGFRA</italic> and prevent healthy IVD cells from developing senescent phenotype. Further studies using preclinical animal models to validify the protectiveness of PDGF against the onset or progression of senescence in the IVD will offer more robust evidence.</p>
<p>Degenerated IVD cells experienced an imbalance between ROS accumulation and antioxidant capacity, leading to oxidative stress, which is involved in cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Mitochondrion is the primary location of intracellular ROS production and its dysfunction in degenerated IVD cells causes electron leakage, resulting in the formation of superoxide radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). PDGF-AB/BB treatment suppressed the activity of damaged mitochondria, leading to decreased ROS and oxidative stress in degenerated NP and AF cells, as indicated by GO BP analysis. Consistently, GSEA revealed the underrepresentation of oxidative phosphorylation in treated NP cells. The downregulation of genes related to mitochondria activity and oxidative phosphorylation may be indicative of a shift in metabolic pathways, leading cells to potentially prioritize alterative pathways such as glycolysis. Indeed, PDGF treatment upregulated groups of genes involved in response to decreased oxygen levels, suggesting that the treatment activated cellular mechanisms involving in sensing and adapting to low oxygen conditions. In line with this idea, it has been demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor 1α is highly expressed in healthy NP cells to suppress oxidative phosphorylation and enhanced glycolysis, allowing cells to adjust to a hypoxia microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Conversely, degenerated NP cells show an opposite metabolic pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>).</p>
<p>Besides the anti-senescence, NP and AF cells responded differently to PDGF-AB/BB treatment. AF cells were more responsive to the treatment with twice as many DEGs as NP cells. The difference in tissue architecture and cellular contents between NP and AF contributes to their specialized functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). The multiple layers of concentric lamellae in the AF enables it to withstand circumferential loads while this highly organized structure was disrupted with aging and degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). In addition, damage to the AF has the potential to stimulate neovascularization and nerve ingrowth, provoking an inflammatory response and contributing to low back pain. PDGF-AB/BB treatment downregulated groups of genes related to neurogenesis and response to mechanical stimulus in AF cells while downregulated genes in the NP were more associated with metabolic pathways, providing evidence that the treatment enhanced IVD functionality in different aspects between the two compartments.</p>
<p>Senescence as a central hallmark of aging can be induced by several factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). One limitation of this study is that we did not examine the protective effects of PDGF-AB/BB treatment on senescence using other senescence models. In addition, our findings were obtained in vitro experiments, so caution is needed when interpreting our data. Our future work will focus on establishing an appropriate experimental animal model to study the functions of PDGF on cellular senescence.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated a novel function of PDGF in human NP and AF cells. PDGF-AB/BB treatment alleviated oxidative stress and mitochondria dysfunction while stimulating cell cycle progression in degenerated IVD cells. In addition, the treatment protected healthy NP and AF cells against the progression of senescence induced by irradiation. Our results suggest that PDGF-AB/BB could be a promising candidate for preventing or treating IVD degeneration by targeting cellular senescence.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of recombinant human PDGF-AB/BB proteins in reducing the senescent signatures of primary human intervertebral disc cells. The study represents a significant advance in the treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration and can be applied broadly to other degenerative musculoskeletal tissues through the suppression of senescence. <bold>Solid</bold> evidence, primarily based on transcriptomic analysis and direct protein measurements from relatively homogeneous cell populations, supports the therapeutic potential of PDGF, but more experimental details would be needed to make the evidence stronger.</p>

<p>The authors, Zhang et al., demonstrate the beneficial effects of treating degenerate human primary intervertebral disc (IVD) cells with recombinant human PDGF-AB/BB on the senescence transcriptomic signatures. Utilizing a combination of degenerate cells from elderly humans and experimentally induced senescence in young, healthy IVD cells, the authors show the therapeutic effects on mRNA transcription as well as cellular processes through informatics approaches.</p>
<p>One notable strength of this study is the use of human primary cells and recombinant forms of human PDGF-AB/BB proteins, which increases the translational potential of these in vitro studies. The manuscript is well-written, and the informatics analyses are thorough and clearly presented.</p>
<p>However, in its current form, the study does not provide sufficient experimental details, and clarifications are needed. These are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The source of PDGF-AB/BB proteins is not detailed.</p>
<p>
(2) The irradiation parameters are not adequately reported - the authors should consider (PMCID: PMC5495460) for the parameters that should be reported.</p>
<p>
(3) The criteria for young and old patient donors are not explicitly described - though from the table, one presumes the cut-off for young is 27 years old.</p>
<p>
(4) What is the rationale for using different concentrations of PDGF-AB/BB in the degenerate cell and irradiation experiments?</p>
<p>There are also a number of other issues the authors could consider. First, in the title and throughout the manuscript, the effects of PDGF-AB/BB are described as protective, yet in all the experiments, PDGF-AB/BB appears to be administered following either in vivo degeneration or in vitro irradiation, where protective effects (e.g., administration prior to insult) were not tested. Therefore, the effects of PDGF-AB/BB may be more accurately described as mitigating or therapeutic rather than protective.</p>
<p>The authors state that the focus on NP (nucleus pulposus) cell studies is due to NP being the first site impacted during degeneration. However, this reviewer believes that this is because changes in the NP are more clinically evident (by imaging methods), despite degeneration often initiating from the AF (annulus fibrosus), e,g. through tears/microtears.</p>
<p>A prior study has examined the effects of X-ray irradiation on NF-kB signaling in young and aged IVDs (PMCID: PMC5495460), and the authors may wish to consider this work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work highlights a novel role for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in mitigating cellular senescence associated with age-related and painful intervertebral disc degeneration. Prior literature has demonstrated the importance of the accumulation of senescent cells in mediating many of the pathological effects associated with the degenerate disc joint such as inflammation and tissue breakdown. In this study, the authors treat clinically relevant human nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cells from patients undergoing discectomy with recombinant PDGF-AB/BB for 5 days and then deep phenotyped the outcomes using bulk RNA sequencing. In addition, they irradiated healthy human disc cells which they subsequently treated with PDGF-AB/BB examining the expression of SASP-related markers and also PDGFRA receptor gene expression. Overall PDGF was able to down-regulate many senescent-associated pathways and the degenerate phenotype in IVD cells. Altered pathways were associated with neurogenesis, mechanical stimuli, metabolism, cell cycle, reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall the authors achieved their aims and the results by and large support their conclusions although improvements could be made to enhance the rigor of the study and findings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength of this study is the use of human cells from patients undergoing discectomy for disc herniation as well as access to healthy human cells. Investigating the role of PDGF regarding cellular senescence in the degenerate disc joint is a novel and underexplored area of research which is a significant contribution to the field of spine. This study highlights a potential target for addressing cellular senescence where most of the prior focus has been on senolytic drugs. Such studies have broad implications for other age-related diseases where senescence plays a major role. The use of transcriptomics and therefore an unbiased approach to investigating the role of PDGF is also considered a strength as are the follow-up studies involving irradiating healthy human disc cells and treating these cells with PDGF. The combined assessment of both nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cells in the context of these studies adds to the impact.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness of these studies lies in the lack of experimental details provided in the methodology including the rationale for such methods/conditions. Many details such as the specific culture models utilized, substrates, cell density, and media components are missing which impacts rigor. Such details would strengthen the manuscript and the ability to replicate and build on such work/findings. An additional weakness relates to qualitative data presented such as the B-galactosidase assay and immunofluorescence of senescence-associated proteins such as P21 and P16. Quantification of such data sets would greatly strengthen the studies and lend further support to the hypotheses. The study in its current form could be strengthened by the inclusion of mechanistic studies probing the downstream PDGF receptor-associated pathways for example specifically targeting or modulating the activity of the PDGF receptor PDGFRA including validation of the gene data for PDGFRA with protein level data to determine if the transcripts are being translated to protein. The claim that in annulus fibrosus cells, PDGF do not mediate their effects via the PDGFRA does not appear to be supported by the current data as only gene expression for the receptor was assessed with no functional or mechanistic studies being performed. Further discussion, interpretation, and direct comparison of the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus data sets would be helpful for the readers. The magnitude of changes related to the effects of PDGF-BB on the S-phase in irradiated NP and AF cells between control and treated groups seem small making interpretation of these findings challenging.</p>
