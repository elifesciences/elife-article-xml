<title>Abstract</title><p>Circulating lactate is a fuel source for liver metabolism but may exacerbate metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Indeed, haploinsufficiency of lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) in mice reportedly promotes resistance to hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Here, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver thyroxin binding globulin (TBG)-Cre or lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (Lrat)-Cre to MCT1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice on a choline deficient, high fat NASH diet to deplete hepatocyte or stellate cell MCT1, respectively. Stellate cell MCT1KO (AAV-Lrat-Cre) attenuated liver type 1 collagen protein expression and caused a downward trend in trichrome staining. MCT1 depletion in cultured human LX2 stellate cells also diminished collagen 1 protein expression. Tetra-ethylenglycol-cholesterol (Chol)-conjugated siRNAs, which enter all hepatic cell types, and hepatocyte-selective tri-N-acetyl galactosamine (GN)-conjugated siRNAs were then used to evaluate MCT1 function in a genetically obese NASH mouse model. MCT1 silencing by Chol-siRNA decreased liver collagen 1 levels, while hepatocyte-selective MCT1 depletion by AAV-TBG-Cre or by GN-siRNA unexpectedly increased collagen 1 and total fibrosis without effect on triglyceride accumulation. These findings demonstrate that stellate cell lactate transporter MCT1 significantly contributes to liver fibrosis through increased collagen 1 protein expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, while hepatocyte MCT1 appears not to be an attractive therapeutic target for NASH.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, afflicting over a quarter of the world’s population. It describes a spectrum of liver diseases ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Steatosis is considered relatively benign as lifestyle modifications can reverse fatty liver to a healthy condition. On the other hand, NASH is characterized by severe steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Severe fibrotic stages of NASH can develop into permanent liver damage, and the disease can progress to cirrhosis and hepatoma. Currently, NASH is a leading cause for liver transplantation, and there is no FDA-approved therapeutic for NASH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Since NASH is closely associated with the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes and obesity, including chronic overnutrition, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, it is likely that substrate overload to the liver contributes to its cause<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Accordingly, NAFLD and NASH patients display hyperactive liver tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux due to an overabundance of upstream metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that lowering substrate influx to the liver is a promising strategy to prevent and possibly alleviate steatosis and NASH.</p>
<p>Human subjects with type 2 diabetes and obesity reportedly have increased plasma lactate levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Lactate is produced and released into the circulation when cellular glycolytic flux surpasses mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Once considered to be simply a metabolic waste product, lactate is now recognized as a primary fuel for the TCA cycle in liver and thus an essential energy source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Additionally, it is a critical regulator that contributes to whole-body energy homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Under physiological conditions, cellular lactate levels are tightly controlled by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). MCTs are members of the solute carrier 16A (SLC16A) family, which are proton-coupled transmembrane protein transporters. Among 14 MCT isoforms, only MCTs 1-4 have been shown to transport monocarboxylate molecules such as lactate, pyruvate, short-chain fatty acids, and ketone bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Notably, MCT1/SLC16A1 is denoted as a primary lactate transporter as it is the most widely distributed MCT isoform in various metabolic tissues and has a high affinity for lactate, maintaining basal cellular homeostasis according to transmembrane lactate gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Reportedly, MCT1 haploinsufficiency in mice reduces MCT1 protein levels to nearly half in major metabolic tissues such as liver, brain, and white adipose tissues, and these mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and liver steatosis and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The role of MCT1 in hypothalamus and adipose tissues in these phenotypes was ruled out, as selective MCT1 depletion in those tissues either increased food intake and body weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> or enhanced systemic inflammation and insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Thus, the question of which tissue or tissues are responsible for the phenotype of whole body MCT1 haploinsufficiency is not solved.</p>
<p>The above considerations suggest the possibility that MCT1KO in one or more liver cell types may explain the effects of MCT1 haploinsufficiency in mice. Since hepatocytes account for the majority of liver cells and have high rates of lipogenesis and triglyceride (TG) accumulation, lactate levels governed by hepatocyte MCT1 could be involved in regulating steatosis. On the other hand, while hepatic stellate cells account for only 5-10% of the hepatic cell population, they are the major cell type contributing to hepatic fibrogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Fate tracing studies have revealed that 82-96% of myofibroblasts are derived from hepatic stellate cells, which are liver-specific pericytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. During NASH progression, multiple liver injury signals stimulate the transition of vitamin A-storing quiescent hepatic stellate cells into fibrogenic, proliferative myofibroblasts that produce and secrete collagen fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. As a result, healthy hepatic parenchyma is replaced with a collagen-rich extracellular matrix, turning the liver into a hardened and scarred tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In general, major organ fibrosis is directly correlated with morbidity and mortality, contributing up to 45 % of deaths in developed countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, targeting activated hepatic stellate cells has become a major strategy in NASH therapeutics development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, the role of MCT1 in hepatic stellate cells activation or fibrogenesis has not been investigated.</p>
<p>The aim of the present studies was to investigate the role of hepatic lactate transport via MCT1 in lipid metabolism and fibrogenesis in NASH, and to determine its potential suitability as a therapeutic target. Two key unanswered questions were of particular interest: 1) is it hepatocyte-specific MCT1 depletion that protects mice with MCT1 haploinsufficiency from liver lactate overload and NAFLD and 2) does liver stellate cell MCT1 promote hepatic fibrogenesis that occurs in NASH? We tested the possible enhancement of lipogenesis and fat accumulation via MCT1 function specifically in hepatocytes using adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated thyroxin binding globulin (TBG)-Cre MCT1KO in MCT1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, and in other experiments by silencing hepatocyte MCT1 with tri-N-acetyl galactosamine (GN)-conjugated siRNA. These experiments showed hepatocyte MCT1 loss decreased expression of enzymes in the <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis (DNL) pathway, but did not diminish overall steatosis. Surprisingly, hepatocyte MCT1KO increased liver fibrosis in two mouse models of NASH. In contrast, hepatic stellate cell-selective MCT1KO, achieved by injection of AAV9-lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (Lrat)-Cre into MCT1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, did attenuate collagen production and fibrosis. Our findings underscore the critical importance of implementing cell type-specific targeting strategies to diminish NASH fibrogenesis.</p>

<title>MCT1 depletion prevents transforming growth factor 1β (Tgf1β)-stimulated type 1 collagen production in cultured human LX2 stellate cells</title>

<title>Identification of a potent, chemically modified siRNA candidate targeting MCT1</title>
<p>Given the therapeutic potential of <italic>MCT1</italic> silencing in preventing fibrogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), we aimed to develop MCT1-siRNA compounds, chemically modified for stability, potency and delivery <italic>in vivo</italic> for use in this research and potentially for therapeutic advancement. Asymmetrical siRNA compounds used here are composed of 15 double-strand nucleotides with a short overhanging single-strand that promotes cellular uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. To enhance the stability of the constructs, the 2’-OH of each ribose was modified to either 2’-O-methyl or 2’-fluoro. In addition, phosphorothioate linkage backbone modifications were applied to avoid exonuclease degradation. Tetra-ethylenglycol-cholesterol linker (Chol) was conjugated to the 3’ end-sense strand to enhance stability and cellular uptake of candidate compounds.

<p>To validate the biodistribution of siRNAs with these two conjugates, 10mg/kg of each siRNA was subcutaneously injected into 16-18 weeks-old male C57BL/6 wild-type mice twice within a 15 day period. On day 15, mice were sacrificed and the livers were perfused to isolate multiple hepatic cell types, including hepatocytes, stellate cells, and Kupffer cells. Isolation of each hepatic cell type was validated for enrichment (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 1A-1F</xref>). As expected, GN-conjugated, fully chemically modified MCT1-siRNA (GN-MCT1-siRNA) silenced <italic>Mct1</italic> mRNA only in the hepatocyte fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>), as GN binds to the asialoglycoprotein receptor primarily expressed in hepatocytes. On the other hand, Chol-MCT1-siRNA silenced <italic>Mct1</italic> mRNA levels in all hepatic cell types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>), as its cellular uptake is highly dependent on the non-specific, hydrophobic interaction between cholesterol and plasma membranes. Notably, the hepatic stellate cell fraction distinguishes GN-MCT1-siRNA from Chol-MCT1<italic>-</italic>siRNA in biodistribution, as only the latter silences <italic>Mct1</italic> in stellate cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> vs <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>).

These mice normally develop severe steatosis from an early age but hardly develop fibrosis until fed the GAN diet. Each siRNA (10mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected once every 10 days and mice were fed a GAN diet for 3 weeks before sacrifice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Hepatic MCT1 protein levels were visually monitored by MCT1-positive staining immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>), showing more than 70% MCT1 protein depletion (Chol-MCT1<italic>-</italic>siRNA: 77.99% &amp; GN-MCT1-siRNA: 71.35% silencing).

Importantly, there was no surge in plasma lactate level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), addressing the concern of potential lactic acidosis after MCT1 depletion in the liver, the major lactate-consuming tissue. We also monitored food intake and body weight over time (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 2A, 2B</xref>), as there was a report of decreased food anticipation activity upon hepatic MCT1 deletion followed by reduced plasma β-hydroxybutyrate levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, the GN-MCT1-siRNA administration led to a decrease in both food intake and body weight, while the Chol-MCT1<italic>-</italic>siRNA did not. Neither Chol-MCT1<italic>-</italic>siRNA administration nor hepatocyte-specific MCT1KO improved glucose tolerance on the genetically obese NASH mouse model or a 12 week HFD-induced NAFLD model, respectively (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 3A, 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Hepatic MCT1 depletion downregulates lipogenic genes but not steatosis in the ob/ob NASH diet mouse model</title>
<p>In order to fully analyze steatosis in NASH, lipid droplet morphology and total hepatic TG was assessed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). The results showed that neither GN<italic>-</italic>MCT1-siRNA nor Chol-MCT1<italic>-</italic>siRNA decreased total hepatic TG levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>), although quantitative analysis of H&amp;E images showed a small decrease in mean lipid droplet size and increased number of lipid droplets upon MCT1 silencing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). These data suggest the possibility that hepatic MCT1 depletion either 1) inhibits formation or fusion of lipid droplets, or 2) enhances lipolysis to diminish lipid droplet size.</p>
<p>To investigate the underlying mechanism by which lipid droplet morphological dynamics change, we monitored the effect of hepatic MCT1 depletion on DNL-related gene expression. Both GN-MCT1-siRNA and Chol-MCT1<italic>-</italic>siRNA strongly decreased the mRNA and protein levels related to representative DNL genes (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 4A-4D</xref>). Intriguingly, both modes of hepatic MCT1 depletion also inhibited expression of the upstream regulatory transcription factors SREBP1 and ChREBP.

<title>Opposite effects of Chol-MCT1-siRNA versus GN-MCT1-siRNA on fibrotic collagen expression</title>
<p>We next monitored fibrosis, a tissue damaging phenotype that is associated with NASH. Consistent with the results in LX2 stellate cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), Chol-MCT1-siRNA administration to ob/ob mice on GAN diet significantly reduced liver collagen 1 protein levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). This result could be attributable to the fact that subcutaneous injection of the Chol-MCT1-siRNA compound is able to silence genes in hepatic stellate cells, the predominant cell type that produces collagens. Interestingly, decreases in mRNA encoding collagen 1 isoforms were not detected by rt-qPCR analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating possible effects at the level of translation or protein turnover. Surprisingly, an opposite phenotype on collagen 1 protein expression was observed in response to administration of GN-MCT1-siRNA compared to Chol-MCT1-siRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Hepatocyte-specific GN-MCT1-siRNA actually enhanced the expression of type 1 collagen protein in these experiments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>), and this effect was also apparent at the mRNA expression level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Overall fibrosis as detected by Sirius Red was also analyzed in these experiments, as this staining detects all types of collagen fibers that are involved in hepatic fibrosis, such as III, IV, V, and VI. In line with collagen 1 mRNA and protein levels, GN-MCT1-siRNA significantly enhanced Sirius red positive areas in the images, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>. Despite its inhibitory effect on collagen 1 production levels, Chol-MCT1-siRNA did not reduce Sirius Red positive areas, suggesting that reduction of major type 1 collagen might is not the major contributor to fibrosis in this model or that compensatory effects are occurring.</p>

<title>MCT1KO by AAV-Lrat-Cre and AAV-TBG-Cre constructs confirm cell type specificity of MCT1KO effects</title>
<p>The results presented above suggested that Chol-MCT1-siRNA downregulates type 1 collagen protein by depleting MCT1 in hepatic stellate cells, which hepatocyte-specific GN-MCT1-siRNA cannot target. To test this hypothesis, we developed and validated AAV9-Lrat-Cre constructs to generate hepatic stellate cell-specific MCT1 knockout mice. Male MCT1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> were intravenously injected with AAV9-Lrat-Cre (1×10<sup>11</sup>gc) and sacrificed 3 weeks later (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 5A</xref>). Isolation of hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells were validated with their representative marker genes encoding albumin, and desmin, respectively (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 5B, 5C</xref>). Successful depletion of hepatic stellate cell selective <italic>Mct1</italic> mRNA was confirmed in the MCT1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice injected with the AAV9-Lrat-Cre construct. <italic>Mct1</italic> mRNA levels in the hepatocytes, which accounts for up to 70% of total liver cell types, were intact (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 5D, 5E</xref>). No change in MCT1 protein level was observed in other metabolic tissues (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 5F, 5G</xref>).</p>
<p>We employed the choline-deficient HFD-induced NASH mouse model (CDHFD) to test these AAV constructs on steatosis and fibrosis. CDHFD induces severe steatosis due to inhibited VLDL secretion and β-oxidation and thereby exacerbates NASH fibrosis in a relatively short time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.

There was no food intake or body weight difference between the groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Similar to results we obtained by MCT1 silencing with siRNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), MCT1 deletion in either hepatocytes or in hepatic stellate cells did not resolve steatosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>).</p>

<p>Also consistent with results obtained by hepatocyte selective MCT1 silencing with GN-MCT1-siRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), hepatocyte-specific knockout of MCT1 (Hep KO) enhanced the collagen 1 level compared to the control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, hepatic stellate cell-specific MCT1 knockout (HSC KO) prevented CDHFD-induced collagen 1 protein levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). MCT1KO in combined hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells blunted the effect shown in each single KO (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The major finding of this study is that MCT1 function in hepatic stellate cells promotes collagen 1 expression, as MCT1 depletion in this cell type, either <italic>in vitro</italic> in cell culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) or <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), attenuates fibrotic collagen 1 protein production. This finding in mice was made by generating novel AAV9-Lrat-Cre constructs that can be injected into MCT1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice to elicit stellate cell selective MCT1 depletion, as verified by isolation and <italic>Mct1</italic> mRNA analysis in liver cell types (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 5</xref>). Previous use of Lrat-Cre for germline transmission had validated constitutive gene KO selectively in hepatic stellate cells in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, while our AAV-Lrat-Cre construct allows inducible gene KO, eliminating time-demanding mouse crossing and breeding. Surprisingly, MCT1KO in hepatocytes, both <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 6B</xref>), evoked the opposite effect: a robust upregulation of collagen 1 expression and fibrosis. This may be in part a cell-autonomous effect in hepatocytes, as we observed increased collagen 1 expression in Hep2G cells in culture upon silencing <italic>MCT1</italic> (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of stellate cell MCT1KO was observed only at the collagen 1 protein level, while the hepatocyte MCT1KO affected both collagen mRNA and protein. In addition, the hepatocyte selective MCT1KO caused increased total fibrosis, evidenced by trichrome staining of liver (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>), while the stellate cell MCT1KO was associated with a trend towards diminished trichrome staining that did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). Nonetheless, taken together, our data suggest that lactate flux in hepatic stellate cells strongly promotes collagen 1 translation or inhibits protein turnover rates (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 7</xref>: Graphical abstract).</p>
<p>Strong support for the above conclusions was obtained in an alternative experimental model of NASH--genetically obese ob/ob mice on a GAN diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In these experiments we employed chemically stabilized siRNA, taking advantage of RNA modifications 2-Fluoro, 2-O-Methyl ribose, and phosphorothioate backbone replacement to block siRNA degradation and immune responses as well as enhance <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery effectiveness and silencing longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Conjugation of such siRNA compounds with GN promotes binding to the asialoglycoprotein receptor that is primarily expressed in hepatocytes at high levels, and we confirmed hepatocyte selective gene silencing with such constructs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Moreover, injection of GN-MCT1-siRNA did not affect MCT1 expression in other major tissues including iWAT, gWAT, BAT, intestine, heart, lung, kidney, and spleen (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 1G, 1H</xref>). Hepatocyte selective MCT1 silencing strongly upregulated collagen 1 in livers of ob/ob mice on a GAN diet (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>), as did hepatocyte selective MCT1KO in the CDHFD mouse model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, cholesterol-conjugated, chemically modified siRNA targeting MCT1 silenced the gene in all three liver cell types tested, including hepatic stellate cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>), and did attenuate liver collagen 1 expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). This result is consistent with the idea that depleting MCT1 in stellate cells decreases collagen 1 production, as shown by MCT1KO in stellate cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The data in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplement Figure 1</xref> also show the effectiveness of RNA interference (RNAi) in interrogating cell specific processes in liver, and highlight the multiple advantages over traditional small molecule inhibitors in developing therapeutics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. To date, five RNAi-based therapeutic agents have received FDA approvals targeting multiple disease areas, and a great many clinical trials of oligonucleotide therapeutics are in progress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Analysis of gene expression profiles also showed that hepatic MCT1 positively regulates the levels of SREBP1 and ChREBP, major transcription factors regulating liver lipid metabolism, as well as their target DNL genes. These effects were apparently not sufficient to reverse severe steatosis in the genetically obese NASH mouse model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), although a slight decrease in mean lipid droplet size was observed. The remaining steatosis may be attributed to the continuous supply of fatty acids from adipose tissue lipolysis, which accounts for up to 65% of hepatic fat accumulation as opposed to only 25% coming from DNL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. We also cannot rule out the possibility of compensatory effects from other MCT isoforms that are expressed. However, since MCT1 haploinsufficiency showed greatly reduced HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, the discrepancies with our data may be due to other tissues being involved or the different mouse models used. Overall, it is clear from our studies that steatosis is not much affected by hepatic MCT1 depletion in two models of NASH in mice. A possible future strategy for NASH therapeutics may be to combine the depletion of MCT1 in stellate cells to decrease fibrosis with a potent anti-steatosis target such as DGAT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> which we and others have shown is effective in reducing steatosis when depleted. Although there are still remaining challenges in developing a successful hepatic stellate cell-selective delivery system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, ongoing studies are identifying promising candidates such as M6P-polyethylene glycol (M6P-PEG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, IGF2R-specific peptide coupled nanocomplex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To understand the underlying mechanism by which hepatic MCT1 depletion drives the downregulation of DNL genes expression, we investigated AMPK activation, as phosphorylated AMPK has a negative regulatory effect on SREBP1 and ChREBP activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Indeed, hepatic MCT1 silencing enhanced AMPK phosphorylation, consistent with the previous MCT1 haploinsufficient mice study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. These data are also in line with another study in which MCT1 inhibition reduced ATP production and activated AMPK, thus deactivating SREBP1c and lowering levels its target SCD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. It remains to be examined whether other mechanisms are also at play that connect MCT1 function in liver to DNL gene regulation.</p>
<p>In summary, the data presented here highlight hepatic stellate cell MCT1 as a potential therapeutic target to prevent NASH fibrogenesis related to collagen 1 production. Its utility as a therapeutic target is complicated by our finding that MCT1 depletion in hepatocytes actually increases fibrosis. This work highlights the importance of contemplating cell-type specificity when developing therapeutic strategies, especially in systems of complex cellular landscapes such as NASH.</p>

<p>The 15-20 or 18-20 sequence oligonucleotides were synthesized by phosphoramidite solid-phase synthesis on a Dr Oligo 48 (Biolytic, Fremont, CA), or MerMade12 (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, CA) using 2ʹ-F and 2ʹ-O-Me phosphoramidites with standard protecting groups (Chemgenes, Wilmington, MA). For the 5’-VP coupling, 5’-(E)-Vinyl tetraphosphonate (pivaloyloxymethyl) 2’-O-methyl-uridine 3’-CE phosphoramidite was used (Hongene Biotech, Union City, CA). Phosphoramidites were prepared at 0.1 M in anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN), except for 2’-O-methyl-uridine phosphoramidite dissolved in anhydrous ACN containing 15% dimethylformamide. 5-(Benzylthio)-1H-tetrazole (BTT) was used as the activator at 0.25 M, coupling time for all phosphoramidites was 4 min. Detritylations were performed using 3% trichloroacetic acid in dichloromethane. Capping reagents used were CAP A (20% n-methylimidazole in ACN) and CAP B (20% acetic anhydride and 30% 2,6-lutidine in ACN). Phosphite oxidation to convert to phosphate or phosphorothioate was performed with 0.05 M iodine in pyridine-H2O (9:1, v/v) or 0.1 M solution of 3-[(dimethylaminomethylene)amino]-3H-1,2,4-dithiazole-5-thione (DDTT) in pyridine respectively. All synthesis reagents were purchased from Chemgenes. Unconjugated oligonucleotides were synthesized on 500Å long-chain alkyl amine (LCAA) controlled pore glass (CPG) functionalized with Unylinker terminus (ChemGenes).

<p>Prior to the deprotection, synthesis columns containing oligonucleotides were treated with 10% diethylamine (DEA) in ACN to deprotect cyanoethyl groups. Synthesis columns containing the oligonucleotides covalently attached to the solid supports were cleaved and deprotected for 1 hour at room temperature with anhydrous Mono-Methylamine gas (Airgas). Columns with deprotected oligonucleotides were washed with 1mL of 0.1M sodium acetate in 85% ethanol aqueous solution, followed by rinse with an 85% ethanol aqueous solution. The excess ethanol was dried from the column on a vacuum manifold. Finally, the oligonucleotides were eluted off the columns with MilliQ water.</p>

<title>Deprotection and purification of oligonucleotides for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments</title>
<p>Chol- or GN-conjugated oligonucleotides were cleaved and deprotected with 28-30% ammonium hydroxide and 40% aq. Methylamine in a 1:1 ratio for 2h at room temperature. VP-containing oligonucleotides were cleaved and deprotected as described previously. Briefly, CPG with VP-oligonucleotides was treated with a solution of 3% diethylamine in 28–30% ammonium hydroxide for 20 hours at 35⁰C. The cleaved oligonucleotide solutions were filtered to remove CPG and dried under a vacuum. The pellets were resuspended in 5% ACN in water and purified on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II HPLC system. VP and GN-conjugated oligonucleotides were purified using a custom 20 x 150mm column packed with Source 15Q anion exchange resin (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA). Run conditions were the following. Eluent A: 20 mM sodium acetate in 10% ACN in water. Eluent B: 1 M sodium bromide in 10% ACN in water. Linear gradient 10–35% B 20 min at 40⁰C. Chol-conjugated oligonucleotides were purified using 21.2 x 150mm PRP-C18 column (Hamilton Co, Reno, NV). Run conditions were the following: Eluent A, 50 mM sodium acetate in 5% ACN in water; Eluent B: 100% ACN. Linear gradient, 40–60% B 20 min at 60⁰C. Flow used was 40mL/min for both systems. Peaks were monitored at 260 nm. Fractions collected were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Pure fractions were combined and dried under a vacuum and resuspended in 5% ACN. Oligonucleotides were desalted by size exclusion on a 50 x 250mm custom column packed with Sephadex G-25 media (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA), and lyophilized.

While the evidence is largely <bold>convincing</bold> and the work significantly advances our understanding of the roles of distinct hepatic cell types in steatosis, a number of issues require attention and would best be solved by further experimentation.</p>

<p>The authors put forth the hypothesis that hepatocyte and/or non-parenchymal liver MCT1 may be responsible for physiologic effects (lower body weight gain and less hepatic steatosis) in MCT1 global heterozygote mice. They generate multiple tools to test this hypothesis, which they combine with mouse diets that induce fatty liver, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Novel findings include that deletion of hepatocyte MCT1 does not change liver lipid content, but increases liver fibrosis. Deletion of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) MCT1 does not substantially affect any liver parameter, but concomitant HSC MCT1 deletion does reverse fibrosis seen with hepatocyte MCT1 knockout or knockdown. In both models, plasma lactate levels do not change, suggesting that liver MCT1 does not substantially affect systemic lactate. In general, the data match the conclusions of the manuscript, and the studies are well-conducted and well-described. Further work would be necessary to dissect mechanism of fibrosis with hepatocyte MCT1, and whether this is due to changes in local lactate (as speculated by the authors) or another MCT1 substrate. This would be important to understand this novel potential cross-talk between hepatocytes and HSCs.</p>
<p>A parallel and perhaps more important advance is the generation of new methodology to target HSC in mice, using modified siRNA and by transduction of AAV9-Lrat-Cre. Both methods would reduce the need to cross floxed mice with the Lrat-Cre allele, saving time and resources. These tools were validated to an extent by the authors, but not sufficiently to ensure that there is no cross-reactivity with other liver cell types. For example, AAV9-Lrat-Cre-transduced MCT1 floxed mice show compelling HSC but not hepatocyte Mct1 knockdown, but other liver cell types should be assessed to ensure specificity. This is particularly important as overall liver Mct1 decreased by ~30% in AAV9-Lrat-Cre-transduced mice, which may exceed HSC content of these mice, especially when considering a 60-70% knockdown efficiency. This same issue also affects Chol-MCT1-siRNA, which the authors demonstrate to affect hepatocytes and HSC, but likely affects other cell types not tested. As this is a new and potentially valuable tool, it would be important to assess Mct1 expression across more non-parenchymal cells (i.e. endothelial, cholangiocytes, immune cells) to determine penetration and efficacy.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors seek to answer two main questions: 1) Whether interfering with lactate availability in hepatocytes through depletion of hepatocyte specific MCT-1 depletion would reduce steatosis, and 2) Whether MCT-1 in stellate cells promote fibrogenesis. While the first question is based on the observation that haploinsufficiency of MCT-1 makes mice resistant to steatosis, the rationale behind how MCT-1 could impact fibrogenesis in stellate cells is not clear. A more detailed discussion regarding how lactate availability would regulate two different processes in two different cell types would be helpful. The authors employ several mouse models and in vitro systems to show that MCT1 inhibition in hepatic stellate cells reduces the expression of COL-1. The significance of the findings is moderately impacted due to the following considerations:</p>
<p>a) Fibrosis in human NAFLD is a significant problem as a predictor of liver related mortality and is associated with type 1 and type 3 collagen. However, the reduction in COL1 in stellate cells did not amount to a reduction in liver fibrosis even in cell specific KO (in Fig 7E, there is no indication of whether Sirius red staining was different between HSC KO and control mice- the authors mention a downward trend in the text). The authors postulate that type 1 COL may not be the more predominant form of fibrosis in the model. This does not seem likely, since the same ob/ob mouse model was used to determine that fibrosis was enhanced with hepatocyte specific MCT-1 KO and decreased with Chol MCT-1KO. Measurements of different types of collagens in their model and the effect of MCT-1 on different types could be more informative. In particular, although collagens are the structural building blocks for hepatic fibrosis, fibrosis can also be controlled by matrix remodeling factors such as Timp1, Serpine 1, PAI-1 and Lox.</p>
<p>b) The authors use multiple animal models including cell specific KO to conclude that stellate cell MCT-1 inhibition decreases COL-1. However, the mechanisms behind this reduced expression of COL-1 are not discussed or explored, making it descriptive.</p>
<p>c) Different types of diets are used in this study which could impact lactate availability. Choline deficiency diets are reported to cause weight loss, and importantly have none of the metabolic features of human NASH. Therefore, their utility is doubtful, especially for this study which proposes to investigate if metabolic dysregulation and substrate availability could be a tool for therapy.</p>
<p>d) Hepatocyte specific MCT-1 KO mice seem to have increased COL-1 production, despite no noticeable difference in hepatocyte steatosis. The reasons for this are not discussed. Fibrosis in NASH is thought to be from stellate cell activation secondary to signals from hepatocellular damage. There is no evidence that there was a difference in either of these parameters in the mouse models used.</p>
<p>e) The authors report that serum lactate levels did not rise after MCT-1 silencing, but the reasons behind this are unclear. There is insufficient data about lactate production and utilization in this model, which would be useful to interpret data regarding steatosis and fibrosis development. For example, does the MCT-1 KO prevent hepatocyte and stellate cell net import or export of lactate? What is the downstream metabolic consequence in terms of pyruvate, acetylCoA and the NAD/NADH levels. Does the KO have downstream effects on mitochondrial TCA cycling?</p>
<p>f) MCT-1 protein expression is measured only in the in vitro assay. Similar quantitation through western blot is not shown in the animal models.</p>

<p>A major finding of this work is that loss of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), specifically in stellate cells, can decrease fibrosis in the liver. However, the underlying mechanism whereby MCT1 influences stellate cells is not addressed. It is unclear if upstream/downstream metabolic flux within different cell types leads to fibrotic outcomes. Ultimately, the paper opens more questions than it answers: why does decreasing MCT1 expression in hepatocytes exacerbate disease, while silencing MCT1 in fibroblasts seems to alleviate collagen deposition? Mechanistic studies in isolated hepatocytes and stellate cells could enhance the work further to show the disparate pathways that mediate these opposing effects. The work highlights the complexity of cellular behavior and metabolism within a disease environment but does little to mechanistically explain it.</p>
<p>The observations presented are compelling and rigorous, but their impact is limited by the nearly complete lack of mechanistic insight presented in the manuscript. As also mentioned elsewhere, it is important to know whether lactate import or export (or the transport of another molecule-like ketone bodies, for example) is the decisive role of MCT1 for this phenotype. Beyond that, it would be interesting, albeit more difficult, to determine how that metabolic change leads to these fibrotic effects.</p>
<p>Kuppfer cells are initially analyzed and targeted. These cells may play a major role in fibrotic response. It will be interesting to determine the effects of lactate metabolism in other cells within the microenvironment, like Kuppfer cells, to gain a complete understanding of how metabolism is altered during fibrotic change.</p>
<p>The timing of MCT1 depletion raises concern, as this is a largely prophylactic experiment, and it remains unclear if altering MCT1 would aid in the regression of established fibrosis. Given the proposal for translation to clinical practice, this will be an important question to answer.</p>
