<title>Abstract</title><p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the abnormal expansion of CGG repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Many FXS patients experience sleep disruptions, and we sought to explore these symptoms along with the possible benefits of a scheduled feeding intervention using the <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mouse model. These mutants displayed clear evidence for sleep and circadian disturbances including delay in the onset of sleep and fragmented activity rhythms with increases in cycle-to-cycle variability. Importantly, the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibited deficits in their circadian behavioral response to light with reduced masking, longer time to resetting to shifts in the Light-Dark cycle, altered synchronization to a skeleton photoperiod and lower magnitude light-induced phase shifts of activity rhythms. Investigation of the retinal input to the surprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) with the neurotracer cholera toxin (β subunit) and quantification of the light-evoked cFos expression in the SCN revealed an abnormal retinal innervation of the SCN in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for the observed behavioral deficits. Interestingly, disruptions in social and repetitive behaviors correlated with sleep duration and fragmentation. Understanding the nature of the deficits, we decided to apply a scheduled feeding regimen (6-hr/18-hr feed/fast cycle) as a circadian-based strategy to boast circadian rhythms independently of light. This intervention significantly improved the activity rhythms and sleep in the mutants. Strikingly, the scheduled feeding ameliorated social interactions and reduced repetitive behaviors as well as the levels of Interferon-gamma and Interleukin-12 in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mutants, suggesting that timed eating may be an effective way to lessen inflammation. Collectively, this work adds support to efforts to develop circadian based interventions to help with symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a relatively common inherited cause of intellectual disability with a prevalence of about 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females (Hersh and Saul, 2011), with the males more severely affected. FXS present with an abnormal expansion of CGG repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<italic>FMR1</italic>) gene. Such trinucleotide repeat expansion causes transcriptional silencing of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene and reduction in the levels of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein essential for synaptic plasticity among other functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zalfa et al., 2006</xref>; Soden et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kute et al., 2019</xref>). There is no cure for FXS; current treatments primarily focus on managing the symptoms, among which the most common include social deficits, repetitive behaviors and sleep disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Budimirovic et al., 2022</xref>; Mendez and Mendez, 2024). Given the central role of sleep and circadian rhythms in restoration and recovery, a key issue is whether improving the sleep/wake cycle could ameliorate other symptoms of FXS.</p>
<p>Animal models are helpful to better understand the mechanisms underlying circadian and sleep disorders as well as to develop strategies for disease management focused on restoring the sleep/wake cycle. Several models of FXS have been put forward, each with a distinct set of advantages and disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sandoval et al., 2024</xref>); among them the <italic>Fmr</italic>1 knockout (KO) model has been validated for elucidating disease mechanisms and is widely used for preclinical development of drug candidates including those focused on sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kazdoba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Saré et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Martinez et al., 2024</xref>). Prior work has found that both the <italic>Fmr1/Fxr2</italic> double KO and <italic>Fmr1 KO/Fxr2</italic> heterozygous animals exhibit a loss of rhythmic activity in the light/dark (LD) cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). More recent work has found evidence for deficits in sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Saré et al., 2017</xref>) and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bonasera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Angelakos et al., 2019</xref>) rhythms in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO model. This prior work suggests that, like the FSX patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kronk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Budimirovic et al., 2022</xref>), sleep/wake disturbances can be seen in the mouse models. Still numerous gaps remain in our knowledge in regard to the nature of the deficits and if correcting the altered sleep/wake cycles would better other aspects of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO phenotype.</p>
<p>In this study, we sought to comprehensively examine the sleep/circadian disturbances in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice and to answer the question of whether or not these are associated with their behavioral alterations. It is worth noting that much of the literature concerning behavioral deficits in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO line were conducted in the middle of the day when the mice were normally asleep, and this daytime protocol may cause sleep disruption. To address this issue, we sought to make use of non-invasive monitoring systems to assess the sleep behavior and the activity rhythms of the animals in their home cages. The response of WT and mutants to different behavioral tests was assessed during the active (dark) phase to minimize disruptions to their sleep/wake rhythms. The same mice that were recorded for their sleep/wake cycles were also evaluated with other behavioral tests so that correlations could be examined. Guided by our understanding of the deficits in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO line, we utilized a circadian-based intervention (schedule feeding, 6-hr feeding/18-hr fast) and determined its impact on sleep/wake rhythms as well as social deficits, and repetitive behavior.</p>

<title>Fmr1 KOs exhibited shorter and fragmented sleep in the light phase</title>
<p>To determine if the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO had deficits in immobility-defined sleep behavior, the animals were examined using a combination of video recording and mouse tracking system under LD (12:12 hr) conditions. All the mice exhibited robust day-night rhythms in sleep with higher levels of sleep during the day and the lowest levels during the first half of the night (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Looking at the total sleep values within a 24 hr cycle, the total amount of sleep and the number of sleep bout did not vary between genotypes, although the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO did exhibit a reduction in the average duration of each sleep bout (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A two-way ANOVA used to analyze the temporal pattern of sleep (1-hr bins) in WT and mutants indicated significant effects of time (F<sub>(23,</sub> <sub>287)</sub> = 31.94; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and genotype (F<sub>(23,</sub> <sub>287)</sub> = 11.95; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). A number of diurnal differences emerged when day and night sleep parameters were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Focusing our attention on the resting phase (day), the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mutants exhibited less sleep behavior (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) with more bouts of a shorter duration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). In addition, maximum sleep bout duration was about 20 minutes shorter in the mutant mice. The reduced sleep time, shorter bout length, and a greater number of sleep bouts seen during the day are all evidence of a fragmented sleep pattern in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mutants.</p>

<title>Reduced rhythmic strength and nocturnality in the Fmr1 KOs</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the presence of deficits in locomotor activity rhythms in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice showed. Age-matched WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO were housed in cages equipped with running-wheels under LD cycles for 2 weeks and then released into constant darkness (DD) to measure their endogenous rhythms. All of the mice exhibited a robust daily and circadian rhythms in wheel running activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the LD environment, some indication of the commonly reported hyper-activity in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice emerged (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), although the activity levels over 24 hours were not significantly different (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) between the genotypes. Analysis of the diurnal activity patterns with two-way ANOVA confirmed the significant effects of time (F<sub>(23,</sub> <sub>287)</sub> = 8.84; <italic>P</italic> = 0.003) and genotype (F<sub>(23,</sub> <sub>287)</sub> = 39.75; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) on locomotor activity. In LD conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), the mutants exhibited lower power rhythms with increased activity during lights-on and higher cycle-to cycle variability; while, when the animals were released in DD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), both the WT and the mutants displayed very similar free-running period (tau), but again, the latter presented with weaker rhythmic strength and increased cycle-to-cycle variability (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Together, our data suggest that the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibit deficits in the circadian regulation of locomotor activity and raise the possibility of problems in the synchronization to the LD cycle.</p>

<title>Fmr1 KOs displayed an aberrant behavioral response to photic timing cues</title>
<p>The likelihood of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice presenting deficits in their response to light was tested using four behavioral assays and measuring wheel running activity. First, the ability of light (4500K, 50lx) to suppress or “mask” the locomotor activity of nocturnal mice was evaluated. For this assay, the level of locomotor activity between Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 14 and 15 was first measured under baseline LD conditions, and no differences were observed between genotypes (WT: 2229 ± 162 revolutions (rev); KO: 2639 ± 328 rev; <italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub> = -1.123, P = 0.277). The next day the mice were exposed to light for 1 hour at this same phase and the levels of activity measured. A two-way ANOVA indicated significant effects of both genotype (F<sub>(1,</sub> <sub>39)</sub> = 12.002; <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and light exposure (F<sub>(1,</sub> <sub>39)</sub> = 24.253; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The percentage of suppression in activity elicited by the light exposure was higher in the WT compared to the mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), although a couple of KO mice exhibited levels of masking comparable to WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Next, we determined the number of cycles needed by the mice to re-entrain to a 6 hours phase advance of the LD cycle. While the WT mice re-synchronized in 5.9 ± 0.6 days to the new phase, it took 11.3 ± 0.4 days for the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO to adjust (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Third, we evaluated the ability of the mice to entrain to a skeleton photoperiod (SPP) in which the full 12 hours of light are replaced by two 1-hr light exposures separated by 11 hours of dark (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In these experiments, the mice were first entrained to the standard LD cycle and then released into the SPP for 2 weeks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

The <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO exhibited a tau of 23.7 ± 0.2 hr with the shorter period driven by three mutant mice who failed to stably entrain to the SPP (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Compared to the WT, the mutants under SPP showed reduced rhythmic strength, increased light-phase activity, and larger cycle-to-cycle onset variability (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).

The WT showed a phase delay of 135.6 ± 26.9 min, whilst, in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mutants, the delay in the activity onset on the next day was about half the magnitude (64.0 ± 0.1 min) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

<title>Fmr1 KOs exhibited subtle deficits in the retinal afferent innervation to the SCN</title>
<p>The results described above suggest that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice could have an anomalous retinal input to the SCN. The fluorescence-conjugated neurotracer Cholera Toxin (β subunit) has been used to map the projections of melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) from the retina to the SCN (Muscat et al., 2003; Hattar et al., 2006), hence, the WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO received a bilateral intravitreal injection of this tracer. A lower fluorescent signal could be observed in the mutant mice both laterally and medially to the ventral SCN (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) as well as beneath in the optic chiasm as compared to the WT. Analysis of the intensity and distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e2306">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>) of the labelled retino-hypothalamic processes entering the ventral SCN showed a reduction, particularly evident in the lateral side of both the left and right mutant SCN (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, C</xref>).

<p>A well-established test of the light input to the circadian system is the light-evoked cFos response in the SCN. In line with the results obtained with the Cholera Toxin suggesting an impaired light-pathway to the SCN in the mutants, the number of cFos positive cells in the SCN of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO was greatly reduced (50%) in comparison to the WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Contrary to other models of neurodevelopmental disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), the <italic>Fmr1 KO</italic> mice did not display any histomorphometrical alteration of the SCN (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).

<title><italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs exhibited deficits in social interactions as well as increased repetitive behaviors</title>
<p>Social deficits and stereotypic symptoms are hallmark problems in NDDs and we sought to evaluate these behaviors during the night, between ZT 16-18, in the two genotypes. The active-phase social behavior was first tested with the three-chamber test (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In the first stage of testing, both genotypes showed more interest toward the stranger mouse when they were given the choice between an inert object and a mouse. The direct comparison of the time spent with the object and the novel mouse did not show significant differences between the genotypes (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). On the other hand, measurement of the social preference index (SPI) indicated that the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO exhibited reduced interest in conspecifics compared to WT mice (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). In the second testing stage, the lifeless object was replaced with a second novel mouse while the stranger mouse from the first stage had become a familiar mouse (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Under these conditions, the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO spent more time with the familiar mouse than the WT (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Again, the social novelty preference index (SNPI) indicated that the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO exhibited reduced interest in novel mouse compared to WT mice (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The reduced time in exploring and staying in the novel-mouse chamber suggested that the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mutants were not able to distinguish the second novel mouse from the first now familiar mouse. The possibility of impaired social memory was further tested with the 5-trial social test (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). In this test, the first stranger mouse becomes a familiar mouse after 4 exposures to the testing mouse. When the second novel mouse is introduced in the 5<sup>th</sup> trial, the testing mouse typically shows a boosted interest in investigating the novel mouse. As expected, when the second novel stranger mouse replaced the first familiar mouse and was introduced to the testing animals in the 5<sup>th</sup> trial, WT showed elevated social behavior. In contrast, the mutants did not display increased interest in exploring the second novel mouse (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<title>A scheduled feeding paradigm ameliorated sleep disturbances and improved the deficits in social memory and repetitive grooming behavior in the Fmr1 KO</title>
<p>The correlations between the fragmented sleep and the severity of other behavioral phenotypes support the possibility that interventions focused on improving circadian rhythms and sleep may benefit the observed deficits in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Scheduled feeding can be a powerful regulator of circadian rhythms (Long and Satchidananda, 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Manoogian et al., 2022</xref>) and has been shown to be effective in several disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Whittaker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; Gao et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Whittaker et al., 2023</xref>). We, therefore, sought to determine if a scheduled feeding paradigm (time restricted feeding, TRF) consisting of 6-h feeding/18-h fast for 2 weeks would benefit the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, and compared the 2 genotypes held on <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding (ALF) as well as TRF. We confirmed that food consumption was very similar in the four groups by the second week (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e2306">S. Fig. 2</xref>); both genotypes were able to well adapt to the TRF protocol and ate as much as their ALF controls after 5 days. At the end of the two-week treatment, the TRF groups weighed less than the ALF groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e2306">S. Fig. 2</xref>). The TRF treatment benefited a number of aspects of the temporal patterning of activity and sleep (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) in both genotypes. The scheduled feeding improved the power of the rhythms while reducing the fragmentation in both WT and <italic>Fmr1 KO</italic>, and markedly restored the cycle-to-cycle variability in the mutants to WT levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C-E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). The total cage activity was not altered by the intervention in either genotype. When the sleep behavior was assessed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F, G</xref>), TRF increased the total amount of daytime sleep (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>; <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>), reduced sleep fragmentation (bout number, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref>) and increased the average duration of each bout (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7J</xref>) in both genotypes. During the light phase, the TRF-treated mutants spent more time sleeping with longer sleep bout length and a smaller number of sleep bouts than the ALF controls. In general, strong genotypic differences were present in the response to TRF with the WT mice showing a more robust sleep response (<xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>).</p>

The interest of <italic>the Fmr1</italic> KO mice in interacting with the second novel mouse was significantly increased to WT-like level, suggesting that the treated mutants were able to distinguish the novel mouse from the familiar mouse. Regarding the repetitive grooming behavior, the TRF-treated <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice showed a significant reduction in the time spent on self-grooming (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). This reduction was not due to changes in their locomotor ability as there was no effects on the distance travelled during the test between the TRF and the ALF groups (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). In summary, TRF not only improved the sleep/wake cycles but also the deficits in social memory as well as the self-grooming behavior in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.</p>

<title>Scheduled feeding treatment reduced the elevated IL-12 and INF<sub>Ƴ</sub> pathway in the Fmr1 KO mice</title>
<p>An abnormal immune response has been suggested to play a role in FXS pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Reynolds et al., 2021</xref>; Dias et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Robinson-Agramonte et al., 2022</xref>). To investigate whether the scheduled feeding protocol impacted cytokine profiles in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, plasma samples were collected at the end of the intervention. Our assessment revealed that several cytokine levels were altered in the mutants, and these changes were countered by TRF (<xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). The comparison within the ALF groups revealed that the mutants had elevated levels of Interleukin-12, (IL-12), Interferon-gamma (IFN<sub>Ƴ</sub>), and of the Chemokine Ligand-9 (CXCL-9) compared to WT. The observed genotypic differences in these pro-inflammatory markers were abolished in the TRF-treated groups (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). The scheduled feeding also repristinated the levels of IL-2 in the mutant to WT levels. We next asked whether there was a correlation between the levels of these proinflammatory markers and the expression of the behavioral phenotypes. We focused our attention on IL-12 and IFN<sub>Ƴ</sub> axis because their elevated levels in the KO were successfully reduced by TRF. Markers of poor sleep such as higher activity in the light phase, shorter sleep time/sleep bout length, and higher numbers of sleep bouts were significantly associated with higher levels of IL-12 and IFN<sub>Ƴ</sub> (<xref rid="tbl10" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>). The levels of IL-12 and IFN<sub>Ƴ</sub> were also significantly associated with the social memory impairments and the severity of repetitive grooming behavior (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B, C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl10" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>). Together, our data demonstrate that TRF treatment effectively reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in this model of FXS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A significant proportion of individuals with NDDs such as FXS exhibit disruptions to their daily sleep/wake cycles. Particularly common are difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, and altered sleep patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Budimirovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Minhas et al., 2024</xref>), which have a major impact on the quality of life of the patients. Individuals with the worse set of symptoms in other behaviors also experience the most pronounced sleep problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schreck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kaufmann et al., 2024</xref>) raising the possibility that the disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle contribute to the severity of other behavioral systems. Notably, abnormalities in sleep are detected early in development, even in infants and toddlers carrying the FMR1 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">D’Souza et al., 2020</xref>). These sleep/wake disruptions may be due to a direct effect of the mutation itself on the circuitry underlying circadian rhythms and sleep homeostasis or indirect effects due to other symptoms including anxiety, sensory hypersensitivity and repetitive behaviors that would themselves disrupt the sleep/wake cycle.</p>
<p>As with other symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sandoval et al., 2024</xref>), animal models are helpful for better understanding the mechanisms underlying circadian and sleep disorders as well as for developing strategies focused on restoring the sleep/wake cycle. In the present study, we used a mouse model to demonstrate that loss of <italic>Fmr1</italic> has deleterious effects on the temporal pattern of sleep and locomotor activity with strong deficits in the response to the environment lighting. The disrupted rhythms were significantly associated with social memory impairments and repetitive behaviors. Critically, we found that the circadian-based treatment strategy, scheduled feeding, was effective in countering the behaviors deficits as well as reducing the inflammatory signature in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>In our behavioral sleep assays, we observed reduced total sleep time and sleep fragmentation in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Similarly, Saré and colleagues found evidence for an impact of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO on sleep duration during the light phase using a comparable assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Saré et al., 2017</xref>). Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Westmark et al., 2023</xref>) examined sleep architecture in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO using electroencephalography (EEG). While this work focused on the effects of a ketogenic diet, the control recordings did not find evidence for differences between the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and WT. We cannot explain the differences in the findings between these studies and would only point out that perhaps the sleep phenotype under baseline conditions is subtle. A gap in this literature is the lack of investigation into sleep homeostatic mechanisms. It is possible that a sleep deprivation protocol could uncover deficits in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO model. Notably, these mutant mice display neural oscillation abnormalities, including increased resting state gamma power and heightened amplitude of auditory evoked potentials, paralleling the EEG signatures observed in FXS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jonak et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we assessed diurnal and circadian rhythms in locomotor activity using a wheel-running assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibited weaker rhythms, with increased cycle-to-cycle variation and heightened daytime activity. These disruptions persisted when the mice were housed in DD, where locomotor rhythms are regulated by the endogenous circadian system without direct light influence. Previous research has shown that the <italic>Fmr1/Fxr2</italic> double KO and the <italic>Fmr1 KO/Fxr2</italic> heterozygous mice display a marked loss of rhythmic activity in a LD cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). While this early study did report effects in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO alone, it did not examine the single mutation in detail. Other studies measuring home cage activity found that the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibited significantly reduced movement during the active phase (the dark cycle) and increased bouts of activity during the light cycle compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bonasera et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, hypoactivity during the night was a prominent feature in male <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, as measured by infrared beam breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Angelakos et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, these studies consistently demonstrate disrupted locomotor activity rhythms in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. The increased daytime activity and greater cycle-to-cycle variability may be attributable to deficits in the light response of the circadian system.</p>
<p>A well-defined circuit mediates the effects of light on the circadian system entrainment. The photic signal is detected by the ipRGCs, which express the photopigment melanopsin (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). The ipRGCs receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors and project to the central circadian clock in the SCN, as well as to other brain regions involved in cognitive regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lucas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mahoney and Schmidt, 2024</xref>). We conducted a series of experiments to determine if this circuit is compromised in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Behaviorally, we identified deficits in the light-evoked suppression of activity (negative masking), the speed of re-entrainment to a new LD cycle, and the light-induced phase shifts of the circadian system. A particularly intriguing assay we used involved exposing the mice to a skeleton photoperiod, consisting of one hour of light followed by 11 hours of darkness. While the WT mice readily synchronized to this skeleton photoperiod, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibited several difficulties. These behavioral findings confirmed impairments in the light input to the circadian system, prompting further examination of this pathway.</p>
<p>Using fluorescently labeled cholera toxin β-subunit, we demonstrated that the ipRGC innervation of the SCN is defective in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Additionally, the light-evoked increase in cFos expression in the SCN was strikingly reduced in the mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Together, the behavioral, anatomical, and functional data suggest deficits in the circadian light response in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Since FMRP expression has been reported in the ipRGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), these findings may be explained by a loss of function in the retina. Interestingly, these results highlight a reduced circadian light response, contrasting with the general sensory hypersensitivity observed in humans with FXS and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rais et al., 2018</xref>). It will be important to investigate whether these prominent defects in the light input seen in this mouse model are also present in FXS patients. If the circadian light response is indeed compromised, it could have practical implications for the management of FXS.</p>
<p>There was no significant shortening of the free-running circadian period (tau) when activity was measured in constant darkness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Angelakos et al., 2019</xref>). The free-running period, as assessed by locomotor behavior in DD, is a highly sensitive marker of the output from the core molecular clock driving circadian oscillations (Takahashi et al., 2008). Furthermore, gene expression measurements in the central clock (SCN) did not reveal any alterations in the rhythmic transcription patterns of the core clock genes (<italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Bmal1</italic>, or <italic>Cry1</italic>) in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Given the absence of changes in tau or clock gene expression in the SCN, it is unlikely that the core molecular clock mechanism underlying circadian oscillation is impaired in these mutants. Still our data show that this FXS model exhibits deficits in the photic regulation of the circadian clock and its rhythmic outputs. Although numerous molecular and cellular pathways are impacted by loss of FMRP, several studies suggest that changes in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and circuit hyperexcitability may contribute to FXS symptoms. Within the SCN, there is evidence that E/I balance plays a crucial role in network synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Olde Engberink et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, future research should investigate the impact of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutation on the E/I balance within the SCN. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the present study demonstrates that the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice show disruptions in the temporal patterning of activity and sleep, which aligns with a broader pattern of deficits observed in mouse models of monogenic neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Angelakos et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brown et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shi and Johnson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Takumi et al., 2019</xref>; Wang et al., 2020, 2023).</p>
<p>The <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse model replicates many of the neurological and behavioral deficits observed in FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Melancia and Trezza, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kat et al., 2022</xref>). In the present study, we report clear deficits in social recognition and repetitive behaviors, such as excessive grooming. By collecting data on sleep, activity rhythms, and other behaviors from the same animals, we were able to investigate correlations between these behaviors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Based on human data, we hypothesized that individual mice exhibiting the most disrupted sleep would also show the most severe behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schreck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kaufmann et al., 2024</xref>). For instance, one study found that objective sleep and circadian disturbances accounted for approximately 30% of the variance in stereotypic behaviors among ASD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Yavuz-Kodat et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that mutant mice with the shortest sleep duration, the highest sleep fragmentation, and the weakest rhythm power performed the worst in tests of social recognition and showed the highest levels of grooming. While these correlations do not establish causation, they align with findings from human studies, which consistently report that individuals with poorer sleep perform worse behaviorally the following day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Robinson-Shelton and Malow, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Budimirovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schwichtenberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Minhas et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>A wide range of growing studies have demonstrated that disrupted circadian rhythms and poor sleep lead to a cluster of symptoms, including metabolic deficits, cardiovascular problems, abnormal immune activities, and cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdul et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>; Johnson et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bisdounis et al., 2022</xref>). Many of these same symptoms are seen in FXS and ASD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Parente et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Protic et al., 2022</xref>), indicating a potentially bidirectional link between the circadian clocks and the core NDD symptoms. No medications are available to treat these core symptoms (i.e., deficits in social communication, sensory aberrations, stereotypic behaviors, and restricted interests). Hence, a bidirectional link is exciting as it would raise the possibility of interactions that, by improving the daily rhythms, could have therapeutic utility in a variety of NDD conditions. A key test of this hypothesis is to determine if an intervention that improves the sleep/wake cycle in a disease model also improves other phenotypes.</p>
<p>Other research has demonstrated sleep benefits with various dietary interventions. Recent studies have shown that a ketogenic diet (KD) increases non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and reduces sleep fragmentation while flattening day/night rhythms in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Westmark et al., 2024</xref>). This same group also found that the KD reduced seizures but did not observe significant KD-responsive effects in several other behavioral tests, such as marble burying, tail suspension, and fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Westmark et al., 2020</xref>). In our own hands, we found that the KD improved sleep in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease (HD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Whittaker et al., 2022</xref>). In this model, improvements in sleep and circadian rhythms paralleled enhanced motor performance. Interestingly, one consequence of placing mice on a KD is the induction of a robust daily rhythm in ketone body levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Whittaker et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that the KD may function as a type of circadian intervention.</p>
<p>The most common intervention to improve sleep in NDD patients would be to give a sedative before bed. There is a surprising lack of clinical evidence to support this practice or even to suggest which hypnotic drug to use. Both clinical and pre-clinical work is needed to address these issues. In the <italic>Frm1</italic> model, three different classes of hypnotics (zolpidem, ramelteon, DORA-22) were all found to improve sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Saré et al., 2022</xref>). The rationale behind the use of these different drugs is related to their different pharmacological profiles and mechanisms involved in sleep i.e. zolpidem is an allosteric modulator of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist, and DORA-22 is a dual orexin receptor antagonist. Pharmacologically increasing sleep was found to reduce anxiety as measured by the open field but had negligible effects on social behavior in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO. In addition, a recent study used EEG measurements to demonstrate that a novel hypnotic (ML297, an activator of G-protein-activated inward-rectifying potassium channels) increased NREM sleep duration and reduced fragmentation in <italic>Fmr1</italic>−/y mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Martinez et al., 2024</xref>). Importantly, this study was also able to show that such treatment following contextual fear or spatial learning improved memory consolidation in the mutant mice.</p>
<p>We tested the hypothesis that improving sleep and circadian rhythms would alleviate behavioral deficits in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mutants using a time-restricted feeding (TRF) protocol. TRF was selected over light therapy due to the deficient responses to photic cues of the mutants. Even after just a two-week treatment, TRF produced significant improvements in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Specifically, TRF enhanced rhythmic power, reduced variability, decreased daytime activity, lengthened and consolidated sleep bouts during the light phase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Crucially, TRF led to improvements in social memory and reduced repetitive grooming behavior (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that TRF can improve circadian behavior in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acosta-Rodríguez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Roth et al., 2023</xref>) and neurodegenerative models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Whittaker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">2023</xref>). Prior work has shown benefits of intermittent fasting in uncovering and rescuing cognitive phenotypes in the PTEN model of NDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cabral-Costa et al., 2018</xref>). However, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of TRF benefiting a model of NDD.</p>
<p>Our findings on the levels of peripheral cytokines (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>) suggest that inflammation may play a mechanistic role linking improvements in sleep/wake rhythms to reductions in NDD-like behaviors. Altered immune profiles and exaggerated responses to immune challenges have been reported in both FXS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ashwood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Careaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Van Dijck et al., 2020</xref>) and Fmr1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pacey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hodges et al., 2020</xref>; Bertrand et al., 2021), indicating that the absence of FMRP may contribute to immune system imbalance. In our study, most pro-inflammatory cytokines (&gt;80%) did not vary by genotype (<xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). However, IL-12 (p40) and IFN-γ were elevated in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice and significantly reduced by the TRF protocol (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>, <xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). Notably, we found significant correlations between plasma levels of these two inflammatory markers and the extent of sleep disturbances and behavioral deficits (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl10" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>). Similar associations between dysregulated cytokine levels and impaired behavior have been documented in both patients and preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Siniscalco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Matta et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-12 have been associated with increased stereotypy, cognitive impairments, anxiety, and reduced social interactions in autism spectrum disorders (Konsman et al., 2008; Ashwood et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fallah et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, counteracting immune dysregulation has been proposed as a strategy to improve behavioral deficits in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Goo et al., 2020</xref>). At least one previous study found that TRF reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Whether TRF directly counteracts neuroinflammation in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice remains to be explored, as does the specific role of IL-12 (p40) and IFN-γ in mediating the observed behavioral disruptions. Future studies will be needed to clarify these mechanisms.</p>

<title>Immobility-Based Sleep Behavior</title>
<p>The sleep behavior under 12h:12h LD cycles was recorded using Anymaze automatic mouse tracking software (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) that tracked the (40 sec or greater as previously described (Wang et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Whittaker et al., 2018</xref>). This threshold was previously determined by Fisher and his colleagues to have 99% correlation with EEG-defined sleep (Fisher et al., 2016). From 5 days of recordings, 2 days with the best recording quality were picked for the analysis. A sleep bout was defined as a time period in which activity stayed above the bout threshold (3 counts of sleep per minute for longer than one minute at a time). Acquiring data were exported in 1-min bins and the total sleep during the light phase and the dark phase was obtained.</p>

<title>Locomotor cage activity rhythms</title>
<p>To characterize the sleep/wake cycles, the WT and the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice were single housed under a scheduled 12h:12h LD cycles. The mice were habituated to this cycle for 2 weeks to ensure entrainment to the appointed LD schedule before activity data was used for analysis. The animals were then released into constant darkness (12h:12h dark-dark, DD) for the assessment of the endogenous rhythms. They were kept in DD for at least 2 weeks with free access to food and water. The locomotor activity under LD cycles and DD was monitored using running wheel sensors that tracked wheel-running activity. In the set of TRF experiments, the locomotor activity rhythms were monitored using a top-mounted passive infra-red (IR) motion detector. Both the wheel-running recordings and the IR recordings were reported to a VitalView data recording system (Mini Mitter, Bend, OR) as previously described. 10 days of recordings were used for analysis and waveform presentations. The analysis was conducted by using the El Temps (A. Diez-Nogura, Barcelona, Spain) and ClockLab (Actimetrics, Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN) programs as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Loh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al 2018</xref>). The periodogram generated by the El Temps provided measures on the period, or the length of one activity cycle, and the power of the rhythmicity. The power, or percent variance (%V), assessed the strength of the mouse’s periodicity corrected for activity amount and normalized to variance percent derived from peak significance (<italic>P</italic>=0.05). The fragmentation and the imprecision of daily onset of sleep/wake cycles were determined by the ClockLab. Fragmentation was determined by the number of activity bouts per day (maximum gap: 1 min; threshold 3 counts/min), and the imprecision was determined by calculating the variability of the time of activity onset between the best-fit line of the 10 analyzed days.</p>

<title>Light-regulating circadian behavior</title>
<p>A cohort of age-matched WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice were single housed in cages with running wheels under a 12:12 LD cycle (300 lx, 4500K) first and then underwent through four behavioral assays of the photic regulation of the circadian system. (<bold>1</bold>) Photic suppression on nocturnal activity (negative light masking): mice were exposed to 1 hr of light (300 lx, 4500K) at ZT 14. The number of wheel revolutions during this pulse of white light was compared to the number of wheel revolutions during the equivalent hour collected from the previous day. The fold changes were reported: [(rev during the 1-hr light exposure) – (rev during the dark baseline)]/(rev during the dark baseline) %. (<bold>2</bold>) Re-entrainment to a 6hr advance of the LD cycle: After stable entrainment, the LD cycles were advanced by 6-hr. The activity was continuously monitored by the wheel-running system and the activity onset determined (VitalView). The re-entrainment was quantified by the difference between the running activity onset and the new ZT 12 in each recording day. A mouse was determined to be full entrained when the activity onset was aligned to lights-off and there was no phase shifting for the consecutive 5 days. (<bold>3</bold>) Skeleton Photoperiod: After stable entrainment to the LD 12:12 cycle, mice were placed in a skeleton photoperiod consisting of 1:11: 1:11 LD. The 1-hr light treatments at 300 lx were given at the beginning (ZT 0) and the end (ZT 11) of the original light phase. The mice were kept in this photic condition for at least 2 weeks. Basic activity rhythm parameters were determined (ClockLab). (<bold>4</bold>) Light-induced phase shifts to a single exposure to light: Mice were released into DD for 10 days. The circadian time (CT) of their free-running activity rhythms was determined using VitalView and El Temps software. The time of activity onset under DD was defined as CT 12. On day 11, the mice were exposed to light (300 lx, 4500K, 15 min) at CT 16. After the light pulse, the mice remained in DD for an additional 10 days. The best-fit lines of the activity onsets of sleep/wake cycles before and after the light exposure were measured.</p>

<title>Stereotypic Behavior</title>
<p>The marble burying test was used to evaluate the repetitive digging behavior (Yrigollen et al., 2019). The testing mice were habituated to the testing room for at least 30 mins before the test. An array of 4 marbles by 6 marbles was placed in the testing arena with a layer of 4-cm deep shavings. The testing mouse was introduced to the arena from the corner and allowed to freely behave during the trial. Their behavior was recorded for 30 mins and the testing mouse was carefully returned to their home cages. After the test, the number of buried marbles was counted. Mable buried more than ⅔ area were counted, and all marbles were cleaned with 70% ethanol before the next use. Time spent on digging was manually scored and the distance travelled was derived from the automatic mouse-tracking system (Anymaze software, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL).</p>
<p>The grooming test was conducted as in our previous work (Wang et al 2020). The behavior of self-grooming was defined as the cleaning, licking, or washing of the limbs, tail, and body surface areas, typically from a head to tail direction, but excluded bouts of scratching. Time spent on self-grooming was manually scored and the distance travelled was derived from the automatic mouse-tracking system (Anymaze software).</p>

<title>Social Behavior</title>
<p>The three-chamber test was performed as previously described (Wang et al 2020; 2022). The testing mice were allowed to freely explore an arena with three chambers where the central chamber remained empty. When being habituated to the three-chamber arena, both the mutants and the WT explored the arena evenly with no preference toward the left or the right chamber (left/right ratio: WT: 0.95 ± 0.14; <italic>P</italic> = 0.43 by paired <italic>t</italic>-test. <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO: 0.82 ± 0.1; <italic>P</italic> = 0.085 by paired <italic>t</italic>-test). The three-chamber test consisted of two parts: the first stage assessed the preference of social approach toward the stranger mouse, and the second stage assessed the ability of social discrimination of the testing mouse. In the first stage (social approach), an up-turned metal-grid pencil cup was placed in the side chambers: one remained empty as the novel object (the object chamber), and a never-met stranger mouse that matched the sex, age, and genotype of the testing mouse was placed in the second up-turned cup (the social chamber). Therefore, the testing mouse was tested for the preference between the object chamber and the social chamber in this first testing stage. In the second stage (social discrimination), the first stranger mouse and the cup remained the same while a second never-met stranger mouse that mached the sex, age, and genotype of the testing mouse was placed in the second up-turned cup. In other words, the social chamber in the first stage became a familiar chamber in the second stage, and the object chamber in the first stage became a novel chamber in the second stage. Thus, the testing mouse was tested for the preference between the familiar chamber and the novel chamber in this second testing stage. Time spent in each chamber and the distance travelled were derived from the automatic mouse-tracking system (Anymaze software).</p>
<p>The 5-trial social test was conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mineur et al., 2006</xref>). The testing mouse was first habituated to a testing arena for 30 mins and then introduced to a never-met stranger mouse for 4 trials. The testing mouse was allowed to explore and interact with the stranger mouse for 2 mins in each trial. A second stranger mouse was introduced to the testing mouse during the 5th trial for 2 mins. The resting interval between trials was 5 mins. Active social behavior such as physical contacts (e.g. crawling over, social grooming), nose-to-nose sniffing, nose-to-anus from the testing mouse to the stranger mice were scored manually. Testing mice that showed aggressive behavior were withdrawn from the experiment, and the stranger mice showed aggressive behavior were removed from the testing trial and the pool of stranger mice.</p>

<title>Time-restricted feeding (TRF) paradigm</title>
<p>The TRF was conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wang et al 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Whittaker et al 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">2023</xref>). WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice were first entrained to a 12:12 LD (300 lx vs 0 lx respectively) for a minimum of 2 weeks, then were exposed to a feeding paradigm of food (standard chow) available for 6 hr during the middle of the active phase from ZT 15 to ZT 21. Separate cohorts of WT and mutant mice were held on <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding (ALF). To monitor the sleep/wake cycles, mice were singly housed in cages with an infrared motion sensor. Scheduled feeding was achieved by manually adding and removing food from the mouse cages, and a careful examination was carried out to ensure no small food fragments were dropped and remained in the cages. Food consumption was manually measured by weighing food at the beginning and the end of the feeding cycles (control (ALF): 24 hr vs TRF: 6 hr). The experimental groups and their ALF controls were held in these conditions for a total of 2 weeks.</p>

<title>Injection, Visualization and Analyses of the Neuroanatomical tracer Cholera Toxin</title>
<p>WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (4 months-old) received a bilateral injection of CholeraToxin (β subunit) conjugated to Alexa Fluor™ 555 Conjugate (catalog number: C34776; Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, CA). Prior to the injections, the animals received a drop of a local ophthalmic anesthetic (Proparacaine HCl, 0.5%, Sandoz, Holzkirchen Germany) and an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Carprofen, Zoetis, Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ). The mice were then anesthetized with isoflurane and a 30G needle (BD PrecisionGlide<sup>TM</sup> Needle; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes NJ) was inserted at a 45° angle into the sclera and the vitreous chamber, towards the base of the retina to allow leakage of vitreous humor. The Cholera Toxin (2 μg in 2μl of sterile PBS) was injected into the vitreous chamber using a 32G Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Reno NV). The needle was left in place for ten seconds before being retracted. Seventy-two hours after the injection, the mice were euthanized with isoflurane (30%–32%) and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma). The brains were rapidly dissected out, post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4°C, and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose. Sequential coronal sections (40-50 μm) containing the left and right SCN were mounted, and the cover-slips applied with a drop of Vectashield-containing DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylinodole; catalog number: H-1200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were visualized on a Zeiss AxioImager M2 microscope equipped with an AxioCam MRm and the ApoTome imaging system, and images acquired with the Zeiss Zen software and a 10x objective to include both left and right SCN. Two methods of analyses were carried out on the images of 5 consecutive sections per animal containing the middle SCN. <underline>First,</underline> the relative intensity of the Cholera Toxin fluorescent processes was quantified in the whole SCN, both left and right separately, by scanning densitometry using the Fiji image processing package of the NIH ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net">https://imagej.net</ext-link>). A single ROI of fixed size (575.99 μm x 399.9 μm, width x height) was used to measure the relative integrated density (mean gray values x area of the ROI) in all the images. The values from the left and right SCN were averaged per section and 5 sections per animal were averaged to obtain one value per animal. <underline>Second,</underline> the distribution of the Cholera Toxin fluorescent signal was obtained for each left and right SCN separately in the same 4-5 consecutive sections per animal using the Profile Plot Analysis feature of ImageJ. Briefly, a rectangular box of fixed size (415.38μm x 110.94 μm, width x height, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e2306">Suppl Fig.1</xref>) to include the ventral part of the SCN was set for each side, and a column plot profile was generated whereby the x-axis represents the horizontal distance through the SCN (lateral to medial for the left and medial to lateral for the right; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e2306">Suppl Fig.1</xref>) and the y-axis represents the average pixel intensity per vertical line within the rectangular box. Subsequent processing of the resulting profiles was performed for left and right SCN images separately. To average the profiles of the 5 sections and obtain a single curve per animal, fifth-order polynomial curves were fit to best estimate the position of the intensity peak on the <italic>x</italic>-axis and, using this position, the original <italic>y</italic>-axis values were aligned and averaged arithmetically [1 profile per section (either left or right), 5 sections per animal]. Data are shown as the average profile ± SD of 3 animals per genotype.</p>

<title>Photic induction of cFos in the SCN and cFos-positive Cell Counting</title>
<p>A separate cohort of male WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (3–4 months-old) were housed in DD conditions and exposed to light (300 lx, 4500K, 15 min) at CT 16. Forty-five mins later, the mice were euthanized with isoflurane (30%–32%) and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) PFA. The brains were rapidly dissected out, post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4°C, and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose until further processing. Sequential coronal sections (40-50 μm), containing the middle SCN, were collected on a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) and further processed for cFos immunofluorescence as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; 2022; Longcore et al., 2024). Briefly, free-floating coronal sections, paired on the rostral-caudal axis and containing both the left and right SCN, were blocked for 1 h at room temperature (1% Bovine Serum Albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100, 10% normal donkey serum in 1xPBS) and then incubated overnight at 4°C with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against cFos (1:1000, RRID: AB_2247211; Cell Signaling) followed by a Cy3-conjugated donkey-anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Sections were mounted and coverslips applied with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI, and visualized on a Zeiss AxioImager M2 microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood NY) equipped with a motorized stage, an AxioCam MRm and the ApoTome imaging system. Z-Stack Images (35 images; 34mm, 1.029mm interval) of both the left and right middle SCN were acquired with a 20X objective using the Zeiss Zen digital imaging software, and two observers masked to the experimental groups performed the cell counting. The boundaries of the SCN were visualized using the DAPI nuclear staining and the cells immuno-positive for cFos counted with the aid of the Zen software tool ‘marker’ in three to five consecutive sections. The numbers obtained from the left and right SCN were averaged to obtain one value per section, and those from three-five sections averaged to obtain one value per animal and are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of 4 animals per genotype.</p>

<title>Histomorphometrical analyses of the SCN</title>
<p>Photographs of DAPI-stained sections generated from the WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice as described above were used to estimate the area, the perimeter, height and width of the SCN as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). For each animal, the four measurements were performed in three consecutive sections containing the middle SCN and acquired with a 10X objective and the Zen software. Measurements (in μm) of both the left and right SCN were obtained with the auxilium of the AxioVision software (Zeiss, Pleasanton, CA, USA). Because the borders of the DAPI-defined SCN are somewhat arbitrary, measurements were performed independently by two observers masked to the genotype of the animals. The area of the SCN in the three sections was summed, whilst the perimeter, height and width were averaged to obtain one value per side. No significant differences were found between the left and right SCN, therefore the values of the left and right SCN were averaged to obtain one value per animal. Data are shown as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of 6 animals per genotype.</p>

The impact of loss of <italic>Fmrp</italic> on the waveforms of sleep/wake cycles was analyzed using repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with time and genotype factors. While a two-way ANOVA with genotype and treatment as factors was used for the differences in sleep bouts between light phase and dark phase. The Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was applied after the two-way ANOVA. The datasets were examined for normality (Shapiro–Wilk test) and equal variance (Brown– Forsythe test); genotypic differences in the behavioral tests were determined by Student <italic>t</italic>-test. Correlations between circadian/sleep parameters and other behaviors were examined by applying the Pearson correlation analysis. Normal distribution of the histomorphological datasets and the relative intensity of the Cholera Toxin fluorescent processes in the whole SCN was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Since the samples did not pass the normality test a two-tailed Mann Whitney test was employed to identify significant differences between groups. The effect of the loss of FMRP on the photic induction of cFos cells was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test. Values are reported as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) or mean ± standard deviation (SD). Differences were determined significant if <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings by using Fmr1 knockout mice as a model to investigate the role of Fmr1 in sleep regulation. These mice exhibited clear evidence of sleep and circadian disturbances, including abnormal retinal innervation of the SCN, which may provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the observed behavioral deficits. Interestingly, the results suggest that a scheduled feeding approach could improve sleep and circadian rhythms while enhancing social interactions and reducing repetitive behaviors in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome. The topic is both intriguing and highly significant; however, while the evidence supporting the authors' claims is <bold>solid</bold>, several issues hinder the manuscript's clarity and impact.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances in Fmr1 KO mice. Initially, they monitored daily home cage behaviors to assess sleep and circadian disruptions. Next, they examined the adaptability of circadian rhythms in response to photic suppression and skeleton photic periods. To explore the underlying mechanisms, they traced retino-suprachiasmatic connectivity. The authors further analyzed the social behaviors of Fmr1 KO mice and tested whether a scheduled feeding strategy could mitigate sleep, circadian, and social behavior deficits. Finally, they demonstrated that scheduled feeding corrected cytokine levels in the plasma of mutant mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript addresses an important topic-investigating sleep deficits in an FXS mouse model and proposing a potential therapeutic strategy.</p>
<p>(2) The study includes a comprehensive experimental design with multiple methodologies, which adds depth to the investigation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The first serious issue in the manuscript is the lack of a clear description of how they performed the experiments and the missing definitions of various parameters in the results. Given that monitoring and analyzing sleep behaviors are the key experiments of this manuscript, I use the &quot;Immobility-Based Sleep Behavior&quot; section of Methods as an example to elaborate:</p>
<p>Incomplete or Incorrect Description of Tracking Threshold:</p>
<p>
o The phrase &quot;tracked the (40 sec or greater as previously described&quot; is incomplete and does not clarify what is being tracked. This appears to be an error in writing or editing.</p>
<p>
Unclear Relationship Between Threshold and EEG Validation:</p>
<p>
o The threshold &quot;40 sec or greater&quot; is mentioned without context or explanation of what it represents (e.g., sleep bout duration, inactivity, or another parameter). The reference to Fisher et al. (2016) and &quot;99% correlation with EEG-defined sleep&quot; seems misaligned with the paragraph's content.</p>
<p>Confusing Definition of Sleep Bout:</p>
<p>
o The definition of a sleep bout is unclear. Sleep bouts should logically be based on periods of inactivity, not activity. The sentence suggesting sleep is measured by &quot;activity staying above the threshold&quot; is confusing. The phrase &quot;3 counts of sleep per minute for longer than one minute&quot; requires clarification.</p>
<p>Unclear Data Selection for Analysis:</p>
<p>
o The phrase &quot;2 days with the best recording quality&quot; is vague and does not specify how &quot;best&quot; was determined or why only two days out of five were analyzed.</p>
<p>Awkward Grammar and Structure:</p>
<p>
o Phrases like &quot;Acquiring data were exported in 1-min bins&quot; are grammatically awkward. &quot;Acquiring&quot; should be &quot;Acquired.&quot; Some sentences are overly long and lack clarity, making the text harder to follow.</p>
<p>
In addition to this section, the authors should review all paragraphs in the Methods section to improve readability.</p>
<p>(2) Although the manuscript has a relatively long Methods section, some essential information is missing. For instance, the definition of sleep bout, as described above, is unclear. Additional missing information includes:</p>
<p>Figure 2: &quot;Rhythmic strength (%)&quot; and &quot;Cycle-to-cycle variability (min).&quot;</p>
<p>
Figure 3: &quot;Activity suppression.&quot;</p>
<p>
Figure 4: &quot;Rhythmic power (V%)&quot; (is this different from rhythmic strength (%)?) and &quot;Subjective day activity (%).&quot;</p>
<p>
Figure 5: Clear labeling of the SCN's anatomical features and an explanation for quantifying only the ventral part instead of the entire SCN. Alternatively, the authors should consider quantifying the whole SCN.</p>
<p>
Figure 6: Inconsistencies in terms like &quot;Sleep frag. (bout #)&quot; and &quot;Sleep bouts (#).&quot; Consistent terminology throughout the manuscript is essential.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 1A shows higher mouse activity during ZT13-16. It is unclear why the authors scheduled feeding during ZT15-21, as this seems to disturb the rhythm. Consistent with this, the body weights of WT and Fmr1 KO mice decreased after scheduled feeding. The authors should explain the rationale for this design clearly.</p>
<p>(4) The interpretation of social behavior results in Figure 6 is questionable. The authors claim that Fmr1 KO mice cannot remember the first stranger in a three-chamber test, writing, &quot;The reduced time in exploring and staying in the novel-mouse chamber suggested that the Fmr1 KO mutants were not able to distinguish the second novel mouse from the first now-familiar mouse.&quot; However, an alternative explanation is that Fmr1 KO mice do remember the first stranger but prefer to interact with it due to autistic-like tendencies. Data in Table 5 show that Fmr1 KO mice spent more time interacting with the first stranger in the 3-chamber social recognition test, which support this possibility. Similarly, in the five-trial social test, Fmr1 KO mice's preference for familiar mice might explain the reduced interaction with the second stranger.</p>
<p>In Figure 6C (five-trial social test results), only the fifth trial results are shown. Data for trials 1-4 should be provided and compared with the fifth trial. The behavioral features of mice in the 5-trial test can then be shown completely. In addition, the total interaction times for trials 1-4 (154 {plus minus} 15.3 for WT and 150 {plus minus} 20.9 for Fmr1 KO) suggest normal sociability in Fmr1 KO mice (it is different from the results of 3-chamber). Thus, individual data for trials 1-4 are required to draw reliable conclusions.</p>
<p>In Table 6 and Figure 6G-6J, the authors claim that &quot;Sleep duration (Figures 6G, H) and fragmentation (Figures 6I, J) exhibited a moderate-strong correlation with both social recognition and grooming.&quot; However, Figure 6I shows a p-value of 0.077, which is not significant. Moreover, Table 6 shows no significant correlation between SNPI of the three-chamber social test and any sleep parameters. These data do not support the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 7 demonstrates the effect of scheduled feeding on circadian activity and sleep behaviors, representing another critical set of results in the manuscript. Notably, the WT+ALF and Fmr1 KO+ALF groups in Figure 7 underwent the same handling as the WT and Fmr1 KO groups in Figures 1 and 2, as no special treatments were applied to these mice. However, the daily patterns observed in Figures 7A, 7B, 7F, and 7G differ substantially from those shown in Figures 2B and 1A, respectively. Additionally, it is unclear why the WT+ALF and Fmr1 KO+ALF groups did not exhibit differences in Figures 7I and 7J, especially considering that Fmr1 KO mice displayed more sleep bouts but shorter bout lengths in Figures 1C and 1D.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not specified whether the results in Figure 7 were collected after two weeks of scheduled feeding (for how many days?) or if they represent the average data from the two-week treatment period.</p>
<p>The rationale behind analyzing &quot;ZT 0-3 activity&quot; in Figure 7D instead of the parameters shown in Figures 2C and 2D is also unclear.</p>
<p>In Figure 7F, some data points appear to be incorrectly plotted. For instance, the dark blue circle at ZT13 connects to the light blue circle at ZT14 and the dark blue circle at ZT17. This is inconsistent, as the dark blue circle at ZT13 should link to the dark blue circle at ZT14. Similarly, it is perplexing that the dark blue circle at ZT16 connects to both the light blue and dark blue circles at ZT17. Such errors undermine confidence in the data. The authors need to provide a clear explanation of how these data were processed.</p>
<p>Lastly, in the Figure 7 legend, Table 6 is cited; however, this appears to be incorrect. It seems the authors intended to refer to Table 7.</p>
<p>(6) Similar to the issue in Figure 7F, the data for day 12 in Supplemental Figure 2 includes two yellow triangles but lacks a green triangle. It is unclear how the authors constructed this chart, and clarification is needed.</p>
<p>(7) In Figure 8, a 5-trial test was used to assess the effect of scheduled feeding on social behaviors. It is essential to present the results for all trials (1 to 4). Additionally, it is unclear whether the results for familial mice in Figure 8A correspond to trials 1, 2, 3, or 4.</p>
<p>
The legend for Figure 8 also appears to be incorrect: &quot;The left panels show the time spent in social interactions when the second novel stranger mouse was introduced to the testing mouse in the 5-trial social interaction test. The significant differences were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak's multiple comparisons test with feeding treatment and genotype as factors.&quot; This description does not align with the content of the left panels. Moreover, two-way ANOVA is not the appropriate statistical analysis for Figure 8A. The authors need to provide accurate details about the analysis and revise the figure legend accordingly.</p>
<p>(8) The circadian activity and sleep behaviors of Fmr1 KO mice have been reported previously, with some findings consistent with the current manuscript, while others contradict it. Although the authors acknowledge this discrepancy, it seems insufficiently thorough to simply state that the reasons for the conflicts are unknown. Did the studies use the same equipment for behavior recording? Were the same parameters used to define locomotor activity and sleep behaviors? The authors are encouraged to investigate these details further, as doing so may uncover something interesting or significant.</p>
<p>(9) Some subtitles in the Results section and the figure legends do not align well with the presented data. For example, in the section titled &quot;Reduced rhythmic strength and nocturnality in the Fmr1 KOs,&quot; it is unclear how the authors justify the claim of altered nocturnality in Fmr1 KO mice. How do the authors define changes in nocturnality? Additionally, the tense used in the subtitles and figure legends is incorrect. The authors are encouraged to carefully review all subtitles and figure legends to correct these errors and enhance readability.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors, using a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome, explore the very interesting hypothesis that restricting food access over a daily schedule will improve sleep patterns and, subsequently, behavioral capacities. By restricting food access from 12h to 6h over the nocturnal period (active period for mice), they show, in these KO mice, an improvement of the sleep pattern accompanied by reduced systemic levels of inflammatory markers and improved behavior. Using a classical mouse model of neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), these data suggest that eating patterns might improve sleep quality, reduce inflammation and improve cognitive/behavioral capacities in children with NDD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the paper is very well-written and easy to follow. The rationale of the study is generally well-introduced. The data are globally sound. The provided data support the interpretation overall.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The introduction part is quite long in the Abstract, leaving limited space for the data provided by the present study.</p>
<p>(2) A couple of points are not totally clear for a non-expert reader:</p>
<p>
- The Fmr1/Fxr2 double KO mice are not well described.</p>
<p>
- What is the rationale for performing both LD and DD measures?</p>
<p>(3) The data on cytokines and chemokines are interesting. However, the rationale for the selection of these molecules is not given. In addition, these measures have been performed in the systemic blood. Measures in the brain could be very informative.</p>
<p>(4) An important question is the potential impact of fasting vs the impact of the food availability restriction. Indeed fasting has several effects on brain functioning including cognitive functions.</p>
<p>(5) How do the authors envision the potential translation of the present study to human patients? How to translate the 12 to 6 hours of food access in mice to children with Fragile X syndrome?</p>
