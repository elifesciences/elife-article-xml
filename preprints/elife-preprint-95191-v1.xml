<title>Abstract</title><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors have produced encouraging results in cancer patients. However, the majority of ß-catenin mutated tumors have been described as lacking immune infiltrates and resistant to immunotherapy. The mechanisms by which the oncogenic ß-catenin affects immune surveillance remain unclear. Herein, we highlighted the involvement of ß-catenin in the regulation of the exosomal pathway and in the immune/cancer cell communication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We showed that mutated ß-catenin represses <italic>SDC4</italic> and <italic>RAB27A</italic> expression, two main actors of exosome biogenesis, in both liver cancer cell lines and HCC patient samples. Using nanoparticle tracking analysis and live-cell imaging, we further demonstrated that activated ß-catenin represses exosome release. Then, we demonstrated in 3D spheroid models that activation of β-catenin promotes a decrease of immune cell infiltration through a default in exosome secretion. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that oncogenic ß-catenin plays a key role in exosome biogenesis. Our study gives new insight into the impact of ß-catenin mutations on tumor microenvironment remodeling, which could lead to the development of new strategies to enhance immunotherapy response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>ß-catenin, encoded by the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> gene, is a main oncogene, mutated in various cancers, such as liver, endometrial, colorectal cancers or melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). These ß-catenin-mutated tumors share specific features such as a microenvironment devoid of immune infiltrates. Thus, in front of the therapeutic revolution for cancers, with the emergence of immunotherapy and more particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1), most of the ß-catenin mutated tumors remain resistant to immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). In these tumors, the oncogenic β-catenin is able to set up a microenvironment that favors tumor progression notably by promoting immune escape. Few studies have reported that the defect of intercellular communication between cancer cells and immune cells is partly mediated by a decrease of chemokines production leading to a reduction of immune infiltrates. In melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a decrease of, respectively CCL4 and CCL5, leads to a defective recruitment of dendritic cells and consequently impaired T-cell activity and immune escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). As immunotherapies are now part of the therapeutic arsenal for cancers, it is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying this immune escape phenotype. In this study we focused on ß-catenin-mutated HCC and intercellular communication through extracellular vesicles.</p>
<p>HCC is the most frequent form of primary liver adult cancer (80% of cases). HCC represents the 6<sup>th</sup> most common diagnosed cancer worldwide and the 3<sup>rd</sup> leading cause of cancer-related death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). This pathology has a poor prognosis and the diagnosis is often made at an advanced stage for which treatment options are limited, especially if surgery is no longer possible. In 2020, the combination of Atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) and Bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) became the first-line FDA-approved therapy for advanced HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). However, as described previously, β-catenin-mutated HCC are characterized by immune escape and are resistant to immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). <italic>CTNNB1</italic> gene mutations are found in 30-40% of HCC and trigger uncontrolled transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). These mutations prevent β-catenin degradation, fostering its role as a transcriptional co-factor and thus the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and invasion. The mechanistic bases underlying immune evasion in β-catenin mutated HCC are not yet fully understood.</p>
<p>Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly described as important actors of the tumor microenvironment communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>); but no studies explored their role in the immune escape and immunotherapy resistance of ß-catenin mutated tumors. EVs are nanometric phospholipid bilayer vesicles, which contain various cargoes such as RNAs or proteins and that impact recipient cells properties and functions. EVs can be classified into two main categories, namely, microvesicles and exosomes. Microvesicles (50 to 1000 nm) correspond to EVs directly secreted from the plasma membrane (PM). Whereas exosomes (50 to 150 nm) are released from an endosomal compartment, the multivesicular body (MVB), by its fusion with the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Among the actors implicated in exosome biogenesis and secretion, syndecan-4, involved in the endosomal membrane budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) and Rab27a which promotes the docking of MVB to the PM play key roles in exosome release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). As important mediators of cell-to-cell communication, EVs can regulate tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and infiltration of immune cells into the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In the context of HCC, it was reported that EVs derived from tumor cells can modulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, intrahepatic metastasis and tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these considerations, the current study investigated the role of exosomes in mutated ß-catenin mediated immune evasion in HCC. We demonstrated that mutated ß-catenin represses syndecan-4 and Rab27a expression, thus altering exosomal secretion from HCC cells, leading to a defective recruitment of immune cells in tumors.</p>

<title>Silencing of mutated ß-catenin increases exosome biogenesis-associated gene expression in HepG2 cells</title>
<p><italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations in HCC are often monoallelic, leaving a wild-type allele in tumor cells. To specifically study the oncogenic ß-catenin, we made use of the dual ß-catenin knockdown (KD) HepG2 model we published recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The transcriptional analysis of HepG2 KD cells revealed that the expression of 1973 genes (log2(Fold-change) &gt;0.5 and &lt;-0.5) is modulated upon mutated ß-catenin silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Gene ontology analysis (FunRich) performed on upregulated genes showed that mutated ß-catenin silencing enhanced significantly the expression of genes linked to specific cellular components including exosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Moreover, silencing of the mutated ß-catenin led to the overexpression of 17 genes associated to exosome biogenesis such as <italic>RAB27A</italic> and <italic>SDC4</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Similarly, proteomic analysis of HepG2 KD cells revealed exosomes as the main cellular component displaying up-regulated proteins upon mutated ß-catenin silencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1d-1e</xref>). Among these 9 up-regulated proteins we found Rab27a and Syndecan-4, consistent with the transcriptomic analysis results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>). These results suggest the involvement of mutated ß-catenin in the regulation of the exosomal pathway.</p>

<title>Stable depletion of mutated ß-catenin increases exosome secretion in the HepG2 cell model</title>
<p>In the model presented above, siRNAs were used to transiently silence mutated ß-catenin expression in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). To improve this method, the same sequences were used to develop an inducible shRNA strategy to stably inhibit the expression of the mutated ß-catenin. The use of doxycycline inducible promoters allowed regulating the expression of shRNAs over time for more in-depth and specific investigations of ß-catenin function in various cellular processes. In HepG2 cells, this strategy reduced protein expression by 62% for mutated ß-catenin and by 42% for CyclinD1, a ß-catenin positive transcriptional target (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). The model was also validated regarding mRNA expression of several ß-catenin transcriptional targets with a decrease of <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>AXIN2</italic> expression (positive targets) and an increase in <italic>ARG1</italic> expression (negative target) (Figure sup 1a). Also, as we previously described with the siRNA strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), after mutated ß-catenin depletion, we observed an increase in the number and in the size of bile canaliculi (BC), feature of more differentiated cells, in HepG2 cells (Figures sup 1b-1c). Nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA) revealed that the depletion of the mutated ß-catenin by both siRNA and shRNA strategies increased the number of secreted particles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, Figure sup 1d). Using NTA, the particle mean size, which was not altered between both conditions, was around 100-150 nm, compatible with the size of small EVs such as exosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, Figure sup 1d). To analyze the exosomal release in living HepG2 cells, we used a pH-sensitive reporter (CD63-pHluorin) allowing the visualization of MVB–PM fusion by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The tetraspanin CD63 is a well-known exosome surface marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). In cells expressing CD63-pHluorin, we could detect multiple increases in the fluorescence signal at the PM over the time suggesting fusion of CD63-pHluorin– positive acidic vesicles with the PM (Figure sup 1e). We found that mutated ß-catenin depletion in HepG2 cells significantly increased the number of fusion events, corresponding to secreted exosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). To go further, EVs released by HepG2 cells were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and characterized (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). First, western-blot analysis of isolated EVs confirmed the expression of the CD63 exosomal marker. It is noteworthy that we observed an increase of CD63 expression after mutated ß-catenin depletion suggesting an increase of the exosomal fraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). This increased expression of CD63 is also confirmed with the proteomic analysis of HepG2 KD cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>). Moreover, the WT and the mutated forms of the ß-catenin protein were also found in HepG2-derived EVs and the expression of mutated ß-catenin is decreased according to the cells of origin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). Then by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we demonstrated that HepG2-derived EVs are similar to exosomes regarding their morphology (flat cup-shaped) and their size (50-150nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2f</xref> and sup 1f). To better understand the regulation of exosome secretion by mutated ß-catenin, we performed TEM experiments in order to visualize MVBs, the origin of exosomes. TEM analysis revealed a higher number of MVBs per cell and an increase of their diameter upon mutated ß-catenin removal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>). Taken together these results highlight that mutated ß-catenin represses exosome secretion.</p>

<title>Mutated ß-catenin decreases Syndecan-4 and Rab27a expression in liver cancer cell lines</title>
<p>To explore the molecular aspect of the alteration of exosome secretion, we first attempt to confirm the data obtained in our transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. In HepG2 cells, we confirmed that transient (Figures sup 2a-b) and stable (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3a-3b</xref>) mutated ß-catenin depletion increased both <italic>SDC4</italic> and <italic>RAB27A</italic> gene and protein expression. Due to the lack of efficient antibodies against SDC4, we failed in analyzing SDC4 protein expression by Western-Blot. We confirmed the increase of expression of Syndecan-4 and Rab27a by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3c-3d</xref>). We then aimed to extend these results to other liver cancer cell lines. We analyzed <italic>SDC4</italic>, <italic>RAB27A</italic>, <italic>ARG1</italic> and <italic>AXIN2</italic> basal mRNA expression in five different liver cancer cell lines, that carry a different <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutational status, and identified positive correlations between <italic>SDC4</italic> and <italic>RAB27A</italic> with <italic>ARG1</italic> (ß-catenin negative target) and negative correlations between <italic>SDC4</italic> and <italic>RAB27A</italic> with <italic>AXIN2</italic> (ß-catenin positive target) (Figure sup 2c-d). Then, we analyzed Rab27a basal protein expression in these five cell lines, and identified a negative correlation between ß-catenin and Rab27a expression (Figures sup 2f-2g). In the two liver cancer cell lines bearing a ß-catenin point mutation (Huh6 and SNU398 cells), inducible shRNA strategy with doxycycline respectively reduced by 63% and 49% the ß-catenin protein expression (Figures sup 2h-2i). We validated both Huh6 and SNU398 models using the shRNA ß-catenin strategy as we observed a decrease of <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>AXIN2</italic> mRNA expression and an increase of <italic>ARG1</italic> mRNA expression (Figures sup 2j-2k). In agreement with the results obtained in HepG2 cells, ß-catenin depletion also increased <italic>SDC4</italic> and <italic>RAB27A</italic> gene expression and Rab27a protein expression in Huh6 and SNU398 cells treated with doxycycline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3e-h</xref>). In order to mimic the ß-catenin activation in a non-mutated HCC cell line, we treated Huh7 cells with a GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR99021) limiting ß-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. We demonstrated that CHIR99021 treatment increased ß-catenin protein expression (2.37-fold) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3i</xref>) and induced its translocation into the nucleus in Huh7 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3j</xref>). The presence of ß-catenin in the nucleus was associated with the deregulation of ß-catenin transcriptional targets (Figure sup 2l). Consistent with our data, CHIR99021 treatment decreased <italic>SDC4</italic> and <italic>RAB27A</italic> gene expression, and Rab27a protein level in Huh7 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3k-l</xref>). Then, we analyzed the exosomal release by TIRF microscopy in living Huh7 cells expressing CD63-pHluorin. We found that CHIR99021 treatment significantly decreased the number of fusion events in Huh7 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3m</xref>). All together, these results revealed that ß-catenin mutation/activation represses the expression of syndecan-4 and Rab27A, two proteins involved in exosome biogenesis, associated with a repression of exosomal secretion.</p>

<title>Mutated ß-catenin promotes immune evasion in HCC cells through exosomes</title>
<p>We aim at deciphering the involvement of mutated ß-catenin in HCC immune escape through the regulation of exosomes. We used 3D spheroid models from two liver cancer cell lines (HepG2 and Huh7) and after 24h co-culture with Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC), immune cell infiltration was evaluated by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4a-4b</xref>). First of all, we assessed the capability of PBMC to invade spheroids formed from Huh7 cells treated with CHIR9901. We observed a decrease of PBMC infiltration and an increase of tumor cell survival when Huh7 cells were treated with CHIR9901 compare to control condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). Of note, we confirmed that CHIR99021 increased ß-catenin and decreased Rab27a protein expression in Huh7 spheroids with no impact on the cell viability (Figures sup 3a-3b). Next, we showed that the depletion of mutated ß-catenin protein enhanced PBMC infiltration in HepG2 cells associated with a decrease of tumor cell survival (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). We validated that mutated ß-catenin protein is correctly depleted in HepG2 spheroids, with an increase of Rab27a protein expression and with no impact on the cell viability (Figures sup 3c-d). Altogether, these results confirm the involvement of mutated ß-catenin in immune evasion. We next sought to investigate the role of exosomes in this process. In order to blunt exosome secretion, we used siRNA directed against Rab27a in spheroids formed with HepG2 cells depleted for the mutated ß-catenin. Rab27a depletion decreases the number of secreted particles without any effect on cell viability in HepG2 shßcat MUT spheroids (Figures sup 3e-g). Furthermore, depletion of Rab27a decreased PBMC infiltration associated with an increase of tumor cell survival (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>), strongly suggesting the determinant role of exosomes in immune cell infiltration.</p>

<title><italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations are associated to low expression of exosomal biogenesis-associated genes in HCC patient samples</title>
<p>To determine whether markers of exosomal biogenesis are deregulated in HCC human samples, we assessed the expression of <italic>SDC4</italic> and <italic>RAB27A</italic> using public transcriptomic data from two different cohorts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>: TGCA data sets from Cbioportal, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>: Boyault et <italic>al.</italic> article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ß-catenin is a main oncogene in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) and several studies have reported a key role for mutated ß-catenin in immune escape in several types of cancer such as HCC, colorectal cancer, melanoma and glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) but its mechanisms of action in this process remain to be explored deeper. During the past decades, ß-catenin mutated HCC have been classified at the molecular, histo-pathological and clinical levels as liver cancers with specific features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). More recently, these tumors have been described as cold with low immune infiltrates and resistant to immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study we deciphered the role of mutated ß-catenin in cell communication between cancer cells and immune cells. Based on omic results, we hypothesized a role of EV in the control of immune infiltrates in ß-catenin mutated HCC. Following ISEV guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), we applied various techniques to address the impact of ß-catenin activation on EV secretion. Using NTA, we demonstrated that HepG2 cells silenced for mutated ß-catenin secrete more particles than control cells. Our different analyses and results (TIRF with the CD63 exosomal marker, TEM for the EVs shape and size, regulation of Rab27a expression) led us to take a strong interest in small EVs, i.e. exosomes, a subpopulation of EVs. Using real-time visualization of the release of CD63-enriched EVs we demonstrated that mutated ß-catenin silencing in HepG2 cells favors small EV secretion. The link between activation of ß-catenin and secretion of small EVs was further confirmed in ß-catenin non-mutated cells, Huh7 cells, treated by GSK3 inhibitor, suggesting that activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway may result in a repression of the EV machinery in tumor cells. This link between ß-catenin and EVs was poorly explored in the literature and essentially restricted to the identification of ß-catenin as a common EV cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). For example, it was shown that tetraspanins expression reduces the cellular pool of β-catenin by enhancing the exosome-associated export of β-catenin from the cell and that this exosomal discharge of β-catenin downregulates the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). More recently, using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-mediated screening to identify genes involved in EV release, Lu et <italic>al</italic>. identified the Wnt signaling pathway in the top hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Indeed, by this approach, a number of Wnt-signaling modulators appeared among the candidates as EV biogenesis regulators, which were further validated in chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. They also demonstrated that Wnt-mediated GSK3 inactivation, in K562 cells, regulated EV release in a Rab27a dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Herein, we added new findings reporting that this regulation also occurs in solid tumors. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time the specific involvement of the oncogenic ß-catenin in the regulation of exosome biogenesis.</p>
<p>At the molecular level, thanks to global approaches we found that oncogenic ß-catenin represses the expression of genes involved in the EV machinery. We indeed found that genes from the Rab (<italic>RAB8B</italic>, <italic>RAB11A</italic>, <italic>RAB11B</italic>, <italic>RAB17, RAB27A</italic>), Vamp (<italic>VAMP2</italic>, <italic>VAMP5</italic>, <italic>VAMP8</italic>) and Vps (<italic>VPS4A</italic>, <italic>VPS4B</italic>, <italic>VPS16</italic>, <italic>VPS28</italic>) families were upregulated upon removal of the oncogenic ß-catenin in HepG2 cells. Herein, we focused on <italic>RAB27A</italic> and <italic>SDC4</italic> genes, which were the most dysregulated in our transcriptomic analysis. We showed that mutated ß-catenin represses their gene expression in liver cancer cell lines. In non-mutated ß-catenin HCC cells, activation of ß-catenin showed that both gene and protein expression of Rab27a were decreased.</p>
<p>We further found a correlation between the presence of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations and the low expression of <italic>RAB27A</italic> and <italic>SDC4</italic> in human HCC patient samples. The way <italic>RAB27A</italic> and <italic>SDC4</italic> gene expression is repressed by ß-catenin remains to be explored. We described positive correlation between expression of <italic>SDC4</italic> and <italic>RAB27A</italic> and expression of negative transcriptional targets of ß-catenin, and negative correlation with expression of positive targets in tumors. Even if the mechanism by which ß-catenin and LEF/TCF transcription factors led to target gene expression activation is well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), it is not the case for the repression process. In melanoma the transcription repressor ATF3 induced by the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway has been associated with <italic>CCL4</italic> repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Analysis of <italic>SDC4</italic> and <italic>RAB27A</italic> promoter sequences revealed the presence of consensus sequences of Lef1, Tcf4 and Atf3 binding (data not shown), suggesting that these newly identified target genes could be regulated at the transcriptional level by transcription factors known to associate with ß-catenin. In this line, <italic>SDC4</italic> was found as a negative Tcf4 target gene in HCC mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the EV machinery alteration, we further addressed the impact of the ß-catenin-mediated repression of EV secretion on immune cell infiltration in tumors. Herein, the functional role of these tumor-derived exosomes in tumor immunity was studied using liver cancer 3D models and PBMC. We showed that mutated ß-catenin promotes a decrease of immune cell infiltration in micro-tumors through a decrease of exosome secretion by depletion of Rab27a using siRNA. The small GTPase Rab27a has been described in several cancer progression mechanisms such as metastasis, cell invasion or migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). The oncogenic function of Rab27a is mainly due to its function as regulator of exosome secretion, which modulates cancer cell function and tumor microenvironment. In mammary carcinoma cells, the decrease of exosome secretion by Rab27a inhibition resulted in a diminution of primary tumor growth and lung metastatic dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). However, shRNA knockdown of Rab27a in a prostate cancer model revealed a dominant immunosuppressive role for EVs during antigen cross presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). These data are inconsistent with our own, meaning that Rab27a-induced exosomal secretion is a double-edged sword in tumor progression. This could be due to the content of EVs. In fact, EVs are known to contain heterogeneous cargos that can play a critical role in immunomodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). For example, the main immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-ß expressed by tumoral-derived EVs has been identified in Natural Killer cell function suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). EVs released by tumoral cells can also carry several miRNAs mainly known to be involved in immune suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). MiR-103a and Let-7a in tumor EVs promote M2-like polarization in lung and melanoma cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Interestingly, immunomodulatory proteins such as CSF-1, CCL2, FTH, FTL, and TGF-β chemokines have been identified in tumor exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). The content of ß-catenin-regulated EVs remains to be explored to fully understand their function in the immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study is the first description of the oncogenic ß-catenin as a key regulator of the exosome machinery. Moreover, it gave new insights regarding the regulation of tumor-derived exosome production by the ß-catenin pathway and their involvement in the immune escape observed in ß-catenin mutated HCC. Given that ß-catenin is also mutated in melanoma, endometrial and colorectal cancers, these new findings may have a broader significance. Our data indicate that exosomes could be a promising biomarker and that restoring the tumor exosomal secretion of ß-catenin-mutated tumors may increase the communication between tumor and immune cells, and turning hot, cold tumors.</p>

<p>Three independent biological replicates were performed on total protein extracts from human HepG2 cells transfected with control siRNA or ß-catenin mutated siRNA. 10 μg of proteins were loaded on a 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel and proteins were visualized by Colloidal Blue staining. Migration was stopped when samples had just entered the resolving gel and the unresolved region of the gel was cut into only one segment. The steps of sample preparation and protein digestion by the trypsin were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). NanoLC-MS/MS analysis were performed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLC Nano-UPHLC system (Thermo Scientific, USA) coupled to a nanospray Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ Tribrid™ Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, California, USA). Each peptide extracts were loaded on a 300 μm ID x 5 mm PepMap C18 precolumn (Thermo Scientific, USA) at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. After a 3 min desalting step, peptides were separated on a 50 cm EasySpray column (75 μm ID, 2 μm C18 beads, 100 Å pore size, ES903, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 4-40% linear gradient of solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN) in 57 min. The separation flow rate was set at 300 nL/min. The mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode at a 2.0 kV needle voltage. Data were acquired using Xcalibur 4.4 software in a data-dependent mode. MS scans (m/z 375-1500) were recorded at a resolution of R = 120000 (@ m/z 200), a standard AGC target and an injection time in automatic mode, followed by a top speed duty cycle of up to 3 seconds for MS/MS acquisition. Precursor ions (2 to 7 charge states) were isolated in the quadrupole with a mass window of 1.6 Th and fragmented with HCD@28% normalized collision energy. MS/MS data was acquired in the ion trap with rapid scan mode, a 20% normalized AGC target and a maximum injection time in dynamic mode. Selected precursors were excluded for 60 seconds. Protein identification was done in Proteome Discoverer 2.5. Mascot 2.5 algorithm was used for protein identification in batch mode by searching against a Uniprot Homo sapiens database (75 793 entries, release September 3, 2020). Two missed enzyme cleavages were allowed for the trypsin. Mass tolerances in MS and MS/MS were set to 10 ppm and 0.6 Da. Oxidation (M) and acetylation (K) were searched as dynamic modifications and carbamidomethylation (C) as static modification. Raw LC-MS/MS data were imported in Proline Studio for feature detection, alignment, and quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Protein identification was accepted only with at least 2 specific peptides with a pretty rank=1 and with a protein FDR value less than 1.0% calculated using the “decoy” option in Mascot. Label-free quantification of MS1 level by extracted ion chromatograms (XIC) was carried out with parameters indicated previously. The normalization was carried out on median of ratios. The inference of missing values was applied with 5% of the background noise.

<p>This study reports <bold>compelling</bold> data supporting the role of beta-catenin on intercellular communication occurring via extracellular vesicles, with implications for immune evasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This <bold>fundamental</bold> insight sheds light on the underlying biology of HCC at a time when an increasing number of treatment options, including targeted small molecular inhibitors and immuno-oncologic drugs are being used to treat patients in the absence of validated predictive biomarkers. This work will be of special interest to researchers investigating the basic biology of liver function and HCC, and also to readers investigating novel pathways for therapeutic targeting of HCC.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This finding shows a connection between cancer-associated beta-catenin mutations and extracellular vesicle secretion. A link between the beta-catenin mutation and expression of trafficking and exocytosis machinery. They used a multidisciplinary approach to explore expression levels of relevant proteins and single-particle imaging to directly explore the release of extracellular vesicles. These results suggest a role of extracellular vesicles in immune evasion in liver cancer with the role needing to be further explored in other forms of cancer. I find this work to be compelling and of strong significance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper uses multidisciplinary methods to demonstrate the compelling role of beta-catenin mutations in suppressing EV secretion in tumors. The results and imaging are extremely convincing and compelling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is no major weakness in this work. There are only things that left me more intrigued about this work. While the role of Rab27 was strongly examined, the hits of the VAMP proteins were not explored in detail. I was wondering if the decrease in the presence of VAMPS directly suggests the final step of membrane fusion in the exocytosis of EVs is what is being impaired. Or if it is other trafficking steps along the EV secretion pathway.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Dantzer and colleagues are investigating the pivotal role of ß-catenin, a gene that undergoes mutation in various cancer cells, and its influence on promoting the evasion of immune cells. In their initial experiments, the authors developed a HepG2 mutated ß-catenin KD model, conducting transcriptional and proteomic analyses. The results revealed that the silencing of mutated ß-catenin in HepG2 cells led to an up-regulation in the expression of exosome biogenesis genes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the researchers verified that these KD cells exhibited increased production of exosomes, with the mutant form of ß-catenin concurrently decreasing the expression of SDC4 and Rab27a. Intriguingly, applying a GSK inhibitor to the cells resulted in reduced expression of SDC4 and Rab27a. Subsequent findings indicated that mutated ß-catenin actively facilitates immune escape through exosomes, and silencing exosome biogenesis correlates with a decrease in immune cell infiltration.</p>
<p>
In a crucial clinical correlation, the study demonstrated that patients with ß-catenin mutations exhibited low levels of exosome biogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the data robustly supports the outlined conclusions, and the study is commendably designed and executed. However, there are a few suggestions for manuscript improvement.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
No weaknesses were identified by this reviewer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this very important study by Dantzer et al., 'Emerging role of oncogenic b-catenin in exosome biogenesis as a driver of immune escape in hepatocellular carcinoma' the authors define a role for oncogenic b-catenin on exosome biology and explore the link between reduce exosome secretion and tumor immune cell evasion. Using transcriptional and proteomic analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells with either oncogenic or wildtype b-catenin the authors find that oncogenic b-catenin negatively regulates exosome biogenesis.</p>
<p>The authors can provide compelling evidence that oncogenic b-catenin in different hepatocellular carcinoma cells negatively regulates exosome biogenesis and secretion, by downregulation of, amongst others, SDC4 and RAB27A, two proteins involved in exosome biogenesis. The authors corroborate these results by inducing b-catenin activation using CHIR99021 in a hepatocarcinoma cell line with non-oncogenic bCatenin (Huh7 cells). The authors can further demonstrate convincingly that a reduction in exosome release by hepatocarcinoma spheroids leads to a reduction in immune cell infiltration into the tumor spheroid.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very important and well-conceived study, that appeals to a readership beyond the field of hepatocarcinoma. The authors demonstrate a compelling link between oncogenic bCatenin and exosome biogenesis. Their results are convincing and with well-designed control experiments. The authors included various complementary lines of investigation to verify their findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One limitation of this study is that the mechanistic relationship of exosome release and how they affect immune cells remains to be elucidated. In this context, the authors conclusions rest on the assumption that hepatocarcinoma immune evasion is based exclusively on the reduced number of exosomes. However, the authors do not analyze exosome composition between exosomes of wild type and oncogenic background, which could be different.</p>
