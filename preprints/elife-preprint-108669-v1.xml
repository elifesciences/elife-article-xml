<abstract>
<p>The liver’s microenvironment consists of interconnected vascular, biliary, and neural networks that regulate homeostasis and disease progression. However, the lack of high-resolution 3D visualization hinders our understanding of their interactions in health and pathology.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed a high-resolution multiplex 3D imaging method integrating multicolor metallic compound nanoparticle (MCNP) perfusion and optimized CUBIC tissue clearing, enabling simultaneous 3D visualization of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile ducts, and central vein spatial networks in mouse liver.</p>
<p>Using this approach, we identified a novel perivascular structure, the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC), regularly distributed along the portal vein axis between its endothelium and the periportal lobule sinusoid. The PLC contains a unique population of CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ dual-positive endothelial cells with a distinct gene expression profile, potentially linked to bile acid transport, biliary epithelial cell proliferation, and neural development.</p>
<p>Under normal physiological conditions, the PLC colocalizes with terminal bile duct branches and sympathetic nerve fibers. During liver fibrosis progression, the PLC dynamically extends into liver lobules alongside advancing fibrosis, acting as a scaffold guiding the migration of bile ducts and nerve fibers into the hepatic parenchyma.</p>
<p>Differential gene expression and GO enrichment analyses further revealed neurodevelopmental and axon guidance pathway enrichment in the CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ endothelial population of PLC during fibrosis.</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings establish the PLC as a critical structural and functional hub integrating hepatic vascular, biliary, and neural systems to regulate liver function. This study advances our understanding of liver biology and offers potential therapeutic targets for liver diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The liver performs diverse physiological functions including nutrient metabolism, detoxification, bile secretion, and immune regulation, all of which rely on its unique microanatomy — the hepatic lobule, the smallest structural and functional unit <sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. To sustain the efficient operation of the vast number of hepatic lobules distributed throughout the parenchyma, the liver has evolved the most complex and densely n organized vascular network in the body, consisting primarily of the portal vein system, central vein system, hepatic artery system, biliary system, and intrahepatic autonomic nerve network <sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Together, these systems form a multicompartmental 3D network, integrating blood transport, bile drainage, and neuroimmune regulation essential for maintaining the hepatic microenvironment. Despite their distinct physiological functions, these systems are closely interconnected, coordinating with one another to support metabolic, immune, and regenerative processes within each lobule <sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. While macroscopic hepatic vascular patterns and metabolic zonation have been described <sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. how these networks interact with countless microscale, spatially heterogeneous lobules remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Traditional two-dimensional (2D) histological analysis, while offering high spatial resolution, has long been regarded as the gold standard for morphological studies <sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. However, it presents notable limitations when applied to the investigation of complex three-dimensional (3D) vascular systems. On one hand, single-section analyses cannot restore the full 3D connectivity of vascular structures, while serial section reconstruction is prone to alignment errors and remains inadequate for resolving the interactions among multiple ductal systems. Therefore, achieving 3D-level visualization of multiple intrahepatic vascular systems is essential for studying their dynamic interactions during liver development, homeostasis, and disease progression.</p>
<p>Conventional imaging modalities such as ultrasound, micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely applied in both experimental animal studies and clinical practice. Although these techniques can capture gross pathological alterations in the hepatic vasculature, they lack the spatial resolution required to resolve micrometer-scale structures. X-ray phase-contrast computed tomography (PCCT), recently developed for liver microvascular imaging, has achieved contrast-agent-free microvasculature visualization in rat livers<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> . However, its contrast sensitivity remains insufficient for resolving subcellular structures. Similarly, the DUCT technique successfully reconstructed a 3D portal vein–bile duct network in the mouse liver via dual-color resin casting, but was limited by its inability to resolve luminal structures smaller than 5 μm <sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. To fully understand how multiple hepatic ductal systems maintain their intricate terminal 3D interactions — such as portal vein– hepatic artery blood flow coupling, bile duct–vessel countercurrent exchange, and nerve–vessel signaling — and how these systems collectively coordinate with liver lobules, a more effective multicolor, high-resolution 3D imaging strategy is urgently needed. Nevertheless, integrating such approaches for the liver remains challenging for several reasons. First, the hepatic vasculature is structurally complex, featuring ultra- dense vascular distributions (with hepatic sinusoids occupying 10–15% of liver volume) and multilevel, intertwined arrangements (arterial branches encircling portal vein branches, and bile ducts running parallel to blood vessels). Imaging must therefore achieve submicron spatial resolution (≤1 μm) while maintaining millimeter-scale tissue penetration depth<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.Second, the liver’s tissue-specific properties significantly interfere with imaging. Endogenous pigments (such as bilirubin and lipofuscin) and strong autofluorescent components (such as collagen and NADPH/FAD) severely impair tissue-clearing efficiency and degrade fluorescence signal quality, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in traditional clearing–staining–imaging workflows<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.Third, multiple intrahepatic systems — including blood vessels, bile ducts, nerves, lymphatics, and immune cell networks — are densely interwoven and functionally interdependent. However, there is currently a lack of efficient 3D multi-target labeling strategies capable of simultaneously visualizing these systems in both their hierarchical macroscopic structures and their fine terminal interactions. In summary, the liver’s unique structural complexity and tissue-specific properties impose significant constraints on the performance of existing clearing techniques (such as CLARITY and iDISCO) and labeling protocols (such as immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence) in 3D imaging applications, limiting imaging depth, resolution, and SNR<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Compared to organs such as the brain and kidney, the application of 3D, high-resolution, multicolor imaging in the liver remains markedly underdeveloped.</p>
<p>Given these limitations, the development of liver-adapted, high-fidelity clearing strategies, deep multi-target labeling systems, and compatible 3D imaging platforms has become an urgent priority and a key technical breakthrough needed to advance both physiological and pathophysiological studies of the liver.</p>
<p>An ideal three-dimensional (3D) visualization technique for the liver should enable clear delineation of the hierarchical architecture and structural alterations of the vascular systems at a macroscopic level, while simultaneously allowing the observation of terminal vascular structures coordinating with liver lobules at a single- cell resolution. Considering the unique anatomical and cellular characteristics of the liver, our research team has developed an advanced 3D visualization strategy tailored for the hepatic multi-ductal system, building upon existing imaging technologies. The core innovations of this strategy include:(1) Establishment of an efficient liver clearing protocol (liver-CUBIC): By systematically optimizing sample processing procedures and reagent compositions within the CUBIC tissue clearing framework, we achieved a 63.89% improvement in clearing efficiency and a 20.12% increase in tissue transparency.(2) Selection and application of multicolor metal compound nanoparticles (MCNPs): These nanoparticles exhibit excellent water resistance and compatibility with the Liver-CUBIC system. Their multicolor properties enable stable, simultaneous 3D labeling of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile ducts, and central vein in mouse livers. Moreover, the MCNP series possesses unique excitation/emission spectra, making them suitable for multimodal imaging applications including brightfield, extended depth of field (EDF), and fluorescence microscopy. Their high spatial resolution supports the visualization of fine vascular terminal branches and subcellular structures.(3) Development of a multimodal immunolabeling system: This 3D visualization strategy is compatible with both DAB chromogenic and TSA-based multiplex immunofluorescence staining, enabling simultaneous labeling of various cell types and molecular antigens alongside vascular system visualization. This allows for the generation of high signal-to-noise ratio, multi-target, subcellular-resolution 3D structural maps of the liver. In summary, this newly established 3D visualization platform for hepatic multi-ductal systems provides both macroscopic and microscopic insights, offering a powerful tool for investigating the spatial organization, functional coordination, and pathological remodeling mechanisms of the liver microenvironment.</p>
<p>Based on this platform, we successfully applied the proposed strategy to investigate the microanatomical architecture of the hepatic vascular system in mice, with a particular focus on elucidating how the complex intraparenchymal vascular networks are spatially organized and coordinate with liver lobule units at single-cell resolution. Through multimodal microscopic visualization, multicolor antigen-specific labeling, and targeted gene expression analysis, we identified a previously unrecognized functional structure termed the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC). This novel structure is distributed periodically along the portal vein axis and is closely associated with terminal bile duct branches and autonomic nerve plexuses, forming a specialized spatial interaction unit. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis combined with multiplex 3D immunostaining confirmed that the PLC possesses distinct spatial localization, morphological features, and molecular marker profiles within the murine liver. Its unique gene expression signatures and intimate interactions with multiple terminal vascular branches suggest a cooperative mechanism underlying hepatic microanatomical organization.</p>
<p>This discovery not only validates the superior capability of our multi-ductal 3D visualization platform in resolving microscale hepatic vascular interactions but also provides a technical foundation for establishing a new paradigm in hepatic vascular research. By enabling full-scale visualization from the organ to the vascular network and down to the single-cell level, this platform offers a powerful methodological tool for uncovering regulatory mechanisms of hepatic physiology and pathological remodeling.</p>

<title>H<sub>2</sub>O₂-Enhanced CUBIC Clearing Coupled with Multicolor Nanoprobes for High- Resolution 3D Mapping of Liver Ductal -Vascular network</title>
<p>The CUBIC (Clear, Unobstructed Brain/Body Imaging Cocktails and Computational analysis) technique has been widely applied in the tissue clearing and 3D imaging of organs such as the brain, kidney, and heart due to its excellent compatibility with various fluorescent dyes and immunolabeling protocols[<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]</sup>. However, the application of CUBIC in liver tissue remains challenging because of the liver’s high heme content and densely packed cellular architecture, which leads to pronounced light scattering and markedly limits the clearing efficacy. In addition, the conventional CUBIC protocol requires up to 9 days for liver tissue processing, severely restricting experimental throughput (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, red schematic).To address these limitations, Laura M. Molina et al. incorporated a hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) bleaching step into the CLARITY protocol, improving liver transparency but failing to reduce the processing time; clearing efficiency also remained suboptimal <sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> In this study, we developed an optimized clearing strategy termed Liver-CUBIC, featuring two key modifications:(1) Integration of an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-CUBIC hybrid system, incorporating an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> bleaching step into the CUBIC workflow. This dual-action mechanism effectively removes pigments such as heme and lipofuscin through oxidative reactions, while partially clearing lipid components to reduce light scattering.(2) Optimization of urea concentration, increasing from 25% to 40%, enhancing protein denaturation to minimize light scattering and improve tissue permeability, thus promoting more uniform reagent distribution. Experimental results confirmed that the Liver-CUBIC protocol significantly improved liver clearing efficiency (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). Specifically, initial PBS/PFA perfusion efficiently removed residual heme (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>, panel 2); subsequent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> bleaching eliminated pigment deposits (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>, panel 3); and final 40% urea treatment achieved refractive index homogenization (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>, panel 4).Using this optimized protocol, the total clearing time was reduced from 9 days with conventional CUBIC (25% urea, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, red schematic) to 3.25 days with 40% urea + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, green schematic), representing a 63.89% increase in efficiency. Importantly, no significant tissue expansion was observed following Liver-CUBIC treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>).Transmittance measurements revealed that the Liver-CUBIC protocol (40% urea + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) markedly outperformed conventional CUBIC, with an average transmittance improvement of 20.12% (P &lt; 0.0001; 95% CI: 19.14–21.09) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, in 1 mm-thick liver sections, the clearing time was reduced to just 20 minutes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>), while real-time imaging demonstrated complete clearing of 200 μm-thick slices within 60 seconds (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>; Supplementary Video 1), fully meeting the demands for rapid live imaging.</p>
<p>Metal compound nanoparticles (MCNPs) exhibit excellent brightness, tunable multicolor properties, and strong resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> bleaching, maintaining color stability even after Liver-CUBIC clearing. Utilizing four distinct MCNP colors — pink, green, black, and yellow — we developed a four-channel vascular labeling strategy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref> and S1D). The hepatic artery was perfused with yellow MCNPs via the left ventricle, bile ducts were retrogradely injected with green MCNPs through the extrahepatic duct, portal veins were directly filled with pink MCNPs, and central veins were labeled using black MCNPs via the inferior vena cava Using this method, simultaneous four-color labeling of the intrahepatic ductal-vascular system can be achieved (Figures S1E–S1G), while single- or dual-color labeling allows for higher- resolution visualization of fine microscale structures. High-resolution 3D imaging revealed that MCNP-Green-labeled large intrahepatic bile ducts exhibit a one-to-one parallel topology with adjacent portal vein branches. At the periphery, the terminal biliary network forms a classic three-dimensional plexus, characterized by helical configurations and polygonal extensions projecting into the hepatic lobules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).Meanwhile, MCNP-Pink-labeled portal veins displayed a typical tree-like branching pattern in the central regions of hepatic lobes, but in the marginal areas, they formed an unusually dense, radial micro-branching pattern (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Notably, the terminal micro-branches of the portal vein appeared not only around secondary branches but also intermittently along the main trunks, challenging the conventional notion of strictly hierarchical vascular bifurcation. For MCNP-Black-labeled central veins, imaging revealed sparse, circular or oval fenestrae measuring 50–100 nm in diameter distributed across the surface of the central vein trunks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Previous scanning electron microscopy studies have described similar structures, which are thought to facilitate the return of hepatocyte-synthesized metabolic products (such as lipoproteins and cytokines) into the circulation, assist immune cell trafficking from the liver to the systemic circulation, and help maintain hepatic sinusoid–interstitium osmotic pressure balance<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Additionally, dual-label imaging using MCNP-Pink and MCNP-Green demonstrated that the hepatic artery runs parallel to the portal vein trunk, with the hepatic artery displaying a notably smaller diameter compared to its adjacent portal vein. At the periphery, hepatic arterial branches formed a three-dimensional entwined network that closely contacted the portal vein micro-branches (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>).

<p>Extended depth-of-field imaging revealed that MCNP-Green specifically labels a distinct vascular structural unit located in the adventitial layer of the portal vein trunk, which we designate as the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>, orange arrows). Morphologically, this structure consists of fine vascular branches distributed along the surface of the portal vein trunk. Its base is anchored to the portal vein, and it radiates outward in a lobular pattern centered on the portal vein, giving rise to multiple terminal branches that directly connect to the liver sinusoids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>The PLC structures align in a serial arrangement along the portal vein trunk (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>)</title>
<p>Further validation by confocal fluorescence imaging confirmed that following portal vein perfusion with MCNP-Green, fluorescence signals are highly enriched within the PLC. Quantitative analysis showed that the fluorescence intensity within the PLC was significantly higher than that observed in the portal vein lumen and liver sinusoid regions, with minimal dye diffusion at the PLC periphery, indicating predominant localization within the main PLC structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2G</xref>–<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>). In contrast, MCNP-Pink signals, introduced via hepatic artery perfusion, predominantly localized within the PLC and its margins without crossing into adjacent PLC units. Due to differences in perfusion pathways, the pink dye demonstrated a greater tendency to extend from the PLC towards the lobular parenchyma compared to the green dye. This phenomenon likely reflects the relatively low permeability of the PLC region: green nanoparticles delivered through the portal vein are largely retained within the low-permeability PLC core, with limited peripheral diffusion, whereas the arterial pink dye, influenced by the pressure and flow characteristics of the hepatic artery system, effectively labels the peripheral PLC structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2G</xref>–<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the Extended Depth-of-Field Multimodal Imaging System, we quantitatively analyzed the distribution of PLC structures in relation to portal vein diameter and anatomical location. By defining classical hexagonal hepatic lobule units through the primary portal vein trunk containing PLC structures and its two adjacent secondary branches (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), quantitative analysis revealed that the length of the primary portal vein trunk ranged from 269.85 μm to 1513.67 μm (n = 19), with a median length of 769.89 μm (IQR: 593.67 μm–987.77 μm). The number of PLC structures per trunk ranged from 1 to 4, with 68.42% (13/19) of portal veins containing two PLCs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). Notably, neither the number nor the area of PLCs showed significant correlation with the length of the portal vein trunk (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>), indicating that morphological parameters alone (such as trunk length) may be insufficient to define hepatic lobular units, especially given the substantial differences in blood transport capacity among portal veins of varying diameters. The diameters of the primary portal veins bearing PLC structures ranged from 63.45 μm to 321.42 μm, and PLC area showed a significant positive correlation with portal vein diameter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>), whereas PLC number did not correlate with diameter (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>). This diameter–area relationship may reflect a functional adaptation of the portal venous system in metabolically active liver regions: larger-diameter portal veins accommodate higher blood flow and consequently experience greater shear stress on the vessel wall. The formation of PLC structures in the adventitial layer may participate in local blood flow regulation, maintenance of microenvironmental homeostasis, and vascular–stem cell interactions.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC) is not only a morphologically and spatially distinct, low-permeability vascular unit surrounding the portal vein, but also likely serves as a critical nexus connecting the portal vein, hepatic artery, and liver sinusoids. Thus, the PLC constitutes a key node within the interactive vascular network of the mouse liver.</p>

<p>To further investigate the potential relationship between the PLC and bile delivery regulation within the hepatic lobule, we employed a dual-channel vascular labeling strategy to simultaneously visualize the mouse liver portal vein and bile duct systems.</p>
<p>We combined MCNP-Pink labeling of the portal vein and its associated PLC structures with three-dimensional DAB immunohistochemical staining for CK19 to visualize the bile duct epithelial architecture. Extended depth-of-field three-dimensional bright-field imaging revealed a strict 1:1 anatomical association between the primary portal vein trunk (diameter 280 ± 32 μm) and the first-order bile duct (diameter 69 ± 8 μm) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and S3A).From multiview imaging showed that second- order bile ducts are distributed along the portal vein trunk and branch directionally toward the PLC. Their terminal portions, namely the canals of Hering, form the distal bile duct network responsible for bile collection, and are located at the interface between hepatic lobules, rather than being evenly distributed around the portal vein.</p>

<p>Instead, these terminal ducts are specifically concentrated within the PLC surrounding the portal vein, displaying marked spatial colocalization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This finding suggests a potential anatomical spatial association between the terminal canals of Hering and the periportal PLC structures. Furthermore, based on MCNP-Green labeling of the biliary tract, combined with 3D DAB-CK19 staining, both extended depth-of-field bright-field imaging and 3D confocal fluorescence imaging consistently confirmed that the terminal regions of the biliary network—responsible for collecting bile from the hepatic parenchyma—are primarily located adjacent to the PLC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3B</xref>).</p>
<p>To delineate the microscopic architecture underlying bile flow from the hepatic parenchyma into the bile duct network, we employed three-dimensional TSA-based multiplex immunofluorescence to simultaneously label the tight junction protein ZO1, the hepatocyte nuclear marker HNF4A, and the bile duct epithelial marker CK19 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Three-dimensional confocal imaging demonstrated that bile canaliculi on the hepatocyte surface formed polygonal networks demarcated by ZO1, while terminal bile duct epithelial cells also organized into luminal structures via ZO1, arranged in either single- or multicellular rings, thereby establishing an interface between the canalicular network and the bile duct system. However, detailed morphological analysis suggested that this connection does not occur directly between the bile canaliculi and the terminal bile duct epithelial cells. Instead, bile duct epithelial cells at the terminal ducts extended partially along the canalicular network without directly participating in the formation of the bile duct lumen. This finding indicates that these cells may remain in an immature state or possess alternative stem/progenitor cell-like properties <sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. To further verify the precise interface between the terminal bile ducts and the bile canalicular network, we performed retrograde perfusion of MCNP-Green dye through the common bile duct while progressively increasing the perfusion pressure. When the dye pressure exceeded a defined threshold, dye leakage was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>, and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3C</xref>). Dual-channel three-dimensional confocal imaging combined with CK19 immunostaining revealed that the sites of dye leakage did not coincide with the CK19-positive terminal bile duct epithelium, but instead were predominantly localized within regions adjacent to the PLC structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>, and S3C).This observation further supports our earlier hypothesis: first-order bile ducts distribute along the portal vein trunk, secondary bile ducts branch directionally toward the PLC regions, and terminal bile duct branches converge spatially adjacent to the PLC, where they collect bile drained from the hepatic lobules. These results suggest that the PLC may serve not only as a spatial positional cue guiding bile duct growth and branching but also as a regulatory node involved in coordinating bile drainage from the hepatic lobule into the biliary network.</p>

<p>The PLC structures are anatomically located within the transitional zone between portal vein ECs and periportal LSECs(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Most of the characteristic genes within this region exhibited a continuous gradient expression pattern, rather than displaying a distinct binary classification between portal vein ECs and Periportal LSECs. Based on this spatial continuum, we hypothesized that PLC endothelial cells might display a hybrid transcriptional signature, co-expressing marker genes derived from both adjacent endothelial populations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>).To test this, we performed Venn diagram intersection analysis combined with differential gene expression screening, identifying a set of candidate genes potentially specific to PLC endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Subsequent validation by CmTSA staining confirmed that CD31, a pan-endothelial marker, reliably delineated the spatial boundaries of portal vein ECs, PLC endothelium, and periportal LSECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Notably, among the intersection genes, CD34 and Sca-1 (Ly6a) were co-expressed exclusively within the PLC structures surrounding the portal vein, but absent from both central vein ECs and midzonal LSECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).Additionally, we examined the spatial distribution of other endothelial-associated markers in two-dimensional liver sections. CD36 was found to specifically label</p>
<p>Periportal LSECs, while PDGFRβ was broadly expressed across multiple intrahepatic endothelial subtypes(<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref>). Comparative analysis indicated that the combination of CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ expression served as a superior marker set for identifying PLC endothelial cells.Based on this, we sorted CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ endothelial populations from the total liver endothelial cell pool (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Projection mapping analysis demonstrated that CD34 and Sca-1 were primarily distributed within Portal vein ECs, Periportal LSECs, and Midzonal LSECs (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>). Notably, CD34 and Sca-1 are also classical markers of mesenchymal stem cells and intrahepatic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), indicating potential stem/progenitor-like properties of PLC-associated endothelial cells<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Further analysis revealed that the CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ endothelial cell population, which marks the PLC structures, exhibited significantly upregulated expression of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-associated genes. Notably, <italic>Mecom</italic> — a critical transcriptional regulator essential for HSC self-renewal and highly expressed in human and approximately 60% of murine long-term HSCs<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>— was prominently enriched within this population. In addition, <italic>PDGFRα</italic>, which together with Sca-1 serves as a classical marker for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) isolation and may label important mesenchymal progenitor cell populations known to promote hepatocyte differentiation via direct contact and growth factor secretion<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, was also highly expressed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis further demonstrated that differentially expressed genes in the CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ population were significantly enriched in pathways associated with HSC proliferation, lineage differentiation, mesenchymal cell development, and hepatic cell fate determination (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). These findings suggest that this unique endothelial subset possesses dual regulatory functions in both metabolic and hematopoietic modulation within the periportal region. Finally, three-dimensional structural reconstruction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>) revealed that the main trunk of the PLC is composed of CD34⁺Sca-1⁺CD31⁺ endothelial cells. In addition, a distinct “hematopoietic stem cell–vascular” niche unit formed by CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ double- positive cells was identified at the basal region of the PLC structure. This finding suggests that PLC endothelial cells not only regulate the periportal microcirculatory blood flow, but also establish a specialized microenvironment that supports periportal hematopoietic regulation, contributing to stem cell recruitment, vascular homeostasis, and tissue repair.</p>

<p>Gene Ontology enrichment analysis confirmed that differentially expressed genes in the CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ endothelium of PLC are enriched in pathways regulating epithelial morphogenesis and branching morphogenesis of epithelial tubes, suggesting multifunctional roles of PLC in bile duct branching and hepatic microenvironment homeostasis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>)</p>
<p>During liver fibrosis progression, proliferation and infiltration of terminal bile duct branches (Canals of Hering, CoH) into the hepatic parenchyma represent a core feature of the intrahepatic ductular reaction (DR), critically influencing disease progression, liver regeneration, and carcinogenesis<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. To investigate the potential regulatory role of the PLC structures in bile duct growth, we established a CCl₄-induced mouse model of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. The results showed:(1)Using MCNP-Pink to label the portal vein combined with three-dimensional DAB immunohistochemical staining for CK19 to visualize bile duct epithelial cells, extended depth-of-field brightfield imaging revealed that in control mice, bile duct termini localized adjacent to the portal vein, whereas after 3 or 6 weeks of CCl₄ treatment, bile duct termini significantly extended into the hepatic parenchyma by 100–300 μm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>), with a notable increase in bile duct branch area (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>). (2)Multiplex CmTSA 3D imaging demonstrated that under fibrotic conditions, PLC structures became elongated and extended toward the lobular parenchyma. Concurrently, the CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ endothelial cell population of PLC, showed a significant increase during liver fibrosis progression (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref>). (3)Further 3D staining confirmed that under fibrotic conditions, bile ducts progressively grew and branching along the expanded PLC structures and infiltrated deeper into the hepatic lobules, forming extensive terminal bile duct branches within the parenchyma. (4)With advancing fibrosis, the extension of CK19⁺ bile duct termini into the parenchyma was markedly greater after 6 weeks of CCl₄ treatment compared to 3 weeks, suggesting a coordinated expansion of bile duct branches alongside PLC structures that correlates with fibrosis severity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed significant upregulation of bile duct-related genes in the CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ endothelium of PLC in cirrhotic liver, with notably high expression of Lgals1 (Galectin-1) and HGF(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Previous studies have shown that Galectin-1 is absent in normal liver parenchyma but highly expressed in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), correlating with tumor dedifferentiation and invasion<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Additionally, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), particularly in combination with epidermal growth factor (EGF) in 3D cultures, promotes hepatic progenitor cells to form bile duct-polarized cystic structures<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Together, these findings suggest the PLC endothelium may act as a key regulator of bile duct branching and fibrotic microenvironment remodeling in liver cirrhosis.</p>
<p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that the PLC, situated between the portal vein and periportal sinusoidal endothelium, constitutes a critical vascular microenvironmental unit. It not only guides bile duct branching during development but also, through its basal CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ double-positive endothelial cells, orchestrates bile duct epithelial proliferation, branching morphogenesis, and bile acid transport homeostasis via multiple signaling pathways. Particularly during liver fibrosis progression, the PLC exhibits dynamic structural extension correlating with fibrosis severity, serving as a spatial scaffold facilitating terminal bile duct migration and expansion into the hepatic parenchyma (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). These findings highlight the PLC endothelial cell population and the vascular-bile duct interface as key regulatory hubs in bile duct regeneration, tissue repair, and pathological remodeling, providing novel cellular and molecular insights for understanding bile duct-related diseases such as ductular reaction, cholangiocarcinoma, and cholestatic disorders, and offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ Endothelium in the Periportal Lamellar Complex is a Potential Neurovascular Niche Regulating Hepatic Autonomic Nerve Patterning in Cirrhosis</title>
<p>The liver receives both afferent and efferent innervation from sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers. Although hepatic nerve distribution exhibits species- specific differences, In the human liver, nerve fibers are predominantly localized around the portal vein and central vein regions, and terminal nerve cells can also be observed within the interlobular septa and the connective tissue of the parenchyma.

Differential gene expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of multiple genes associated with neurogenesis and axon guidance within this population (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), including <italic>Nrg1</italic>—a key regulator of Schwann cell proliferation, myelination, and sheath formation—and <italic>ADGRG6</italic> (Gpr126), an essential factor for myelination in the mammalian peripheral nervous system, required for Schwann cell differentiation and peripheral nerve development in mice<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Subsequent GO enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in this cell cluster demonstrated significant activation of pathways related to neuronal projection and central nervous system differentiation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>Previous studies have confirmed that the highest density of hepatic parenchymal innervation originates from postganglionic sympathetic neurons located in the celiac ganglion<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry is the preferred method to visualize noradrenergic sympathetic innervation of hepatocytes and vasculature in both rodents and humans<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. In this study, confocal three-dimensional imaging revealed that TH⁺ sympathetic nerve fibers form a characteristic “neuronal bead-chain” network along the PLC structure, with nerve terminals terminating at the PLC base and around vascular bundles, suggesting a potential regulatory role of the PLC in controlling functional zones within the hepatic lobule (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6B</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6C</xref>).</p>
<p>Further validation using a CCl₄-induced mouse liver fibrosis model demonstrated that: (1) during fibrosis progression, sympathetic nerve fibers progressively extend along the PLC structure, accompanied by nerve terminal branching and infiltration into the hepatic parenchyma; (2) after 6 weeks of CCl₄ treatment, TH⁺ nerve fibers extended significantly farther into the hepatic parenchyma compared to 3 weeks, indicating a coordinated expansion trend of bile duct branches, PLC structures, and sympathetic nerve networks closely associated with fibrosis severity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomic volcano plot analysis revealed significant upregulation of neural-related genes within the CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ endothelium of PLC in the cirrhotic group, notably including <italic>EDNRB</italic> (Endothelin receptor type B), which plays a critical role in the development of neural crest-derived autonomic nervous system components, including the liver<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Nestin, a type VI intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, has recently been implicated in tissue homeostasis during wound healing. For example, in traumatic CNS injury, Nestin is induced in reactive astrocytes contributing to glial scar formation. Additionally,</p>
<p>Nestin expression correlates with the severity of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. In the healthy adult liver, Nestin is nearly absent but is upregulated following acute or chronic hepatic injury, indicating its potential role in liver regeneration(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>)<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. These findings suggest that this specific endothelial subpopulation of PLC may participate in neural branching development and fibrotic microenvironment remodeling, exhibiting multifunctional regulatory potential(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Accurate three-dimensional mapping of organs in both physiological and pathological states is essential for understanding their function and disease mechanisms. Compared to flow cytometry and conventional two-dimensional histology, building a comprehensive multi-channel 3D atlas of the liver helps compensate for spatial information loss—especially important for its complex and heterogeneous ductal-vascular systems. This study addresses two major technical bottlenecks in 3D imaging of the mouse liver. First, although various tissue-clearing techniques (e.g., SeeDB, iDISCO, CUBIC, Clarity, and PEGASOS) have been applied to whole-organ imaging<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, he liver’s high content of heme, lipids, and dense connective tissue renders it significantly less transparent than organs like the brain.</p>
<p>Second, current imaging platforms often face trade-offs between resolution and field of view. For example, CT and PCCT are limited to single-system visualization, while DUCT enables dual-system reconstruction but cannot resolve fine structures such as bile canaliculi due to its 5 μm/pixel resolution<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, we developed the Liver-CUBIC 3D visualization system. By optimizing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-based bleaching and urea concentration, we significantly improved hepatic tissue transparency (total clearing time: 3.25 days; light transmittance increased by 20.12%). In parallel, we introduced multicolor metal compound nanoparticles (MCNPs) with excellent photostability and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resistance to achieve four-channel segmentation and labeling of the portal vein, hepatic artery, central vein, and bile ducts. This system enables, for the first time, 3D visualization of microstructures such as terminal bile duct arborization, fine portal vein branching patterns, and fenestrations in central venous endothelium—providing a high-resolution, multidimensional platform for liver microcirculation studies.</p>
<p>The labeling strategy relies on perfusing contrast-complementary MCNPs into multiple vascular and ductal compartments. By carefully controlling injection site, pressure, and volume—combined with 15 μL microinjection needles and post-perfusion vessel ligation—we ensured even dye distribution and structural fidelity. High- density image data can be simplified using dual-channel overlays (e.g., portal vein and bile duct), and multiple imaging modalities (e.g., stereomicroscopy, confocal, or extended-depth microscopy) can be chosen depending on the desired resolution or field of view. Moreover, the dyes demonstrate robust fluorescence under laser-scanning microscopy, enabling clear 3D structural imaging.</p>
<p>Despite its strengths, the system remains sensitive to anatomical variation, such as liver lobe overlap and heterogeneous vascular architecture. Local perfusion may be inconsistent or excessively aggregated, especially at vascular intersections. Therefore, injection strategies and perfusion parameters must be adapted to liver size and vessel status to improve reproducibility and image quality.</p>
<p>Using this system, we identified a previously unrecognized structure located on the adventitia of the main portal vein, which we termed the <bold>Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC)</bold>. The PLC consists of multi-branched extensions radiating from the outer membrane of the main portal vein. Notably, it is absent in terminal vessels and other vascular systems, challenging the conventional “strict hierarchical bifurcation” model of vascular organization. The PLC is spatially associated with terminal branches of both bile ducts and hepatic arteries, suggesting possible roles in local microenvironmental regulation through physical or signaling interactions.</p>
<p>Multiplex immunostaining revealed that cholangiocytes extend along ZO-1⁺ bile canalicular networks but display an elongated, immature morphology without forming complete lumens (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). This observation aligns with previous findings that HNF4α⁺ hepatocytes and CK19⁺ cholangiocytes can jointly form bile-excreting conduits, supporting a guiding role for the PLC in bile duct positioning and morphogenesis<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Morphologically, the PLC shares features with previously described <bold>telocytes (TCs)</bold>—a recently identified class of interstitial cells in the liver observed via transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry as CD34⁺ cells with multiple long telopodes<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. However, functional and molecular characterization of TCs remains limited, and their direct relationship with the PLC is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed a CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ endothelial cell population enriched within the PLC that expressed hematopoiesis-related genes and stem cell regulatory pathways<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. This suggests that the PLC may not only provide structural support but also serve as a perivascular stem cell niche specific to the portal region, potentially involved in hematopoiesis and tissue regeneration. Supporting this, Sca-1 expression is localized to the portal region during mouse liver development <sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, and Nestin⁺NG2⁺ precursor cells in the fetal liver also concentrate near the portal vein, where they express key HSC-supportive factors such as SCF and CXCL12<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> — highlighting the PLC as a key component of the hepatic vascular-stem cell microenvironment.</p>
<p>Further analysis showed significant upregulation of genes involved in neurodevelopment and axonal guidance in the CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ cluster, along with activation of neuronal signaling pathways. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of TH⁺ sympathetic nerve fibers wrapping around the PLC in a “beads-on-a-string” pattern (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), consistent with a classic neurovascular unit<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Previous studies have shown that sympathetic nerves enter the liver along collagen fibers of Glisson’s capsule and interact with hepatic arteries, portal veins, and bile duct epithelium, supporting the PLC as a scaffold for intrahepatic neurovascular integration.</p>
<p>In CCl₄-induced hepatotoxic fibrosis models, injury and toxic metabolite accumulation are primarily restricted to the centrilobular region, while bile ducts extend linearly toward the central vein<sup>[</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. We observed dynamic elongation of the PLC in parallel with fibrosis progression, indicating its role as a spatial scaffold for ductal expansion. This suggests potential involvement in ductular reactions and neural remodeling during cirrhosis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides the first systematic characterization of the PLC as a structural and functional interface among hepatic vasculature, bile ducts, and nerves. The PLC serves as a directional scaffold for ductal growth, a specialized stem cell niche, and a potential site of neurovascular coupling. These findings provide novel insights into hepatic homeostasis, bile duct development, and fibrotic remodeling, and suggest that the PLC and its CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ endothelial population may represent promising therapeutic targets for diseases such as cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing cholangitis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Chengjian Zhao et al. focused on the interactions between vascular, biliary, and neural networks in the liver microenvironment, addressing the critical bottleneck that the lack of high-resolution 3D visualization has hindered understanding of these interactions in liver disease.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study developed a high-resolution multiplex 3D imaging method that integrates multicolor metallic compound nanoparticle (MCNP) perfusion with optimized CUBIC tissue clearing. This method enables the simultaneous 3D visualization of spatial networks of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile ducts, and central vein in the mouse liver. The authors reported a perivascular structure termed the Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC), which is identified along the portal vein axis. This study clarifies that the PLC comprises CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ dual-positive endothelial cells with a distinct gene expression profile, and reveals its colocalization with terminal bile duct branches and sympathetic nerve fibers under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This manuscript is well-written, organized, and informative. However, there are some points that need to be clarified.</p>
<p>(1) After MCNP-dye injection, does it remain in the blood vessels, adsorb onto the cell surface, or permeate into the cells? Does the MCNP-dye have cell selectivity?</p>
<p>(2) All MCNP-dyes were injected after the mice were sacrificed, and the mice's livers were fixed with PFA. After the blood flow had ceased, how did the authors ensure that the MCNP-dyes were fully and uniformly perfused into the microcirculation of the liver?</p>
<p>(3) It is advisable to present additional 3D perspective views in the article, as the current images exhibit very weak 3D effects. Furthermore, it would be better to supplement with some videos to demonstrate the 3D effects of the stained blood vessels.</p>
<p>(4) In Figure 1-I, the authors used MCNP-Black to stain the central veins; however, in addition to black, there are also yellow and red stains in the image. The authors need to explain what these stains are in the legend.</p>
<p>(5) There is a typo in the title of Figure 4F; it should be &quot;stem cell&quot;.</p>
<p>(6) Nuclear staining is necessary in immunofluorescence staining, especially for Figure 5e. This will help readers distinguish whether the green color in the image corresponds to cells or dye deposits.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present manuscript of Xu et al. reports a novel clearing and imaging method focusing on the liver. The authors simultaneously visualized the portal vein, hepatic artery, central vein, and bile duct systems by injecting metal compound nanoparticles (MCNPs) with different colors into the portal vein, heart left ventricle, inferior vena cava, and the extrahepatic bile duct, respectively. The method involves: trans-cardiac perfusion with 4% PFA, the injection of MCNPs with different colors, clearing with the modified CUBIC method, cutting 200 micrometer thick slices by vibratome, and then microscopic imaging. The authors also perform various immunostaining (DAB or TSA signal amplification methods) on the tissue slices from MCNP-perfused tissue blocks. With the application of this methodical approach, the authors report dense and very fine vascular branches along the portal vein. The authors name them as 'periportal lamellar complex (PLC)' and report that PLC fine branches are directly connected to the sinusoids. The authors also claim that these structures co-localize with terminal bile duct branches and sympathetic nerve fibers, and contain endothelial cells with a distinct gene expression profile. Finally, the authors claim that PLC-s proliferate in liver fibrosis (CCl4 model) and act as a scaffold for proliferating bile ducts in ductular reaction and for ectopic parenchymal sympathetic nerve sprouting.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The simultaneous visualization of different hepatic vascular compartments and their combination with immunostaining is a potentially interesting novel methodological approach.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This reviewer has several concerns about the validity of the microscopic/morphological findings as well as the transcriptomics results. In this reviewer's opinion, the introduction contains overstatements regarding the potential of the method, there are severe caveats in the method descriptions, and several parts of the Results are not fully supported by the documentation. Thus, the conclusions of the paper may be critically viewed in their present form and may need reconsideration by the authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the reviewed manuscript, researchers aimed to overcome the obstacles of high-resolution imaging of intact liver tissue. They report successful modification of the existing CUBIC protocol into Liver-CUBIC, a high-resolution multiplex 3D imaging method that integrates multicolor metallic compound nanoparticle (MCNP) perfusion with optimized liver tissue clearing, significantly reducing clearing time and enabling simultaneous 3D visualization of the portal vein, hepatic artery, bile ducts, and central vein spatial networks in the mouse liver. Using this novel platform, the researchers describe a previously unrecognized perivascular structure they termed Periportal Lamellar Complex (PLC), regularly distributed along the portal vein axis. The PLC originates from the portal vein and is characterized by a unique population of CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ dual-positive endothelial cells. Using available scRNAseq data, the authors assessed the CD34⁺Sca-1⁺ cells' expression profile, highlighting the mRNA presence of genes linked to neurodevelopment, biliary function, and hematopoietic niche potential. Different aspects of this analysis were then addressed by protein staining of selected marker proteins in the mouse liver tissue. Next, the authors addressed how the PLC and biliary system react to CCL4-induced liver fibrosis, implying PLC dynamically extends, acting as a scaffold that guides the migration and expansion of terminal bile ducts and sympathetic nerve fibers into the hepatic parenchyma upon injury.</p>
<p>The work clearly demonstrates the usefulness of the Liver-CUBIC technique and the improvement of both resolution and complexity of the information, gained by simultaneous visualization of multiple vascular and biliary systems of the liver at the same time. The identification of PLC and the interpretation of its function represent an intriguing set of observations that will surely attract the attention of liver biologists as well as hepatologists; however, some claims need more thorough assessment by functional experimental approaches to decipher the functional molecules and the sequence of events before establishing the PLC as the key hub governing the activity of biliary, arterial, and neuronal liver systems. Similarly, the level of detail of the methods section does not appear to be sufficient to exactly recapitulate the performed experiments, which is of concern, given that the new technique is a cornerstone of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the work does bring a clear new insight into the liver structure and functional units and greatly improves the methodological toolbox to study it even further, and thus fully deserves the attention of readers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors clearly demonstrate an improved technique tailored to the visualization of the liver vasulo-biliary architecture in unprecedented resolution.</p>
<p>This work proposes a new biological framework between the portal vein, hepatic arteries, biliary tree, and intrahepatic innervation, centered at previously underappreciated protrusions of the portal veins - the Periportal Lamellar Complexes (PLCs).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Possible overinterpretation of the CD34+Sca1+ findings was built on re-analysis of one scRNAseq dataset.</p>
<p>Lack of detail in the materials and methods section greatly limits the usefulness of the new technique to other researchers.</p>
