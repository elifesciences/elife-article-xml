<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Imidacloprid is a global health threat that severely poisons the economically and ecologically important honeybee pollinators, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>. However, its effects on developing bee larvae remain largely unknown. Our pilot study found that imidacloprid causes developmental delay in bee larvae, but its toxicological mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this study, we exposed bee larvae to imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.7, 1.2, 3.1, and 377 ppb. A significant dose-dependent delay in the larval development was observed, including reductions in body mass, width, and growth index; however, imidacloprid did not affect larval survival and food consumption. Predominant toxicological effects induced by high concentrations of imidacloprid (377 ppb) included disruption of neural transmission, induction of oxidative stress and gut structural damage and apoptosis, inhibition of developmental regulatory hormones and genes, disruption of proteolysis, amino acid transport, protein synthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis energy production. In parallel, we observed that the larvae employed antioxidant defense and P450 detoxification mechanisms to counteract imidacloprid. Ultimately, this study provides the first evidence that environmental exposure to imidacloprid can retard bee larval growth and development by disrupting molting regulation and limiting the metabolism and utilization of dietary nutrients and energy. These findings have broader reference implications for studies assessing pesticide hazards to other juvenile animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hazardous pesticides are extensively used worldwide to safeguard crop production, particularly in developing countries that depend on agriculture. However, exposure to these chemicals has become a global health concern. Imidacloprid, introduced in 1991, is known for its high animal toxicity and has received international attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jeschke et al., 2011</xref>). The World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have listed it as an acute oral and dermal toxicant for animals. Overuse of imidacloprid can lead to environmental contamination, endangering human and animal health through food chains, poisoning non-target pollinators, and disrupting ecological balances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tudi et al., 2021</xref>). Adults exposed to high doses of imidacloprid experience dizziness, apathy, movement disorders, labored breathing, and temporary growth retardation. Imidacloprid also causes adverse congenital, hematological, hepatic, and renal effects, along with degenerative changes in various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Khan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Shaw et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). In rats and rabbits, imidacloprid causes severe liver, thyroid, and body weight problems, reproductive toxicity, developmental retardation, and neurobehavioral deficits, even at low doses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anatra-Cordone M, 2005</xref>). Imidacloprid also affects the singing ability of birds, making it difficult for them to attract mates and reproduce. Imidacloprid represents a significant contributing factor to the decline in the number of terrestrial insects since 1925, which has declined by an average of 9% per decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cardoso et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">SÃ¡nchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The development and health status of juvenile animals play a critical role in population structure and future growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gill et al., 2012</xref>), but they are more susceptible to the toxic effects of pesticides than adults. However, there is a paucity of information on the assessment of toxic effects of imidacloprid on juvenile animals. Available reports primarily describe the epistatic traits influenced by toxicity, with limited investigation into the biochemical mechanisms involved. Studies have shown that imidacloprid poses a potential health risk to children through dietary exposure (Anderson and Harmon Threatt, 2021) and can lead to developmental abnormalities in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Samojeden et al., 2022</xref>) and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Islam et al., 2019</xref>) as well as negative effects on insect pupal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jia and Li, 2023</xref>). In insects, the honeybees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic> L.) are valuable model organisms with significant economic and ecological importance as pollinators of crops and maintenance of ecological balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zheng and Fu-Liang, 2009</xref>). However, the widespread use of pesticides, including imidacloprid, has resulted in colony collapse disorder (CCD), causing serious impacts on beekeeping industry and ecological balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">MahÃ© et al., 2021</xref>). Studies have shown that Imidacloprid is applied as seed coating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Simon-Delso et al., 2015</xref>) and accumulate in the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dively and Kamel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rocha et al., 2022</xref>), exposing non-target bees to imidacloprid residues during pollen and nectar collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tong et al., 2018</xref>). Even low levels of systemic imidacloprid cause sublethal effects in adult bees, including neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Belzunces et al., 2012</xref>), behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Karahan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Medrzycki et al., 2003</xref>), reproductive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chaimanee et al., 2016</xref>), immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pettis et al., 2013</xref>), apoptosis and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Carneiro et al., 2022</xref>), and shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson and Harmon-Threatt, 2021</xref>). Larvae is the future of colony growth and development, yet the broader toxic effects of imidacloprid on larvae remain unknown. Limited reports suggest that developing bee larvae are exposed to imidacloprid through contact with contaminated hives or ingesting contaminated food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhme et al., 2018</xref>), leading to delayed development, reduced rates of capping, pupation, and eclosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), and impaired olfactory learning behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Peng and Yang, 2016</xref>). In the pilot study, we found that imidacloprid exposure caused obvious developmental delay in bee larvae, but the molecular and biochemistry mechanisms remain to systematically investigated. To this end, this study comprehensively evaluated the toxicity of imidacloprid on honey bee larvae at multiple levels including histology, neurotoxicity, molting regulation, oxidative stress, detoxification, nutrition, and energy metabolism, and provides first-hand evidence for imidacloprid causing developmental delay in bee larvae. Because the mechanisms involved are relatively conserved in animals, our findings have broader implications for understanding and assessing the potential risk of continuous exposure to imidacloprid during animal development.</p>

<title>Imidacloprid causes bee larval developmental retardation</title>
<p>During the 96-hour observation period, larval survival in the four imidacloprid-exposed groups was not significantly different from that in the control group. However, with increasing exposure concentration and duration, larval developmental progress, weight and width were significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Further analysis focused on the most adverse exposure level of 377 ppb, which did not affect survival, feeding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, and 1G), and the time taken for larvae to successfully enter the pupal stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), but resulted in slow developmental obstacles and lower initial rate of successful pupation and growth index. In addition, imidacloprid also caused consistently lower weight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>) and width (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>) of larvae up to the pupal stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>RT-qPCR analysis revealed that imidacloprid exposure reduced the expression of critical genes involved in energy metabolism, including cytochrome c oxidase copper chaperone (<italic>COX17</italic>) and NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1Î² subcomplex subunit 7 (<italic>NDUFB7</italic>), in developmentally delayed larvae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Imidacloprid exposure also inhibited the expression of genes related to glycolysis and energy production, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>Gapdh</italic>) and glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase (<italic>Oscillin</italic>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). In addition, the expression of transcription initiation factors related to protein synthesis, including translation initiation factor 3 subunit M (<italic>Tango7</italic>), translation initiation factor 3 subunit B (<italic>elF3-S9</italic>), and translation initiation factor 3 subunit A (<italic>elF3-S10</italic>), was significantly suppressed by imidacloprid toxicity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Finally, the total levels of ATP, glycogen and protein, which are closely related to energy production and reserves, were significantly lower in developmentally delayed larvae than in controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref>).</p>

<title>Correlation between developmental phenotypic changes and molecular features caused by imidacloprid toxicity</title>
<p>To better understand the mechanism of imidacloprid-induced larval developmental retardation, we performed a comprehensive correlation analysis between epigenetic growth traits and molecular characteristics (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The results showed that in larvae with imidacloprid-induced developmental retardation, body weight, width, growth index, and developmental rate were positively correlated with energy metabolism and reserves, nutrient catabolism, protein synthesis, and developmental regulation. Conversely, negative correlations were observed between these growth traits and parameters associated with detoxification and antioxidant defense processes that require additional energy expenditure. Moreover, oxidative stress and damage, detoxification, and antioxidant defense all exhibited significant positive correlations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Toxic effects and the molecular basis of environmental concentrations of imidacloprid on bee larvae</title>
<p>Previous research has shown that bee larvae are more susceptible to the adverse effects of pesticides than adult bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">TomÃ© et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, larvae were exposed to environmental concentrations of imidacloprid, resulting in sublethal effects such as decreased body weight, width, developmental rate, and growth index (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Our results support the notion that pesticides can affect larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). However, current research has primarily focused on characterizing the effects of imidacloprid on larval phenotype and behavior, and the molecular mechanisms underlying its ecotoxicological effects remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>To obtain molecular evidence of imidacloprid toxicity to bee larvae, we first examined the expression of acetylcholine receptors and AChE activity. The results showed that imidacloprid exposure increased the expression of the <italic>Alph2</italic> gene and inhibited AChE activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Normally, acetylcholine stimulates nerve impulses by binding to the Alph receptor, and AChE degrades acetylcholine to terminate nerve conduction. However, imidacloprid competitively binds to AChE receptors, inhibits AChE activity, and causes continuous excitation of nerve conduction, ultimately leading to paralysis and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">KatiÄ et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shan et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that imidacloprid is neurotoxic to bee larvae.</p>
<p>The growth and development of juvenile animals depends on the digestion, absorption and utilization of food nutrients. Therefore, we next investigated whether imidacloprid affects the digestion and utilization of dietary by larvae. The results indicate that exposure to imidacloprid suppressed the hydrolysis genes <italic>CPs</italic> and <italic>APs</italic> and the amino acid transport pathway genes <italic>Aats-Gly</italic> and <italic>Aats-Tyr</italic> in larvae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Since these genes are responsible for cleaving dietary proteins into absorbable peptides and amino acids and transporting them for metabolism (2019), inhibiting the expression of these genes would severely affect larval digestion, resulting in protein deficiency and impaired metabolic activity. In addition, imidacloprid also affected the expression of <italic>Î±-Am</italic> and <italic>Î±-Glu</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), which are involved in carbohydrate digestion, indicating that imidacloprid also affects the digestion of dietary carbohydrates. Indeed, histological observations also confirmed that a large amount of undigested food remained in the intestine of larvae exposed to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In conclusion, imidacloprid inhibits the digestion and utilization of dietary proteins and carbohydrates by larvae, which is extremely detrimental to their growth and development.</p>
<p>In addition to nutrition, energy metabolism is critical for the maintenance of all life activities. In this study, imidacloprid exposure inhibited the expression of genes related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (<italic>COX17</italic>, <italic>NDUFB7</italic>) and its alternative glycolytic pathway (<italic>Gapdh</italic>, <italic>Oscillin</italic>). Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is the central pathway for ATP generation during energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Tian et al., 2020a</xref>), while glycolysis is an alternative mechanism for ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Since both biochemical processes are essential for energy production, their inhibition resulted in reduced ATP levels in bee larvae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). These results strongly suggest that imidacloprid induces mitochondrial dysfunction leading to insufficient energy production in larvae. Since larval energy production is insufficient, this is likely to lead to a depletion of energy reserves. Indeed, further analysis revealed a significant decrease in glycogen and protein energy reserves in larvae exposed to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref>). These findings are consistent with previous reports that exposure to pesticides such as endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, insecticides, and fipronil can lead to a reduction in energy reserves in organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bouayad et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Dutra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Radwan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rambabu and Rao, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ribeiro et al., 2001</xref>). In conclusion, our results suggest that imidacloprid induces mitochondrial dysfunction and affects energy production and reserves in bee larvae.</p>
<p>Insects rely primarily on cytochrome P450 detoxification to resist toxic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Li et al., 2007</xref>), and the level of CYP450 expression indicates the severity of pesticide toxicity. While adult worker bees have shown a positive response to imidacloprid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mao et al., 2009</xref>), it is uncertain whether bee larvae can respond to pesticide toxicity. In this study, we found that seven cytochrome P450 family transcripts, including CYPq1, CYPq2, CYP450, CYP6AS14, CYP4G11, and CYP306A1, were significantly upregulated in bee larvae, with CYP9q1 being 94-fold higher than the control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These results are consistent with previous findings that the CYP450 family genes CYP6AS3, CYP6AS4, and CYP9S1 were significantly upregulated in adult worker bees exposed to quercetin, coumaphos, and fluvalinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mao et al., 2011</xref>) and that CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, and CYP9Q3 help bees detoxify fluvalinate and coumaphos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gregorc et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that the P450 detoxification system is already established in bee larvae and they respond positively by activating the detoxification function of CYP450 upon exposure to imidacloprid.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress is the excessive production of ROS in aerobic organisms (Felton, 1995; Ozcan and Ogun, 2015). Pesticides, including coumaphos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gregorc et al., 2018</xref>), fipronil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Paris et al., 2017</xref>), paraquat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li-Byarlay et al., 2016</xref>), organophosphorus, pyrethroid, organochlorinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chakrabarti et al., 2015</xref>), and chlorpyrifos (Shafiq-ur-Rehman et al., 2012), have been shown to cause oxidative stress in bees. In this study, exposure to imidacloprid resulted in increased levels of ROS and MDA in larvae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), indicating severe oxidative stress and lipid damage. Organisms have evolved antioxidant defense mechanisms to scavenge excessive ROS and resist oxidative stress, including increasing levels of antioxidants such as CAT, SOD, GSH, TrxR, and GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Tian et al., 2020b</xref>). In this regard, we have recently confirmed this in worker bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li et al., 2022</xref>), which is also well reflected in the present study. We observed a significant increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT, gene expression of Trx and Gpx, and GSH levels in larvae after exposure to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). These results show that the antioxidant system in developing larvae is established and used to resist oxidative stress caused by imidacloprid, similar to that in adult worker bees. Notably, compared to our recent study in adult bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li et al., 2022</xref>), the larvae in this study exhibited more robust antioxidant activity when exposed to higher concentrations of imidacloprid toxicity than worker bees. However, the underlying mechanism requires further investigation. The underlying mechanisms involved require further study.</p>
<p>Notably, in addition to routine antioxidants, imidacloprid induces a 7-fold increase in Vg expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Vg is known to provide nutrition to developing embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jorgensen et al., 2009</xref>) and to help animals cope with pollution-induced stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Matozzo et al., 2008</xref>). In bees, Vg plays an important antioxidant role by protecting other hemolymph molecules from ROS and increasing cellular oxidative stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Corona et al., 2007</xref>). Previous studies have shown a correlation between high Vg expression in adult worker bees and resistance to oxidative stress resulting from exposure to the pesticide paraquat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seehuus et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, our results support this observation and suggest that larvae may also resist oxidative stress caused by imidacloprid through increased Vg production.</p>

<title>Mechanisms of imidacloprid-induced developmental retardation in bee larvae</title>
<p>Impaired juvenile development can have a significant impact on the growth and sustainability of entire populations. Deviations in juvenile development due to environmental stress have recently received considerable attention. Drosophila melanogaster exposed to heat stress exhibit developmental delays due to the failure of early embryos to fully inhibit the synthesis of non-heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bergh and Arking, 1984</xref>). Similarly, exposure to nutrient and heavy metal stress can cause delayed or arrested development in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> due to altered gene expression and disruption of developmental signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Carranza-GarcÃ­a and Navarro, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rashid et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we also observed typical developmental delays in honeybee larvae exposed to imidacloprid, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.</p>
<p>Insect development is regulated by the hormones JH and 20E, which control morphological remodeling events during molting. 20E promotes pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>), while JH maintains juvenile characteristics and prevents metamorphosis by antagonizing the effects of 20E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Luo et al., 2021</xref>). To elucidate the mechanism underlying imidacloprid-induced larval developmental delay, we first focused on the hormonal regulation of molting development and found that imidacloprid inhibits the expression of JHAMT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), a positive regulator of JH synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), but did not affect JH titer levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). This suggests that the antagonistic effect of JH still restricts the developmental process, thereby maintaining larval morphology. In parallel, imidacloprid toxicity also resulted in reduced ecdysteroid 20E titer and Br-c expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The role of 20E is to induce larval molting and pupation by triggering downstream response factors, such as Br-c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Deng et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that larval developmental delay may be caused by imidacloprid reducing 20E titer and inhibiting <italic>Br-c</italic> expression, thereby blocking molting. Notably, we also observed that a decrease in 20E levels was accompanied by a decrease in AChE activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), which is known to cause delayed pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">He et al., 2012</xref>) and developmental arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Desneux et al., 2007</xref>) in insect larvae. Therefore, our results suggest that imidacloprid neurotoxicity may cause developmental delay in bee larvae by inhibiting the molting hormone 20E. This conclusion is supported by a correlation analysis showing that decreases in 20E titer, <italic>Br-c</italic> expression and AChE activity were positively correlated with decreased developmental rates and growth index, weight and width growth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In conclusion, imidacloprid neurotoxicity inhibits the 20E and <italic>Br-c</italic> genes, thereby blocking molting, which may be an important cause of delayed larval development in honey bees.</p>
<p>Animals employ selective foraging as a survival strategy to avoid ingesting toxic foods that may cause adverse physiological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berenbaum and Johnson, 2015</xref>). Although bees cannot actively reject toxins innately, postingestive malaise allows them to learn to avoid ingesting toxic-containing foods with adverse physiological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hurst et al., 2014</xref>). Given this, we speculate that it is likely that the honey bee larvae in this study reduced their intake of toxic imidacloprid-containing foods, making it difficult to meet their nutritional and energy needs, which may have resulted in delayed development. However, monitoring of daily food intake did not show a significant difference between larvae exposed to imidacloprid and the control group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>), indicating that larval food intake was not reduced and larvae did not initiate avoidance behavior toward toxic food. Therefore, food intake was not a critical factor in the delayed larval development caused by imidacloprid.</p>
<p>Nutrition and energy are critical for the growth and development of juvenile animals. Exposure to heavy metals and neonicotinoid pesticides has been shown to affect digestion, energy reserves, production, and utilization in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Given this, since the lack of the necessary correlation between delayed larval development and food intake in this study prompts us to consider potential problems in larval food and energy utilization that led to delayed development. Consequently, our focus shifted to the investigation of larval nutrition and energy metabolism. Interestingly, we found severe pathological changes in the gut tissues of developmentally delayed larvae exposed to imidacloprid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Imidacloprid caused a significant reduction in the tightness of the cell arrangement in the basal layer of the gut, and a drastic decrease in the number of cells. The peritrophic membrane was incompletely formed, and undigested food residues were present in the gut. qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant decrease in larval digestion and catabolism of dietary proteins and carbohydrates, amino acid transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). Biochemical assays showed that imidacloprid stress also decreased ATP levels and total glycogen and protein content, resulting in a lack of energy reserves and increased energy expenditure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref>). Correlation analysis indicated a positive relationship between impaired catabolism and dietary nutrient utilization caused by imidacloprid and larval developmental delay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). These evidence strongly suggest that imidacloprid exposure affects the digestion and utilization of nutrients and energy in larvae, resulting in insufficient nutrients and energy for growth and development, which may be another important factor contributing to imidacloprid-induced larval developmental delay.</p>
<p>The Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory suggests that environmental stress can significantly affect the energy balance of organisms, leading to increased energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kooijman, 2009</xref>). To cope with stress, animals may deplete their energy reserves, such as glycogen and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bouayad et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Matsukura et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we found that larvae with delayed development caused by imidacloprid had lower energy reserves (ATP, total protein, and total glycogen), and these energy reserves were negatively correlated with larval antioxidant and detoxification (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), suggesting that the reduction in energy reserves caused by imidacloprid is related to the energy-consuming activities of CYP450 detoxification and antioxidant defense. To meet the high energy cost demands of environmental stress, animals often have to allocate most of their food intake to defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Guedes et al., 2006</xref>), and this redistribution of energy resources will inevitably lead to an insufficient energy supply for growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beyers et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, the P450 detoxification and antioxidant defense used by the larvae in this study to resist imidacloprid toxicity will inevitably force them to consume more food resources that should have been used for growth and development, resulting in a severe lack of energy needed for development. This may also be another important reason why imidacloprid causes delayed development in bee larvae.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Imidacloprid toxicity caused growth and developmental delay in A. mellifera larvae. The toxic mechanism may include imidacloprid disrupting the regulatory balance of molt development, resulting in restricted development. In addition, the gut damage caused by imidacloprid restricts the metabolism and utilization of food nutrients and energy in the larvae. Third, the additional energy consumed by larval P450 detoxification and antioxidant defenses further reduces the supply of nutrients and energy for growth and development (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This study is the first multi-level investigation of the toxic effects of imidacloprid on A. mellifera larvae. These findings have broader implications for understanding and assessing the threat of harmful pesticides to animal larvae.</p>

<p>The Animal Bioethics Committee at Chongqing Normal University, China approved all experimental protocols. The chosen colonies were healthy and not exposed to pathogens or pesticides. Two-day-old larvae were individually transferred to sterile 24-well cell culture plates filled with a standard diet consisting of royal jelly, glucose, fructose, water, and yeast extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aupinel et al., 2005</xref>). The larvae were cultured in dark conditions at 35Â°C and 96% RH, with daily feeding volumes adjusted according to their age (20 Î¼L for three-day-old larvae, 30 Î¼L for four-day-old larvae, 40 Î¼L for five-day-old larvae, and 50 Î¼L for six-day-old larvae).

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>This study employed four different concentrations of imidacloprid, which were residual concentrations found in honey (0.7 ppb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chauzat et al., 2009</xref>), bees (1.2 ppb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chauzat et al., 2011</xref>), pollen (3.1 ppb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mullin et al., 2010</xref>), and beeswax (377 ppb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kapoor et al., 2014</xref>). The experiment was conducted with three treatment groups: control group (CK), solvent control group (CKac), and imidacloprid-treated group (IMI), each with three replicates. Each replicate contained 32 bees that were distributed in standard 24-well cell culture plates (1 bee/well). The CK group consisted of larval bees fed acetone-royal jelly glucose-fructose-yeast extract-distilled water (0.00377%-50%-6%-6%-1%-36.99623%, v/w/w/w/w/v). The IMI group consisted of larvae-fed control solution containing imidacloprid (99% active ingredient, Hubei Norna Technology Co. Ltd, Hubei, China) at 0.7 ppb, 1.2 ppb, 3.1 ppb, and 377 ppb. The CKac group served as a solvent control and contained only acetone at a concentration of 0.00377%. A total of 312 larvae were used for survival statistics (96 bees), body weight and width (96 bees), and gene expression, enzyme activity, histochemical content, and histopathologic analysis. Food was administered daily according to age (20 Î¼L for three-day-old larvae, 30 Î¼L for four-day-old larvae, 40 Î¼L for five-day-old larvae, and 50 Î¼L for six-day-old larvae). Dead individuals and food remain were recorded daily, and incubation conditions were 35Â°C and 96% RH. Surviving larvae were collected 72 h after consumption of the test solution and stored at â80Â°C for further analysis, including evaluations of gene expression, enzyme activity, and chemical content evaluations. Furthermore, HE-stained sections were used to evaluate any imidacloprid-induced tissue damage and apoptosis.</p>

<title>Developmental phenotypic traits</title>
<p>Larval individuals were randomly selected daily from the CK and IMI groups to measure body weight and width. Food residues, larval mortality, developmental progression, and the amount of time spent in the larval developmental stage (from the first imidacloprid exposure to before pupa) were recorded daily to calculate food consumption, survival rates, developmental rates, and development times. The growth index (GI) was calculated for larvae exposed to imidacloprid from the three-day-old to the six-day-old using the equations described by Zhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhang et al., 1993</xref>).

<title>RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time quantitative PCR analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from larvae using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNAex Pro Reagent (Accurate Biology, China) as instructed by the manufacturer. The RNA quality was evaluated by gel electrophoresis and absorbance determination using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, New York, USA). Genomic DNA was removed, and cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit (Evo M-MLV RT Mix Kit with gDNA Clean for qPCR, Accurate Biology, China) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Briefly, 1 Î¼g of RNA reacted with the 5X gDNA Clean Reaction Mix provided in the kit at 42Â°C for 5 min to remove residual genomic DNA to ensure the accuracy of the quantitative results. After the reaction, 4 Î¼L of 5X Evo M-MLV RT Reaction Mix and 4 Î¼L of RNase-free water were added to the reaction tube for 20 Î¼L. The mixture was incubated at 37Â°C for 15 min and 85Â°C for 5 sec to generate cDNA. Then, quantitative RTâPCR was performed with a Bio-Rad CFX96â¢ Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to standard protocols and cycling conditions. RP49 (ribosomal protein 49, Accession no. AF441189) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lourenco et al., 2008</xref>) was used as the endogenous control. The primers for target genes and RP49 are listed in Table S1. qPCR system (20 ÂµL): EvaGreen Express 2X qPCR MasterMix (10 ÂµL), each forward and reverse primer (0.4 ÂµL, 0.2 Âµmol/L), cDNA (1 ÂµL, 100 ng/ÂµL), ddH<sub>2</sub>O (8.2 ÂµL). The thermal cycling program was as follows: 95Â°C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 95Â°C for 5 s and 60Â°C for 30 s. The qPCR products were sequenced by Shanghai Biological Engineering Technology Services Co., Ltd. to confirm whether the amplified fragments were the target sequences.

Each well was washed five times with 400 Î¼L of PBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20, pat dried, and left to stand at room temperature for 5 min. TMB chromogen solution A (50 Î¼L) and solution B (50 Î¼L) were added to each well, gently mixed, and incubated at 37Â°C for 15 min in the dark. Then, 50 Î¼L of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (4 mol/L) was added to each well to terminate the reaction. Finally, the OD value was measured at 450 nm with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, New York, USA), and the content of the detected substance was calculated from a calibration curve constructed by reference standards.</p>
<p>To prepare samples for analysis of protein carbonylation (PCO), acetylcholinesterase (AchE), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH), larvae was weighed and homogenized on ice in 5 volumes (M: V) of PBS buffer, then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min to collect the supernatant. Subsequently, PCO content was measured using the 2,4-dinitrophenyl-hydrazine (DNPH) method with slight modifications. The above-prepared supernatant was mixed with streptomycin sulfate at a 9:1 volume (V: M), kept at room temperature for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min. Then, 80 Î¼L of supernatant was mixed with 160 Î¼L of 10LrmM DNPH in 2LrM HCl and reacted at 37Â°C for 30 min. Sample controls were also prepared by adding an equal volume (500LrÎ¼L) of 2LrM HCl. Then, 200 Î¼L of 20% TCA was added, mixed thoroughly, and centrifuged at 4Â°C for 10 min at 12,000 x g, and the precipitate was collected. Add 400 Î¼L of ethanol: ethyl acetate mixture (1:1), vortex and mix, centrifuge at 4Â°C 12,000 x g for 10 min, and collect the precipitate to remove unbound DNPH. This DNPH removal step was repeated once. The pellet was mixed with 400LrÎ¼L of 6LrM guanidine hydrochloride, kept at room temperature for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 4Â°C 12,000 x g for 10 min to collect the supernatant. The carbonyl and protein contents were determined by reading the absorbance at Î»Lr=Lr370Lrnm and 280 nm with a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, California, USA) for each sample against an appropriate blank. Finally, the carbonyl content per unit of protein was calculated based on the protein content.</p>
<p>AChE activity was measured by the Ellman method as described by Orhan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Orhan et al., 2007</xref>) with slight modifications. Briefly, 20 Î¼L of the prepared sample supernatant was mixed with 160 ÂµL of 0.1 mM PBS buffer (pH 8.0) and 10 ÂµL of an AChE (0.28 U mL) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then, 10 ÂµL of ATChI (acetylthiocholine iodide, 4 mg mL) was added together with 20 ÂµL of DTNB (5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid, 1.2 mg mL) and immediately mixed, and the absorbance was read at 412 nm. The results were expressed as activity percentages relative to the sample solvent negative control.</p>
<p>The CAT activity was determined using a kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturerâs instructions with slight modifications. Briefly, 10 Î¼L of the prepared sample supernatant was mixed with 30 Î¼L of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mmol L), 10 ÂµL of 250 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added, and the mixture was immediately mixed and kept at 25Â°C for 5 min. Then, 450 Î¼L of 1.8 mol L-1 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was added, and the mixture was vortexed to terminate the reaction. Subsequently, 10 ÂµL of this termination reaction solution was mixed with 40 ÂµL of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mmol L). Then, 10 ÂµL of this mixture was added to a 96-well plate mixed with 200 ÂµL of color development working solution containing peroxidase and incubated for 15 min at 25Â°C. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 520 nm, and the CAT activity was calculated using a calibration curve of 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>T-AOC was measured using the total antioxidant capacity assay kit with the ABTS (2,2â-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) method based on a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Add 10 Î¼L of the prepared sample supernatant to 200 Î¼L of ABTS working solution. After 6 min of reaction, the absorbance was measured at 734 nm. Finally, the antioxidant activity was displayed by Trolox equivalents antioxidant capacity as mmol Trolox equivalents/g extract. The ABTS working solution was prepared as follows: 400 Î¼L of potassium persulfate was added to 400 Î¼L of ABTS to generate an ABTS stock solution, which was then incubated for 16 h at room temperature in the dark. Before use, the stock solution was diluted with phosphate buffer, and the absorbance at 734 nm was adjusted to 0.70 Â± 0.05.</p>
<p>Additionally, MDA, SOD, and GSH levels were detected using ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) according to our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Histopathological analysis</title>
<p>Microsectioning and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was performed according to standard histological protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Khan et al., 2010</xref>) with some modifications. Briefly, entire fresh larvae were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution for 12 h at 4Â°C after 72 h of imidacloprid exposure. After isopropyl alcohol dehydration, samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Three-micron-thick sections were stained with a Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), observed with an Olympus BX51 microscope, and photographed with an Olympus digital camera.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>useful</bold> investigation of the changes in gene expression and some of the physiological consequences of sublethal exposures to the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid in honeybee larvae. While the study adds to our understanding of how this insecticide impacts development and growth of honeybees, the evidence supporting the major claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>. The study would benefit from a more thorough mechanistic characterization of the phenotypes to substantiate the conclusions.</p>

<p>This study delves into the impact of imidacloprid, an insecticide documented for its toxicity towards honeybees, on the development of bee larvae. The investigation involved exposing bee larvae to various concentrations of imidacloprid, and observing the resultant effects.</p>
<p>The findings of this study revealed that imidacloprid exerted a dose-dependent delay in the development of bee larvae, marked by reductions in body mass, width, and an overall decline in the growth index. Moreover, at elevated concentrations, imidacloprid was observed to impair neural transmission, induce oxidative stress, inflict damage to the gut, and inhibit hormones and genes essential for development. The larvae were found to engage antioxidant defense systems and deploy detoxification mechanisms to mitigate these effects.</p>
<p>However, the manuscript could be significantly enhanced through several improvements. Firstly, the structure of the manuscript warrants refinement to foster coherence and clarity. Additionally, there is a need for careful reevaluation of the concentrations of imidacloprid employed in the study, to ensure their relevance and applicability. In terms of references, greater attention to accuracy in citation is imperative.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the authors have provided an overview of the general effects of imidacloprid on both vertebrates and invertebrates, the inclusion of a more exhaustive literature review with a specific focus on honey bees and other insects would bolster the context and significance of this research. This would be particularly beneficial in the introduction section, which should be subjected to a major revision.</p>
<p>In summary, this study offers preliminary evidence of the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on the development of bee larvae by interfering with molting and metabolism. This research holds potential as a valuable resource for assessing the risks posed by pesticides to juvenile stages of various animal species.</p>

<p>This study provides evidence on the ability of sublethal imidacloprid doses to affect growth and development of honeybee larva. While checking the effect of doses that do not impact survival or food intake, the authors found changes in the expression of genes related to energy metabolism, antioxidant response, and P450 metabolism. The authors also identified cell death in the alimentary canal, and disturbances in levels of ROS markers, molting hormones, weight and growth ratio. The study strengths come from applying these different approaches to investigate the impacts of imidacloprid exposure. The study weaknesses are not providing an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms behind the impacts observed and not bringing the results in light of the current literature. For instance, the authors' hypothesis is based on two main points, the generation of ROS that leads to gut cell death and energy dysfunction, and the increased P450 expression. They propose this increases P450 expression which in turn increases energy consumption and could contribute to developmental retardation. There is however no investigation on the mechanisms of ROS generation (it could be through mitochondrial damage, Nox/ Duox activity, NOS activity, P450s activity, etc). A link between higher P450 expression and increased energy consumption leading to energy deprivation is also missing. It would also be important for the authors to provide a more complete literature review as previous works have investigated imidacloprid sublethal dose impacts in larval stages for bees and other insect models.</p>
