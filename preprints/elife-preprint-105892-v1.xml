<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Modern fungicides have made significant contributions to crop disease management, but the development of resistant fungal strains has caused their failure in disease control. Therefore, developing fungicides with novel action mechanisms is the most effective measure to manage resistance. Quinofumelin, a novel quinoline fungicide, exhibits exceptional antifungal activity against phytopathogens. However, there is currently no available information on its mechanism of action. Here, we used transcriptome and metabolome analysis to observe a co-enrichment pattern of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) within pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (PBP), identifying down-regulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Exogenous UMP, uridine or uracil (metabolites in PBP) successfully restored quinofumelin-induced inhibition of mycelial growth in <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> and <italic>Fusarium asiaticum</italic>. Additionally, the deletion of <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> was determined to be lethal; however, mycelial growth of ΔFgDHODHII mutants could be restored by adding UMP, uridine or uracil. These findings indicate that the deficiencies in <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> are functionally equivalent to complete inhibition of its activity by quinofumelin. Finally, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) results strongly support the precise interaction between quinofumelin and FgDHODHII. Collectively, these findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of <italic>de novo</italic> uracil biosynthesis as mechanism of action for quinofumelin while identifying FgDHODHII as its specific target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Agrochemical fungicides have a history spanning over 3000 years in the control of plant diseases, and have undergone a development process from traditional protective fungicides with multiple action sites to modern selective fungicides with single action site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The introduction of the first fully systemic seed treatment agent (carboxin, a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) in 1966 and the launch of the first broad-spectrum foliar systemic fungicide (benomyl, a tubulin polymerization inhibitor) in 1968 represent significant milestones in the advancement of modern selective fungicides with single action site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Owing to their exceptional selectivity, potent activity, specific target site, and low toxicity, modern selective fungicides have gained widespread acceptance and witnessed an increasing market share year after year. However, like every coin has two sides, these types of fungicides encounter substantial challenges related to serious resistance issues when deployed in agricultural fields. Numerous reports have been published on plant pathogens developing resistance to modern selective fungicides, which often result in failures or reductions in the effectiveness of chemical control against plant diseases and lead to decreased crop yields and quality (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frac.info/">https://www.frac.info/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is crucial to expedite the development of new-generation selective fungicides with innovative modes of action. Based on a single fungicide target, numerous modern selective fungicides can be developed. For instance, 24 commercialized available fungicides have been created so far based on the respiratory chain complex II as the target. Similarly, another 20 commercialized fungicides have been developed targeting the respiratory chain complex III. Additionally, there are already 37 commercialized fungicides that specifically target the fungicide target C14-demethylase in ergosterol biosynthesis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frac.info/">https://www.frac.info/</ext-link>). Therefore, discovering novel targets poses a significantly greater challenge compared to creating new fungicides within the existing categories.</p>
<p>According to the latest information released by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC), over 30 fungicide selective targets have been identified and acknowledged in the field of fungicide biological research spanning more than 130 years. Currently, these targets have been identified based on the successful development of fungicides and are all related proteins that are essential for pathogen growth or pathogenicity. Extensive identification and functional analysis of essential genes for growth or pathogenicity in plant pathogens have been achieved with rapid advancements in molecular biology techniques; however, there is no precedent for successfully developing commercialized fungicides targeting genes involved in growth or pathogenicity. The creation of highly active modern selective fungicides currently relies on the structural characteristics of existing targets and is accomplished through technologies such as AI drug discovery and design (AIDD), and computer aided drug design (CADD). The biological functions of drug targets are highly conserved, although variations may occur at critical amino acid sites during genetic evolution. Therefore, it is crucial to explore drug targets and analyze their structural characteristics in order to develop novel fungicides with enhanced activity and selectivity. Recently, the Fungicide Biology group from Nanjing Agricultural University proposed a new concept for targeting pesticides based on the principles of targeted medicine. The objective is to create specialized targeted pesticides that exhibit higher activity, greater selectivity, stronger specialization, lower toxicity, and environmental friendliness by leveraging the structural characteristics of pesticide targets. This approach aims to provide essential technical support for scientifically controlling crop diseases.</p>
<p>Quinofumelin (CAS 861647-84-9) is a novel quinoline fungicide developed by Mitsui Chemicals Co., Ltd. Japan. Due to their significant bioactivity, quinoline compounds and their derivatives have found extensive applications in medicine and pesticides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Based on their biological and physiological characteristics, quinolines are classified as FRAC group 13 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frac.info/">https://www.frac.info/</ext-link>). However, the precise mode of action of quinolines against plant pathogens remains unclear. In addition, quinofumelin exhibits no cross-resistance to currently extensively used fungicides, indicating its unique action target against phytopathogenic fungi. Therefore, this study unveils that the mechanism of action for quinofumelin involves <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of uracil that identifies dihydroorotate dehydrogenase as its specific target. This newly discovered selective target for antimicrobial agents provides a valuable resource for the design and development of targeted pesticides.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Transcriptomic analysis of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> as affected by quinofumelin</title>
<p>To evaluate the quality of RNA-Seq data, we conducted a comprehensive analysis for quality control. In the principal component analysis, PC1 and PC2 accounted for 45.59% and 16.98% of the total variance, respectively. The distinct separation observed between the groups indicates significant differences in gene expression between the controls and experimental samples, which could be used for subsequent investigations (Supporting Information, Fig. S1). The clustering heat map effectively categorized the controls and experimental samples into distinct clusters based on their gene expression profiles, demonstrating robust biological replication with minimal intra-group variability and ensuring the reliability of the data. Moreover, notable inter-group dissimilarities highlighted variations among different treatment samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The differential analysis unveiled a total of 234 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the control and experimental samples. Among these findings, there were identified as up-regulated for a count of 97 genes while down-regulation was observed in case of another set comprising around 137 genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). A graphical representation called “volcano plot” was employed to depict the statistical distribution pattern exhibited by these DEGs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). To gain deeper insights into gene functionalities, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were performed on these DEGs. The results showed that they are notably enriched in seventeen distinct GO terms spanning across two major categories; eleven molecular functions along with six processes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Furthermore, the enrichment analysis highlighted significant associations with various functional attributes including transition metal ion binding, oxidoreductase activity, modified amino acid binding, amide binding, monooxygenase activity, and heme binding. Moreover, the enriched biological processes primarily involved transcriptional regulation driven by nucleic-enabled mechanisms as well as monocarboxylic acid metabolism and RNA biosynthesis. Additionally, the KEGG enrichment analysis identified specific pathways associated with thiamine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, amino acid sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, pantothenic acid and CoA biosynthesis, as well as nucleotide sugar production compound synthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Metabolomic analysis of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> as affected by quinofumelin</title>
<p>In metabolomics principal component analysis, the contribution rate of PC1 was determined to be 76.6% in positive ion mode and 51.2% in negative ion mode, respectively. Moreover, the quality control (QC) samples exhibited highly concentrated results, indicating excellent instrument stability and remarkable data repeatability. Furthermore, a distinct separation between groups was observed, particularly prominent in the positive ion mode, indicating significant variations in metabolites among different groups that warrant further investigation (Supporting Information, Fig. S2a and S2b). The findings from Pearson correlation analysis were consistent with those obtained from principal component analysis (Supporting Information, Fig. S2c and S2d). Strong correlations were identified within samples belonging to the same group, while weak correlations were observed between different groups.</p>
<p>Metabolomics analysis revealed a total of 713 differential metabolites, with 14 up-regulated and 699 down-regulated in the positive ion mode, as well as 230 differential metabolites, including 103 up-regulated and 127 down-regulated in the negative ion mode (Supporting Information, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and Fig. S3a). Based on the classification of the identified 943 different metabolites, it was observed that amino acids and their derivatives accounted for the highest proportion (17%), followed by organic acids and their derivatives (11%), benzene and substituted derivatives (11%), aldehydes, ketones, esters (11%), and heterocyclic compounds (10%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The volcano plot visually represents the distribution of statistical differences in metabolite abundance between the two groups (Supporting Information, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and Fig. S3b).</p>

<p>KEGG pathways enriched by differential metabolites primarily include arachidonic acid metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, purine metabolism, citrate cycle, arginine and proline metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and metabolic pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The classification of enrichment pathways for differential metabolites revealed that the majority of these metabolites were associated with nucleotide metabolism (25%), amino acid metabolism (25%), carbohydrate metabolism (25%), and energy metabolism (12.5%) (Supporting Information, Fig. S3c).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Conjoint analysis of transcriptome and metabolome integration</title>
<p>Through transcriptome and metabolome data analysis, we observed a co-enrichment of differentially expressed genes and differentially accumulated metabolites in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. In the expression calorigrams of metabolites and genes depicting the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis pathway of pyrimidine, we identified down-regulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) in the experimental groups. This down-regulation hinders the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, thereby inhibiting the biosynthesis of downstream metabolites orotidine-5P and uracil, leading to their decreased abundance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the action mechanism of quinofumelin may involve inhibition of the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis pathway of pyrimidine.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Identification of DHODHII in <italic>F. graminearum</italic></title>
<p>The <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> sequences in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> were identified by performing a BLAST search against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database, using <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> DHODHII amino acid sequences as a query. <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> is a gene consisting of 1419 bp without introns and is predicted to encode a protein consisting of 472 amino acids. Orthologs of <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> were obtained using the BLAST algorithm. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the amino acid sequences of DHODHII homologous protein with Mega X using the neighbor-joining method. Motif pattern information was generated using the MEME suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, while functional domain information and protein coordinates were obtained through CD-search<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. TBtools software was used for visualizing the tree representation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. All DHODHII proteins possess the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating high conservation among fungi. Besides, these orthologs proteins would potentially interact with the fungicide in other pathosystems.</p>

<title>Recovery test of mycelial growth suppressed by quinofumelin in <italic>Fusarium genus</italic></title>
<p>The mycelial growth of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> PH-1 was significantly inhibited on CZA plates containing quinofumelin at concentrations of 1 μg/mL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). To investigate the potential recovery of mycelial growth by exogenous dihydroorotate, UMP, uridine, or uracil, CZA plates supplemented with quinofumelin were treated with these compounds. Despite the addition of exogenous dihydroorotate at 50 μg/mL failing to restore mycelial growth, the addition of exogenous UMP, uridine or uracil at 50 μg/mL successfully recovered quinofumelin-induced inhibition of mycelial growth. Similar results were observed in other strains of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> or <italic>F. asiaticum</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Fig. S4).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In over 130 years of research on fungicide biology, more than 30 novel targets for selective fungicides have been identified. Based on these newly discovered targets, over 200 modern selective fungicides have been developed. Consequently, the identification of novel targets for fungicides poses a significantly greater challenge compared to the development of new fungicides. Currently, modern selective fungicides with single action site are widely applied in agricultural practices for crop disease management. However, these specific types of fungicides encounter substantial obstacles associated with resistance issues when deployed in agricultural fields. Numerous studies have extensively documented cases of plant pathogens developing resistance to modern selective fungicides, resulting in failures or reductions in their efficacy against plant diseases and subsequently leading to decreased crop yields and quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. For instance, <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, a significant plant pathogenic fungus, has emerged as multi-resistant population that is resistant to all currently used modern selective fungicides. This poses a formidable challenge for the control of crop grey mold disease caused by <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new fungicides with novel mechanisms of action to effectively manage multiple resistance.</p>
<p>The novel quinoline, quinofumelin, developed by Mitsui Chemicals Co., Ltd. Japan, has demonstrated remarkable antifungal activity against plant pathogens such as <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, our research group found that quinofumelin exhibits no cross-resistance to all types of currently used modern selective fungicides. These findings indicate that quinofumelin possesses a distinctive mode of action against plant pathogens. Based on their biological and physiological characteristics, quinolines are classified as FRAC group 13 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frac.info/">https://www.frac.info/</ext-link>). However, the precise mechanism by which quinolines act against plant pathogens remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of quinofumelin on <italic>F. graminearum</italic> using a combined analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics. The transcriptome data revealed that DEGs were involved in “tryptophan metabolism” and “amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism”. Furthermore, the metabolome data identified DAMs enriched in “nucleotide metabolism” and “amino acid metabolism”. Interestingly, we observed a co-enrichment of DEGs and DAMs in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. Specifically, we identified a down-regulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) in the experimental groups, which impeded the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate. Consequently, this inhibition led to decreased biosynthesis of downstream metabolites orotidine-5P and uracil. Therefore, we conducted an experiment using <italic>F. graminearum</italic> standard strain PH-1 to quantify mycelial growth by supplementing exogenous uracil, which is the end product of the uracil biosynthesis pathway. This was performed in the presence of complete inhibition of mycelial growth caused by quinofumelin. Surprisingly, the addition of exogenous uracil restored the inhibited mycelial growth induced by quinofumelin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Meanwhile, similar results were successfully verified with four other <italic>F. graminearum</italic> strains and five <italic>F. asiaticum</italic> strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Fig. S4). Based on our depicted pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), we also supplemented other intermediate products such as dihydroorotate, orotate, UMP, and uridine externally. Except for dihydroorotate and orotate, supplementation of exogenous UMP and uridine effectively restored mycelial growth inhibited by quinofumelin as well. These findings strongly support that quinofumelin acts through modulation of the uracil biosynthesis pathway.</p>
<p>As a key enzyme in the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, DHODH has previously been investigated as a potential target for inhibiting infectious organisms and as an antitumor agent in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Inhibiting DHODH can effectively impede the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and glycoproteins, thereby regulating aberrant cell metabolism and proliferation to ultimately achieve therapeutic objectives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Within mammalian cells, DHODH is closely associated with the mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in the respiratory chain through its interaction with ubiquinone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Here, using amino acid sequences from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> DHODHII as a reference query, we have identified FgDHODHII (FGSG_09678), a gene comprising of 1419 bp without any introns, which encodes 472 amino acids in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. FgDHODHII possesses a typical DHOD-2 like domain (NCBI: cd04738) and belongs to class 2 DHODs. Class 2 DHODHs are membrane-bound enzymes, whereas class 1 enzymes are located in the cytosol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The DHODH enzyme catalyzes a unique redox reaction in the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The DHOD-2 like domain can bind orotate and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), facilitating the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate and the reduction of the FMN cofactor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Based on the aforementioned findings, we have concluded that DHODHII functions as the target of action for quinofumelin against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Consequently, we performed a protoplast transformation assay to delete FgDHODHII in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and further validate the precise target of action for quinofumelin. Typically, most fungicide targets are either lethal genes or essential pathogenic genes. Therefore, it is plausible that the inactivation of FgDHODHII may be lethal. In our genetic transformation experiment, exogenous uridine was supplemented to successfully obtain deletion mutants of the FgDHODHII gene. Fortunately, two ΔFgDHODHII mutants were successfully obtained. These mutants exhibited an inability to grow on PDA or CZA medium; however, mycelial growth was fully restored upon addition of uridine to the medium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Additionally, exogenous supplementation of UMP or uracil effectively restored mycelial growth. However, the supplementation of dihydroorotate to the medium did not alleviate the growth defect observed in ΔFgDHODHII mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Furthermore, mycelial growth in two ΔFgDHODHII mutants was restored by exogenously adding UMP, uracil or uridine under quinofumelin treatments. These findings indicate that the defects of FgDHODHII are functionally equivalent to complete inhibition of its activity by quinofumelin and further confirm that the mechanism of action for quinofumelin involves <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of uracil while identifying FgDHODH as its specific target.</p>
<p>Molecular docking is a computational procedure employed to predict the optimal binding orientation of a ligand with its macromolecular target (receptor), thereby forming a stable complex. In concise terms, docking is a molecular modeling technique employed to predict the interaction between a protein (enzyme) and small molecules (ligands). In this study, we conducted molecular docking analysis between quinofumelin and the target protein FgDHODHII. The docking results unveiled a robust affinity between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin. Furthermore, these findings provided additional evidence that the strong affinity of quinofumelin with FgDHODHII disrupts its activity and function.</p>
<p>Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique is employed for real-time measurement of molecular interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The SPR sensor map characterizes intermolecular interaction rates primarily by conveying the kinetic rate constant, while it characterizes the binding level between molecules mainly by conveying the affinity constant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In this study, we used SPR technology to measure the binding energy and kinetics between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin. The binding kinetics of FgDHODHII and quinofumelin demonstrated fast-binding and fast-dissociation modes. Soluble FgDHODHII exhibited an ideal affinity (Kd) of 6.606×10<sup>−6</sup> M with quinofumelin, falling within the suitable range of 10<sup>−3</sup> M to 10<sup>−6</sup> M for biomacromolecule-small molecule interactions. Furthermore, the binding affinity between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin was confirmed by a microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay. Therefore, these data strongly support the precise interaction between quinofumelin and its target protein FgDHODHII. This newly discovered selective target for antimicrobial agents offers a valuable resource for the design and development of targeted pesticides. Unlike many other dehydrogenases that require NAD or NADP as an electron acceptor, DHODH transfers electrons to ubiquinone, which then transfers electrons into respiratory complex III and eventually to oxygen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, the production of orotate in pyrimidine biosynthesis is coupled with the electron transport system and energy production, exerting additional control over nucleotide synthesis and ensuring its coupling to cellular energy metabolism. In the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, DHODHII regulates the conversion from dihydroorotate to orotate. Our findings demonstrated that DHODHII is target of action for quinofumelin. A previous study reported that exogenous orotate but not exogenous dihydroorotate recovered mycelial growth inhibited by quinofumelin, indicating that quinofumelin inhibits the formation of orotate in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, we observed that the supplementation of orotate to the medium did not alleviate the growth defect of ΔFgDHODHII mutants. Considering the disparity in mycelial growth inhibition between <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and other fungi, our data suggests that a nonclassical two-site ping-pong mechanism is the most suitable model for DHODH as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In the classical ping-pong mechanism, DHODH interacts with dihydroorotate and ubiquinol in an identical confirmation, while orotate and ubiquinone combine with an alternative form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. However, similar to brequinar sodium inhibiting the activity of DHODH isolated from mammalian sources, FgDHODHII may follow a nonclassical, two-site ping-pong mechanism. In this nonclassical ping-pong mechanism, the two substrates may not share chemical resemblance and therefore do not bind to a single binding site but likely bind to two adjacent sites that facilitate reactant transfer. The precise nature of the interaction between quinofumelin and FgDHODHII may require further elucidation studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Phytophathogens including fungal pathogens such as F. graminearum remain a major threat to agriculture and food security. Several agriculturally relevant fungicides including the potent Quinofumelin have been discovered to date, yet the mechanisms of their action and specific targets within the cell remain unclear. This paper sets out to contribute to addressing these outstanding questions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is generally well-written and provides convincing data to support their claims for the impact of Quinofumelin on fungal growth, the target of the drug, and the potential mechanism. Critically the authors identify an important pyrimidine pathway dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) gene FgDHODHII in the pathway or mechanism of the drug from the prominent plant pathogen F. graminearum, confirming it as the target for Quinofumelin. The evidence is supported by transcriptomic, metabolomic as well as MST, SPR, molecular docking/structural biology analyses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whilst the study adds to our knowledge about this drug, it is, however, worth stating that previous reports (although in different organisms) by Higashimura et al., 2022 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9716045/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9716045/</ext-link> had already identified DHODH as the target for Quinofumelin and hence this knowledge is not new and hence the authors may want to tone down the claim that they discovered this mechanism and also give sufficient credit to the previous authors work at the start of the write-up in the introduction section rather than in passing as they did with reference 25? other specific recommendations to improve the text are provided in the recommendations for authors section below.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the current study, the authors aim to identify the mode of action/molecular mechanism of characterized a fungicide, quinofumelin, and its biological impact on transcriptomics and metabolomics in Fusarium graminearum and other Fusarium species. Two sets of data were generated between quinofumelin and no treatment group, and differentially abundant transcripts and metabolites were identified. The authors further focused on uridine/uracil biosynthesis pathway, considering the significant up- and down-regulation observed in final metabolites and some of the genes in the pathways. Using a deletion mutant of one of the genes and in vitro biochemical assays, the authors concluded that quinofumelin binds to the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Omics datasets were leveraged to understand the physiological impact of quinofumelin, showing the intracellular impact of the fungicide. The characterization of FgDHODHII deletion strains with supplemented metabolites clearly showed the impact of the enzyme on fungal growth.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some interpretation of results is not accurate and some experiments lack controls. The comparison between quinofumelin-treated deletion strains, in the presence of different metabolites didn't suggest the fungicide is FgDHODHII specific. A wild type is required in this experiment.</p>
<p>Potential Impact: Confirming the target of quinofumelin may help understand its resistance mehchanism, and further development of other inhibitory molecules against the target.</p>
<p>The manuscript would benefit more in explaining the study rationale if more background on previous characterization of this fungicide on Fusarium is given.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript shows the mechanism of action of quinofumelin, a novel fungicide, against the fungus Fusarium graminearum. Through omics analysis, phenotypic analysis, and in silico approaches, the role of quinofumelin in targeting DHODH is uncovered.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The phenotypic analysis and mutant generation are nice data and add to the role of metabolites in bypassing pyrimidine biosynthesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The role of DHODH in this class of fungicides has been known and this data does not add any further significance to the field. The work of Higashimura et al is not appreciated well enough as they already showed the role of quinofumelin upon DHODH II.</p>
<p>There is no mention of the other fungicide within this class ipflufenoquin, as there is ample data on this molecule.</p>
