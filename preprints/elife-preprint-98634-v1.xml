<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Galanin is a neuropeptide, which is critically involved in homeostatic processes like controlling arousal, sleep, and regulation of stress. This extensive range of functions aligns with implications of galanin in diverse pathologies, including anxiety disorders, depression, and epilepsy. Here we investigated the regulatory function of galanin on whole-brain activity in larval zebrafish using wide-field Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Combining this with genetic perturbations of galanin signaling and pharmacologically increasing neuronal activity, we are able to probe actions of galanin across the entire brain. Our findings demonstrate that under unperturbed conditions and during epileptic seizures, galanin exerts a sedative influence on the brain, primarily through the galanin receptor 1a (<italic>galr1a</italic>). However, exposure to acute stressors like pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) compromises galanin’s sedative effects, leading to overactivation of the brain and increased seizure occurrence. Interestingly, galanin’s impact on seizures appears to be bidirectional, as it can both decrease seizure severity and increase seizure occurrence, potentially through different galanin receptor subtypes. This nuanced interplay between galanin and various physiological processes underscores its significance in modulating stress-related pathways and suggests its potential implications for neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Taken together, our data sheds light on a multifaceted role of galanin, where galanin regulates whole-brain activity but also shapes acute responses to stress.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Similar to classic neurotransmitters, neuropeptides are chemical messengers that are mainly synthesized and released by neurons. In contrast to conventional neurotransmitters, neuropeptides are amino acid chains between 3 and 36 amino acids of length. While classic neurotransmitters are primarily stored in synaptic vesicles, neuropeptides are predominantly stored in large dense-core vesicles (LDCV) and are mostly released during neuronal bursts or high-frequency firing <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Neuropeptides play a crucial role in modulating neuronal activity and regulating various aspects of neural network function. They act as neuromodulators, exerting long-lasting effects on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and plasticity <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. By influencing the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs to neurons, neuropeptides can shape network dynamics and information processing. This is achieved through their interactions with specific receptors and signaling pathways, allowing for precise modulation and optimization of neural activity in response to changing conditions <sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Overall, neuropeptides play a pivotal role in orchestrating the complex activity of neuronal networks and maintaining homeostasis within the central nervous system. Elevated neuronal activity is often accompanied by shifts in neuropeptide transcription rates through a phenomenon known as “stimulus-secretion-synthesis coupling” <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. This intricate interplay between neuropeptide release and biosynthesis likely serves as a crucial mechanism for replenishing neuropeptide stores, given the absence of a mechanism for neuropeptide uptake post-release and their degradation by extracellular peptidases. Further, neuropeptides are well known to contact neurons via volume transmission, where extrasynaptically secreted molecules activate receptors on neurons synaptically unconnected to the releasing neuron. This leads to signal transmission across considerable distances, extending up to multiple microns, targeting multiple neurons in different regions of the brain <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Galanin is such a neuropeptide, which is expressed predominantly in the hypothalamus, the center of homeostatic regulation in the brain. Galanin is highly involved in homeostatic processes like controlling arousal and sleep <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, but has been shown to regulate stress <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, research has demonstrated that galanin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus play a role in regulating both food intake <sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and parental behavior <sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> in rodents. This extensive range of functions aligns with implications of galanin in diverse pathologies, including anxiety disorders, depression, and epilepsy <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Here we investigated the regulatory function of galanin on whole-brain activity in larval zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>). Leveraging the transparency of zebrafish during their larval stages, a characteristic that facilitates live imaging, we utilized basic wide-field Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging methods. Combining this with genetic perturbation of galanin and pharmacologically increasing neuronal activity, we were able to delve into the actions of galanin across the entire brain.</p>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that, under unperturbed conditions and during epileptic seizures, galanin exerts a sedative influence on the brain, which is likely governed by <italic>galanin receptor 1a</italic> (<italic>galr1a</italic>). However, when faced with an acute stressor like pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), the typically sedative effects of galanin are substantially compromised. We found that exposure to this acute central nervous system stressor results in a galanin dependent overactivation of the brain that overrides most of galanins sedating actions and increases the occurrence of epileptic seizures. Taken together, our data sheds light on a multifaceted role of galanin, where galanin regulates whole-brain activity but also shapes acute responses to stress.</p>

<title><italic>gal</italic> expression correlates with whole-brain activity</title>
<p>In prior work, we introduced a novel epilepsy model characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures and interictal neuronal hypoactivity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A - D</xref>) <sup><xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. The unexpected observation of locomotor and neuronal hypoactivity in this model stands in contrast to most existing studies in zebrafish that report hyperactivity in epileptic animals <sup><xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, recent investigations have demonstrated that overexpression of galanin induces locomotory hypoactivity in zebrafish models <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. To explore the potential involvement of galanin in the hypoactivity observed in <italic>eaat2a</italic> mutants, we conducted qPCR analysis on 5 dpf (days post fertilization) larval brains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The results revealed a significant 15.4-fold increase in galanin expression compared to wild type siblings, suggesting an involvement of galanin in the interictal hypoactivity observed in <italic>eaat2a</italic> mutants. Furthermore, recent findings have shed light on the role of galanin in pharmacologically induced rebound sleep <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Additionally, it was demonstrated that increasing short term neuronal activity results in subsequent inactivity that is dependent ongalanin <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. To explore whether the application of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) would also lead to a temporary decrease in whole-brain activity, we exposed 5 dpf larvae to 20 mM PTZ for 1 h, followed by a 2-hour washout period before undergoing Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Remarkably, while PTZ increases swimming activity and induces seizure-like behavior during acute drug exposure <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, there was a significant reduction in brain activity during PTZ rebound (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">J</xref>), which was correlated with an increase in galanin expression by 2.5-fold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) compared with non-PTZ-treated larvae. Notably, large Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> &gt; 10%) decreased in frequency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>), and decreased in amplitude (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>), while their duration increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>) compared to non-PTZ-treated larvae. For small Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> &gt; 5) the frequency also decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>), while their amplitude and duration were not affected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">K</xref>). Together, our results illustrate that the expression of galanin rises in reaction to seizure-like activity in two separate seizure models and is correlated with an overall decrease in whole-brain activity.</p>

<title><italic>gal</italic> controls whole-brain activity</title>
<p>To investigate if galanin by itself is able to reduce whole-brain activity, we employed a transgenic approach by using <italic>hsp70l:gal</italic> <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> expressing larvae. These transgenic fish express galanin under the control of the heatshock promoter <italic>hsp70l</italic>, enabling the induction of galanin expression by upregulating transcripts by over 300 fold <sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Attempts to induce galanin overexpression through heat shock were discontinued due to a notable impact on the brain activity of wild type larvae compared to non-exposed wild type larvae (Suppl. Figure 1). Yet, considering that <italic>hsp70l:gal</italic> larvae already display a basal elevation of galanin transcripts by approximately 8-fold <sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, comparable with the upregulation seen in <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants and PTZ rebound (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1F</xref>), we chose to use larvae without inducing transcription via heat shock. We performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and found that indeed elevated expression of galanin in <italic>hsp70l:gal</italic> larvae leads to a decrease in whole-brain activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) compared to wild type siblings. We detected a reduction in frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations for larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> events and a reduction in their amplitude (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref>), mirroring our earlier findings in the PTZ rebound (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1H</xref>). Notably, <italic>hsp70l:gal</italic> larvae exhibited no difference in small Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref>). Subsequent quantification of galanin levels in the brain through qPCR unveiled a 1.8-fold increase in galanin transcripts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) in <italic>hsp70l:gal</italic> larvae compared to their wild type siblings, potentially explaining the more subtle effects observed on brain activity. To further examine the role of galanin in regulating whole brain activity, we used <italic>galanin</italic><sup><italic>t12ae/t12ae</italic></sup> mutants (<italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants) that carry a 7 bp deletion in exon 3 of the <italic>galanin</italic> gene which leads to a premature stop codon <sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. While other studies focused their analysis in <italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants on their locomotion <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and sleep <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, we want to assess the effects of a galanin deficiency on the brain. When performing Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we found that brain activity is heavily increased in <italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) compared to wild type larvae. While overexpression of galanin primarily influences larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, the absence of galanin specifically affects smaller Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations. The increased frequency of these events is accompanied by a decrease in both amplitude and duration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2K</xref>). To delve deeper into the galanin system, we took a targeted approach focusing on a specific galanin receptor in zebrafish. Zebrafish have four galanin receptors: <italic>galr1a, galr1b, galr2a</italic>, and <italic>galr2b</italic>. While information about these receptors in zebrafish is limited, studies indicate that <italic>galr1a</italic> is widely expressed in the brain, and sequence identity closely resemble those of mammalian GALR1 <sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. To investigate the actions of <italic>galr1a</italic> in zebrafish, we conducted F0 knockouts which enable a direct analysis of the injected embryos, bypassing the need to establish stable lines <sup><xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. We found that <italic>galr1a</italic> crispants have an increased number of small Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in the brain, compared to control injected larvae (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref>). The absence of <italic>galr1a</italic> specifically affects the frequency of smaller Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations, similar to <italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>), suggesting that galanin might regulate whole-brain activity via <italic>galr1a</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>gal</italic> exerts only a modest effect on seizure activity in <italic>eaat2a</italic> mutants</title>
<p>While we could show that galanin has direct implications in regulating whole brain activity, others have investigated its antiepileptic properties. It was shown that galanin signaling can affect the seizure thresholds and severity in mice <sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, and can reduce the occurrence of seizure-like behavioral episodes and their intensity in zebrafish <sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The increased levels of galanin observed in <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants could be interpreted as an internal compensatory mechanism, possibly serving to shield neurons from excitotoxicity. The observed interictal hypoactivity may be a consequence of the brain’s deliberate neuroprotective strategy so reduce the occurrence of seizures.

Although not all <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants exhibit spontaneous epileptic seizures in the 1-hour recording window, an estimated 57.14% - 60.00% (12/21; 21/35) of larvae do (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We then compared seizures of 5 dpf <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>;hsp70l:gal</italic> with <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> larvae and found no significant difference in seizure susceptibility or severity in spontaneous epileptic seizures. Neither the number of seizures, their amplitude, duration nor time to peak was altered (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref>). This is however not surprising, as we showed earlier that 5 dpf <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants already overexpress galanin by 15.4-fold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and therefore more galanin might not make a big difference. To investigate if galanin is still important in seizure protection, we turned to analyze <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>;gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">L</xref>).

Neither the number of seizures, the seizure duration nor the time to peak changed significantly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H, J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">L</xref>).

<p>Despite the observed decrease in neuronal activity resulting from galanin overexpression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref>), exposing 5 dpf <italic>hsp70l:gal</italic> larvae to 20 mM PTZ surprisingly led to a significant increase in seizure activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) compared to non-exposed wild type siblings. While seizure number increases significantly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), there is also a decrease in seizure duration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Conversely, the absence of galanin during acute PTZ exposure induces an opposing phenotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">K</xref>). A marked decrease in the occurrence of epileptic seizures is evident in <italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>) compared to wild type larvae. Merely 6 out of 38 <italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants (15.8%) display seizures, whereas 20 out of 39 wild type larvae (51.3%) exhibit seizure activity. However, when <italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> larvae experience seizures upon PTZ, the seizure amplitude is significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>), while their duration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>) increases. Further, time to peak and AUC of seizures are increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4I</xref>). Strikingly, while seizures in control larvae come to an abrupt stop after a gradual decline, seizures seem to taper off over the duration of several minutes in <italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>Contrary to our initial expectations derived from prior results indicating a potentially sedative and neuroprotective role of galanin, the exposure of larvae to PTZ under acute conditions resulted in an opposing observation. While it was surprising that galanin seems to increase seizure susceptibility instead of protecting the larvae from seizures, this fits very well with results from a recent publication, where the authors found galanin to be involved in a stress response upon salient stimuli <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The authors hypothesize that galanin binds to autoreceptors on Gal<sup>+</sup> neurons, reducing their own activity and therefore reducing their secretion of galanin and additionally reduce release of GABA on downstream stress-promoting neurons, ultimately leading to an increase in stress <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. While the specific galanin receptor governing the stress pathway remains elusive, it has been found that GALR1 exerts an inhibitory influence on neuronal activity in mammals, while GALR2 displays a dual role, exhibiting both inhibitory and excitatory effects <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Notably, it has been demonstrated that a significant portion of Gal+ neurons in the preoptic area in zebrafish express either <italic>galr1a, galr1b</italic> or <italic>galr2b</italic> <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. To discern whether <italic>galr1a</italic>, beyond its role in regulating whole-brain activity, is intricately linked to the stress response pathway, we implemented F0 knockouts of <italic>galr1a</italic> and exposed injected larvae to PTZ-induced stress. If <italic>galr1a</italic> were the autoreceptor on GABAergic Gal+ neurons, we would expect a decrease in seizure number similar to <italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants. However, our examination of <italic>galr1a</italic> crispants exposed to 20 mM PTZ revealed no significant decrease in seizure frequency compared to control injected larvae (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4P</xref>). This suggests that <italic>galr1a</italic> is not the hypothesized autoreceptor governing this stress response pathway. Furthermore, our findings reveal that <italic>galr1a</italic> crispants manifest a more severe response to PTZ-induced seizures, evident in the substantial increase in both amplitude and duration compared to control injected larvae (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4R</xref>). Strikingly, several seizure characteristics in <italic>galr1a</italic> crispants mirror those observed in <italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants exposed to PTZ. Specifically, AUC of seizures shows a marked increase, the time to peak extends, and seizures exhibit a gradual tapering off over several minutes, a distinct pattern in contrast to the rapid resolution seen in controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4O</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings underscore the multifaceted role of galanin, not only in inducing a sedating effect on the entire brain but also in playing a pivotal role in a recently described stress response pathway <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Although the specific receptor orchestrating this stress pathway remains unidentified, our research decisively eliminates <italic>galr1a</italic> as the regulator. Collectively, this leads us to the conclusion that galanin likely exerts its sedative actions during epileptic seizures through <italic>galr1a</italic>, and that the stress response pathway is governed by another galanin receptor.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sustaining brain homeostasis enables consistent behavior and demands the brain’s ongoing integration of sensory information from the environment, internal behavioral state of the organism, and the elaborate networks of synaptic and non-synaptic connectivity <sup><xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. While maintenance of homeostasis requires multiple factors, here we focused on the neuropeptide galanin, as it has been shown to impact whole organism activity <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, sleep <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and responses to stress <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. In animals such as zebrafish, sleep is operationally defined as periods of locomotor quiescence with an increased arousal threshold <sup><xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>–<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. A recent study showed evidence for galanin being important in homeostatic sleep regulation in zebrafish <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Others found a decrease in locomotor activity upon galanin overexpression <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. We similarly found that overexpression of galanin leads to a reduction in brain activity, while lack of galanin leads to neuronal hyperactivity. Interestingly, most sleep-active GABAergic neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) are galanin positive in mammals and the VLPO has long been proposed to be a major sleep regulator <sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. While our investigation did not delve into galanin’s direct influence on sleep, our results suggests that galanin exerts a sedative influence on the brain. This calming effect is likely governed by <italic>galr1a</italic>, as lack of <italic>galr1a</italic> leads to similar neuronal hyperactivity of the brain as the absence of galanin. This is in line with the observation that GALR1 activation inhibits the expressing cell by opening of G protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels (GIRKs) <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Moreover, it has been shown that galanin signaling is implicated in the reduction of glutamate release <sup><xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>, which could further explain its calming effect on the brain.</p>
<p>Besides galanin regulating global neuronal activity, we showed that excessive neuronal activity is a potential predictor of subsequent reduced neuronal inactivity similar to another study <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Employing two distinct models characterized by increased neuronal activity and epileptic seizures, our findings elucidate a consistent pattern – elevated galanin levels and decline of overall neuronal activity. This discovery is particularly interesting, considering that post-ictal fatigue is a common symptom in epilepsy patients <sup><xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> and it further mimics slow background brain activity and reduced muscle tone present in human patients <sup><xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>–<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup>. Moreover, the reduced neuronal activity is particularly intriguing, especially when considering the divergent mechanisms of action utilized by the two models we employed. In <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants glutamate uptake into astroglia is deprecated. This results in an accumulation of glutamate in the synaptic cleft, leading to the initiation of severe epileptic seizures that spread across the entire brain <sup><xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. PTZ, on the other hand, acts as a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, leading to the disinhibition of the brain and a subsequent dose-dependent increase in neuronal activity, ultimately triggering epileptic seizures. The observation that both models show a reduced neuronal activity interictally (<italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) or after washout (PTZ), which coincides with upregulation of galanin, suggests possible implications of galanin in various types of epileptic seizures. Galanin has been shown to be antiepileptic in numerous studies <sup><xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. In an attempt to assess potential antiepileptic effects of galanin in zebrafish, we manipulated galanin levels in <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants. However, the impact of galanin on seizures in <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> larvae was found to be minimal, likely attributed to the exceptionally severe seizure phenotype associated with <italic>eaat2a</italic> dysfunction <sup><xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. In acute PTZ exposure however, galanin modulated seizures significantly. While we hypothesized to see antiepileptic effects upon modulation of galanin, our observations did not initially support this expectation. Galanin overexpression significantly elevated the number of seizures, whereas the absence of galanin led to a decrease in seizure occurrence. This is however in line with results from a recent publication, where galanin was found to be involved in fine-tuning a stress response upon exposure to hypertonic solution <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Supposedly, galanin binds to autoreceptors on Gal<sup>+</sup> neurons, reducing their own activity and therefore reducing their release of GABA on downstream stress-promoting neurons, ultimately leading to an increase in stress via Crh<sup>+</sup> neurons <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. This can be thought of as a control system to fine-tune neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stressful situations. While it is not clear which galanin receptor is governing this inhibitory loop, <italic>galr1a</italic> stands out as the most expressed and main inhibitory galanin receptor in the zebrafish brain <sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Hence, we explored whether <italic>galr1a</italic> crispants exhibit a reduction in seizure occurrence similar to <italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants upon PTZ-induced stress. Surprisingly, we found that seizures did not decrease in number in <italic>galr1a</italic> crispants, indicating that <italic>galr1a</italic> might not function as the autoreceptor on GABAergic Gal<sup>+</sup> neurons. Furthermore, seizures got more severe in <italic>galr1a</italic> crispants, as their amplitude and duration increased significantly, similar as in <italic>gal</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants. This suggests that galanin influences whole brain activity in at least two ways during epileptic seizures. On one hand, galanin acts as a sedating agent, decreasing seizure severity, which is likely governed by <italic>galr1a</italic>. On the other hand, galanin increases seizure occurrence, similar to increasing stress in another study <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and we hypothesize that this might be dependent on one of the other galanin receptors.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data sheds light on a multifaceted role of galanin in regulating whole brain activity. The complexity of galanin’s effects is evident in our study, where it can serve as a central nervous system depressant or regulate stress response pathways. This is particularly the case during acute stress, where its modulatory role overrides its sedative actions. This suggests a nuanced interplay between galanin and various physiological processes, elicidating on its potential significance in modulating stress-related pathways. Exploring the mechanisms underlying these effects could offer valuable insights into the intricate role of galanin and its implications for various physiological functions or neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Other studies have revealed that galanin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus are involved in regulating diverse processes including food intake <sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, parental behavior <sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, sleep <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and stress <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, discrete subsets of hypothalamic neurons express galanin, with each subset displaying distinct responses to various stimuli. This diversity in neuronal responsiveness may account for the broad spectrum of physiological functions governed by galanin within the brain <sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Investigating the function of these galaninergic neuron populations represents a crucial next step in unraveling how galanin modulates neuronal activity and ultimately influences brain function. Although many questions remain, our data reveals a multifaceted role of galanin, where galanin regulates whole-brain activity but also shapes acute responses to stress and epileptic seizures.</p>

For generating the F0 knockouts, one-cell staged embryos were injected with 1 nl injection mix (10.1 fmol [357 pg] per gRNA) into the yolk. Control injection mix contained a set of three scrambled RNPs, which carry gRNAs (IDT, Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 Negative Control crRNA #1 (#1072544), #2 (#1072545), #3 (#1072546)<sup><xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>) with pseudo-random sequences predicted to not match any genomic locus. For all experiments scramble RNP injected siblings were used as controls. As stable <italic>galr1a</italic> mutants <sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> lack overt morphological phenotypes apart from their pigmentation phenotype, all larvae with abnormal appearance were discarded to rule out injection artifacts.</p>

<title>Calcium imaging and data analysis</title>
<p>5 dpf larvae in the Tg(<italic>elavl3:GCaMP5G</italic>) or Tg(<italic>elavl3:GCaMP6f</italic>) background respectively were individually immobilized in a drop of 2% low melting temperature agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) in a small cell culture dish. Agarose was left to dry briefly before a part was cut away and a second larvae was embedded close to the first larvae and in the same focal plane. Dish was filled with E3 medium. Calcium signals were recorded using an Olympus BX51 WI epifluorescence microscope with a 5x objective and by means of a camera (1.33 Hz sampling rate) for 1 h with the VisiView software established by the Visitron Systems GmbH. In each experiment, the GCaMP fluorescence signal of manually selected regions of interest (ROIs, whole brain) was extracted using Fiji ImageJ <sup><xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>. Images were corrected for sample drift with Correct_3D_Drift.py script <sup><xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> in Fiji ImageJ <sup><xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>. For each time point, the mean intensity of each ROI was measured and further processed using a custom script in R with the RStudio interface <sup><xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup>. The baseline (F<sub>0</sub>) as 1% of the total fluorescence of every ROI was computed within a moving window of 150s (for normal brain activity) or 300s (for <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> seizure analysis) per fish. Subsequently, the fractional change in fluorescence (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) of each ROI was determined. In all imaging experiments, heartbeat of larvae was assessed before and after each experiment, and animals without heartbeat were excluded from analysis. In order to compare whole brain activity, thresholds for event detection were set. For examining normal brain activity, events were categorized into two distinct groups, 5% and 10% of ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>. Duration, amplitude and number of events were calculated for each of these groups. For analyzing normal behavior, area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the whole normalized fluorescence trace except for the experiment with <italic>eaat2a</italic> mutants and the respective controls in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, where AUC was calculated and averaged over 2 five-minutes time windows per animal (same random windows for all larvae, adjusted if during seizure). To demonstrate previously published <italic>eaat2a</italic> hypoactivity <sup><xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B, D, E, F</xref>), data from <italic>eaat2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">F</xref>) and closely related wild type larvae (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">F</xref>) were re-used and differently analyzed. For this particular experiment, we removed seizures by excluding all events with amplitudes bigger than 50% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> and a duration of more than 20s. For all other recordings, seizures were defined as calcium fluctuations reaching at least 100% of ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> in the whole brain. Seizure duration was defined as the period from the first time point where ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> is greater than 50% (seizure initiation) until the first time point where ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> is below 50% in the brain. To generate the overlay plots (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A, 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4M</xref>); all seizures were aligned by the time point where 50% of the maximum ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was reached. The resulting plots showcase the mean average seizure per genotype, shaded area represents the standard error of the mean (SEM). AUC and time to peak of each seizure were calculated from the beginning of the aligned seizure trace.</p>

<title>PTZ exposure</title>
<p>For exposure with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), 20 mM PTZ was prepared freshly on each experimental day (Sigma-Aldrich). For acute PTZ exposure, E3 medium was replaced by 20 mM PTZ (in E3) directly before starting the 1 h imaging period. For PTZ rebound experiments, freely swimming larvae were exposed to 20 mM PTZ (in E3) in a 50 ml cell culture dish for 1 h, subsequently rinsed in a dish containing E3 medium and were then transferred to a fresh dish with E3 medium for 1 h. Larvae were embedded as described earlier and left in E3 medium until the 1-hour calcium imaging experiment was conducted precisely 2 hours after initiating the PTZ washout.</p>

<p>Statistical analysis was performed using R software version 4.2.1 with the RStudio version RStudio 2023.09.1+494 interface <sup><xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup> or GraphPad Prism version 10.1.2 for Windows, GraphPad Software, Boston, Massachusetts USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>. Calcium imaging data was tested for normality using Shapiro–Wilk test. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test nonpaired analysis was used for calcium imaging analysis (amplitudes, duration, AUC, time to peak). For comparing event number, as data was overdispersed, a negative binomial generalized linear model was fitted and assessed (package: MASS, glm.nb in R). For qPCR data, Student’s t-test in GraphPad Prism was used. Differences were considered statistically significant if p &lt; 0.05.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors explored how galanin affects whole-brain activity in larval zebrafish using wide-field Ca2+ imaging, genetic modifications, and drugs that increase brain activity. The authors conclude that galanin has a sedative effect on the brain under normal conditions and during seizures, mainly through the galanin receptor 1a (galr1a). However, acute &quot;stressors(?)&quot; like pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) reduce galanin's effects, leading to increased brain activity and more seizures. The authors claim that galanin can reduce seizure severity while increasing seizure occurrence, speculated to occur through different receptor subtypes. This study confirms galanin's complex role in brain activity, supporting its potential impact on epilepsy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The overall strength of the study lies primarily in its methodological approach using whole-brain Calcium imaging facilitated by the transparency of zebrafish larvae. Additionally, the use of transgenic zebrafish models is an advantage, as it enables genetic manipulations to investigate specific aspects of galanin signaling. This combination of advanced imaging and genetic tools allows for addressing galanin's role in regulating brain activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses of the study also stem from the methodological approach, particularly the use of whole-brain Calcium imaging as a measure of brain activity. While epilepsy and seizures involve network interactions, they typically do not originate across the entire brain simultaneously. Seizures often begin in specific regions or even within specific populations of neurons within those regions. Therefore, a whole-brain approach, especially with Calcium imaging with inherited limitations, may not fully capture the localized nature of seizure initiation and propagation, potentially limiting the understanding of Galanin's role in epilepsy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Galanin's effects may vary across different brain areas, likely influenced by the predominant receptor types expressed in those regions. Additionally, the use of PTZ as a &quot;stressor&quot; is questionable since PTZ induces seizures rather than conventional stress. Referring to seizures induced by PTZ as &quot;stress&quot; might be a misinterpretation intended to fit the proposed model of stress regulation by receptors other than Galanin receptor 1 (GalR1).</p>
<p>The description of the EAAT2 mutants is missing crucial details. EAAT2 plays a significant role in the uptake of glutamate from the synaptic cleft, thereby regulating excitatory neurotransmission and preventing excitotoxicity. Authors suggest that in EAAT2 knockout (KO) mice galanin expression is upregulated 15-fold compared to wild-type (WT) mice, which could be interpreted as galanin playing a role in the hypoactivity observed in these animals.</p>
<p>However, the study does not explore the misregulation of other genes that could be contributing to the observed phenotype. For instance, if AMPA receptors are significantly downregulated, or if there are alterations in other genes critical for brain activity, these changes could be more important than the upregulation of galanin. The lack of wider gene expression analysis leaves open the possibility that the observed hypoactivity could be due to factors other than, or in addition to, galanin upregulation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the observation that in double KO mice for both EAAT2 and galanin, there was little difference in seizure susceptibility compared to EAAT2 KO mice alone further supports the idea that galanin upregulation might not be the reason for the observed phenotype. This indicates that other regulatory mechanisms or gene expressions might be playing a more pivotal role in the manifestation of hypoactivity in EAAT2 mutants.</p>
<p>These methodological shortcomings and conceptual inconsistencies undermine the perceived strengths of the study, and hinders understanding of Galanin's role in epilepsy and stress regulation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study is an investigation of galanin and galanin receptor signaling on whole-brain activity in the context of recurrent seizure activity or under homeostatic basal conditions. The authors primarily use calcium imaging to observe whole-brain neuronal activity accompanied by galanin qPCR to determine how manipulations of galanin or the galr1a receptor affect the activity of the whole-brain under non-ictal or seizure event conditions. The authors' Eaat2a-/- model (introduced in their Glia 2022 paper, PMID 34716961) that shows recurrent seizure activity alongside suppression of neuronal activity and locomotion in the time periods lacking seizures is used in this paper in comparison to the well-known pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) pharmacological model of epilepsy in zebrafish. Given the literature cited in their Introduction, the authors reasonably hypothesize that galanin will exert a net inhibitory effect on brain activity in models of epilepsy and at homeostatic baseline, but were surprised to find that this hypothesis was only moderately supported in their Eaat2a-/- model. In contrast, under PTZ challenge, fish with galanin overexpression showed increased seizure number and reduced duration while fish with galanin KO showed reduced seizure number and increased duration. These results would have been greatly enriched by the inclusion of behavioral analyses of seizure activity and locomotion (similar to the authors' 2022 Glia paper and/or PMIDs 15730879, 24002024). In addition, the authors have not accounted for sex as a biological variable, though they did note that sex sorting zebrafish larvae precludes sex selection at the younger ages used. It would be helpful to include smaller experiments taken from pilot experiments in older, sex-balanced groups of the relevant zebrafish to increase confidence in the findings' robustness across sexes. A possible major caveat is that all of the various genetic manipulations are non-conditional as performed, meaning that developmental impacts of galanin overexpression or galanin or galr1a knockout on the observed results have not been controlled for and may have had a confounding influence on the authors' findings. Overall, this study is important and solid (yet limited), and carries clear value for understanding the multifaceted functions that neuronal galanin can have under homeostatic and disease conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The authors convincingly show that galanin is upregulated across multiple contexts that feature seizure activity or hyperexcitability in zebrafish, and appears to reduce neuronal activity overall, with key identified exceptions (PTZ model).</p>
<p>- The authors use both genetic and pharmacological models to answer their question, and through this diverse approach, find serendipitous results that suggest novel underexplored functions of galanin and its receptors in basal and disease conditions. Their question is well-informed by the cited literature, though the authors should cite and consider their findings in the context of Mazarati et al., 1998 (PMID:982276). The authors' Discussion places their findings in context, allowing for multiple interpretations and suggesting some convincing explanations.</p>
<p>- Sample sizes are robust and the methods used are well-characterized, with a few exceptions (as the paper is currently written).</p>
<p>- Use of a glutamatergic signaling-based genetic model of epilepsy (Eaat2a-/-) is likely the most appropriate selection to test how galanin signaling can alter seizure activity, as galanin is known to reduce glutamatergic release as an inhibitory mechanism in rodent hippocampal neurons via GalR1a (alongside GIRK activation effects). Given that PTZ instead acts through GABAergic signaling pathways, it is reasonable and useful to note that their glutamate-based genetic model showed different effects than did their GABAergic-based model of seizure activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The authors do not include behavioral assessments of seizure or locomotor activity that would be expected in this paper given their characterizations of their Eaat2a-/- model in the Glia 2022 paper that showed these behavioral data for this zebrafish model. These data would inform the reader of the behavioral phenotypes to expect under the various conditions and would likely further support the authors' findings if obtained and reported.</p>
<p>- No assessment of sex as a biological variable is included, though it is understood that these specific studied ages of the larvae may preclude sex sorting for experimental balancing as stated by the authors.</p>
<p>- The reported results may have been influenced by the loss or overexpression of galanin or loss of galr1a during developmental stages. The authors did attempt to use the hsp70l system to overexpress galanin, but noted that the heat shock induction step led to reduced brain activity on its own (Supplementary Figure 1). Their hsp70l:gal model shows galanin overexpression anyways (8x fold) regardless of heat induction, so this model is still useful as a way to overexpress galanin, but it should be noted that this galanin overexpression is not restricted to post-developmental timepoints and is present during development.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The neuropeptide galanin is primarily expressed in the hypothalamus and has been shown to play critical roles in homeostatic functions such as arousal, sleep, stress, and brain disorders such as epilepsy. Previous work in rodents using galanin analogs and receptor-specific knockout has provided convincing evidence for the anti-convulsant effects of galanin.</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors sought to determine the relationship between galanin expression and whole-brain activity. The authors took advantage of the transparent nature of larval zebrafish to perform whole-brain neural activity measurements via widefield calcium imaging. Two models of seizures were used (eaat2a-/- and pentylenetetrazol; PTZ). In the eaat2a-/- model, spontaneous seizures occur and the authors found that galanin transcript levels were significantly increased and associated with a reduced frequency of calcium events. Similarly, two hours after PTZ galanin transcript levels roughly doubled and the frequency and amplitude of calcium events were reduced. The authors also used a heat shock protein line (hsp70I:gal) where galanin transcript levels are induced by activation of heat shock protein, but this line also shows higher basal transcript levels of galanin. Again, the higher level of galanin in hsp70I:gal larval zebrafish resulted in a reduction of calcium events and a reduction in the amplitude of events. In contrast, galanin knockout (gal-/-) increased calcium activity, indicated by an increased number of calcium events, but a reduction in amplitude and duration. Knockout of the galanin receptor subtype galr1a via crispants also increased the frequency of calcium events.</p>
<p>In subsequent experiments in eaat2a-/- mutants were crossed with hsp70I:gal or gal-/- to increase or decrease galanin expression, respectively. These experiments showed modest effects, with eaat2a-/- x gal-/- knockouts showing an increased normalized area under the curve and seizure amplitude.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors attempted to study the relationship between galanin and brain activity during a PTZ challenge. The hsp70I:gal larva showed an increased number of seizures and reduced seizure duration during PTZ. In contrast, gal-/- mutants showed an increased normalized area under the curve and a stark reduction in the number of detected seizures, a reduction in seizure amplitude, but an increase in seizure duration. The authors then ruled out the role of Galr1a in modulating this effect during PTZ, since the number of seizures was unaffected, whereas the amplitude and duration of seizures were increased.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The gain- and loss-of function galanin manipulations provided convincing evidence that galanin influences brain activity (via calcium imaging) during interictal and/or seizure-free periods. In particular, the relationship between galanin transcript levels and brain activity in Figures 1 &amp; 2 was convincing.</p>
<p>(2) The authors use two models of epilepsy (eaat2a-/- and PTZ).</p>
<p>(3) Focus on the galanin receptor subtype galr1a provided good evidence for the important role of this receptor in controlling brain activity during interictal and/or seizure-free periods.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Although the relationship between galanin and brain activity during interictal or seizure-free periods was clear, the manuscript currently lacks mechanistic insight in the role of galanin during seizure-like activity induced by PTZ.</p>
<p>(2) Calcium imaging is the primary data for the paper, but there are no representative time-series images or movies of GCaMP signal in the various mutants used.</p>
<p>(3) For Figure 3, the authors suggest that hsp70I:gal x eaat2a-/-mutants would further increase galanin transcript levels, which were hypothesized to further reduce brain activity. However, the authors failed to measure galanin transcript levels in this cross to show that galanin is actually increased more than the eaat2a-/- mutant or the hsp70I:gal mutant alone.</p>
<p>(4) Similarly, transcript levels of galanin are not provided in Figure 2 for Gal-/- mutants and galr1a KOs. Transcript levels would help validate the knockout and any potential compensatory effects of subtype-specific knockout.</p>
<p>(5) The authors very heavily rely on calcium imaging of different mutant lines. Additional methods could strengthen the data, translational relevance, and interpretation (e.g., acute pharmacology using galanin agonists or antagonists, brain or cell recordings, biochemistry, etc).</p>

<p>- The authors use both genetic and pharmacological models to answer their question, and through this diverse approach, find serendipitous results that suggest novel underexplored functions of galanin and its receptors in basal and disease conditions. Their question is well-informed by the cited literature, though the authors should cite and consider their findings in the context of Mazarati et al., 1998 (PMID:982276). The authors' Discussion places their findings in context, allowing for multiple interpretations and suggesting some convincing explanations.</p>
<p>- Sample sizes are robust and the methods used are well-characterized, with a few exceptions (as the paper is currently written).</p>
<p>- Use of a glutamatergic signaling-based genetic model of epilepsy (Eaat2a-/-) is likely the most appropriate selection to test how galanin signaling can alter seizure activity, as galanin is known to reduce glutamatergic release as an inhibitory mechanism in rodent hippocampal neurons via GalR1a (alongside GIRK activation effects). Given that PTZ instead acts through GABAergic signaling pathways, it is reasonable and useful to note that their glutamate-based genetic model showed different effects than did their GABAergic-based model of seizure activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The authors do not include behavioral assessments of seizure or locomotor activity that would be expected in this paper given their characterizations of their Eaat2a-/- model in the Glia 2022 paper that showed these behavioral data for this zebrafish model. These data would inform the reader of the behavioral phenotypes to expect under the various conditions and would likely further support the authors' findings if obtained and reported.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a thorough behavioral assessment would have strengthened the study, but we deemed it outside of the scope of this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- No assessment of sex as a biological variable is included, though it is understood that these specific studied ages of the larvae may preclude sex sorting for experimental balancing as stated by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The study was done on larval zebrafish (5 days post fertilization). The first signs of sexual differentiation become apparent at about 17 days post fertilization (reviewed in Ye and Chen, 2020). Hence sex is no biological variable at the stage studied.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The reported results may have been influenced by the loss or overexpression of galanin or loss of galr1a during developmental stages. The authors did attempt to use the hsp70l system to overexpress galanin, but noted that the heat shock induction step led to reduced brain activity on its own (Supplementary Figure 1). Their hsp70l:gal model shows galanin overexpression anyways (8x fold) regardless of heat induction, so this model is still useful as a way to overexpress galanin, but it should be noted that this galanin overexpression is not restricted to post-developmental timepoints and is present during development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The developmental perspective is an important point to consider. Due to the rapid development of the zebrafish it is not trivial to untangle this. In the zebrafish we first observe epileptic seizures as early as 3 days post fertilization (dpf), where the brain is clearly not well developed yet (e.g. behavioral response to light are still minimal). Even the 5 dpf stage, where most of our experiments have been conducted, cannot by far not be considered post-development.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The neuropeptide galanin is primarily expressed in the hypothalamus and has been shown to play critical roles in homeostatic functions such as arousal, sleep, stress, and brain disorders such as epilepsy. Previous work in rodents using galanin analogs and receptor-specific knockout has provided convincing evidence for the anti-convulsant effects of galanin.</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors sought to determine the relationship between galanin expression and whole-brain activity. The authors took advantage of the transparent nature of larval zebrafish to perform whole-brain neural activity measurements via widefield calcium imaging. Two models of seizures were used (eaat2a-/- and pentylenetetrazol; PTZ). In the eaat2a-/- model, spontaneous seizures occur and the authors found that galanin transcript levels were significantly increased and associated with a reduced frequency of calcium events. Similarly, two hours after PTZ galanin transcript levels roughly doubled and the frequency and amplitude of calcium events were reduced. The authors also used a heat shock protein line (hsp70I:gal) where galanin transcript levels are induced by activation of heat shock protein, but this line also shows higher basal transcript levels of galanin. Again, the higher level of galanin in hsp70I:gal larval zebrafish resulted in a reduction of calcium events and a reduction in the amplitude of events. In contrast, galanin knockout (gal-/-) increased calcium activity, indicated by an increased number of calcium events, but a reduction in amplitude and duration. Knockout of the galanin receptor subtype galr1a via crispants also increased the frequency of calcium events.</p>
<p>In subsequent experiments in eaat2a-/- mutants were crossed with hsp70I:gal or gal-/- to increase or decrease galanin expression, respectively. These experiments showed modest effects, with eaat2a-/- x gal-/- knockouts showing an increased normalized area under the curve and seizure amplitude.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors attempted to study the relationship between galanin and brain activity during a PTZ challenge. The hsp70I:gal larva showed an increased number of seizures and reduced seizure duration during PTZ. In contrast, gal-/- mutants showed an increased normalized area under the curve and a stark reduction in the number of detected seizures, a reduction in seizure amplitude, but an increase in seizure duration. The authors then ruled out the role of Galr1a in modulating this effect during PTZ, since the number of seizures was unaffected, whereas the amplitude and duration of seizures were increased.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The gain- and loss-of function galanin manipulations provided convincing evidence that galanin influences brain activity (via calcium imaging) during interictal and/or seizure-free periods. In particular, the relationship between galanin transcript levels and brain activity in Figures 1 &amp; 2 was convincing.</p>
<p>(2) The authors use two models of epilepsy (eaat2a-/- and PTZ).</p>
<p>(3) Focus on the galanin receptor subtype galr1a provided good evidence for the important role of this receptor in controlling brain activity during interictal and/or seizure-free periods.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Although the relationship between galanin and brain activity during interictal or seizure-free periods was clear, the manuscript currently lacks mechanistic insight in the role of galanin during seizure-like activity induced by PTZ.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We completely agree and concede that this study constitutes only a first attempt to understand the (at least for us) perplexing complexity of galanin function on the brain.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Calcium imaging is the primary data for the paper, but there are no representative time-series images or movies of GCaMP signal in the various mutants used.</p>
<p>We are in the process of preparing some time series images and will include them in the next revision.</p>
<p>(3) For Figure 3, the authors suggest that hsp70I:gal x eaat2a-/-mutants would further increase galanin transcript levels, which were hypothesized to further reduce brain activity. However, the authors failed to measure galanin transcript levels in this cross to show that galanin is actually increased more than the eaat2a-/- mutant or the hsp70I:gal mutant alone.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent suggestion. We will perform the necessary qPCR experiments and will include the data in the next revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Similarly, transcript levels of galanin are not provided in Figure 2 for Gal-/- mutants and galr1a KOs. Transcript levels would help validate the knockout and any potential compensatory effects of subtype-specific knockout.</p>
<p>(5) The authors very heavily rely on calcium imaging of different mutant lines. Additional methods could strengthen the data, translational relevance, and interpretation (e.g., acute pharmacology using galanin agonists or antagonists, brain or cell recordings, biochemistry, etc).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Again, we agree and concede that a number of additional approaches are needed to get more insight into the complex role of galanin in regulation overall brain activity. These include, among others, also behavioral, multiple single cell recordings and pharmacological interventions.</p>
