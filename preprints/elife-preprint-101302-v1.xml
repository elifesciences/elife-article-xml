<title>Abstract</title><p>Mental and behavioral disorders are associated with extended period of hot weather as found in heatwaves, but the underlying neural circuit mechanism is poorly known. The posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) is a hub for emotional processing and receives inputs from the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA), the well-recognized thermoregulation center. The present study was designed to explore whether chronic heat exposure leads to aberrant activities in POA recipient pPVT neurons and subsequent changes in emotional states. By devising an air heating paradigm mimicking the condition of heatwaves and utilizing emotion-related behavioral tests, viral track tracing, <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium recordings, optogenetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings, we found that chronic heat exposure for 3 weeks led to negative emotional and hyperarousal states in mice. The pPVT neurons receive monosynaptic excitatory and inhibitory innervations from the POA. These neurons exhibited a persistent increase in neural activity following chronic heat exposure, which was essential for chronic heat-induced emotional changes. Notably, these neurons were also prone to display stronger neuronal activities associated with anxiety responses to stressful situations. Furthermore, we observed saturated neuroplasticity in the POA-pPVT excitatory pathway after chronic heat exposure that occluded further potentiation. Taken together, long-term aberration in the POA to pPVT pathway offers a neurobiological mechanism of emotional and behavioral changes seen in extended period of hot weather like heatwaves.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Against a backdrop of global warming, heatwaves that are characterized by abnormally hot weather for extended periods have become more frequent and intense. This is highlighted by that the July 2023 was the hottest month ever recorded by human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tollefson, 2023</xref>). Previous studies have established a correlation between heatwaves and impaired physical health leading to increased mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barriopedro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Garcia-Herrera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Robine et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, elevated temperatures could impact mental health by triggering feelings of anger, stress, aggression, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Beecher et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, epidemiological research conducted across various regions extensively demonstrated a positive association between chronic heat exposure and higher hospital admissions for mental and behavioral disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Amr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Basu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dominiak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mulder et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Trang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Whitney et al., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, our understanding of how the brain regulates emotional changes following prolonged heat exposure remains limited.</p>
<p>Current understanding about heat-induced emotional changes mainly focuses on the impact of heat stress on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which leads to abnormal plasma concentrations of the hormone cortisol and neurotransmitters such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), noradrenaline and adrenaline, all of which play a significant role in emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">McMorris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). However, the relationship between chronic heat exposure and emotional changes is likely to be more complex. Multifaceted factors, such as the levels of physiological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sampath et al., 2023</xref>), changes of neuroendocrine system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Podstawski et al., 2021</xref>), sleep disturbances (Altena et al., 2022), adaptation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Oppermann et al., 2021</xref>), even the age and individual health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kenny et al., 2010</xref>; Malmquist et al., 2022), could interact in a various way to directly and indirectly contribute to emotional changes in response to chronic heat exposure. Thus, gaining insights into the mechanisms behind emotional changes caused by chronic heat exposure is crucial for a more comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological foundations of emotional regulation.</p>
<p>Emerging evidence has suggested that the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) serves as an important integrative node that detects aversive sensory and homeostatic challenges and regulates emotional responses and adaptive behaviors. As such, PVT neurons receive inputs from diverse nuclei in the hypothalamus, midbrain, and hindbrain, and has been implicated in a variety of behavioral responses including arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ren et al., 2018</xref>), pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jurik et al., 2015</xref>), anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Heilbronner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Spencer et al., 2004</xref>), fear and fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Do-Monte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Penzo et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, PVT is now considered as an essential component of the emotional processing system in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Penzo et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the various inputs from different brain regions to the PVT, the hypothalamus preoptic area (POA) is a well-known thermoregulatory center of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Anatomically, the posterior PVT (pPVT) has been reported to receive projections from POA warm-sensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we hypothesize that the direct projection from POA to pPVT contributes to chronic heat-induced emotional disturbances. Based on the murine model, we dissected the synaptic connection from POA to pPVT, tracked its activities and interrogated its involvement in behavioral responses of the animals under acute and chronic heat exposure paradigms. Our results uncovered long-term aberration in the activity of this pathway and pPVT neurons mediating chronic heat-induced changes in emotional and hyperarousal states, providing a neurobiological basis of how chronic heat affects mental states.</p>

<title>Chronic heat produces negative emotional and hyperarousal states but not depression-like behaviors in mice</title>
<p>c57BL/6 mice were exposed to chronic heat by putting them into a pre-heated (38 ± 2℃) chamber daily for 21 days with free access of food and water (details in Materials and Methods). In our preliminary experiments, various durations of daily heat exposure were tested. We settled to 90 minutes due to its robustness in inducing emotional state-related behavioral changes without causing collapse of the animals. Throughout the entire process of chronic heat exposure, we monitored the physiological states of mice daily. The chronic treatment did not induce abnormal changes in body temperature (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A and B), but affected normal gain in body weight (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C and D) and reduced food consumption (Figure 1-figure supplement 1E and F), compared with control mice. On the other hand, mice subjected to chronic heat displayed a higher prevalence of negative emotional behaviors in various behavioral tests. Specifically, in the elevated plus maze test, chronic heat-exposed mice spent less time in the open arms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and C</xref>), indicating increased stress levels. Moreover, in the three-chamber test, these mice displayed reduced interests in exploring the unfamiliar male mouse compared to the inanimate object (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and E</xref>), suggesting decreased sociability. Similarly, during the female encounter test, these mice performed less engagement with the unfamiliar female mouse compared with the unfamiliar male mouse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F and G</xref>), indicating decreased innate motivation. Interestingly, the chronic heat-exposed mice displayed decreased latencies for the first attack but increased attack durations in the resident-intruder test (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H and I</xref>), indicating elevated aggression levels.</p>

</fig>
<p>We also observed that after chronic heat exposure, the mice displayed heightened alertness, suggesting a state of hyperarousal. To confirm this, we quantified the acoustic startle response of the animals by digital video capture of their rapid movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pantoni et al., 2020</xref>). Chronic heat-exposed mice displayed amplified acoustic startle response characterized by increased body fluctuations within 200 ms of the delivery of a 105 dB sound stimulus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J-M</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-video supplement 1). However, these mice did not exhibit clear hyper-locomotion during the three-chamber test, the female encounter test, or the open field test (Figure 1-figure supplement 1G-I). Collectively, our data demonstrate that chronic heat exposure triggers increased negative emotional states as well as increased arousal in mice.</p>
<p>The fact that the observed changes in emotional and arousal states are the results of long-term rather than short-term heat exposure is supported by the lack of effect following one-time acute heat exposure for 90 mins (Figure 1-figure supplement 2). Furthermore, we did not observe signs of depression in chronic heat-exposed mice, as there were no significant increases in immobile time during forced swimming (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N</xref>) and the tail suspension tests (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1O</xref>), no obvious decrease in sucrose intake (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1P</xref>), and no sign of decreased exploration as there was no change in the time spent by these animals in the center zone of the open field (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Q</xref>).</p>

<title>Involvement of the hypothalamic preoptic area to posterior paraventricular thalamus projection</title>
<p>To explore the involvement of POA and pPVT in chronic heat exposure induced behavioral changes, we first studied the effect of heat treatment <italic>per se</italic> on their activities via c-Fos staining. We found that acute heat treatment (for 90 mins) significantly increased c-Fos expressions of POA and pPVT neurons (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A-C), supporting not only the notion that the POA serves as a thermoregulation center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Morrison et al., 2011</xref>) but also the recruitment of pPVT following heat treatment. Next, to dissect the anatomical relationship between POA and pPVT especially in the context of heat exposure, we injected viruses (AAV1-hSyn-cre, AAV-FLEX-TVA-mCherry, AAV-FLEX-RG and subsequently SAD△G (EnvA) virus) of a monosynaptic retrograde tracing rabies virus system (details in Materials and Methods) into pPVT, which resulted in clear expression of retrogradely-labeled neurons within POA, its upstream area (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>). Moreover, a significant overlap (84 ± 5%, 3 mice) was observed between the retrogradely-labeled and c-Fos expressed neurons in POA following heat exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, almost all the POA recipient pPVT neurons identified by a Cre-dependent anterograde labelling strategy ((97 ± 3%, 3 mice)) were strongly activated by heat exposure (Figure 2-figure supplement 2). Together, our results indicate that most of the pPVT-projecting POA neurons were neurons that respond to heat treatment which would then recruit their downstream neurons in pPVT by exerting a net excitatory influence.</p>

<p>To functionally characterize the synaptic connection between POA and pPVT, we administered AAV9-hSyn-ChR2-mCherry into the POA for optogenetic manipulation of its neurons and their terminals in pPVT. By patch-clamp recordings in brain slices prepared from these animals, we first confirmed robust firing of ChR2-mCherry-expressing neurons in POA upon light stimulation at various frequencies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). When we applied 473 nm light stimulation to POA terminals in pPVT, in some neurons, a clear inhibitory outward postsynaptic current was recorded in pPVT neurons held at +10 mV, which was sensitive to picrotoxin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). In some other neurons, an inward excitatory postsynaptic current sensitive to CNQX was recorded when the neurons were held at −70 mV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Quantification of the presence of these light-evoked postsynaptic currents revealed the presence of both excitatory and inhibitory currents in 34.9% of neurons recorded, only inhibitory currents in 52.4% of neurons and only excitatory currents in 12.7% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Since these currents could be completely blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) but restored with the addition of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), it indicated the monosynaptic connection, (an example shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I-K</xref>). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that heat responsive POA neurons project directly to pPVT via both excitatory and inhibitory innervations.</p>

<title>Activity changes of POA recipient pPVT neurons throughout chronic heat exposure</title>
<p>We speculated that repeated activation of POA recipient pPVT neurons underlie the emotional state changes observed following chronic heat exposure. To gain support for this hypothesis, we first monitored the activity changes of these neurons during the course of chronic heat exposure by <italic>in vivo</italic> fibre photometry of calcium signals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref>). We injected AAV1-hSyn-Cre-EGFP into POA and Cre-dependent AAV9-hSyn-Flex-jGCaMP8F into pPVT and implanted optical fibers into pPVT neurons after enough expression of GCaMP. The fibre photometry recordings revealed fluctuations in signals composed of spontaneous events (details in Materials and Methods) superimposed on the baseline. The detected spontaneous calcium events presumably represent brief trains or bursts of neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ali et al., 2020</xref>). We first confirmed that the signals were stable for extended period (at least 21 days) in a group of mice not undergoing any treatment (Figure 3-figure supplement 1). As illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, prior to subjecting the mice to chronic heat exposure, we recorded the neuronal activities of POA recipient pPVT neurons for each mouse as the pre-heat control. We then recorded the calcium events one day after acute heat exposure on day 1 and after chronic heat exposure on day 21. Interestingly, when compared with the pre-heat condition of day 1, both the frequency and amplitude during heat exposure on day 1 and day 21 were significantly increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D and F</xref>). However, such increases in calcium events disappeared on the day following heat exposure on day 1 indicating its transient nature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, after 21 days of heat exposure, such increases in the frequency of calcium events persisted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in both the frequency and amplitude of calcium events during heat exposure on day 1 and day 21 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on the increased neuronal activities of POA recipient pPVT neurons after chronic heat exposure, we investigated the impact of activating the pathway from the POA to pPVT on emotional states and arousal levels of mice (Fig. S6A). Utilizing the real-time place preference behavioral paradigm, we noticed that when the blue light was turned on, mice that had already gone through the habituation process quickly entered the chamber with the light turned off (Figure 3-supplement figure 2B and C). This finding suggests that the activation of the POA to pPVT circuit induces an aversive emotional valence. Notably, optogenetic activation did not affect the movement activity of the mice during the experiment (Figure 3-supplement figure 2D). On the other hand, as pupil size is widely recognized as the gold standard for reflecting arousal levels in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Privitera et al., 2020</xref>), we further studied the effect of optogenetic activation of POA excitatory terminals in pPVT in mice under head fixation. The photos (Figure 3-supplement figure 2E) and video (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-video supplement 1) clearly demonstrated the enlargement of both the pupil (Figure 3-supplement figure 2F and G) and eye sizes (Figure 3-supplement figure 2H and I) of the mice during light stimulation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that POA recipient pPVT neurons exhibited heightened activities after chronic heat exposure. Moreover, the activation of the POA to pPVT circuit is associated with negative emotional states and higher levels of arousal.</p>

<title>POA recipient pPVT neurons are sufficient and necessary for chronic heat exposure-induced negative emotional and hyperarousal states in mice</title>
<p>To confirm the direct relationship between repeated activation of POA recipient pPVT neurons and the negative emotional and hyperarousal states in mice, we conducted chronic activation of POA excitatory terminals within pPVT by injecting CaMKII-promotor encoded ChR2 into the POA and implanting an optical fiber in pPVT. We applied a chronic activation protocol, described by Sidor et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sidor et al., 2014</xref>), which involved a cycle of 2 minutes on and 2 minutes off, for a total of 20 minutes per day, over a period of up to 21 days. Following chronic optogenetic activation, we observed several behavioral changes in mice that were similar to those seen in mice exposed to chronic heat. Notably, in the elevated plus maze test, mice subjected to chronic optogenetic activation spent less time in the open arms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B and C</xref>), representing increased stress levels. In the three-chamber test, these mice displayed reduced interests in exploring the unfamiliar male mouse compared to an inanimate object (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D and E</xref>), suggesting decreased sociability. During the female encounter test, these mice engaged less with the unfamiliar female mouse compared with the unfamiliar male mouse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F and G</xref>), indicating decreased innate motivation. In the resident-intruder aggression test, the chronic heat-exposed mice exhibited both the decreased latencies in initiating the first attack and increased attack durations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H and I</xref>), suggesting elevated aggression levels. Additionally, compared to the control group, mice after chronic optogenetic activation exhibited more pronounced body fluctuations when captured by a high-resolution camera in response to a 105 dB sound stimulus, indicating the heightened arousal levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J-M</xref>). Our results directly demonstrated that chronic optogenetic activation of POA excitatory terminals within pPVT circuit could induce negative emotional and hyperarousal states in mice.</p>

<p>To establish the necessity of POA recipient pPVT neurons for chronic heat exposure-induced emotional changes, we optogenetically inhibited the POA recipient pPVT neurons during chronic heat exposure by employing a cycle stimulation strategy of 3 minutes ON followed by 3 minutes OFF. Only mice with sufficient virus infection and accurate fiber implantation were included in the data analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4O and P</xref>). The optogenetic inhibition prevented chronic heat-induced behavioral changes, including anxiety levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Q and R</xref>). sociability (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4S</xref>), innate motivation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4T</xref>), aggression levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4U and V</xref>) and arousal state (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4W and X</xref>).

<title>Chronically activated POA recipient pPVT neurons exhibit exaggerated response to stressful situations</title>
<p>To gain further insight into the roles of POA recipient pPVT neurons in stress-related behaviors, we elucidated the relationship of their activities with specific behaviors indicative of emotional transitions and hyperarousal states. In the elevated plus maze test in which the chronic heat-exposed mice spent less time in the open arms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and C</xref>), there were also reduced number of entries into the open arms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). More detailed analysis revealed that, compared with untreated mice, these animals more frequently paused at the center of the maze and then returned to the closed arms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, mice after chronic heat exposure exhibited a higher chance of running, rather than walking, back to the closed arms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) and their running speeds significantly increased compared to their pre-heat condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), presumably reflecting a state of increased anxiety. Interestingly, POA recipient pPVT neurons consistently exhibited a peak in activity when they were about to run back to the closed arm, while chronic heat-exposed mice exhibited a significantly larger peak (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-H</xref>). Notably, no comparable increases of activities in the POA recipient pPVT neurons were observed when chronic heat-exposed mice paused at the center and finally walked out to the open arms (Figure 5-supplement figure 1A-C) or walked to the closed arms (Figure 5-supplement figure 1D-F). Similar phenomena were found with respect to the transitions from the open arm to the closed arm, not only in terms of number of transitions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I and J</xref>), walking and running behavior (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>), and speed of running (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref>), but also a larger calcium peak response aligned with the running behavior (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5M-O</xref>).</p>

<p>In the chronic heat-treated mice, we also observed a context-dependent change in behavior reminiscent of the hyperarousal states when we introduced them back into the heat chamber. The mice exhibited apparent locomotion hyperactivity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5P</xref>), as evidenced by a notable increase in motion speeds exceeding 400 mm/s (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Q</xref>) and a higher frequency of fast running (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5S</xref>). A clear time correlation was found between the heightened calcium activities in POA recipient pPVT neurons and the main component of locomotion hyperactivity, namely fast running under this condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5T</xref>-V). In contrast, when being placed into a different chamber not associated with heat exposure, no obvious changes were observed among these chronic heat-exposed mice in their total distance traveled (Figure 5-supplement figure 1G), motion speed (Figure 5-supplement figure 1H), number of running exceeding 400 mm/s (Figure 5-supplement figure 1I), the frequency of fast running (Figure 5-supplement figure 1J), or the neuronal activities (Figure 5-supplement figure 1K-M). Collectively, our data suggest the heightened or exaggerated activities of POA recipient pPVT neurons after chronic heat exposure could serve as a driving force for behaviors manifesting negative emotional and hyperarousal states in response to stressful conditions.</p>

<title>Increased pre- and post-synaptic excitability of pPVT neurons but saturated circuitry neuroplasticity capacity following chronic heat exposure</title>
<p>To explore the potential mechanisms underlying the heightened activities of POA recipient pPVT neurons after chronic heat exposure, we conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> slice recordings on pPVT neurons obtained from mice exposed to room temperature, acute heat, and chronic heat, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Both acute and chronic heat exposure significantly increased the amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in pPVT neurons but there was no difference in mIPSCs amplitude between the acute and chronic heat groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). On the other hand, we observed a significant increase in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) specially in pPVT neurons after chronic but not acute heat exposure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). These results suggest that while heat exposure could modulate both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs onto pPVT neurons, there was a differential increase in presynaptic excitability of the excitatory pathway after chronic heat exposure but an increase in postsynaptic response to inhibitory input. Furthermore, when we examined the excitability of pPVT neurons by injecting a sequence of inward currents up 100 pA to pPVT neurons, pPVT neurons from chronic heat-exposed mice exhibited significant increases in the number of action potentials from 30 to 70 pA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G and H</xref>).

<p>The increase in presynaptic excitability of the POA to pPVT excitatory pathway suggested plastic changes induced by the chronic heat treatment. While it would be difficult to follow the excitability of this pathway in vivo during the chronic heat treatment, we sought to examine the synaptic plasticity capacity of this pathway before and after chronic heat treatment to shed light on its involvement. We injected CaMKII-promotor encoded ChR2 into the POA of mice and divided them into two groups: a control group exposed to room temperature and a chronic heat group. After 21 days of heat exposure, sagittal slices that largely preserved the POA to pPVT pathway were prepared from both the control and chronic heat groups to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>). Local optogenetic stimulation vertically (470 nm) through the objective was applied to elicit light-evoked EPSCs in POA recipient pPVT neurons and baseline of 10 minutes was recorded. High frequency stimulation (HFS) is an effective induction protocol for eliciting LTP at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grover et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hwong et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, by delivering blue light at various frequencies (10, 30, 50, 70, 90 Hz) to activate the POA excitatory terminals within pPVT, we developed an optogenetic HFS protocol (HFS<sub>opto</sub>: light pulses at 30 Hz, repeated 3 times at 20 s interval) effective in eliciting potentiated EPSCs on POA recipient pPVT neurons after baseline recording. HFS<sub>opto</sub> protocol could successfully induce LTP at POA-pPVT synapses. The amplitude of light-evoked EPSCs in the control group following HFS<sub>opto</sub>, at the onset, showed an obvious increase and gradually became stable potentiation, lasting at least 30 min (150 % ± 18 of baseline, 14 neurons from 5 mice) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6K and L</xref>). However, when we applied the same protocol to the POA recipient pPVT neurons of mice after chronic heat exposure, typically no LTP could be induced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6K-M</xref>), suggesting that the pathway in these mice were already saturated during chronic heat exposure.</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings suggest enhanced excitatory inputs to pPVT neurons and increased membrane excitability of these neurons may underlie the behavioral changes observed in mice following chronic heat exposure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we aimed to uncover the neurobiological basis of how extended periods of high temperature such as heatwaves impact on emotional processing in the mammalian brain. We demonstrated that chronic heat exposure led to negative emotional and hyperarousal states in mice, but not depression-like behavior. We discovered that hypothalamic POA recipient pPVT neurons in the thalamus mediate such emotional state changes via increased baseline activities and excitability in response to stressful conditions. Presumably, this is attributed to that repeated activation of the POA to pPVT circuit modulates both pre- and post-synaptic processes leading to their long-term changes.</p>
<p>Different from utilizing heating panels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Venkatachalam et al., 2007</xref>) to investigate heat-induced thermoregulation, our study employed an air heating strategy. This choice was motivated by the aim to replicate the realistic conditions induced by heatwaves. To ensure the well-being of the animals and prevent unnecessary physiological harm, we maintained temperatures around 38°C, as temperatures exceeding 40℃ can lead to adverse effects on the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deuis et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings also revealed that the protocol of chronic heat exposure at 90 min per day for 21 days did not impact the thermoregulatory function in mice. In the various emotional state-related behavioral tests we conducted, including the open field, three-chamber, and female encounter test, we did not observe locomotion hyperactivity in mice. However, a distinct acoustic startle response was noted following chronic heat exposure. This may initially appear contradictory, as hyperarousal states are typically associated with hyperlocomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, POA recipient pPVT neurons exhibited heightened responses to stressful and aversive situations, which suggested that chronic heat exposure might primarily induce a state of increased susceptibility towards anxiety and hyperarousal rather than persistent hyperarousal states in mice.</p>
<p>There are a number of studies revealing the connections from the POA to pPVT. Some previous reports have already shown that both excitatory and inhibitory neurons within POA contribute to thermoregulatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Morrison et al., 2011</xref>). Augustine et al. on the other hand demonstrated that POA neurons expressing nNOS send both excitatory and inhibitory projections to PVT, with an emphasis on their roles in thirst regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, Allen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allen et al., 2017</xref>) previously described those thirst-related POA neurons sending projections to PVT mediated reinforcing behavior, highlighting their independence from POA heat-responsive neurons. The findings of the present study enriched our understanding on that heat-responsive neurons in the POA could send both excitatory and inhibitory projections to pPVT and uncovered the role of the POA recipient pPVT neurons in chronic heat exposure-induced emotional changes.</p>
<p>Notably, we observed that POA recipient pPVT neurons exhibited higher baseline activities and displayed heightened response to stress or aversive stimuli following chronic heat exposure. Interestingly, prior studies have reported that PVT neurons exhibited stronger activation when mice were subjected to novel stimuli after repeated restraint stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Vertes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bhatnagar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heydendael et al., 2011</xref>). This effectively supports our theory of heightened susceptibility to anxiety and our results provide a rationale for this widely observed phenomenon. Meanwhile, the specific neuronal signals correlated with actions indicative of heightened anxiety such as fast running to closed arms and fast running in chronic-heat exposed chamber were not induced by the motion <italic>per se</italic>. Our recording was conducted when mice were spontaneously behaving without any pre-set cues, excluding the influence of salient stimuli on the activity of POA recipient pPVT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Penzo et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the enhanced excitatory connections from POA to pPVT after chronic heat exposure, we observed an increased amplitude of inhibitory postsynaptic response after both acute and chronic heat exposure. Increased inhibition could act to compensate for the initial over-excitation at critical time, to ensure that neurons briefly activated by stress can be effectively and prevent the occurrence of the excessive stress-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Perica et al., 2023</xref>). pPVT neurons are anatomically innervated by strong inhibitory projections from different brian nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Penzo et al., 2021</xref>). Acute stress-mediated disinhibition of pPVT neurons, as reported by Beas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beas et al., 2018</xref>), can rapidly induce an anxiety-like state in mice. Other studies also showed that inhibition of activated neurons induced by stressful stimuli is effective to avoid abnormal affective behavioral performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cruz et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ghasemi et al., 2022</xref>). Our results showed that long-term optogenetic inhibition of POA recipient pPVT neurons during chronic heat exposure can effectively prevent changes of emotional and hyperarousal states in mice. Therefore, the increase in mIPSC amplitude observed under both acute and chronic heat conditions in this study suggests the potential presence of negative feedback regulation in response to the over-excitation. However, under chronic heat condition, further persistent significant increase in excitatory synaptic transmission may surpass this effect, leading to a final net activation in the pPVT neurons. However, the potential mechanisms by which increased excitatory synaptic transmission and enhanced postsynaptic inhibitory responses interact to achieve activation or inhibition of neurons themselves still require further study.</p>
<p>Current hypothesis regarding the mechanism of pPVT in mediating anxiety-like behavior primarily focused on the dopamine-mediated disinhibition of hypothalamic inhibitory terminals within pPVT during acute stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beas et al., 2018</xref>). Our study distinctly revealed that the enhanced excitatory inputs to pPVT and increased excitability following chronic heat exposure are responsible for the ensuing negative emotional and hyperarousal states. Interestingly, different from previous studies that reported a decrease in the amplitude of mIPSC in pPVT-expressing dopamine receptor 2 neurons 24 hours after acute restraint stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beas et al., 2018</xref>), our slice recording from pPVT neurons 24 hours after acute heat exposure exhibited an increase in mIPSCs amplitude. The reasons behind these differences could be attributed to the treatment applied and the specific neuronal types under investigation. Both the enhanced presynaptic excitability and increased intrinsic postsynaptic excitability following chronic heat exposure suggested the involvement of long-term neuroplasticity. The fact that LTP of the POA to pPVT pathway was no longer inducible after chronic heat exposure strongly suggests that this pathway was potentiated during the heat treatment, which account for the increased excitability of POA terminals to pPVT and their increased neuronal activities. Overall, both the enhanced excitatory inputs to pPVT and increased excitability may play an indispensable role in chronic heat exposure-induced emotional changes in mice.</p>
<p>There are certain limitations in the scope of the present study. First, our study was conducted solely on male mice. Further investigation is required to determine whether chronic heat exposure can elicit similar behavioral phenotypes in female mice. Also, the pPVT is known to express various peptide receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Curtis et al., 2021</xref>). However, the specific roles of these peptide receptors in chronic heat exposure-induced emotional changes remain unexplored. Some possible mechanisms may contribute to heightened activities of POA recipient pPVT neurons, such as the increased sensitization, the increased activity of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, the transition from chronic adaptation to pathological condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Herman, 2013</xref>), and even the chronic effect of dopamine-induced disinhibition of inhibitory terminals within pPVT, all of which required further investigations. Furthermore, POA and pPVT were both previously reported to be activated by stimuli other than heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Penzo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Additional studies are needed to explore the specificity of POA recipient pPVT neurons on chronic heat-induced emotional changes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings provide compelling evidence that the heightened activities of POA recipient pPVT neurons are critically involved in chronic heat-exposure-mediated negative emotional and hyperarousal states, and render mice to enter anxiety-like state more readily, as summarized in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6N</xref>. These results shed a new light on the mechanisms underlying heatwaves-induced emotional changes.</p>

<title>Protocols for chronic heat exposure</title>
<p>The temperature (38 ± 2℃) was adopted based on other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bridges et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cassuto, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cure, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jin et a., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rousset et al., 1984</xref>). A home-made chamber was constructed for chronic heat exposure (80 cm [L] × 40 cm [W] × 60 cm [H]) which was composed of two built-in components (heating system and an environmental monitoring sensor). For the heating system, a heater with (1) adjustable buttons that could control the heating power and (2) a “dual heating” setting that was able to stop heating when the temperature exceeded 40℃ in the chamber and restarted heating when the temperature in the chamber decreased to lower than 36℃. After the air temperature of the chamber was gradually heated to the targeted temperature ranges and was monitored to be stable for at least 30 minutes, mice would be gently put into the chamber for 90 minutes of heat exposure per day for 21 days. During heat exposure, mice were freely accessible to drinking water and consuming food. The time point within each daytime to start heat exposure was random. For the environmental monitoring sensor, it was used to monitor the chamber temperature value and humidity level (Peng He Dian Zi, Shanghai, China).</p>
<p>The method for measuring the body temperature of mice was based on a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kawakami et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, prior to exposing them to heat, the mice were gently held by their tails to expose their lower abdomen. An infrared thermometer sensor was positioned beneath the lower abdomen and the temperature was measured. This measurement process was repeated three times for each mouse, and the stable values obtained were then averaged to determine the specific mouse’s body temperature.</p>

<title>Acoustic startle response test</title>
<p>The acoustic startle response (ASR) test was conducted based on a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pantoni et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, a sound-proof box was purchased, in which a trumpet, a high-speed camera (200 frames per second, Plexon), and a box made from acrylic plate (10 cm [L] x 5 cm [W] x 25 cm [H]) were prepared. Mice exposed to sound at 105 dB measured by a decibel meter exhibited obvious startle response while 75 dB evoked no response. 105 dB was thus set as the sound decibel of pulse-only stimulation with 0.2 s duration, while 75 dB was set as pre-pulse stimulation with 0.2 s duration. Before the ASR test, mice were placed into an acrylic box for three days of environmental habituation and then for the test. Pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) test started with at least 20 min baseline to make the tested mice quiet and immobile, and then the habituation phase, which consisted of 10 pulses, each 20 s apart, and finally presented with a PPI phase, in which 20 trials: 5</p>
<p>pulse-only trials and 15 pre-pulse &amp; pulse trials were delivered. In the pre-pulse &amp; pulse trials, the pre-pulse was presented about 500 ms before the pulse stimulus. The mice’s startle response was captured by a high-speed camera and then analyzed with the machine learning method: DeepLabCut. The brief details were as follows: the mice’s body parts were manually labeled and labeled data were input into the google co-lab for the machine learning process until the learning error was lower than 0.5. The successful training data were exported as a .csv file. The startle amplitude of mice was calculated as the average value of all the labeled body parts’ vibration amplitude which was shown as a standard deviation within 200 ms after the sound was broadcasted. Each trial was manually checked, and startle response affected by the mice’s random moving would not be collected for further analysis. The startle response was visualized with custom MATLAB scripts.</p>

After 40 to 60 minutes of recovery, the brain slices were placed into a recording chamber with normal aCSF, pH 7.4, which contained (mM): NaCl 125, KCl 2.5, Glucose 11, NaHCO3 26, NaH2PO4 1.25, CaCl2 2, and MgCl2 2 for neuronal recording.</p>

<p>To record optically evoked postsynaptic currents, we used an internal solution containing (mM): K-gluconate 130, KCl 10, HEPES 10, EGTA 1, MgCl2 2, Na2-ATP 2, Na3-GTP 0.4. Light pulses at 470 nm were delivered through a light stimulator (Polygon400 DSI-E-0470-0590-NK1 Dynamic Spatial Illuminator) to activate POA ChR2-EGFP-expressing terminals while patched pPVT neurons were held at −70mV. The neuron with access resistance &lt;20 MΩ and leak current &lt;100 pA was included for data collection.</p>

<title>Measurements of synaptic activity and intrinsic properties</title>
<p>To measure the changes in synaptic transmission of pPVT neurons after chronic heat exposure and acute heat exposure, coronal mice’s brain slices were prepared as mentioned above. The internal solution for both miniature inhibitory (sIPSCs, held at +10 mV) and excitatory (sEPSCs, held at −70 mV) post synaptic currents recording was Cesium-gluconate based solution with pH 7.3-7.4 which contains (mM): CsMSF 130, HEPES 10, EGTA 1, MgCl2-6H2O 2, Na2ATP 2, NaGTP 0.4, QX-314-Cl 5, TEA-OH 5. And Tetrodotoxin (0.5 mM) was present for both miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) and miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) recording. Once completion of recording, brain slices were fixed overnight with 4% PFA and the correct position of recorded pPVT neurons was identified by staining with streptavidin-conjugated Alex 405 (ThermoFisher). For measuring the firing frequency under current clamp recording, steady state current was injected in +10 pA increments from 0 to 100 pA. All action potential properties and excitability recordings in Figure S8 were performed in the presence of 10 μM CNQX and 100 μM picrotoxin. As mentioned in the previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Knowland et al., 2017</xref>), the firing rate evoked by current injections and the half-width were calculated in Clampfit software (Molecular Devices) by using peak detection function and full-width at half max amplitude, respectively. The threshold was measured as the change in the voltage from rest at which the slope =20 V/s. Membrane resistance was calculated from the change in voltage elicited after a 50 ms 5 mV hyperpolarizing step from −70 mV (the last 10 ms of the step from baseline was taken as △V). Capacitance and membrane time constant were calculated by Clampfit during the first minute after breaking in to cell.</p>

<title>Long-term potentiation</title>
<p>To measure the zneuroplasticity of the POA to pPVT pathway, two batches of mice with enough expression of CaMKII-ChR2-mCherry within the POA were prepared: One serving as the control group and the other as the chronic heat group. Sagittal brain slices from the mice were prepared, and a low-chloride internal solution was used to record pPVT neurons. EPSCs evoked by focal optogenetic stimulation through the objective (approximately 2-3 mm above the surface of brain slice) in a top-down vertical direction were elicited using a Polygon400 Multiwavelength Dynamic Patterned Illuminator (Mightex). A circular area (roughly 500 μm diameter) covering the recorded cell soma was illuminated with brief pulses of blue light (470 nm, duration: 2 ms). LTP induced by optogenetic stimulation of pPVT neurons was elicited by HFS consisting of three episodes of 30 Hz blue light pulses at 20 s intervals.</p>
<p>All above signals were collected using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier controlled by Clampfi× 10.4 software via a Digital data 1550 interface (Molecular Devices). Electrical signals were filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and further analyzed using Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study aimed to identify how chronic heat exposure affects subsequent behavior and brain function. This work positively expands the field of thermoregulation. The data were collected using a myriad of next-generation approaches, including extensive behavior testing, thermal monitoring, electrophysiology, circuit mapping, and manipulations. As a result the strength of evidence is mostly <bold>solid</bold>, however a few weaknesses drove the some of the conclusions to be <bold>incompletely</bold> supported. These largely circle around the question of how unique these effects are to thermal stress (as opposed to other forms of stress), a lack of statistical analyses and rigor in some of the experiments and figures, and the specificity of the POA-pPVT pathway compared to other inputs to the PVT in the control of observed effects.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Cao et al. examines an important but understudied question of how chronic exposure to heat drives changes in affective and social behaviors. It has long been known that temperature can be a potent driver of behaviors and can lead to anxiety and aggression. However, the neural circuitry that mediates these changes is not known. Cao et al. take on this question by integrating optical tools of systems neuroscience to record and manipulate bulk activity in neural circuits, in combination with a creative battery of behavior assays. They demonstrate that chronic daily exposure to heat leads to changes in anxiety, locomotion, social approach, and aggression. They identify a circuit from the preoptic area (POA) to the posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) in mediating these behavior changes. The POA-PVT circuit increases activity during heat exposure. Further, manipulation of this circuit can drive affective and social behavioral phenotypes even in the absence of heat exposure. Moreover, silencing this circuit during heat exposure prevents the development of negative phenotypes. Overall the manuscript makes an important contribution to the understudied area of how ambient temperature shapes motivated behaviors.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The use of state-of-the-art systems neuroscience tools (in vivo optogenetics and fiber photometry, slice electrophysiology), chronic temperature-controlled experiments, and a rigorous battery of behavioral assays to determine affective phenotypes. The optogenetic gain of function of affective phenotypes in the absence of heat, and loss of function in the presence of heat are very convincing manipulation data. Overall a significant contribution to the circuit-level instantiation of temperature-induced changes in motivated behavior, and creative experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) There is no quantification of cFos/rabies overlap shown in Figure 2, and no report of whether the POA-PVT circuit has a higher percentage of Fos+ cells than the general POA population. Similarly, there is no quantification of cFos in POA recipient PVT cells for Figure 2 Supplement 2.</p>
<p>(2) The authors do not address whether stimulation of POA-PVT also increases core body temperature in Figure 3 or its relevant supplements. This seems like an important phenotype to make note of and could be addressed with a thermal camera or telemetry.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 3G: is Day 1 vs Day 22 &quot;pre-heat&quot; significant? The statistics are not shown, but this would be the most conclusive comparison to show that POA-PVT cells develop persistent activity after chronic heat exposure, which is one of the main claims the authors make in the text. This analysis is necessary in order to make the claim of persistent circuit activity after chronic heat exposure.</p>
<p>(4) In Figure 4, the control virus (AAV1-EYFP) is a different serotype and reporter than the ChR2 virus (AAV9-ChR2-mCherry). This discrepancy could lead to somewhat different baseline behaviors.</p>
<p>(5) In Figure 5G, N for the photometry data: the authors assess the maximum z-score as a measure of the strength of calcium response, however the area under the curve (AUC) is a more robust and useful readout than the maximum z score for this. Maximum z-score can simply identify brief peaks in amplitude, but the overall area under the curve seems quite similar, especially for Figure 5N.</p>
<p>(6) For Fig 5V: the authors run the statistics on behavior bouts pooled from many animals, but it is better to do this analysis as an animal average, not by compiling bouts. Compiling bouts over-inflates the power and can yield significant p values that would not exist if the analysis were carried out with each animal as an n of 1.</p>
<p>(7) In general this is an excellent analysis of circuit function but leaves out the question of whether there may be other inputs to pPVT that also mediate the same behavioral effect. Future experiments that use activity-dependent Fos-TRAP labeling in combination with rabies can identify other inputs to heat-sensitive pPVT cells, which may have convergent or divergent functions compared to the POA inputs.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The study by Cao et al. highlights an interesting and important aspect of heat- and thermal biology: the effect of repetitive, long-term heat exposure and its impact on brain function.</p>
<p>
Even though peripheral, sensory temperature sensors and afferent neuronal pathways conveying acute temperature information to the CNS have been well established, it is largely unknown how persistent, long-term temperature stimuli interact with and shape CNS function, and how these thermally-induced CNS alterations modulate efferent pathways to change physiology and behavior. This study is therefore not only novel but, given global warming, also timely.</p>
<p>The authors provide compelling evidence that neurons of the paraventricular thalamus change plastically over three weeks of episodic heat stimulation and they convincingly show that these changes affect behavioral outputs such as social interactions, and anxiety-related behaviors.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>(1) It is impressive that the assessed behaviors can be (i) recruited by optogenetic fiber activation and (ii) inhibited by optogenetic fiber inhibition when mice are exposed to heat. Technically, when/how long is the fiber inhibition performed? It says in the text &quot;3 min on and 3 min off&quot;. Is this only during the 20-minute heat stimulation or also at other times?</p>
<p>(2) It is interesting that the frequency of activity in pPVT neurons, as assessed by fiber photometry, stays increased after long-term heat exposure (day 22) when mice are back at normal room temperature. This appears similar to a previous study that found long-term heat exposure to transform POA neurons plastically to become tonically active (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.06.606929v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.06.606929v1</ext-link> ). Interestingly, the POA neurons that become tonically active by persistent heat exposure described in the above study are largely excitatory, and thus these could drive the activity of the pPVT neurons analyzed in this study.</p>
<p>(3) How can it be reconciled that the majority of the inputs from the POA are found to be largely inhibitory (Fig. 2H)? Is it possible that this result stems from the fact that non-selective POA-to-pPVT projections are labelled by the approach used in this study and not only those pathways activated by heat? These points would be nice to discuss.</p>
<p>(4) It is very interesting that no LTP can be induced after chronic heat exposure (Figures K-M); the authors suggest that &quot;the pathway in these mice were already saturated&quot; (line 375). Could this hypothesis be tested in slices by employing a protocol to extinguish pre-existing (chronic heat exposure-induced) LTP? This would provide further strength to the findings/suggestion that an important synaptic plasticity mechanism is at play that conveys behavioral changes upon chronic heat stimulation.</p>
<p>(5) It is interesting that long-term heat does not increase parameters associated with depression (Figure 1N-Q), how is it with acute heat stress, are those depression parameters increased acutely? It would be interesting to learn if &quot;depression indicators&quot; increase acutely but then adapt (as a consequence of heat acclimation) or if they are not changed at all and are also low during acute heat exposure.</p>
<p>Weaknesses/suggestions for improvements</p>
<p>(1) The introduction and general tenet of the study is, to us, a bit too one-sided/biased: generally, repetitive heat exposure --heat acclimation-- paradigms are known to not only be detrimental to animals and humans but also convey beneficial effects in allowing the animals and humans to gain heat tolerance (by strengthening the cardiovascular system, reducing energy metabolism and weight, etc.).</p>
<p>(2) The point is well taken that these authors here want to correlate their model (90 minutes of heat exposure per day) to heat waves. Nevertheless, and to more fully appreciate the entire biology of repetitive/chronic/persistent heat exposure (heat acclimation), it would be helpful to the general readership if the authors would also include these other aspects in their introduction (and/or discussion) and compare their 90-minute heat exposure paradigm to other heat acclimation paradigms. For example, many past studies (using mice or rats) have used more subtle temperatures but permanently (and not only for 90 minutes) stimulated them over several days and weeks (for example see PMID: 35413138). This can have several beneficial effects related to cardiovascular fitness, energy metabolism, and other aspects. In this regard: 38{degree sign}C used in this study is a very high temperature for mice, in particular when they are placed there without acclimating slowly to this temperature but are directly placed there from normal ambient temperatures (22{degree sign}C-24{degree sign}C) which is cold/coolish for mice. Since the accuracy of temperature measurement is given as +/- 2{degree sign}C, it could also be 40{degree sign}C -- this temperature, 40{degree sign}C, non-heat acclimated C57bl/6 mice will not survive for long.</p>
<p>The authors could consider discussing that this very strong, short episodic heat-stress model used here in this study may emphasize detrimental effects of heat, while more subtle long-term persistent exposure may be able to make animals adapt to heat, become more tolerant, and perhaps even prevent the detrimental cognitive effects observed in this study (which would be interesting to assess in a follow-up study).</p>
<p>(3) Line 140: It would help to be clear in the text that the behaviors are measured 1 day after the acute heat exposure - this is mentioned in the legend to the figure, but we believe it is important to stress this point also in the text. Similarly, this is also relevant for chronic heat stimulation: it needs to be made very clear that the behavior is measured 1 day after the last heat stimulus. If the behaviors had been measured during the heat stimulus, the results would likely be very different.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 2 D and Figure 2- Figure Supplement 1: since there is quite some baseline cFos activity in the pPVT region we believe it is important to include some control (room temperature) mice with anterograde labelling; in our view, it is difficult/not possible to conclude, based on Fig 2 supplement 2C, that nearly 100% of the cfos positive cells are contacted by POA fibre terminals (line 168). By eye there are several green cells that don't have any red label on (or next to) them; additionally, even if there is a little bit of red signal next to a green cell: this is not definitive proof that this is a synaptic contact. It is therefore advisable to revisit the quantification and also revisit the interpretation/wording about synaptic contacts.</p>
<p>In relation to the above: Figure 2h suggests that all neurons are connected (the majority receiving inhibitory inputs), is this really the case, is there not a single neuron out of the 63 recorded pPVT neurons that does not receive direct synaptic input from the POA?</p>
<p>(5) It would be nice to characterize the POA population that connects to the pPVT, it is possible/likely that not only warm-responsive POA neurons connect to that region but also others. The current POA-to-pPVT optogenetic fibre stimulations (Figure 4) are not selective for preoptic warm responsive neurons; since the POA subserves many different functions, this optogenetic strategy will likely activate other pathways. The referees acknowledge that molecular analysis of the POA population would be a major undertaking. Instead, this could be acknowledged in the discussion, for example in a section like &quot;limitation of this study&quot;.</p>
<p>(6) Figure 3a the strategy to express Gcamp in a Cre-dependent manner: it seems that the Gcamp8f signal would be polluted by EGFP (coming from the Cre virus injected into the POA): The excitation peak for both is close to 490nm and emission spectra/peaks of GCaMP8f (510-520 nm) and EGFP (507-510 nm) are also highly overlapping. We presume that the high background (EGFP) fluorescence signal would preclude sensitive calcium detection via Gcamp8f, how did the authors tackle this problem?</p>
<p>(7) How did the authors perform the social interaction test (Figures 1F, G)? Was the intruder mouse male or female? If it was a male mouse would the interaction with the female mouse be a form of mating behavior? If so, the interpretation of the results (Figures 1F, G) could be &quot;episodic heat exposure over the course of 3 weeks reduces mating behavior&quot;.</p>

<p>In this study, Cao et al. explore the neural mechanisms by which chronic heat exposure induces negative valence and hyperarousal in mice, focusing on the role of the posterior paraventricular nucleus (pPVT) neurons that receive projections from the preoptic area (POA). The authors show that chronic heat exposure leads to heightened activity of the POA projection-receiving pPVT neurons, potentially contributing to behavioral changes such as increased anxiety level and reduced sociability, along with heightened startle responses. In addition, using electrophysiological methods, the authors suggest that increased membrane excitability of pPVT neurons may underlie these behavioral changes. The use of a variety of behavioral assays enhances the robustness of their claim. Moreover, while previous research on thermoregulation has predominantly focused on physiological responses to thermal stress, this study adds a unique and valuable perspective by exploring how thermal stress impacts affective states and behaviors, thereby broadening the field of thermoregulation. However, a few points warrant further consideration to enhance the clarity and impact of the findings.</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that behavior changes induced by chronic heat exposure are mediated by the POA-pPVT circuit. However, it remains unclear whether these changes are unique to heat exposure or if this circuit represents a more general response to chronic stress. It would be valuable to include control experiments with other forms of chronic stress, such as chronic pain, social defeat, or restraint stress, to determine if the observed changes in the POA-pPVT circuit are indeed specific to thermal stress or indicative of a more universal stress response mechanism.</p>
<p>(2) The authors use the term &quot;negative emotion and hyperarousal&quot; to interpret behavioral changes induced by chronic heat (consistently throughout the manuscript, including the title and lines 33-34). However, the term &quot;emotion&quot; is broad and inherently difficult to quantify, as it encompasses various factors, including both valence and arousal (Tye, 2018; Barrett, L. F. 1999; Schachter, S. 1962). Therefore, the reviewer suggests the authors use a more precise term to describe these behaviors, such as valence. Additionally, in lines 117 and 137-139, replacing &quot;emotion&quot; with &quot;stress responses,&quot; a term that aligns more closely with the physiological observations, would provide greater specificity and clarity in interpreting the findings.</p>
<p>(3) Related to the role of POA input to pPVT,</p>
<p>
a) The authors showed increased activity in pPVT neurons that receive projections from the POA (Figure 3), and these neurons are necessary for heat-induced behavioral changes (Figures 4N-W). However, is the POA input to the pPVT circuit truly critical? Since recipient pPVT neurons can receive inputs from various brain regions, the reviewer suggests that experiments directly inhibiting the POA-to-pPVT projection itself are needed to confirm the role of POA input. Alternatively, the authors could show that the increased activity of pPVT neurons due to chronic heat exposure is not observed when the POA is blocked. If these experiments are not feasible, the reviewer suggests that the authors consider toning down the emphasis on the role of the POA throughout the manuscript and discuss this as a limitation.</p>
<p>
b) In the electrophysiology experiments shown in Figures 6A-I, the authors conducted in vitro slice recordings on pPVT neurons. However, the interpretation of these results (e.g., &quot;The increase in presynaptic excitability of the POA to pPVT excitatory pathway suggested plastic changes induced by the chronic heat treatment.&quot;, lines 349-350) appears to be an overclaim. It is difficult to conclude that the increased excitability of pPVT neurons due to heat exposure is specifically caused by inputs from the POA. To clarify this, the reviewer suggests the authors conduct experiments targeting recipient neurons in the pPVT, with anterograde labeling from the POA to validate the source of excitatory inputs.</p>
<p>(4) The authors focus on the excitatory connection between the POA and pPVT (e.g., &quot;Together, our results indicate that most of the pPVT-projecting POA neurons responded to heat treatment, which would then recruit their downstream neurons in the pPVT by exerting a net excitatory influence.&quot;, lines 169-171). However, are the POA neurons projecting to the pPVT indeed excitatory? This is surprising, considering i) the electrophysiological data shown in Figures 2E-K that inhibitory current was recorded in 52.4% of pPVT neurons by stimulation of POA terminal, and ii) POA projection neurons involved in modulating thermoregulatory responses to other brain regions are primarily GABAergic (Tan et al., 2016; Morrison and Nakamura, 2019). The reviewer suggests showing whether the heat-responsive POA neurons projecting to the pPVT are indeed excitatory (This could be achieved by retrogradely labeling POA neurons that project to the pPVT and conducting fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays against Slc32a1, Slc17a6, and Fos to label neurons activated by warmth). Alternatively, demonstrate, at least, that pPVT-projecting POA neurons are a distinct population from the GABAergic POA neurons that project to thermoregulatory regions such as DMH or rRPa. This would clarify how the POA-pPVT circuit integrates with the previously established thermoregulatory pathways.</p>
