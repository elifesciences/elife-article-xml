<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Insect wings, a key innovation that contributed to the explosive diversification of insects, are recognized for their remarkable variation and many splendid adaptations. Classical morphological work subdivides insect wings into several distinct domains along the antero-posterior (AP) axis, each of which can evolve relatively independently to produce the myriad forms we see in nature. Important insights into AP subdivision of insect wings comes from work in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, however they do not fully explain the diversity of AP domains observed across broad winged insects. Here we show that the transcription factor <italic>mirror</italic> acts as a selector gene to differentiate a far posterior domain in the butterfly wing, classically defined as the vannus, and has effects on wing shape, scale morphology, and color pattern. Our results support models of how selector genes may facilitate evolutionarily individuation of distinct AP domains in insect wings outside of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and suggest that the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wing blade has been reduced to represent only a portion of the archetypal insect wing.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Insect wings vary dramatically in their size and morphology. Butterflies and moths in particular have attracted attention for their rapidly evolving wings that show extreme variation in shape and color pattern. Interestingly, the diversity of lepidopteran color patterns appears to follow relatively simple rules, wherein an evolutionarily conserved set spot and stripe pattern elements can vary in size, color, and presence/absence along the antero-posterior (AP) axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Surveys of wing pattern diversity across butterflies, considering both natural variation and genetic mutants, suggest that wings can be subdivided into five AP domains, bounded by the M1, M3, Cu2, and 2A veins as summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Within each domain there is a strong correlation between pattern variation and wing morphology, and, conversely, between domains there is a relative degree of independence in morphological variation. We know little about how these different AP domains are differentiated during wing development, however.</p>

<p>Some aspects of the AP wing differentiation process have been extrapolated from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wings to butterflies. The transcription factors engrailed and spalt define AP domains in developing fly wings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and exhibit expression patterns in butterflies that suggest some functions may be conserved. In butterflies <italic>engrailed</italic> transcription across the entire region posterior to the M1 vein, while its paralog <italic>invected</italic> marks a largely overlapping region between M1 and 2A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> <italic>spalt</italic> expression is more dynamic and complex in butterflies, but appears to consistently mark a region between the R2 and M3 veins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> These observations, coupled with the overall size and morphological complexity of butterfly wings, have spurred interest in the question of whether additional AP differentiation mechanisms may underlie AP domain specification in Lepidoptera and other insects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> The identification of additional domain-determining transcription factors in broad winged insects would provide a model for the modular diversification of insect wing morphology.</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to identify the molecular basis of AP domain specification in the butterfly wing, posterior of the M1 engrailed boundary. We initially identified the transcription factor <italic>mirror</italic> as a potential candidate selector gene based on previous mRNA-seq studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> coupled with <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> work showing that <italic>mirror</italic> specifies the alula â a small membranous lobe at the posterior base of the wing in some dipterans (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,D</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> We used <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to visualize <italic>mirror</italic> mRNA localization in the last-instar imaginal discs of the common buckeye butterfly, <italic>Junonia coenia</italic>, and observed <italic>mirror</italic> expression throughout the wing domain posterior to the 2A vein boundary (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1</xref><bold>)</bold>. This expression precisely marks the vannus, or anal region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B, E</xref>), of the butterfly wing â a distinct posterior domain of the wing blade populated by the anal (A) veins and bordered anteriorly by the claval fold between the cubital (Cu) and A veins in the hindwing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). As observed in various representative species across different butterfly families, this region of the hindwing is distinct from the rest of the wing; the color patterns defining the wing blade terminate at the 2A vein, and in many species it is marked by scales that differ in morphology and lack color patterns found in anterior regions of the wing <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2A</xref><bold>)</bold>. This region has been proposed to represent the posterior-most color pattern domain in butterflies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup></p>

<p>To functionally assess the role of <italic>mirror</italic> in wing development we generated CRISPR/Cas9 mosaic knockouts (mKOs) targeting the coding region of <italic>J. coenia mirror</italic>. We recovered many mKO mutants that consistently exhibited several distinctive phenotypes <bold>(Table S1)</bold>, but only ever in the <italic>mirror</italic>-expressing posterior vannus region:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><bold>Venation:</bold> In mKO mutant hindwings we observed frequent truncation or complete loss of the loss of the 3A vein, as well as discontinuity and ectopic bifurcation of 2A veins <bold>(hindwings: </bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-G</xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2</xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3</xref><bold>; forewings: </bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref><bold>)</bold>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Wing shape:</bold> mKOs consistently showed shape change along the posterior edge of the wing, especially the hindwing where the projecting lobe characteristic of the vannus was reduced and replaced by a more even, regular wing margin. The anal fold between the 2A and 3A veins, which marks the edge of the vannal lobe, was also lost in mutant clones affecting this wing region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Color pattern expansion:</bold> In mutant hindwings we consistently observed extension of wing margin color patterns across the 2A vein boundary into the posterior region of the wing. In wild-type wings the submarginal and central symmetry system color patterns terminate at the 2A vein <bold>(dorsal: </bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-G</xref><bold>; ventral: </bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref><bold>)</bold>. Remarkably, in <italic>mirror</italic> mKO mutants these entire color pattern systems extend past the 2A vein into the posterior regions of the wing on both dorsal and ventral wing surfaces. Specifically, submarginal bands continue past 2A to follow the posterior wing margin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2</xref>), while central symmetry patterns extend from 2A down to the posterior margin (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Scale morphology:</bold> In most mutants vannus scales lost their distinctive silver structural color and rounded apical edges, and transformed into brown, serrated scales typical of the remigium (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). We also observed that scales along mutant wing margins often displayed elongated scales, often manifesting as a dense hair-like matt across the posterior margin (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The knockout phenotypes we observed illustrate several things about <italic>mirror</italic>âs function in wing development. First, across all mKO replicates we never observed mutant phenotypes anterior to the 2A vein, which suggests that <italic>mirror</italic> effects are limited to the far posterior domain in which we observed <italic>mirror</italic> expression. Second, <italic>mirror</italic> knockouts appear to affect multiple aspects of wing morphology, including scale shape and coloration, overall wing shape, and wing venation. Finally, the loss of <italic>mirror</italic> function resulted in transformation, not loss, of the posterior domain. Even in mKO individuals that appeared to have a mutant phenotype across the entire posterior region, the <italic>mirror</italic>-expressing cells posterior to the 2A vein were not simply lost â the wing field continues well past the 2A vein. Instead, the identities of the post-2A scale cells changed in color and structure. In this respect, the expansion of multiple color pattern systems into the posterior domain of mutants was particularly compelling because the loss of central symmetry system and submarginal patterns in the post-2A vannus region is commonly observed in Lepidoptera (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The ability to reconstitute these complex color pattern elements in the posterior domain by knocking out a single transcription factor leads us to speculate that their patterning information may occur in a latent form that is masked by <italic>mirror</italic> effects. Together, our expression and knockout data suggest that <italic>mirror</italic> acts as a selector gene necessary to define the identity of the far posterior wing domain.</p>
<p>Identifying <italic>mirror</italic> as a vannus-specifying factor is of interest for a few reasons. First, it provides a molecular explanation for how different AP domains of the butterfly wing may be individuated to independently evolve their own shape and color pattern variations. Previous authors have proposed the existence of such individuated domains, and speculated that they may be specified by selector genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Our data provide experimental support for this model, and now motivate us to identify additional factors that may specify other domain boundaries between the M1 and A2 veins.</p>
<p>Next, the role of <italic>mirror</italic> in specifying the vannus provides an important link between molecular developmental biology and Snodgrassâ classical anatomical designations of the insect wing fields â i.e., the remigium, the vannus, and the jugum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> The remigium and the vannus are dominant features of most insect wings, while the jugum is smaller lobe-like feature that is reduced or lost in many clades. The remigium is the major anterior wing blade that is directly articulated by thoracic motor musculature to power flight, and is typically divided from the vannus by a distinct wing fold (e.g. the âanal foldâ in butterflies). In many insect orders the vannus is a prominent fan-like structure, which can be a greatly enlarged gliding surface some hemimetabolous clades such as Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers), Dictyoptera (mantids and roaches), Phasmatodea (stick insects), and Plecoptera (stoneflies). Importantly, <italic>mirror</italic> knockdown in the hemimetaboulous milkweed bug <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic> causes developmental defects in the claval and anal furrows in the posterior wing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> which leads us to infer that <italic>mirror</italic>âs role in determining the vannus may be deeply conserved in insects. This prompts us to speculate that the developmental individuation of the posterior domain by <italic>mirror</italic> facilitated the remarkable diversification of the vannus across the insects.</p>
<p>Finally, the function of <italic>mirror</italic> in determining the alula in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> suggests that the alula may represent an evolutionarily reduced vannus. The ramifications of this are significant for reconstructing the history of the insect wing, because they suggest that the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wing blade is a lone remigium â only one-third of the archetypal insect wing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The dipteran jugum appears to have been lost entirely, except perhaps as a membranous haltere cover (calypter) in the Calyptratae clade, as speculated by Snodgrass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Thus, while flies have been an important model for characterizing genes and processes that build insect wings, a more comprehensive understanding of the development and evolution of insect wings requires work in species that have wings more representative of the complete ancestral blueprint.</p>

Last (5<sup>th</sup>) instar larval wing imaginal discs were dissected in cold 1x PBS. The dissected discs collected from left and ride sides of the larvae were randomly assigned to control or treatment batches. Both controls and treatment batches were fixed in 1x cold fix buffer (750uL PBS, 50mM EGTA, 250uL 37% formaldehyde) on ice. The discs were then washed three times in 1x PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PTw) on ice spending approximately 30sec â 2min for each wash. Tissues were then gradually dehydrated by washing in 33%, 66%, and 100% MeOH (in PTw) for 2-5min / wash on ice, and stored in 100% MeOH in -20Â°C for days until HCR protocol was started. On the day of the HCR protocol, the wing discs were progressively rehydrated in cold 75% MeOH, 50% MeOH, and 25% MeOH in PTw spending 2-5min per wash. After rehydrating, discs were washed once for 10min and twice for 5min with PTw. The discs were then permeabilized in 300-500Î¼L of detergent solution (1.0% SDS, 0.5% Tween, 50mM Tris-HCL pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl) for 30min at room temperature. While waiting, hybridization buffer (Molecular Instruments) was warmed to 37Â°C (200Î¼L/tube). After permeabilizing with detergent solution, each tube of wing discs was incubated in 200Î¼L of pre-warmed hybridization buffer for 30min at 37Â°C. Probe solution was prepared by adding 0.8pmol (0.8 Î¼l of probe from 1uM stock solution) of each probe mixture to 200Î¼L of probe hybridization buffer at 37Â°C. The pre-hybridization buffer was removed, and the probe solution was added. For negative control tissues, hybridization buffer without probes was added instead. All wing discs were incubated overnight (12-16hr) at 37Â°C. Before resuming the protocol, probe wash buffer (Molecular Instruments) was warmed to 37Â°C, amplification buffer (Molecular Instruments) was calibrated to room temperature, and a heat block was set to 95Â°C. The probe solution was removed and saved at -20Â°C to be reused. Wing discs were then washed four times in 1mL pre-warmed probe wash buffer at 37Â°C for 15min per wash. After the last wash step, discs were washed twice (5min/wash) with 1mL of 5x SSCT (5X sodium chloride sodium citrate, 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature. The wing discs were pre-amplified with 1mL of equilibrated amplification buffer for 30min at room temperature. During this step, 2Î¼L of each of hairpin h1 and 2uL of each hairpin h2 were mixed in 100Î¼L of amplification buffer at 95Â°C for 90sec and cooled to room temperature in the dark for 30 min. For <italic>mirror</italic>-only <italic>in situ</italic> hybridizations, we used B1 hairpin amplifiers tagged with AlexaFluor 594 fluorophore (Molecular Instruments). For <italic>mirror</italic> and <italic>wingless</italic> double stains, we used <italic>mirror</italic> probes with B1 amplifier tagged with AlexaFluor 647 fluorophore and <italic>wingless</italic> probes (Lot #PRG129) with B3 hairpin amplifiers tagged with AlexaFluor 546 fluorophore. After 30min, the pre-amplification buffer was removed from the discs, hairpin solution added, and the tissues were then incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2-16hr. The hairpins were removed and saved at -20Â°C to be reused later. Excess hairpins were removed by washing 5 times (twice for 5min, twice for 30min and once for 5min) with 1mL of 5x SSCT at room temperature. The wing discs were then incubated in 50% glycerol solution (in 1X PBS) with DAPI (0.01Î¼g/mL) overnight at 4Â°C. The wing discs were then mounted and visualized on a Zeiss 710 or Leica Stellaris 5 confocal microscope.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides evidence of a deeply conserved role for the gene Mirror in providing positional identity in the posterior part of butterfly and fly wings, despite increased morphological complexity of butterfly wings. The findings are <bold>solid</bold> for the field of evo-devo. However, the tools in butterflies are more limited than in Drosophila and it is more difficult to determine which specific cells are mutant and whether the effect of mutation is cell-intrinsic. The work will be of interest to evolutionary and developmental biologists working on insect wing evolution and the evolution of patterning more generally.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This short report shows that the transcription factor gene mirror is specifically expressed in the posterior region of the butterfly wing imaginal disk, and uses CRISPR mosaic knock-outs to show it is necessary to specify the morphological features (scales, veins, and surface) of this area.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data and figures support the conclusions. The article is swiftly written and makes an interesting evolutionary comparison to the function of this gene in Drosophila. Based on the data presented, it can now be established that mirror likely has a similar selector function for posterior-wing identity in a plethora of insects.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The revision is satisfactory. I agree with the authors that this article provides interesting insights on the evolution of insect wings. Of note, butterfly and fly wing imaginal disks differ in their mode of development: while fly wing disks grow as epithelial sacs that evaginate during metamorphosis, butterfly wing disks develop as relatively flat epithelial sheets that expand and differentiate progressively. This makes the similar role of mirror all the more interesting.</p>
<p>The revised text appropriately discuss how selector genes like mirror regionalize the wing during larval and pupal development. This article makes a reasonable use of CRISPR mosaic knock outs and uses contralateral controls to show the nature of the phenotypic transformations.</p>

<p>This is a short and unpretentious paper. It is an interesting area and therefore, although much of this area of research was pioneered in flies, extending basic findings to butterflies would be worthwhile. Indeed, there is an intriguing observation but it is technically flawed and these flaws are far too serious to allow us to recommend publication</p>
<p>The authors show that mirror is expressed at the back of the wing in butterflies (as in flies). They present some evidence that is required for the proper development of the back of the wing in butterflies (a region dubbed the vannus by the ancient guru Snodgrass). But there are problems with that evidence. First, concerning the method, using CRISP they treat embryos and the expectation is that the mirror gene will be damaged in groups of cell lineages, giving a mosaic animal in which some lines of cells are normal for mirror and others not. We do not know where the clones or patches of cells that are defective for mirror are because they are not marked. Also, we do not know what part of the wing is wildtype and what part is mutant for mirror. When the mirror mutant cells colonise the back of the wing and that butterfly survives (many butterflies fail to develop), the back of the wing is altered in some selected butterflies. This raises a second problem: we do not know whether the rear of the wing is missing or transformed. From the images the appearance of the back of the wing is clearly different from wild type, but is that due to transformation or not? And then I believe we need to know specifically what us difference between the rear of the wing and the main part. What we see is a silvery look at the back that is not present in the main part, is it the structure of the scales? We are not told. There are other problems. Mirror is only part of a group of genes in flies and in flies both iroquois and mirror are needed to make the back of the wing, the alula (Kehl et al). What is known about iro expression in butterflies?</p>
<p>In flies, mirror regulates a late and local expression of dpp that seems to be responsible of making the alula. What happens in butterflies? Would a study of expression of Dpp in wildtype and mirror compromised wings be useful?</p>
<p>Thus, I find the paper to be disappointing for a general journal as it does little more than claim what was discovered in Drosophila is at least partly true in butterflies. Also it fails to explain what the authors mean by &quot;wing domains&quot; and &quot;domain specification&quot;. They are not alone, butterfly workers in general appear vague about these concepts, their vagueness allowing too much loose thinking. Since these matters are at the heart of the purpose and meaning of the work reported here, we readers need a paper containing more critical thought and information. I would like to have a better and more logical introduction and discussion.</p>
<p>They do define what they mean by the vannus of the wing. In flies the definition of compartments is clear and abundantly demonstrated, with gene expression and requirement being limited precisely to sets of cells that display lineage boundaries. It is true that domains of gene expression in flies, for example, of the iroquois complex, which includes mirror, can only be related to pattern with difficulty. Some recap of what is known plus the opinion of the authors on how they interpret papers on possible lineage domains in butterflies might also be useful as the reader, is no wiser about what the authors might mean at the end of it!</p>
<p>The references are sometimes inappropriate. The discovery of the AP compartments should not be referred to Guillen et al 1995, but to Morata and Lawrence 1975.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>Nearly all the previous criticisms remain valid and are not discussed or overcome in the revision. The authors wish to draw their conclusions and we think they can do that, but they should make clear that key evidence is lacking. Thus their conclusions are speculative. But they present them more or less as facts. This is not justified. Let us suppose that clones lacking mirror do not survive or do not develop properly in the rear part of the wing and what they are seeing is occasional damage due to incomplete regeneration or to regenerative duplication?</p>
<p>Many clones in flies only include parts of one surface of the wing, could this happen here and how would it affect interpretations?</p>
<p>The null phenotype in the wing is not known but deduced from abnormal wings which &quot;even in mKO..... appeared to have a mutant phenotype across the entire posterior region&quot;, a nice example of circular logic.</p>
<p>We believe the authors should be more objective and explain that their interpretations are not solid and that they should ideally be tested by finding ways of independently marking the clones. Other clonal mosaic experiments in butterflies have been done (eg <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/150/18/dev201868/329659/Frizzled2-receives-WntA-signaling-during-butterfly">https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/150/18/dev201868/329659/Frizzled2-receives-WntA-signaling-during-butterfly</ext-link>) without cell autonomous independent markers, but they are more solid as transformed spots are made visible cell by cell by scale colour changes etc.</p>
<p>Their deduction that &quot;mirror acts as a selector gene necessary to define the far posterior wing domain&quot; is a speculative hypothesis, not a deduction and the readers should be so informed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Chatterjee et al., examines the role of the mirror locus in patterning butterfly wings. The authors examine the pattern of mirror expression in the common buckeye butterfly, Junonia coenia and then employ CRISPR mutagenesis to generate mosaic butterflies carrying clones of mirror mutant cells. They find that mirror is expressed in a well-defined posterior sector of final-instar wing discs from both hindwings and forewings and that CRISPR-injected larvae display a loss of adult wing structures presumably derived from the mirror expressing region of hindwing primordium (the case for forewings is a bit less clear since the mirror domain is narrower than in the hindwing, but there also do seem to be some anomalies in posterior regions of forewings in adults derived from CRISPR injected larvae). The authors conclude that wings of these butterflies have at least three different fundamental wing compartments, the mirror domain, a posterior domain defined by engrailed expression, and an anterior domain expressing neither mirror or engrailed. They speculate that this most posterior compartment has been reduced to a rudiment in Drosophila and thus has not been adequately recognized as a such a primary regional specialization.</p>
<p>Critique: This is a very straight-forward study and the experimental results presented support the key claims that mirror is expressed in a restricted posterior section of the wing primordium and that mosaic wings from CRISPR injected larvae display loss of adult wing structures presumably derived from cells expressing mirror (or at least nearby). The major issue I have with this paper is the strong interpretation of these findings that lead the authors to conclude that mirror is acting as a high level gene akin to engrailed in defining a separate extreme posterior wing compartment. To place this claim in context, it is important in my view to consider what is known about engrailed, for which there is ample evidence to support the claim that this gene does play a very ancestral and conserved function in a defining posterior compartments of all body segments (including the wing) across arthropods.</p>
<p>(A) engrailed is expressed in a broad posterior domain with a sharp anterior border in all segments of virtually all arthropods examined (broad use of a very good pan-species anti-En antibody makes this case very strong).</p>
<p>(B) In Drosophila, marked clones of wing cells (generated during larval stages) strictly obey a straight anterior-posterior border indicating that cells in these two domains do not normally intermix, thus, supporting the claim that a clear A/P lineage compartment exists.</p>
<p>In my opinion, mirror does not seem to be in the same category of regulator as engrailed for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) There is no evidence that I am aware of, either from the current experiments, or others that the mirror expression domain corresponds to a clonal lineage compartment. It is also unclear from the data shown in this study whether engrailed is co-expressed with mirror in posterior most cells of J. coenia wing discs? If so, it does not seem justified to infer that mirror acts as an independent determinant of the region of the wing where it is expressed.</p>
<p>(2) The mirror is not only expressed in a posterior region of the wing in flies but also in the ventral region of the eye. In Drosophila, mirror mutants not only lack the alula (derived approximately from cells where mirror is expressed), but also lacks tissue derived from the ventral region of the eye disc (although this ventral tissue loss phenotype may extend beyond the cells expressing mirror).</p>
<p>In summary, it seems most reasonable to me to think of mirror as a transcription factor that provides important development information for a diverse set of cells in which it can be expressed (posterior wing cells and ventral eye cells) but not that it acts as a high level regulator as engrailed.</p>
<p>Recommendation:</p>
<p>While the data provided in this succinct study are solid and interesting, it is not clear to me that these findings support the major claim that mirror defines an extreme posterior compartment akin to that specified by engrailed. Minimally, the authors should address the points outlined above in their discussion section and greatly tone down their conclusion regarding mirror being a conserved selector-like gene dedicated to establishing posterior-most fates of the wing. They also should cite and discuss the original study in Drosophila describing the mirror expression pattern in the embryo and eye and the corresponding eye phenotype of mirror mutants: McNeill et al., Genes &amp; Dev. 1997. 11: 1073-1082; doi:10.1101/gad.11.8.1073.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this feedback. We appreciate that many readers may not accustomed to looking at mosaic knockouts. As discussed in a previous review article (Zhang &amp; Reed 2017), we rely on a combination of contralateral asymmetry and replicates to infer mutant phenotypes. For many genes (e.g. pigmentation enzymes) mutant clones are obvious, but for other types of genes (e.g. ligands) clone boundaries are sometimes not directly diagnosable. It is simply a limitation of our study system. Nonetheless, you see for yourself that âthe back of the wing is altered in some butterfliesâ â the effects of deleting <italic>mirror</italic> are clear and repeatable.</p>
<p>In terms of interpreting mutant phenotypes, we agree that that paper would benefit from a better description of the specific effects. Therefore, we have included an improved, more systematic description of phenotypes, along with better-annotated figures showing changes in wing shape and venation, scale coloration, and color pattern transformation (e.g. posterior elongation of the orange marginal stripes).</p>

<p>A domain is âa region distinctively marked by some physical featureâ. This term is used extensively in the developmental biology literature (e.g. âexpression domainâ, âembryonic domainâ, âtissue domainâ, âdomain specificationâ) and is found throughout popular textbooks (e.g. Alberts et al. âThe Cellâ, Gilbert âDevelopmental Biologyâ). We prefer the term âdomainâ because of its association in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> literature with transcription factors that define fields of cells. We specifically avoided using the term âcompartmentâ because of its association with cell lineage, which we have not tested.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their summary, critique, and recommendations. We agree with everything the reviewer says. Honestly, however, we were surprised by these comments because we took great care in the paper to never refer to <italic>mirror</italic> as a compartmentalization gene or claim it has a function in cell lineage compartmentalization like engrailed. As pointed out, we lack clonal analyses to test for compartmentalization. This is why we used the term âdomainâ instead of âcompartmentâ in the title and throughout the manuscript. Nevertheless, we have recrafted the discussion in the manuscript, including completely removing the term âcompartmentâ, to better avoid implications that <italic>mirror</italic> plays a role in cell lineage compartmentalization.</p>
<p>We also thank the reviewer for recommending the paper about the role of <italic>mirror</italic> in eye development. For the sake of keeping the paper focused, however, we decided not to broach the topic of <italic>mirror</italic> functions outside the context of wing development.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have minor comments for improvement.</p>
<p>The abstract and introductions are terminologically problematic when they refer to the concept of compartment and compartment boundaries. Allegedly this confusion has previously propagated in several articles related to butterfly wing development, which keeps alienating this literature from being taken seriously by fly specialists, for example. So it is important to use the right terms. I will try to explain point by point here, but I would appreciate it if the authors could undertake a significant rewrite taking these comments into account. The authors use the terms compartment and compartment boundary. This has a very specific use in developmental genetics: mitotic clones never cross a boundary (or compartment). I think the authors can keep referring to the equivalent of the A-P boundary, which is situated somewhere between M1-M2 based on unpublished data from the Patel Lab, and is not very well defined (Engrailed expression moves a little bit during development in this area). Domain is a looser term and can be used more liberally to describe genetically defined regions.</p>
<p>- &quot;Classical morphological work subdivides insect wings into several distinct domains along the antero-posterior (AP) axis, each of which can evolve relatively independently.&quot; Yes. This concept of domain and individuation seems important. You could make a proposed link to selector genes here.</p>
<p>- &quot;There has been little molecular evidence, however, for AP subdivision beyond a single compartment boundary described from Drosophila melanogaster.&quot; Incorrect, and this conflates &quot;domain&quot; and &quot;compartment&quot;.</p>
<p>Flies have wing AP domains too, that pattern their veins (see the cited Banerjee et al).</p>
<p>- &quot;Our results confirm that insect wings can have more than one posterior developmental domain, and support models of how selector genes may facilitate evolutionarily individuation of distinct AP domains in insect wings&quot;. Yes, and I like the second part of the sentence. Still, I would recommend simply deleting &quot;confirm that insect wings can have more than one posterior developmental domain, and&quot; because this is neglecting previous work on AP genetic regionalization in both flies (vein literature) and butterflies (e.g. McKenna and Nijhout, Banerjee et al).</p>
<p>- &quot;Analyses of wing pattern diversity across butterflies, considering both natural variation and genetic mutants, suggest that wings can be subdivided into at least five AP domains, bounded by the M1, M3, Cu2, and 2A veins respectively, within each of which there are strong correlations in color pattern variation and wing morphology (Figure 1A)&quot;. Yes, and I would recommend emphasizing they correspond to welldefined gene expression domains as mentioned in Banerjee et al, or McKenna and Nijhout.</p>
<p>- &quot;The anterior-most of these domains, bordered by the M1 vein, appears to correspond to an AP compartment boundary originally described by cell lineage tracing in Drosophila melanogaster, and later supported in butterfly wings by expression of the Engrailed transcription factor. Interestingly, however, D. melanogaster work has yet to reveal clear evidence for additional AP domain boundaries in the wing.&quot; Confusingly, because the first sentence is about compartments while the second is about AP domains. I also think the claim that Dmel has no other known AP domains is dubious because Spalt is highly regionalized in flies.</p>
<p>- &quot;Previous authors have proposed the existence of such individuated domains, and speculated that they may be specified by selector genes.5,10 Our data provide experimental support for this model, and now motivate us to identify factors that specify other domain boundaries between the M1 and A2 veins.&quot; Yes, I completely agree with this way to emphasize the selector effect, and to link it to the concept of &quot;individuated domain&quot;</p>

<p>Fig. S1: the field needs to move away from Red/Green microscopy images, for accessibility reasons.</p>
<p>The easiest fix here would be to change the red channels to magenta.</p>
<p>Green/Magenta provides excellent contrast and accessibility in general in 2-channel images.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have improved the color accessibility of Fig. S1.</p>
