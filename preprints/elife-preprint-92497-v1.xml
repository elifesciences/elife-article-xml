<abstract>
<p>Characterizing and manipulating cellular behaviour requires a mechanistic understanding of the causal interactions between cellular components. We present an approach that can detect causal interactions between genes without the need to perturb the physiological state of cells. This approach exploits naturally occurring cell-to-cell variability which is experimentally accessible from static population snapshots of genetically identical cells without the need to follow cells over time. Our main contribution is a simple mathematical relation that constrains the propagation of gene expression noise through biochemical reaction networks. This relation allows us to rigorously interpret fluctuation data even when only a small part of a complex gene regulatory process can be observed. This relation can be exploited to detect causal interactions by synthetically engineering a passive reporter of gene expression, akin to the established “dual reporter assay”. While the focus of our contribution is theoretical, we also present an experimental proof-of-principle to illustrate the approach. Our data from synthetic gene regulatory networks in <italic>E. coli</italic> are not unequivocal but suggest that the method could prove useful in practice to identify causal interactions between genes from non-genetic cell-to-cell variability.</p>

<p>Translating molecular abundance data into mechanistic models of cellular processes remains a major challenge of systems biology. High-throughput experimental techniques routinely produce statistical associations between genes through correlation measurements of gene expression variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. While such statistical associations can provide insightful clues, they do not directly identify causal interactions: even if two components <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Z</italic> are non-spuriously correlated, we cannot conclude that <italic>X</italic> affects <italic>Z</italic> because the causal connection could be reversed or a confounding factor could be regulating both components, even with statistical associations that go beyond correlations such as Granger causality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Perturbation experiments are a conceptually simple solution to avoid this problem and directly infer causal relationships in gene regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. However, they come with practical challenges: drug perturbations can affect multiple targets at once [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] and genetic perturbations, e.g., through changing gene copy numbers, are not guaranteed to keep cells in their physiologically relevant regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. For large enough perturbations, everything is expected to affect everything else in the cell.</p>
<p>Here we present a method to infer directional causal interactions between cellular components by utilizing stochastic fluctuations in cellular abundances. Existing work on analyzing non-genetic variability has focused on testing completely specified mechanistic models against such fluctuation data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. However, completely specifying mechanistic models of cellular processes often requires making a large number of assumptions about unknown details, which can make inferences based on such an approach unreliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>We propose a novel inference method to detect whether a gene <italic>X</italic> causally affects a gene <italic>Z</italic> which rests on a mathematical identity that constrains an entire class of models. We show how covariability measurements of molecular abundances can then be used to detect causal interactions by specifying only “local” aspects of the underlying gene expression dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Experimentally, we exploit an approach similar to the “dual reporter assay” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] previously established to quantify stochastic fluctuations in expression differences between copies of a gene of interest. However, instead of analyzing the covariance between the dual reporters, we focus on the covariance of each reporter with a third component of biological interest. We prove that under broad conditions these covariances must be identical in the absence of the causal interaction we wish to establish. Violations of this relation can thus be used to detect causal interactions.</p>
<p>To illustrate the generality of our covariance identity, we numerically verify the analytically proven result for a wide variety of example systems. Additionally, we present an experimental proof-of-principle for synthetically constructed gene regulatory circuits in <italic>E. coli</italic> with known interactions. The data establish a baseline estimate for the accuracy of our approach with current experimental methods. Despite the arguable occurrence of a false positive result, the experimental data support our hypothesis that single-cell variability measurements might prove useful in detecting causal interactions in gene regulatory networks.</p>

<p>Our main mathematical result is a covariance invariant that constrains the fluctuations of two molecular species in partially specified reaction networks. We consider a molecular species of interest <italic>X</italic> that is subject to firstorder degradation and is made with an unspecified and time-varying production rate. A reporter species <italic>Y</italic> acts as an identical but separate copy of <italic>X</italic> that is subject to the same control.

<title>Detecting causal interactions between genes through experimentally engineered “dual reporters”</title>
<p>Violation of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> can be used to experimentally deduce the existence of a causal effect from a gene of interest <italic>X</italic> onto another gene of interest Z<sub><italic>k</italic></sub> as follows. If we engineer a co-regulated “dual reporter” system with the properties defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. (1)</xref>, in which <italic>Y</italic> is a passive reporter (i.e., it does not significantly interact with other cellular components) that responds to the same input as <italic>X</italic>, then a violation of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> implies that changes in <italic>X</italic> must causally affect the abundance of component Z<sub><italic>k</italic></sub>. This is because intrinsic fluctuations from the expression of <italic>X</italic> propagate through the network and affect Z<sub><italic>k</italic></sub>, but those from the passive reporter <italic>Y</italic> do not. As detailed next, this approach can be applied to dual reporters for gene expression both on the transcriptional as well as the translational level, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Transcriptional dual reporters</title>
<p>Consider two genes of interest, <italic>geneX</italic> with transcript <italic>X</italic> and <italic>geneZ</italic> with transcript <italic>Z</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>. Our approach relies on engineering a passive reporter gene <italic>geneY</italic> with identical transcriptional control to <italic>geneX</italic> and mRNA lifetime, but with transcript that does not affect other cellular components, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>. This could be achieved with a transcriptional reporter that is put under control of the same promoter as <italic>geneX</italic> and placed at a similar gene locus. One way to ensure that <italic>geneY</italic> interacts minimally with other cellular components would be to remove its start codon so that it will not be translated into a protein.</p>

<title>Translational dual reporters</title>
<p>The dual reporter assay has been frequently implemented as co-regulated fluorescent proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. The invariant of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> directly applies when <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> are co-regulated fluorescent proteins with first-order translation rates and maturation times (see SI Sec. 4 B for details of the proof). Fluorescent proteins can then be used to detect causal interactions in gene regulation as follows. The gene of interest <italic>geneX</italic> is fused to a fluorescent protein to make a functional fusion <italic>geneX-FP</italic>. A passive reporter protein <italic>Y</italic> is made by introducing a spectrally distinguishable fluorescent protein <italic>Y</italic> under the control of the same (but distinct) promoter as <italic>geneX-FP</italic>. The expression level <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> of <italic>geneZ</italic> can be measured either through a transcriptional reporter or a functional fusion protein with a third fluorescence reporter. Under the assumption that the fluorescent protein <italic>Y</italic> does not directly affect other cellular components, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> directly applies to the covariances of fluorescence levels as long as <italic>X</italic> does not causally affect <italic>Z</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>. As the normalized covariances in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> are independent of scaling factors, standard fluorescence microscopy methods can be used without the need to determine absolute numbers. Two stable fluorescent proteins with similar maturation times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] should be chosen to ensure that the assumptions underlying the class of systems is satisfied. Additionally, the translation rates of <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> need not be identical, but can be proportional with a fluctuating proportionality factor as defined in the transitions of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. (1)</xref>. As a result, different fluorescent proteins with different ribosome binding sites, mRNA secondary structures, and gene lengths, can be used as long as the translation rates remain proportional.</p>

<p>Experimental techniques to measure mRNA abundances or fluorescence levels potentially introduce significant measurement noise.

<p>The above repressilator test circuits were chosen for their well-characterized genetic interactions and because oscillating abundances make for a convenient test of the constructs. However, large oscillations in <italic>Z</italic> also make it much more challenging to detect violations of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq.

<p>Overall the experimental data confirm that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> has the fundamental power to experimentally detect causal interactions. However, the precision of current experimental techniques lies at the edge of what is necessary to detect physiologically relevant interactions when genes show large variability relative to the intrinsic noise we exploit.

Our error bars estimate sampling error and correction errors from non-even sample illumination, temporal drift, background fluorescence, and autofluorescence.

<title>Negative controls</title>
<p>Our crucial theoretical result is that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> must be satisfied by any circuit in which <italic>X</italic> does not affect <italic>Z</italic>. To experimentally test this prediction we engineered test cases in which <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> are co-regulated, while <italic>Z</italic> is a component that is not affected by <italic>X</italic>. This took one of two forms: First, we constructed eight different circuits in which RFP (<italic>Z</italic>) was expressed constitutively using the pRNA1 promoter as previously used as a segmentation marker in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. We used various synthetic circuits and the RFP reporter was either integrated chromosomally or included on the circuit plasmid (the latter leading to correlations between RFP and our synthetic components without introducing a causal interaction). Second, as an additional control, for each circuit we also considered the cellular growth rate as the unaffected cellular property <italic>Z</italic>. While the growth rate affects reporter concentrations through dilution, we did not expect cellular growth to be affected by our synthetic circuits which made growth rates a convenient additional negative control.</p>
<p>We found the data from all but one synthetic circuit consistent with our predicted invariant, see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>. Note, the false positives correspond to the same synthetic circuit: one data point is from taking <italic>Z</italic> as the RFP concentration, while the other data point is from taking <italic>Z</italic> as the growth rate. To rule out experimental error we repeated the experiment twice while swapping the YFP and CFP reporters which confirmed the result (see Fig. S3). Additionally, we confirmed the result using a different cell segmentation pipeline (see Fig. S4).</p>
<p>Taken at face-value, our method thus produced two false positives (out of 16 tests), suggesting that our approach could be valuable but somewhat unreliable. However, next we present experimental evidence that indicate the violating data points were not false positives but may have correctly identified an unexpected causal effect from <italic>X</italic> on <italic>Z</italic> in the outlier circuit.</p>

<title>Evidence that RpoS mediated stress response affected cellular growth in the outlier circuit</title>
<p>We observed that the outlier strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) exhibited periods of slow growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that cells underwent periods of stress. Indeed, although RFP was thought to be constitutively expressed, RFP exhibited clear temporal dynamics that were negatively correlated with growth rate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Fig. S5).

Because TetR is the only repressor of the <italic>cI</italic> gene in the synthetic circuit, we hypothesize that during periods of low TetR, CI expression is so high that resource competition with the also highly expressed RFP triggers the bacterial stress response. This interaction, hypothesized to be present in cells with high CI and RFP expression levels, is indicated with a dashed arrow. Solid arrows indicate interactions with direct experimental support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>].</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="555799v1_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We hypothesized that in the outlier strain the “constitutive” RFP reporter was being affected by the bacterial stress response regulator RpoS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. By measuring the transcriptional activity of the known RpoS target <italic>gadX</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] we observed variable RpoS activity with pulses that correlated with periods of slow cellular growth (Fig. S7). Similar pulsing behaviour of RpoS triggering periods of slow growth has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. RFP levels were in turn strongly correlated with RpoS activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), as expected for genes for which transcription rates are constant but cell growth is slowed down by RpoS activity. Indeed, upon deleting RpoS, RFP fluctuations as well as growth rate fluctuations satisfy <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref>, see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>.</p>
<p>Next, we discuss why the RpoS stress response was triggered in the outlier circuit in a TetR dependent manner. In the outlier strain, LacI was chromosomally expressed, which represses TetR independent of the repressilator circuit. Instead of regular oscillations of TetR, we observed extended periods of very low concentrations, see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>. We conjecture that during those extended periods of low TetR levels, expression of CI is exceedingly high, which in combination with the already highly expressed RFP, leads to resource competition in cells that ultimately triggers RpoS mediated stress response. Note, CI is under the control of the very strong pLtetO1 promoter, which can initiate the transcription of up to 0.3 mRNA/sec in bacteria when fully induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] and has been shown to burden <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. RFP is under the control of another strong promoter, pRNA1, previously used as a bright segmentation marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], which we find to affect growth rate (Fig. S8). This RpoS mediated causal effect of TetR on RFP would explain the violations of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> by the outlier circuit, why deletion of <italic>rpoS</italic> removes the outlier data, and why the same circuit without endogenous <italic>lacI</italic> (strain #5) did not violate the constraint, see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>.</p>
<p>Taken together these additional data provide evidence that the outlier data may not have been a false positive but detected an unexpected causal interaction mediated by cellular burden and RpoS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A ubiquitous problem in understanding gene regulatory networks is identifying which genes regulate the expression levels of which other genes. Stochastic fluctuations of molecular abundances within cells provide a natural source of information about such regulation. Here, we presented a mathematical identity that potentially allows for the translation of such single-cell variability data into causal interactions. Because correlations do not imply causation, this method requires experimental intervention, but crucially it does not require perturbing the physiological state of the cells.</p>
<p>Note that agreement with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> does not prove the non-existence of such a causal interaction because the lack of deviation can have two reasons: the causal interaction could be negligible or the effect of the intrinsic noise we exploit is not large enough compared with other sources of variability of the target gene. In other words, while deviations of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> rigorously establish causal interactions, “absence of this evidence does not constitute evidence of absence” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Limitations of this study</title>
<p>Our method relies on a handful of key assumptions about the molecular reporters used. In the absence of standardized synthetic parts we may not know whether a given engineered system satisfies these assumptions. Only if the assumptions are satisfied, can violations of the invariant rigorously identify the existence of a directed causal interaction.</p>
<p>While the presented experimental study works as a proof-of-principle to illustrate the approach and establish its practical feasibility, at face value it also produced a false positive result. Through additional perturbation experiments we argue that the outlier circuit includes an unexpected causal connection. However, the evidence for this conclusion is weaker than the proven theoretical results presented. The fact that our interpretation of the perturbation experiments will be debated may serve as an illustration of how valuable a fluctuation based approach would be that avoids perturbation experiments altogether.</p>

Each component abundance was set to 1 at the beginning of each trajectory, and the cell cycle time set to 0.

We engineered the passive reporter <italic>geneY</italic> by expressing a different fluorescent protein <italic>SCFP3A</italic> (CFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] under the control of the same pLacO1 promoter as <italic>geneX</italic> on the same pSC101 plasmid. Both <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> levels are co-regulated by LacI concentrations. To ensure equal degradation times, we used a version of the repressilator in which the three repressing genes lack degradation tags so that circuit proteins are removed predominantly from cell-division and dilution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. The fluorescent proteins <italic>mVenus NB</italic> and <italic>SCFP3A</italic> were chosen since they both have a short maturation half-life (4.1 ± 0.3min and 6.6 ± 0.5min respectively at 37<sup><italic>o</italic></sup>C) compared to the time-scale of the repressilator oscillations (∼5 hours).</p>
<p>For the RFP, we used a modified <italic>mkate2</italic> hybrid (with improved translational efficiency) throughout all experiments, which consists of the <italic>mCherry</italic> N-terminal 11 amino acids followed by the <italic>mKate2</italic> sequence. In the experiment shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> in which GFP was used to measure <italic>gadX</italic> expression, we used <italic>gfpmut2</italic> as a transcriptional reporter for the <italic>gadX</italic> promoter, placed on a low-copy pSC101 plasmid (taken from the <italic>E. coli</italic> promoter library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]). For <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, we used a strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 with <italic>rpoS</italic> deletion taken from the <italic>E. coli</italic> Keio Knockouts library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].</p>
<p>We chose the repressilator as the base circuit because the circuit interactions are known and the resulting dynamics (periodic oscillations) can be used as a consistency check to ensure that the TetR-YFP fusion is functional (i.e., still represses the <italic>λ</italic> gene).</p>

<title>Mother machine experiment</title>
<p>We used a microfluidic device commonly called “mother machine” to follow growing and dividing cells for hundreds of generations in controlled environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Single-cells are trapped in micrometer wide trenches. As cells grow and divide, the mother cells remain trapped while newborn daughter cells are washed away by the constant flow of growth media. Automated time-lapse microscopy and cell segmentation software enables us to track hundreds of cells in each experiment, while precisely measuring cell fluorescence, growth rate, and cell size. The time-series data for each mother cell can be pooled into a distribution from which the normalized covariances can be computed.</p>
<p>Though the invariant of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> does not require the use of time-series data, we used the additional temporal information as a consistency check for our assumptions. In particular, the highly correlated trajectories of the YFP and CFP fluorescence (see Tables. S3 and S4) are consistent with our assumption that these reporters are co-regulated. Additionally, the observed oscillations in the closed loop circuits are indicative that the TetRYFP fusion has not lost its function as a result of the added fluorescent protein. Moreover, the time-series data allows us to measure cellular growth rates which can be used to test <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq.

<title>Microfluidic chip preparation</title>
<p>Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Sylgard 184 Silicon Elastomer, Fisher Scientific) was mixed at a 10:1 (monomer:curing agent) ratio, poured on top of a 1.0 <italic>μ</italic>m tall wafer and degassed for one hour at room temperature before baking for an additional 1.5 hours at 65°C. After careful removal of the PDMS from the wafer, individual PDMS chips were cut out with a razor blade. The inlet and outlet holes were punched with a 0.75 mm biopsy puncher (World Precision Instruments). The PDMS chips were sonicated in isopropyl alcohol (Fisher Scientific) for 30 minutes and dried at 65°C for 15 minutes. Glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific: 22×40 mm #1.5) were cleaned with 1M potassium hydroxide (KOH, Sigma Aldrich) for 20 minutes. The PDMS chips were bonded to the glass coverslips using a plasma cleaner (Oxygen flow rate at 45 sccm, power at 30W for 15 seconds, Tergeo Plasma Cleaner, PIE Scientific).

At an OD600 of 0.2-0.4, cells were loaded into the main feeding channel of the microfluidic chip and centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min to push cells into the cell trenches. The feeding channels were then connected to syringes filled with imaging media using Tygon tubing, and the microfluidic chip was placed in a temperature controlled incubation chamber set at 37°C. Media was pumped through the feeding channel using syringe pumps (New Era Pump System), first at a rate of 5 <italic>μ</italic>L/min for ∼ 0.5-1 hours to get the cells comfortable in the trenches, then at a high rate of 100 <italic>μ</italic>L/min for 1 hour to clear the inlets and outlets.

<p>Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Observer inverted microscope equipped with a 63x Plan-Apochromat M27 oil objective (NA 1.40), an Orca Flash 4.0 LT camera (Hamamatsu), and an LED epifluorescence illuminator (Zeiss Colibri 7). The experiments were performed inside a temperature controlled incubation chamber set at 37°C. To reduce photobleaching the exposure time (100 ms) and light intensity (10-20%) were set low, with 16bit CZI images taken every 5-8 minutes. Focal drift was corrected automatically with the Definite Focus 2 (Zeiss) monitoring and compensation system using an infrared laser (850 nm). In all experiments in which CFP, YFP, and RFP are measured simultaneously (i.e., all experiments except for the one shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), the following filter sets were used for acquisition: CFP (Semrock FF02475/20-25), YFP (Chroma CT560/39bp), RFP (Zeiss Filter Set 91 HE LED), with respective Zeiss Colibri 7 illumination wavelengths set to 430nm (CFP), 511 nm (YFP), and 590 nm (RFP), along with a the Zeiss TBS 450/538/610 beam splitter.

<title>Segmentation</title>
<p>Because all three fluorescence channels were used to measure synthetic circuit components throughout, we used the bright-field channel for segmentation. This was achieved with the automated deep learning-based cell segmentation software DeLTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. The U-Net deep learning models used for channel identification and cell segmentation were trained with a large dataset built from 5 mother machine experiments performed in the Potvin Lab that were generated with the same microscopy and image acquisition setup. In these training datasets a bright RFP is expressed and a thresholding segmentation pipeline is performed on the RFP channel images to obtain segmentation masks. The U-Net deep learning models from DeLTA are trained with these segmentation masks in combination with bright-field images from the training dataset as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. The training dataset was segmented with the same thresholding pipeline used in previously described procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. We also trained a DelTA model to use the RFP channel for segmentation and obtained similar results on the strains with bright RFP fluorescence. In the SI we include videos of a mother machine with segmentation boundaries obtained from our DeLTA models, along with the single-cell growth trajectories.</p>
<p>We estimated the YFP, CFP, and RFP single-cell concentrations as the average fluorescence intensities of all pixels in the segmentation mask of each cell. Cell area is measured as returned by opencv’s contourArea() over the segmentation mask. Cell length is measured by fitting a rotated bounding box to the segmented cell. We only analyzed data from the mother cells trapped at the top of the growth chambers.</p>

<title>Single-cell traces construction</title>
<p>For a given cell chamber with the Region of Interest identified by the U-Net model, a single-cell trace was constructed by selecting the segmented cell in each frame with highest average vertical pixel location. This in effect keeps track of the mother cells trapped at the top of the growth chambers.</p>
<p>Each single-cell trace went through a manual purging process. Traces with cell areas that are not growing and dividing were removed, as they are expected to correspond to dead cells. Traces with growing and dividing cell areas with very low constant fluorescence correspond to cells that lost the inserted plasmid due to random partitioning at cell division. These traces were also purged, but were analyzed separately to measure the cell autofluorescence as described in the next section. Moreover, segmentation and tracking errors were reduced by purging any parts of the traces that exhibited a clear nonbiological anomaly (see SI for examples).</p>
<p>Cell divisions were identified by a sudden decrease in the cell area. A division is called whenever the cell lengths dropped to less than 80% of its previous value.</p>

<title>Temporal drift correction</title>
<p>Focal drift was reduced automatically with a 850 nm infrared laser (Zeiss Definite Focus 2). However, we used an oil objective, which can cause temporal drift from spreading of the oil over time. We thus applied an additional correction to the data as follows.</p>
<p>In a given mother machine experiment, we computed the mean YFP, CFP, and RFP signals of all the cells at each time frame. For example, the mean YFP time-trace is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="555799v1_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="555799v1_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the average YFP intensity taken over the segmented area of the <italic>i</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup> cell at time frame <italic>t</italic>, and <italic>N</italic><sub>cells</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is the number of surviving cells at time frame <italic>t</italic>. The mean time-traces of each fluorophore are fitted with a second degree polynomial according to a least-squared fit. To correct for the drift, we multiply a measured intensity with the reciprocal of the respective fitted polynomial (see Fig. S9). For example, if <italic>f</italic> (<italic>t</italic>) is the obtained fit of ⟨YFP<sub><italic>avg</italic></sub>⟩<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq.

<title>Uneven illumination and background correction</title>
<p>A single image frame from our setup encompasses ∼ 30 cell trenches with total spatial extension of ∼ 100 <italic>μ</italic>m. This results in uneven illumination onto the cells. We use the linear gain model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>] to correct for uneven illumination and background fluorescence:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">

where <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>m</italic></sup>(<italic>x</italic>) and <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>true</italic></sup>(<italic>x</italic>) are the measured and true intensities at horizontal pixel position <italic>x</italic> respectively, the multiplicative term <italic>S</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) models the uneven illumination, and the additive term <italic>D</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is any background noise that is present when no light is incident on the sensor. For our imaging setup we decompose <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>true</italic></sup>(<italic>x</italic>) as follows
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="555799v1_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>F P</italic></sup> (<italic>x</italic>) is the intensity from the fluorescent proteins, <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup> is the autofluorescence of the cell, <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>media</italic></sup> is any fluorescence originating from the media, and <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>b</italic></sup> is any fluorescence originating from the PDMS background of the microfluidic device. The total background is given by <italic>b</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) = <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>b</italic></sup>(<italic>x</italic>) × <italic>S</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) + <italic>D</italic>(<italic>x</italic>), in which case the imaging model becomes
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="555799v1_eqn6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We use a ‘prospective’ approach to correct for <italic>S</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) and <italic>b</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) as follows. For each segmented cell in an image, we compute the average intensity in a box of dimensions 50 by 50 pixels located 15 pixels above the cell trench (see Fig. S11A). This in effect estimates <italic>b</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) at the <italic>x</italic> position of just above each cell trench. In each image, this <italic>b</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is removed from the <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>meas</italic></sup>(<italic>x</italic>) measurements of each segmented cell. To estimate the uneven illumination gain function <italic>S</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) we pool all of the single cell fluorescence measurements according to their horizontal pixel position <italic>x</italic>. Data is binned into bins of size 50 pixels and averages are taken at each bin (see Fig. S11B). The resulting curve gives an estimate of ⟨<italic>I</italic><sup><italic>F P</italic></sup> + <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>af</italic></sup> + <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>media</italic></sup> ⟩ × <italic>S</italic>(<italic>x</italic>). To estimate <italic>S</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) we fit the curve with a 3rd degree polynomial <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>(<italic>x</italic>). To correct for the uneven illumination gain function we multiply the fluorescence measurements by the reciprocal of <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>(<italic>x</italic>):

<title>Autofluorescence and fluorescing media</title>
<p>The preceding section described how the background and the uneven illumination were corrected using the linear gain imaging model of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn6">Eq. (6)</xref>. Even with the background correction, the fluorescence profile across growth chambers empty of cells is not negligible compared to the profiles of some cell-containing chambers, see Fig. S11. This indicates that media fluorescence is not negligible in experiments with strains that produce low levels of fluorescence. Here we show how we estimated the autofluorescence <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup> and the media fluorescence <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>media</italic></sup> to obtain the sought after fluorescent protein fluorescence <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>FP</italic></sup> .</p>
<p>In each mother machine experiment there was a subset of cells that lost the synthetic circuit plasmid due to random partitioning at cell division. These cells were used to estimate <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup> + <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>media</italic></sup>. Cells that lost the plasmid were identified manually by observing single-cell traces: When a cell loses the plasmid, the CFP and YFP fluorescence decay rapidly and reach a constant low signal level for the remainder of the experiment, see Fig. S10. The segments of the time traces at constant low signal level were cut and saved, with the autofluorescence and the media fluorescence taken as the average fluorescence of the saved traces. Around 10–30 cases of plasmid loss occur for each strain in a mother machine experiment.</p>
<p>Note that <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup> and <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>media</italic></sup> do not need to be corrected in the RFP channel measurements. This is because RFP is taken as the component either affected or not affected by <italic>X</italic>. For the systems in which RFP is not affected by <italic>X</italic>, any <italic>function</italic> of RFP (like adding autofluorescence and media fluorescence) will also not be affected by <italic>X</italic> and the invariant of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> will be satisfied. Alternatively, if <italic>X</italic> affects RFP, then it will generally also affect any typically expected function of RFP. We did not correct for <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup> and <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>media</italic></sup> in the RFP channel because a fraction of circuits have RFP located on the chromosome and not the plasmid.</p>

<title>Estimating confidence intervals</title>
<p>The corrections from the preceding sections rely on the distribution of single-cell measurements. As a result, sampling error affects the accuracy of the corrections, along with the final estimators of the normalized covariances. We applied two methods to estimate normalized covariance confidence intervals by taking into account sampling error and its effect on the corrections.</p>
<p>First we use bootstrapping, where the data corrections and the normalized covariances are computed over many samples of the data, allowing for replacement in sampling. If an experiment produces <italic>N</italic> single-cell traces of cells with plasmid, and <italic>M</italic> single-cell traces of cells that lost the plasmid, random samples of size <italic>N</italic> and <italic>M</italic> of each respective ensemble are taken. The corrections from the previous sections are then applied using the samples, with the corrected data pooled into a distribution from which the normalized covariances are computed. This is repeated until 100 normalized covariances <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>sample</italic></sub> have been computed for each sample. The final reported normalized covariance corresponds to the average over the <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>sample</italic></sub>, with confidence intervals given by twice the standard deviation. See Fig. S12 and SI Sec. 13 for details.</p>
<p>Second we use sampling without replacement, where the single-cell traces from each experiment are divided into 7 to 10 disjoint sets, and the corrections and the normalized covariances are computed for each set. The reported normalized covariances correspond to the average of those computed from the sets, with error bars being the standard error of the mean (see SI Sec. 13 for details).</p>
<p>A single mother machine experiment typically produced 100–500 single-cell traces of cells with plasmid, and 7–30 single-cell traces of cells that lost the plasmid due to random partitioning at division. The computed normalized covariances from the bootstrapping method are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,E</xref>, while those from the alternative splitting method shown in Fig. S2. The two methods give similar results.</p>

<title>Growth rate estimation</title>

To estimate the growth rate from the single-cell traces we assume exponential growth between division events.</p>
<p>In that case, if there is no division event that occurs at time frames <italic>i</italic>−1, <italic>i</italic>, and <italic>i</italic>+1, then the growth rate at time <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is computed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="555799v1_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the cell length at time <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>−1</sub> is the length at the preceding frame, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>+1</sub> is the length at the subsequent frame, and Δ<italic>t</italic> is the time between frames (5–8 min). If there is a division event at the subsequent frame <italic>i</italic> + 1, then the growth rate is computed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="555799v1_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript presents a method to infer causality between two genes (and potentially proteins or other molecules) based on the non-genetic fluctuations among cells using a version of the dual-reporter assay as a causal control, where one half of the dual-reporter pair is causally decoupled, as it is inactive. The authors propose a statistical invariant identity to formalize this idea.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The paper outlines a theoretical formalism, which, if experimentally used, can be useful in causal network inference, which is a great need in the study of biological systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The practical utility of this method may not be straightforward and potentially be quite difficult to execute. Additionally, further investigations are needed to provide evidence of the broad applicability of the method to naturally occurring systems and its scalability beyond the simple circuit in which it is experimentally demonstrated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This paper describes a new approach to detecting directed causal interactions between two genes without directly perturbing either gene. To check whether gene X influences gene Z, a reporter gene (Y) is engineered into the cell in such a way that (1) Y is under the same transcriptional control as X, and (2) Y does not influence Z. Then, under the null hypothesis that X does not affect Z, the authors derive an equation that describes the relationship between the covariance of X and Z and the covariance of Y and Z. Violation of this relationship can then be used to detect causality.</p>
<p>The authors benchmark their approach experimentally in several synthetic circuits. In four positive control circuits, X is a TetR-YFP fusion protein that represses Z, which is an RFP reporter. The proposed approach detected the repression interaction in two or three of the positive control circuits. The authors constructed sixteen negative control circuit designs in which X was again TetR-YFP, but where Z was either a constitutively expressed reporter or simply the cellular growth rate. The proposed method detected a causal effect in two of the sixteen negative controls, which the authors argue is not a false positive, but due to an unexpected causal effect. Overall, these pilot studies, albeit in simplified scenarios, provide encouraging results.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The idea of a &quot;no-causality control&quot; in the context of detected directed gene interactions is a valuable conceptual advance that could potentially see play in a variety of settings where perturbation-based causality detection experiments are made difficult by practical considerations.</p>
<p>By proving their mathematical result in the context of a continuous-time Markov chain, the authors use a more realistic model of the cell than, for instance, a set of deterministic ordinary differential equations.</p>
<p>Caveats:</p>
<p>
The term &quot;causally&quot; is used in the main-text statement of the central theorem (Eq 2) without a definition of this term. This makes it difficult to fully understand the statement of the paper's central theorem without diving into the supplement.</p>
<p>The basic argument of theorem 1 appears to rely on establishing that x(t) and y(t) are independent of their initial conditions. Yet, there appear to be some scenarios where this property breaks down:</p>
<p>(1) Theorem 1 does not seem to hold in the edge case where R=beta=W=0, meaning that the components of interest do not vary with time, or perhaps vary in time only due to measurement noise. In this case x(t), y(t), and z(t) depend on x(0), y(0), and z(0). Since the distributions of x(0), y(0), and z(0) are unspecified, a counterexample to the theorem may be readily constructed by manipulating the covariance matrix of x(0), y(0), and z(0).</p>
<p>(2) A similar problem may occur when transition probabilities decay with time. For example, suppose that again R=0 and X are degraded by a protease (B), but this protease is subject to its own first-order degradation. The deterministic version of this situation can be written, for example, dx/dt=-bx and db/dt=-b. In this system, x(t) approaches x(0)exp(-b(0)) for large t. Thus, as above, x(t) depends on x(0). If similar dynamics apply to the Y and Z genes, we can make all genes depend on their initial conditions, thus producing a pathology analogous to the above example.</p>
<p>The reviewer does not know when such examples may occur in (bio)physical systems. Nevertheless, since one of the advantages of mathematics is the ability to correctly identify the domain of validity for a claim, the present work would be strengthened by &quot;building a fence&quot; around these edge cases, either by identifying the comprehensive set of such edge cases and explicitly prohibiting them in a stated assumption set, or by pointing out how the existing assumptions already exclude them.</p>
