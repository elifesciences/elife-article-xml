<abstract><p>Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is an antiviral interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that has several known anti-influenza functions. However, the mechanisms in relation to its expression compartment and enzymatic activity have not been completely explored. Moreover, only limited animal models have been studied to delineate its role at the tissue level in influenza infections. Our results showed that Plscr1 expression was highly induced by influenza A virus (IAV) infection <italic>in vivo</italic> and in airway epithelial cells treated with IFN-λ. We found that infected <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice exhibited exacerbated body weight loss, decreased survival rates, heightened viral replication, and increased lung damage. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that Plscr1 was required for the expression of type 3 interferon receptor (Ifn-λr1) and a large subset of ISGs upon IAV infection. The impaired expression of Ifn-λr1 and downstream ISGs may be responsible for delayed viral clearance and worse lung inflammation in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. PLSCR1 acts as a transcriptional activator of <italic>IFN-</italic>λ<italic>R1</italic> by directly binding to its promotor after IAV infection. In addition, PLSCR1 interacted with IFN-λR1 on the cell surface of pulmonary epithelial cells following IAV infection, suggesting it also modulated IFN-λ signaling via protein-protein interactions. The lipid scramblase activity of PLSCR1 was found to be dispensable for its anti-flu activity. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing data indicated that <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression was significantly upregulated in ciliated airway epithelial cells in mice following IAV infection. Consistently, <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>Foxj1-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice with ciliated epithelial cell-specific Plscr1 overexpression showed reduced susceptibility to IAV infection, less inflammation and enhanced Ifn-λr1 expression, suggesting that Plscr1 primarily regulates type 3 IFN signaling as a cell intrinsic defense factor against IAV in ciliated airway epithelial cells. Our research will elucidate virus-host interactions and pave the way for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs that target human elements like PLSCR1, thereby mitigating the emergence of drug-resistant IAV strains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is highly contagious and causes acute respiratory infectious disease transmitted by virus-containing droplets. Its segmented gene and wide host range facilitate frequent antigenic shift during coinfection, posing a significant threat to human health. IAV has caused several pandemics in human history, and seasonal flu remains a major health burden in present days, despite annual vaccination efforts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Existing anti-flu drugs mainly target influenza virus proteins: 1) penetration and shelling inhibitors, such as Gocovri (amantadine) and Flumadine (Rimantadine); 2) neuraminidase inhibitors, such as Relenza (zanamivir), Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate), Rapivab (peramivir) and Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. However, the emergence of drug-resistant variant strains is common. Moreover, these direct antivirals have a short therapeutic window and are the most effective only if given within the first 48 hours after the initial infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. In addition, IAV-induced acute inflammation could persist, leading to severe complications such as life-threatening pneumonia, immunopathology, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand host immune responses and develop anti-influenza drugs targeting host factors.</p>
<p>At the center of anti-flu immunity are the interferon (IFN) pathways. Discovered a mere two decades ago, type 3 IFNs were initially perceived as redundant to type 1 IFNs, given their shared intracellular signaling pathways and antiviral activities. However, recent studies have revealed their unique properties, notably their signaling through a pair of heterodimer receptors (IFN-λR1/IL-10R2) distinct from type 1 IFN receptor complex (IFN-αR1/IFN-αR2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. First of all, IFN-λ exhibits a more constrained expression pattern compared to type 1 IFNs. While the cellular sources of type 1 IFNs in viral infections depend on the infection route and the tissue tropism, they can be produced by a large variety of cell types, including epithelial, parenchymal, immune and stromal cells, to combat infections in the skin, mucosal, organ, lymph node, and at the systemic level[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In contrast, IFN-λ is primarily secreted by cells at barrier surfaces, such as respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelial cells, DCs and macrophages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Moreover, their receptor distributions are vastly different. IFN-αR1/IFN-αR2 complex is present on nearly all cell types, but IFN-λR1/IL-10R2 complex is expressed exclusively on epithelial cells and few immune cells, including neutrophils and subsets of dendritic cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Most importantly, IFN-λ is produced earlier than type 1 interferons in IAV infection and can elicit effective antiviral responses without inflammation such as the release of tissue-damaging mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1β from neutrophils. In fact, only under a high dose of IAV are type 1 interferons detected, contributing to tissue immunopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Another exclusive anti-flu mechanism of IFN-λ is its role in preventing viral transmission from the upper airways to the lungs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Taken together, IFN-λ provides a non-redundant front-line shield against influenza virus.</p>
<p>IFNs secreted by infected cells signal neighboring cells to enter an antiviral state by inducing the expression of hundreds of ISGs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. PLSCR1, the most studied member of the phospholipid scramblase protein family, is one such ISG, with its expression highly induced by type 1, 2 and 3 interferons in various viral infections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. It is a type II transmembrane protein generally located on the cell membrane, but can be imported into the nucleus and act as a transcriptional factor to regulate several gene expressions by directly binding to their promoter regions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. PLSCR1 is detected in all tissues and has a relatively high expression in lung. Although it is universally expressed across various cell types in the lung including alveolar epithelial cells and lymphocytes, macrophages have the highest expression, followed by endothelial cells and respiratory ciliated cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The main function of PLSCR1 is to catalyze Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, ATP-independent, bidirectional and non-specific translocation of phospholipids between inner &amp; outer leaflet of plasma membrane. Scrambling of membrane phospholipids results in the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), which acts as a docking site for many biological processes including coagulation, apoptosis, and activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies have described some critical anti-influenza activities of PLSCR1. For example, PLSCR1 interacts with the nucleoprotein (NP) of IAV, impairing its nuclear import and thereby suppressing virus replication in A549 cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. In addition, Plscr1 competes with immunoglobulin-like domain-containing receptor 1 (ILDR1) for NP binding, inhibiting swine influenza virus (SIV) infection in mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Besides direct interactions with the virus, PLSCR1 interacts with toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 and regulates its trafficking and ability to induce type I interferon production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, PLSCR1 is required to potentiate the expression of numerous other ISGs in response to IFN-β in Hey1B cells, including p56, ISG15 and OAS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The goals of this project are to determine the roles of Plscr1 in an IAV-infected mouse model, to implicate its involvement in IFN-λ signaling, and to elucidate the cell types responsible for Plscr1-mediated anti-influenza activities.</p>
<p>To address this knowledge gap, we have employed a systematic approach, leveraging both global and cell type-specific <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Plscr1</italic> knock-in overexpression mice infected with mouse-adapted human IAV. Human respiratory epithelial cell lines harboring PLSCR1 mutations have also been used to elucidate the subcellular roles of PLSCR1. Our findings demonstrate that Plscr1 is an IFN-λ-stimulated gene, and it protects mice against IAV Infection by regulating <italic>IFN-</italic>λ<italic>R1</italic> gene expression in the nucleus and interacting with IFN-λR1 protein on the cell membrane in ciliated airway epithelial cells. Our research will aid in the understanding of virus-host interactions and the development of novel anti-influenza therapeutics targeting human components, preventing the emergence of drug-resistant IAV strains.</p>

<title>Plscr1 Suppresses Viral Replication and Protects Mice in IAV Infection</title>
<p>To uncover any anti-influenza functions of Plscr1 in mice, we employed <italic>Wt</italic> and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice and exposed them to IAV infection. We pursued a systematic approach including multiple endpoints and parameters to monitor mouse health, viral replication and dissemination, antiviral and inflammatory responses, and tissue damage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We established 300 plaque-forming unit (pfu) of IAV as the sublethal dose, and 900 pfu as the lethal dose resulting in ∼50% mortality in <italic>Wt</italic> mice (LD50). Significantly higher <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression was observed in <italic>Wt</italic> infected mice at 3 days post infection (dpi) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that Plscr1 is induced and potentially functions as an antiviral ISG in IAV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM of n = 30 mice/group for weight loss post sublethal infection and n=8 mice/group for weight loss and survival rate post lethal infection. For the rest analysis, n= 5-10 mice/group. All data were pooled from three independent experiments. Logrank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to compare survival rates. Ordinary two-way ANOVA tests were used to compare weight losses. *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001. dpi, days post infection. CTCF, Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence.</p>

<p>Weight loss generally started at 3 dpi for both mouse strains. <italic>Wt</italic> infected mice reached their lowest weights around 8 dpi, while <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>infected mice experienced continued weight loss for an additional 2 days. <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice exhibited significantly greater weight loss compared to <italic>Wt</italic> mice with both sublethal and lethal dose infection at multiple timepoints (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Moreover, upon infection with 900pfu lethal dose of IAV, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had a significantly lower survival rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In fact, 100% of <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice died with 900 pfu of IAV in our experiment by 10 dpi.</p>
<p>We used three assays to robustly and comprehensively measure the viral burden in these animals. First, qRT-PCR analysis using cryopreserved lungs showed that IAV M gene segment mRNA was significantly higher in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> lungs at 3 dpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). This observation was further supported by the plaque assay, which measures infectious virus particles, and the IAV titer was significantly higher in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>lungs at 3 dpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Finally, to visualize IAV burden and spread from upper respiratory tract, paraffin-embedded lung sections were stained for H1N1-FITC. In contrast to <italic>Wt</italic> lungs where IAV infection was mostly local and restricted to major airways, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>lungs had viral dissemination extending from bronchioles to alveoli, with ∼50% of lungs infected. Moreover, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> lungs had significantly higher corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) than <italic>Wt</italic> lungs at 3 dpi, suggesting an overall higher viral burden during acute infection in the absence of Plscr1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>).</p>

<p>Lung sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and histopathology was assessed. <italic>Plscr1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> lungs showed minor and localized tissue damage as early as at 3 dpi, when <italic>Wt</italic> lungs appeared normal. Consistently, aggravated immunopathology was evident in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>lungs at 7 and 10 dpi compared to <italic>Wt</italic> lungs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These observations included increased thickening and collapse of alveolar walls, pulmonary edema surrounding alveolar walls, inflammatory cell infiltration in peri-bronchial and parenchymal areas, and hyperemia in the absence of Plscr1, suggesting its role in maintaining tissue homeostasis in IAV infection.</p>
<p>To assess the role of Plscr1 as an ISG, IFN expressions in whole lungs were measured by qRT-PCR. We found significantly elevated levels of <italic>Ifn-</italic>α, β, γ and λ expression in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, particularly in early infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). This upregulation was associated with heightened production of Tnf-α and Ifn-λ in the BAL at 3 dpi, as assessed by ELISA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).

On the contrary, the expressions of these mediators in <italic>Wt</italic> mice were well controlled, facilitating virus elimination without inciting excessive inflammation.

<title>Plscr1 Binds to <italic>Ifn-</italic><bold>λ</bold><italic>r1</italic> Promoter and Activates <italic>Ifn-</italic><bold>λ</bold><italic>r1</italic> Transcription in IAV Infection</title>
<p>To determine if IFN signaling pathways are regulated by Plscr1 during IAV infection, RNA sequencing of a total of 20,700 genes was performed using pooled samples from <italic>Wt</italic> and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse lungs infected with 300 pfu of IAV. A comprehensive examination of interferons and their receptors revealed that <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> expression was significantly lower in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice, despite high expression of <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ at both 3 and 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> was the only IFN receptor exhibiting this pattern, as the expression of its coreceptor <italic>Il10-r</italic>β and other IFN receptors remained unaltered. Inflammatory cytokines including type 1 and 2 IFNs, <italic>Tnf-</italic>α and <italic>Il-1b</italic> were also highly expressed in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>infected mice, suggesting upstream cytokine production pathways were intact. The RNA sequencing result was further validated by qRT-PCR, which showed that <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice failed to upregulate <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> expression at both 3 and 7 dpi compared to <italic>Wt</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, using the online Interferome database[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], we identified a total of 1,113 ISGs in our dataset with a fold change ≥2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Enlarged heatmaps with gene names are provided in Supplemental Figure 1. Among those ISGs, 584 are regulated exclusively by type 1 IFNs, and 488 are regulated by both type 1 and type 2 interferons. Unfortunately, the Interferome database does not include information on type 3 IFN-inducible genes in mice. Although many ISGs were robustly upregulated in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> infected lungs, consistent with inflammation data, a large subset of ISGs failed to be transcribed when <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> function was impaired, especially at 7 dpi. We suspect that those non-transcribed ISGs in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may be specifically regulated by type 3 IFN and represent interesting targets for future research. As a result, disrupted type 3 interferon signaling due to impaired expression of <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> may underlie the delayed viral clearance and exacerbated immunopathology observed in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>

<p>To corroborate the cell-specific localization of Ifn-λr1 expression, <italic>Wt</italic> IAV-infected mouse lungs were probed with immunofluorescent antibodies to detect Ifn-λr1 and Foxj1 (a marker for ciliated epithelial cells), Uteroglobin (a marker for club cells) or Sftpc (a marker for type 2 alveolar epithelial (AT2) cells). Consistent with previous studies, Ifn-λr1 was present on all of these epithelial cell types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We further quantified Ifn-λr1 expression in selected airways by measuring mean intensity to disregard the differences in airway areas. Ifn-λr1 expression in alveoli were measured using Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF), so that all fluorescent signals within the same size of alveolar areas were analyzed. Expression of Ifn-λr1 was significantly reduced in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse lungs, in both airways and alveoli regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Calu-3 epithelial cells were then used to investigate if <italic>PLSCR1</italic> expression can be regulated by IFN-λ. Using qRT-PCR, we found <italic>PLSCR1</italic> transcription was significantly increased when stimulated with IFN-λ, and this effect was attenuated by pre-incubation with α-hIFNLR1 neutralizing antibody (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Additionally, IFN-λ could directly stimulate the expression of its receptor, <italic>IFN-</italic>λ<italic>R1</italic>, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop to further drive the expression of <italic>PLSCR1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). These studies demonstrate that <italic>PLSCR1</italic> is an ISG that can be directly stimulated by IFN-λ in airway epithelial cells.</p>
<p>We subsequently investigated the mechanism underlying Plscr1’s transcriptional regulation of <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> in airway epithelial cells. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by standard PCR in IAV-infected Calu-3 cells unveiled that Plscr1 physically bound to the promoter region of <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic>, with this binding becoming more evident in IAV-infected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). These results were further validated using real-time quantitative PCR, suggesting that Plscr1 translocated into the nucleus of lung epithelial cells upon IAV infection to activate <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> transcription (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>).</p>
<p>To further determine the regulation of Ifn-λr1 by Plscr1 in response to Ifn-λ signaling without the complexities associated with live virus infection, high molecular weight poly(I:C) was administered intranasally to mice daily for 6 days at 2.5mg/kg of body weight, and mice were sacrificed on the following day (Supplemental Figure 2A). We observed an increase in total BAL cell counts with poly(I:C) administration, although there was no difference between <italic>Wt</italic> and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice (Supplemental Figure 2B). However, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited a significantly higher number of lymphocytes in BAL (Supplemental Figure 2C), indicating that repetitive poly(I:C) administration might activate adaptive immune responses rather than the innate immune system in an acute IAV infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). All interferon expressions were elevated following poly(I:C) administration, with comparable levels observed between <italic>Wt</italic> and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Supplemental Figure 2D). Consistently, lung histopathology exhibited similar levels of inflammation or tissue damage in both <italic>Wt</italic> and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice (Supplemental Figure 2E). Importantly, <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression was significantly induced by poly(I:C) (Supplemental Figure 2F). Notably, although no other phenotypical or genotypical variances were observed in poly(I:C)-treated <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> expression was significantly lower in these mice, further affirming the requirement of Plscr1 for <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> expression in response to IFN-λ (Supplemental Figure 2G).</p>

<title>Plscr1 Interacts with Ifn-<bold>λ</bold>r1 on Pulmonary Epithelial Cell Membrane in IAV Infection</title>
<p>We employed a combination of multiple biophysical approaches to fully assess the potential protein interaction between Plscr1 and Ifn-λr1. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by western blot demonstrated that Plscr1 successfully pulled down Ifn-λr1 in both uninfected and IAV-infected <italic>Wt</italic> mouse lungs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and Supplemental Figure 3). Since the co-IP assay may detect indirect interactions through intermediate partners, we used proximity ligation assay (PLA) as a more precise method to identify direct interactions. Consistently, using PLA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), we detected direct interactions between Ifn-λr1 and Plscr1 on airway and alveolar epithelial cells in <italic>Wt</italic> mouse lungs. Noteworthily, significantly more and stronger PLA signals per area were detected in IAV-infected lungs compared to uninfected lungs. In agreement with the PLA, in unpermeablized Calu-3 cells, Plscr1 and Ifn-λr1 colocalized on the cell membrane after IAV infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, neither colocalization nor clear expression of Plscr1 or Ifn-λr1 was evident without infection, implying an infection-specific interaction in human airway epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Hence, Plscr1 may regulate Ifn-λr1 expression and IFN-λ signaling in airway epithelial cells through both gene transcription and protein interaction in IAV infection.</p>

<title>Both Cell Surface and Nuclear PLSCR1 Regulates IFN-<bold>λ</bold> Signaling and Limits IAV Infection Independent of Its Enzymatic Activity</title>
<p>PLSCR1 mutants with specific PLSCR1 cellular distribution were employed to determine the relative contributions of cell surface and nuclear PLSCR1 in regulating IFN-λ signaling and IAV infection. PLSCR1 contains a 5-cysteine palmitoylation motif (C<sup>184</sup>CCPCC<sup>189</sup>), where substitution of these cysteines with alanine (labeled 5CA) completely abolishes its membrane localization, leading to exclusive localization in the cytosol and nucleus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. On the other hand, a single amino acid mutation of histidine<sup>262</sup> to tyrosine (labeled H262Y) in the non-classical nuclear localization signal of PLSCR1 completely abates its nuclear localization, leaving PLSCR1 exclusively in the cytosol and on the cell membrane[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In addition, given that PS externalization plays a role in cell death regulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], we asked whether the enzymatic activity of PLSCR1 interferes with IFN-λ signaling. Phenylalanine<sup>281</sup> in the β-barrel hydrophobic loop region of PLSCR1 has been shown to be important for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PS exposure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], and a substitution with alanine (labeled F281A) renders PLSCR1 enzymatically inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>PLSCR1(WT), PLSCR1(5CA), PLSCR1(H262Y)</italic> and <italic>PLSCR1(F281A)</italic> plasmids built on PLV-EF1a-IRES-Hygro backbone were amplified in DH5α competent cells, co-transfected with HIV lentivector into 293T cells, and transduced into <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> A549 cells. After a 10-day hygromycin selection, transduction efficiency and subcellular locations of PLSCR1 were analyzed using flow cytometry (Supplemental Figure 4A). <italic>PLSCR1(WT)</italic> exhibited higher PLSCR1 expression than <italic>Plscr1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells, indicating overexpression resulting from transduction (Supplemental Figure 4B). Consistent with previous findings, <italic>PLSCR1(5CA)</italic> exhibited low surface expression, and <italic>PLSCR1(H262Y)</italic> had low nuclear expression of PLSCR1. <italic>PLSCR1(F281A)</italic> showed a similar distribution compared to <italic>PLSCR1(WT)</italic>, confirming that the loss of enzymatic activity did not restrict the subcellular localization.

<p>When compared to <italic>PLSCR1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells, <italic>PLSCR1(WT)</italic>, <italic>PLSCR1(5CA)</italic> and <italic>PLSCR1(F281A)</italic> provided similar protection against IAV infection.

This is further validated with a cell coverage assay when a high dose IAV was used for infection. Since the proliferation between differently transduced cell lines was similar and all cells were grown to full confluency before infection, the cell coverage represented resistance to infection and survival of cells.

Conversely, AT2 cells, epithelial-mesenchymal transitional cells and Krt8+ cells exhibited very low levels of <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression.

<p>For the predominant ciliated epithelial cell cluster, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the differentially expressed genes to compare potentially distinct functions before and after infection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). We found that the most upregulated pathways at 1 dpi were related to protein folding and localization, indicating a rapid cellular response to infection by altering their protein profile. At 21 dpi, ciliated epithelial cells were characterized by adaptive immune regulation, such as antigen presentation and memory cell generation. At 3 and 6 dpi, ciliated epithelial cells exhibited similar innate immune and inflammatory signatures dominated by interferon signaling. As expected, <italic>Plscr1</italic> participated in all of the top 10 enriched pathways, implying that it could facilitate robust antiviral responses in ciliated epithelial cells as an ISG during acute infection.</p>
<p>Gene expression levels of the most differentially expressed genes at individual timepoints in ciliated epithelial cells were shown in a heatmap (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Signature genes for cells at homeostasis included <italic>Jund</italic> (JunD proto-oncogene), <italic>mt-Nd3</italic> (mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 3) and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C), which are regulators of cell metabolism and proliferation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Signature genes enriched at 1 dpi were <italic>Hspa5</italic> (heat shock protein family A member 5), <italic>Hsph1</italic> (heat shock protein family H member 1) and <italic>Clu</italic> (clusterin), which play critical roles in protein folding and assembly[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Consistent with the GO analysis, ciliated cells at 3 and 6 dpi had very similar signature genes associated with interferon pathways, namely a large component of ISGs, such as <italic>Isg15</italic> (interferon-stimulated gene 15), <italic>Oasl2</italic> (2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase like 2) and <italic>Irf7</italic> (interferon regulatory factor 7). Importantly, Plscr1 is required to potentiate the expressions of many of these ISGs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], highlighting its potentially multifunction in anti-flu responses of ciliated epithelial cells. Signature genes for 21 dpi largely overlapped with those for 10 dpi, containing many histocompatibility 2, class II antigen proteins, which are mediators of MHC class II antigen processing and presentation.</p>
<p>In contrast to epithelial clusters, immune populations had low levels of <italic>PLSCR1</italic>, with relatively high expressions observed in alveolar macrophages, NK cells and regulatory T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). However, we did not observe any significant difference in PLSCR1 levels before and post-infection in macrophages and neutrophils (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>), the two immune populations that express IFN-λR1 besides dendritic cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Hence, the anti-influenza activities we described are unlikely to be carried out by immune cells.</p>

<title>Overexpression of Plscr1 in Ciliated Epithelial Cell, but Not Myeloid Cell, Is Sufficient to Provide Anti-Flu Protection through IFN-<bold>λ</bold> Signaling</title>
<p>To further validate the relevant contributions of ciliated epithelial cells versus myeloid populations including macrophages and neutrophils, we generated <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus targeted <italic>Plscr1</italic> conditional knock-in transgenic mice (<italic>Rosa26-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-Plscr1 Tg</italic>; labeled <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup></italic>). These mice were bred with <italic>Foxj1-Cre</italic> or <italic>LysM-Cre</italic> mice to overexpress Plscr1 in ciliated epithelial cells or myeloid cells respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Overexpression was confirmed by qRT-PCR with whole lung lysate and immunofluorescence staining at baseline (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B, 7C</xref> and Supplemental Figure 8A). At 3 dpi with sublethal IAV infection, <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>Foxj1-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>mice lost less body weight (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Moreover, they had lower viral copy numbers as measured by IAV M gene segment qRT-PCR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>), and lower infectious viral titer measured by plaque assays (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>) compared to <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup></italic> mice, indicating overexpression of Plscr1 in ciliated epithelial cells provides protection against flu infection. Concurrently, they had significantly lower total BAL cell counts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>), lower neutrophil percentages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>) and lower type 1 and 3 <italic>Ifn</italic> expressions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>). We then examined Ifn-λr1, and found that its transcription and protein expression were further increased in <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>Foxj1-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice during acute infection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>). Therefore, ciliated epithelial cell-specific overexpression of Plscr1 is sufficient to provide anti-influenza protection through IFN-λ signaling. In contrast, using similar approaches, we found that overexpression of Plscr1 in myeloid cells did not protect mice from IAV infection: <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>LysM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>mice exhibited comparable weight loss, total BAL cell counts, viral copy numbers, histopathology and expressions of interferons, <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> and <italic>Plscr1</italic> at both early and late timepoints examined (Supplemental Figure 8B-8I).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We are the first group to demonstrate the roles of Plscr1 in a mouse-adapted human IAV-infected mouse model, to implicate its IFN-λ signaling-related mechanisms, and to elucidate the cell types that are responsible for Plscr1-mediated anti-influenza activities. We established <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and found them more susceptible to IAV (WSN) compared to <italic>WT</italic> mice, as evidenced by greater weight loss in both sublethal and lethal infection and poorer survival in a lethal infection. Further examination of infected lungs provided the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence demonstrating that Plscr1 suppressed human IAV replication. This observation aligns with previous report indicating that PLSCR1 interacts with the IAV NP, thereby impairing its nuclear import <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Notably, while differences in viral copy numbers were only observed at the early stages of infection, coinciding with a significant increase in <italic>Plscr1</italic> transcription, these changes had profound implications for host fitness. Therefore, as one of the earliest induced ISGs, Plscr1 constitutes the frontline defense against influenza infection.</p>
<p>While the only previously published <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse flu model focused on an H1N1 SIV infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], our data showed both similarities and discrepancies. First, while both studies observed that Plscr1 promoted survival during IAV infection, SIV-infected <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice exhibited weight loss similar to <italic>Wt</italic> mice. Furthermore, while both models attributed the lower survival rate in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to increased viral replication, SIV-infected <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> lungs exhibited higher viral titers across all examined time points, from 1 to 7 dpi. Intriguingly, contrary to our observations, <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression was markedly decreased in SIV infection. Given previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrating PLSCR1 induction by IAV (WSN)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] and type 1 IFNs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], we propose that the contradictory trend observed by Liu et al. may be attributed to distinct properties of SIV, such as viral replication rate, both the cellular tropism and the tissue tropism (proximal or distal lung), or antigen variation which may affect direct interaction with PLSCR1, innate sensing of the infection, or recognition by the adaptive immune response.</p>
<p>The delicate balance between immunity and immunopathology plays a pivotal role in determining host fitness during viral infections. To interrogate immunopathology in the lungs, we accessed the BAL, histology and interferon expressions. BAL from <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were highly enriched with inflammatory neutrophils and lymphocytes, which were likely attracted by robust IFNs and other chemokines. Consistently, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice exhibited more severe lung damage and a greater extent of affected areas. These findings indicate that Plscr1 not only enhances immunity but also mitigates immunopathology. Importantly, regardless of excessive production of antiviral IFNs in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, they failed to effectively control the initial viral infection. This suggests that the absence of Plscr1 impairs the IFN signaling pathway, highlighting the crucial role of Plscr1 in facilitating effective antiviral responses.</p>
<p>Although type 1 and 3 IFNs may share similar downstream pathways, they rely on distinct receptors for signaling. Consistent with previous findings[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], Ifn-λr1 was detected in respiratory epithelium, including ciliated epithelial cells, club cells and AT2 cells during infection. Loss of Plscr1 impaired <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> transcription in IAV infection, with this transcriptional difference translating into protein expression. IFN-λ is crucial for early viral control within the initial days of infection without igniting unnecessary inflammation and compromising host fitness[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. With limited Ifn-λr1 expression, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were unable to mount a robust type 3 IFN response to control early viral infection. Instead, they relied largely on type 1 interferons, which succeeded in eliminating IAV at later time points, but led to exaggerated immunopathology. Furthermore, our observations of enhanced neutrophilia, lung injury and lethality in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice align with findings reported in <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice in IAV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. However, a discrepancy in <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1</italic> expression over the course of infection was observed between the RNA sequencing and the qRT-PCR data. While RNA-seq showed further upregulation of <italic>Ifn-</italic> λ<italic>r1</italic> at 7 dpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), qRT-PCR indicated a rapid downregulation at the same time point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The reason for this time-dependent discrepancy remains unclear and warrants further investigation. In addition, this study did not definitively establish causality between reduced Ifn-λ signaling and the observed <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype. The increased morbidity and mortality in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice could also be attributed to elevated Tnf-α levels and associated lung damage. Given that proinflammatory cytokines and/or enhanced lung damage are known contributors to influenza morbidity and mortality, future work will be needed to disentangle the impacts of TNF-α, IL-1β and other inflammatory cytokines from those of the IFN pathway to fully clarify the role of Plscr1 in antiviral defense.</p>
<p>PLSCR1 expression was increased in response to IFN-λ in human airway epithelial cells, consistent with previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. While PLSCR1 typically localizes on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm, it translocates into nucleus to bind the <italic>IFN-</italic>λ<italic>R1</italic> promoter upon IAV infection, thereby regulating <italic>IFN-</italic>λ<italic>R1</italic> transcription. The nuclear localization and functions of PLSCR1 have been extensively documented in previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Relevantly, IFN-α promotes the nuclear translocation of PLSCR1 in breast cancer cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Therefore, it is highly plausible that the nuclear trafficking of PLSCR1 in airway epithelial cells is similarly stimulated by IFN-α produced during IAV infection, but further evidence is demanded. Additionally, the precise binding site for PLSCR1 within the <italic>IFN-</italic>λ<italic>R1</italic> promoter and the binding motif on PLSCR1 remain unknown. Previous bioinformatics predictions revealed that the −430∼-421 segment of <italic>IFN-</italic>λ<italic>R1</italic> promoter likely contains binding sites for a number of transcription factors (TFs) with important regulatory functions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Further mutagenesis studies, such as truncations or single nucleotide mutations within these sequences, could be done to identify the specific motif for PLSCR1 binding. Finally, it is not clear whether PLSCR1 directly activates <italic>IFN-</italic>λ<italic>R1</italic> expression by acting as a TF, or as a co-factor enhancing other TF’s transcriptional activity. Coimmunoprecipitations could be pursued in future to explore the binding potential between PLSCR1 and other known TFs for <italic>IFN-</italic>λ<italic>R1</italic>, such as NF-Y[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to activities in the nucleus, PLSCR1 has been shown to interact with multiple proteins on the plasma or endosomal membrane[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Here we reported a novel interaction between PLSCR1 and IFN-λR1 on airway epithelial cell membrane <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, confirmed with both coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Since their interaction was significantly enhanced after IAV infection, we speculate that membrane-bound PLSCR1 is a positive regulator of IFN-λR1 signaling. One plausible mechanism is that PLSCR1 facilitates the intracellular trafficking of IFN-λR1, akin to its role in assisting the trafficking of other membrane receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>
<p>The subcellular location of PLSCR1 is vital not only for interactions with host components, but also for direct viral control. We found that nuclear PLSCR1 is both necessary and sufficient for viral control in airway epithelial cells, whereas membrane PLSCR1 provides only partial protection against IAV infection. These findings are not surprising, as the previously reported anti-flu mechanism of PLSCR1 also relies on its nuclear localization signal to restrict the import of IAV NP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, besides <italic>IFN-</italic>λ<italic>R1</italic>, PLSCR1 enhances the expression of a select subset of ISGs in IAV infection as well, a mechanism potentially mediated by nuclear PLSCR1 on ISG gene transcription[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. On the other hand, membrane PLSCR1 may modulate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, thereby augmenting the optimal anti-viral activity of these ISGs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. We found that membrane PLSCR1 interacts with IFN-λR1 protein in IAV infection, suggesting that it could facilitate viral elimination to some extent.</p>
<p>PLSCR1 is most well-known for its scramblase activity that favors PS exposure, apoptosis and phagocytosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Using an enzymatically inactive mutant of PLSCR1, we uncoupled its lipid scramblase activity from anti-influenza activity. There are several potential explanations for this finding. First, our epithelial cell culture lacked phagocytes, therefore the impact of apoptosis followed by phagocytosis induced by PLSCR1 is minimal. Future studies using mice that harbor <italic>Plscr1(F281A)</italic> mutation would be needed to verify the role of lipid scramblase activity and epithelial cell apoptosis in the presence of phagocytes. Second, PLSCR1 exhibits only weak enzymatic activities compared to other members of lipid scramblase family, possibly due to its vastly different central β-barrel structure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. PS externalization may be compensated by other more potent scramblases. Importantly, the lipid scramblase activity of PLSCR1 has been shown to be dispensable for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 function in a similar manner[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], suggesting a general lack of significance for its enzymatic activity in viral infections.</p>
<p>Although PLSCR1 has several previously described anti-influenza functions, including interfering with viral nuclear import[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], regulating TLR9 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], and potentiating the expression of other ISGs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], our studies have clarified the relative contribution of the type 3 IFN pathway to Plscr1-mediated anti-influenza immunity using <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice. We observed that <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were more susceptible to IAV infection than <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, suggesting that the complete loss of Ifn-λr1 results in worse protection than impaired Ifn-λr1 upregulation alone. Moreover, the previously identified anti-IAV functions of Plscr1 do not appear sufficient to compensate for the loss of Ifn-λr1 signaling in <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice. The absence of further disease exacerbation or increased viral titers in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice indicates that the anti-influenza activity of Plscr1 is largely dependent on Ifn-λr1.</p>
<p>While scRNA-seq analysis revealed that endothelial cells express Plscr1 most abundantly in the lung, they are not the major target of IAV infection, and IAV does not efficiently replicate in them[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Instead, airway epithelial cells are the frontline defense against respiratory pathogens, with ciliated epithelial cells being the only cell type that express α2,3-linked SA, the primary influenza virus receptor in the mouse airway[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Coincidently, our scRNA-seq results showed that ciliated epithelial cells not only had the highest aggregated expression of <italic>Plscr1</italic>, but also had the most significant increase in <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression in early IAV infection at 3 dpi. Experiments with <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>Foxj1-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>mice further supported ciliated epithelial cell-dependent protection against IAV, with improved immunity and viral clearance, and dampened immunopathology at as early as 3 dpi. These findings suggest that as a result of enhanced Ifn-λr1 due to Plscr1 overexpression, type 3 interferons were able to exert their advantages being the earliest produced interferon, mounting both antiviral and anti-inflammatory responses in ciliated epithelial cells. To further establish the causal relationship between Plscr1 and Ifn-λ signaling in airway ciliated epithelial cells, future experiments should focus on specifically overexpressing Plscr1 in ciliated epithelial cells on an <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background by breeding <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>Foxj1-Cre<sup>+</sup>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. In addition, ciliated epithelial cells isolated from <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>murine airways could be transduced with a <italic>Plscr1</italic> overexpression construct. We hypothesize that overexpression of Plscr1 in ciliated epithelial cells would not be able to rescue susceptibility in <italic>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice or cells, as the <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup>Ifn-</italic>λ<italic>r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model suggests that Plscr1’s Ifn-λr1-independent anti-influenza mechanisms are likely minor compared to its role in upregulating Ifn-λr1.</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings highlight the essential role of PLSCR1 in the regulation of IFN-λR1 transcription in nucleus and expression on plasma membrane, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These mechanisms are crucial for inhibiting viral spread, reducing inflammation, and enhancing overall host fitness during IAV infection. Further, we found that the enzymatic activity of PLSCR1 is dispensable for its anti-influenza function. Finally, ciliated airway epithelial cells are the primary cell type in the lung for mounting PLSCR1-mediated anti-influenza responses. The potential of PLSCR1 agonists that target ciliated airway epithelial cells as therapeutic treatments for influenza holds promise for future medical interventions. Moreover, our results have the potential to impact the classical yet evolving field of IFN signaling. Not only do these findings elucidate and expand our understanding of newly discovered IFN-λ signaling, but they also shed light on the specific cell types and conditions under which IFN-λ signaling is modulated. Given the significance of IFN-λ signaling in various infectious diseases, these insights may pave the way for innovative therapeutics approaches targeting corresponding regulatory molecules in the treatment of other microbial infections in addition to influenza.</p>

<p>This manuscript by Yang et al. presents a potentially novel mechanism by which Plscr1 defends against influenza virus infection. Using a global knockout (KO) and a tissue-specific overexpression mouse model, the authors demonstrate that Plscr1-KO mice exhibit increased susceptibility and inflammation following IAV infection. In contrast, overexpression of Plscr1 in ciliated epithelial cells protects mice from infection. Through transcriptomic analysis in mice and mechanistic studies in cell culture models, the authors reveal that Plscr1 transcriptionally upregulates Ifnlr1 expression and physically interacts with this receptor on the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing IFN-λ-mediated viral clearance.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a well-performed study, however, causality between Plscr1 and Ifnlr1 expression needs to be more firmly established. This is because two recent studies of PLSCR1 KO cells infected with different viruses found no major differences in gene expression levels compared with their WT controls (Xu et al. Nature, 2023; LePen et al. PLoS Biol, 2024). There were also defects in the expression of other cytokines (type I and II IFNs plus TNF-alpha) so a clear explanation of why Ifnlr1 was chosen should also be given.</p>
<p>While Plscr1 has long been recognized as a cell-intrinsic antiviral restriction factor, few studies have explored its broader physiological role. This study thus provides interesting insights into a specific function of Plscr1 in IAV-permissive airway epithelial cells and its contribution to whole body anti-viral immunity.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>Most of the requested changes and experiments have been done. One very informative experiment is the expression of Plscr1 in Ifnlr1-KO cells to determine if it still inhibits IAV infection. The authors have indicated that this experiment is currently being pursued by crossing mice to introduce Plscr1 expression into ciliated epithelial cells on an Ifnlr1 KO background. It will show if there are Ifnlr1-independent anti-flu activities that still require Plscr1.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Overall, it's a well-performed study, however, causality between Plscr1 and Ifnlr1 expression needs to be more firmly established. This is because two recent studies of PLSCR1 KO cells infected with different viruses found no major differences in gene expression levels compared with their WT controls (Xu et al. Nature, 2023; LePen et al. PLoS Biol, 2024). There were also defects in the expression of other cytokines (type I and II IFNs plus TNF-alpha) so a clear explanation of why Ifnlr1 was chosen should also be given.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s reference to the two recently published research on PLSCR1’s role in SARS-CoV-2 infections. We have also discussed those studies in the Introduction and Discussion sections of this manuscript. Here, we would like to clarify ourselves for the rationale of investigating Ifn-λr1 signaling.</p>
<p>The reviewer mentioned “defects in the expression of other cytokines (type I and II IFNs plus TNF-alpha)” and requested a clearer explanation of why Ifnlr1 was chosen for study. In our investigation of IAV infection, we observed no defects in the expression of type I and II IFNs or TNF-α in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice; rather, these cytokines were expressed at even higher levels compared to WT controls (Figures 2D and 3A). This indicates that the type I and II IFN and TNF-α signaling pathways remain intact and are not negatively affected by the loss of <italic>Plscr1</italic>. Notably, <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> expression is the only one among all IFNs and their receptors that is significantly impaired in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Figure 3A), justifying our focused investigation of this receptor. To further clarify this point, we have expanded the explanation under the section titled “Plscr1 Binds to Ifn-λr1 Promoter and Activates Ifn-λr1 Transcription in IAV Infection” within the Results. The reviewer noted that previously published studies “found no major differences in gene expression levels compared with their WT controls”, but neither study examined Ifn-λr1 expression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The authors propose that Plscr1 restricts IAV infection by regulating the type III IFN signaling pathway. While the data show a positive correlation between Ifnlr1 and Plscr1 levels in both mouse and cell culture models, additional evidence is needed to establish causality between the impaired type III IFN pathway, and the increased susceptibility observed in Plscr1-KO mice. To strengthen this conclusion, the following experiments could be undertaken: (i) Measure IAV titers in WT, Plscr1-KO, Ifnlr1-KO, and Plscr1/ Ifnlr1-double KO cells. If the antiviral activity of Plscr1 is highly dependent on Ifnlr1, there should be no further increase in IAV titers in double KO cells compared to single KO cells; (ii) over-express Plscr1 in Ifnlr1-KO cells to determine if it still inhibits IAV infection. If Plscr1's main action is to upregulate Ifnlr1, then it should not be able to rescue susceptibility since Ifnlr1 cannot be expressed in the KO background. If Plscr1 over-expression rescues viral susceptibility, then there are Ifnlr1-independent mechanisms involved. These experiments should help clarify the relative contribution of the type III IFN pathway to Plscr1-mediated antiviral immunity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that additional evidence is necessary to establish causality between the impaired type III IFN pathway and the increased susceptibility observed in Plscr1-KO mice. As requested by the reviewer, and one step further, we have measured IAV titers in <italic>Wt</italic>, <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse lungs, which provided us with more comprehensive information at the tissue and organismal level compared to cell culture models. Our results are detailed under “The Anti-Influenza Activity of Plscr1 Is Highly Dependent on Ifn-λr1” within “Results” section and in Supplemental Figure 5. Importantly, there was no further increase in weight loss (Supplemental Figure 5B), total BAL cell counts (Supplemental Figure 5C), neutrophil percentages (Supplemental Figure 5D), and IAV titers (Supplemental Figure 5E) in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse lungs compared to <italic>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse lungs. These findings indicate that the antiviral activity of Plscr1 is largely dependent on Ifn-λr1.</p>
<p>We agree that overexpression of Plscr1 on an <italic>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background would provide additional evidence to support our conclusion from the <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. In future studies, we plan to specifically overexpress Plscr1 in ciliated epithelial cells on the <italic>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background by breeding <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>Foxj1-Cre<sup>+</sup>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. In addition, ciliated epithelial cells isolated from <italic>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> murine airways could be transduced with a <italic>Plscr1</italic> construct for overexpression. We hypothesize that overexpression of Plscr1 in ciliated epithelial cells will not rescue susceptibility in <italic>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice or cells, since our <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model suggest that Ifn-λr1-independent anti-influenza functions of Plscr1 are likely minor compared to its role in upregulating Ifn-λr1. These future plans have been added to the “Discussion” section, and we look forward to presenting our results in a forthcoming publication.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 4, the authors demonstrate the interaction between Plscr1 and Ifnlr1. They suggest that this interaction modulates IFN-λ signaling. However, Figures 5C-E show that the 5CA mutant, which lacks surface localization and the ability to bind Ifnlr1, exhibits similar anti-flu activity to WT Plscr1. Does this mean the interaction between Plscr1 and Ifnlr1 is dispensable for Plscr1-mediated antiviral function? Can the authors compare the activation of IFN-λ signaling pathway in Plscr1-KO cells expressing empty vector, WT Plscr1, and 5CA mutant? This could be done by measuring downstream ISG expression or using an ISRE-luciferase reporter assay upon IFN-λ treatment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that downstream activation of the IFN-λ signaling pathway is a critical component of the proposed regulatory role of PLSCR1. As suggested, we attempted to perform an ISRE-luciferase reporter assay following IFN-λ treatment in PLSCR1 rescue cell lines by transfecting the cells with hGAPDH-rLuc (Addgene #82479) and pGL4.45 [luc2P/ISRE/Hygro] (Promega #E4041).</p>
<p>Despite extensive efforts over several months, we were unable to achieve expression of pGL4.45 [luc2P/ISRE/Hygro] in PLSCR1 rescue cells using either Lipofectamine 3000 or electroporation, as no firefly luciferase activity was detected at baseline or following IFN-λ treatment. In contrast, hGAPDH-rLuc was robustly expressed in these cells.</p>
<p>The pGL4.45 [luc2P/ISRE/Hygro] plasmid was obtained directly from Promega as a purified product, and its sequence was confirmed via whole plasmid sequencing. Additionally, both hGAPDH-rLuc and pGL4.45 [luc2P/ISRE/Hygro] were successfully expressed in 293T cells, indicating that neither the plasmids nor the transfection protocols are inherently faulty.</p>
<p>We suspect that prior modifications to the PLSCR1 rescue cells—such as CRISPR-mediated knockout and lentiviral transduction—may interfere with successful transfection of pGL4.45 [luc2P/ISRE/Hygro] through an as-yet-unknown mechanism. Although these results are disappointing, we will continue troubleshooting and plan to communicate in a separate manuscript once the luciferase assay is successfully established.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In the introduction, the linkage between the paragraph discussing type III IFN and PLSCR1 needs to be better established. The mention of PLSCR1 being an ISG at the outset may help connect these two paragraphs and make the text appear more logical.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the lack of linkage and logic between type 3 IFN and PLSCR1. We have introduced PLSCR1 as an ISG at the beginning of its paragraph as recommended.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The statement that, “Intriguingly, PLSCR1 is also an antiviral ISG, as its expression can be highly induced by type 1 and 2 interferons in various viral infections[15, 16]. However, whether its expression can be similarly induced by type 3 interferon has not been studied yet.” is incorrect. Xu et al. tested the role of PLSCR1 in type III IFN-induced control of SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 24). This needs to be revised.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the incorrect information in the introduction and have revised the paragraph with the proper citation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 3B, can the authors provide a comprehensive heatmap that includes all ISGs above the threshold, rather than only a subset? This would offer a more complete overview of the changes in type I, II, and III IFN pathways in Plscr1-KO mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have provided a comprehensive heatmap that includes all ISGs above the threshold in Figure 3C (previously Figure 3B). We identified a total of 1,113 ISGs in our dataset with a fold change ≥2. Enlarged heatmaps with gene names are provided in Supplemental Figure 1. Among those ISGs, 584 are regulated exclusively by type 1 IFNs, and 488 are regulated by both type 1 and type 2 interferons. Unfortunately, the Interferome database does not include information on type 3 IFN-inducible genes in mice[1]. Although many ISGs were robustly upregulated in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> infected lungs, consistent with inflammation data, a large subset of ISGs failed to be transcribed when <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> function was impaired, especially at 7 dpi. We suspect that those non-transcribed ISGs in <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may be specifically regulated by type 3 IFN and represent interesting targets for future research. These results have been added to “Plscr1 Binds to <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> Promoter and Activates <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> Transcription in IAV Infection” within “Results” section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 3C, 5B and 7H, immunoblots should also be included to measure changes of Ifnlr1/IFNLR1 protein level.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As requested by the reviewer, we have provided western blots measuring Ifn-λr1/IFN-λR1 protein level in Figure 5B and 7I. The protein expressions were consistent with the PCR results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 3H, the amount of RPL30 is also low in the anti-PLSCR1-treated and IgG samples, making it difficult to estimate if ChIP binding is genuinely impacted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>RPL30 Exon 3 serves as a negative control in the ChIP experiment and is not expected to bind either the anti-PLSCR1-treated or the IgG control samples. Anti-Histone H3 treatment is a positive control, with the treated sample expected to show binding to RPL30 Exon 3. We hope this clarification has addressed any further potential confusion from the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 4A, can the authors show a larger slice of the gel with molecular weight markers for both Plscr1 and Ifnlr1. In the coIP, the binding may be indirect through intermediate partners. Proximity ligation assay is a more direct assay for interaction and can be stated as such.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have included whole gel images of Figure 4A with molecular weight markers for both Plscr1 and Ifnlr1 in Supplemental Figure 3. We appreciate the reviewer’s affirmation of proximity ligation assay and have stated it as a more direct assay for interaction under “Plscr1 Interacts with Ifn-λr1 on Pulmonary Epithelial Cell Membrane in IAV Infection” in “Results” section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figure 5A, how is the expression of PLSCR1 WT and mutants driven by an EF-1α promoter can be further upregulated by IAV infection? Can the authors also use immunoblots to examine the protein level of PLSCR1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion and appreciate the reviewer’s careful observation. We were initially surprised by this finding as well, but upon further investigation, we found out that the human <italic>PLSCR1</italic> primers used in our qRT-PCR assay can still detect the transcription from the undisturbed portion of the endogenous <italic>PLSCR1</italic> mRNA, even in <italic>PLSCR1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells. In the original Figure 5A, data for vector-transduced PLSCR1<sup>-/-</sup> were not included because PCR was not performed on those samples at the time. After conducting PCR for vector-transduced PLSCR1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, we detected transcription of <italic>PLSCR1</italic>, which confirms that the signaling originates from endogenous DNA, but not from the EF-1α promoter-driven <italic>PLSCR1</italic> plasmid. Please see Author response image 1 below.</p>

<p>The forward human <italic>PLSCR1</italic> primer we used matches 15-34 nt of <italic>Wt PLSCR1</italic>, and the reverse primer matches 224-244 nt of <italic>Wt PLSCR1</italic>. CRISPR-Cas9 KO of <italic>PLSCR1</italic> was mediated by sgRNAs in A549 cells and was performed by Xu et al[2]. sgRNA #1 matches 227-246 nt, sgRNA #2 matches 209-228 nt, and sgRNA #3 matches 689-708 nt of <italic>Wt PLSCR1.</italic> The sgRNAs likely introduced a short deletion or insertion that does not affect transcription. However, those endogenous mRNA transcripts cannot be translated to functional and detectable PLSCR1 proteins, as validated by our western blot (below), as well as western blots performed by Xu et al[2]. Therefore, our primers could amplify endogenous <italic>PLSCR1</italic> transcripts upregulated by IAV infection, if 15-244 nt was not disturbed by CRISPR-Cas9 KO. By western blot, we confirmed that only endogenous PLSCR1 expression is upregulated by IAV infection, and exogenous protein expression of PLSCR1 plasmids driven by an EF-1α promoter are not upregulated by IAV infection.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion, we have removed the original Figure 5A from the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In Figure 5C, the loss of anti-flu activity with the H262Y mutant is modest, suggesting the loss of ifnlr1 transcription is only partly responsible for the susceptibility of Plscr1 KO cells. The anti-flu activity being independent of scramblase activity resembles the earlier discovery of SARS-CoV-2 (Xu et al., 2024). This could be stated in the results since it is an important point that scramblase activity is dispensable for several major human viruses and shifts the emphasis regarding mechanism. It has been appropriately noted in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciated the comments and have acknowledged the consistency of our results with those of Xu et al. under “Both Cell Surface and Nuclear PLSCR1 Regulates IFN-λ Signaling and Limits IAV Infection Independent of Its Enzymatic Activity” in the “Results” section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The statement that type I interferons are expressed by “almost all cells” is inaccurate (line 61). Type I IFN production is also context-dependent and often restricted to specific cell types upon infection or stimulation.</p>

<p>(2) The antiviral response is assessed solely through flu M gene expression. Incorporating infectious virus titers (e.g., TCID50 or plaque assay) would provide a more robust and direct measure of antiviral activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As requested by the reviewer, we have performed plaque assays on all experiments where flu M gene expression levels were measured (Figure 1G, 5E and 7F, and Supplemental Figure 6E). The plaque assay results are consistent with the flu M gene expressions.</p>

<p>(3) While mRNA expression of interferons is measured, protein levels (e.g., through ELISA) should also be quantified to establish the functional relevance of IFN expression changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As requested by the reviewer, we have quantified the protein level of IFN-λ in mouse BAL with ELISA (Figure 2E). The ELISA results are consistent with the mRNA expressions of IFN-λ.</p>

<p>(4) It is unclear whether reduced IFNLR1 expression translates to defective downstream signaling or antiviral responses after IFN-λ treatment in PLSCR1-deficient cells. This is particularly pertinent given the increase in IFN-λ ligand in vivo, which might compensate for receptor downregulation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that downstream activation of the IFN-λ signaling pathway is a critical aspect of PLSCR1’s proposed regulatory role. To investigate this, we attempted an ISRE-luciferase reporter assay to assess downstream signaling following IFN-λ treatment in PLSCR1 rescue cells. Unfortunately, the experiment encountered unforeseen technical issues. For additional context, please refer to our response to Reviewer #1’s public review #3.</p>

<p>(5) Detailed gating strategies for immune cell subsets are absent and should be included for clarity and reproducibility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify that the immune cell subsets in BAL fluids were counted manually following cytospin preparation and Diff-Quik staining (Figure 2B and 7H, and Supplemental Figures 2C, 5D, and 8D), rather than by flow cytometry. We hope this resolves the reviewer’s confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The study does not definitively establish that reduced IFN-λ signaling causes the observed in vivo phenotype. Increased morbidity and mortality in PLSCR1-deficient mice could also stem from elevated TNF-α levels and lung damage, as proinflammatory cytokines and/or enhanced lung damage are known contributors to influenza morbidity and mortality. This point warrants detailed discussions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agreed with the reviewer that this study does not guarantee a definitive causality between reduced IFN-λ signaling and increased morbidity of <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and more experiments are needed to reach the conclusion. We have acknowledged this limitation of our study in the “Discussion”, as requested by the reviewer. We hope to fully eliminate the confounding elements and definitively establish the proposed causality in future studies.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Yang et al. have investigated the role of PLSCR1, an antiviral interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), in host protection against IAV infection. Although some antiviral effects of PLSCR1 have been described, its full activity remains incompletely understood.</p>
<p>This study now shows that Plscr1 expression is induced by IAV infection in the respiratory epithelium, and Plscr1 acts to increase Ifn-λr1 expression and enhance IFN-λ signaling possibly through protein-protein interactions on the cell membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study sheds light on the way Ifnlr1 expression is regulated, an area of research where little is known. The study is extensive and well-performed with relevant genetically modified mouse models and tools.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are some issues that need to be clarified/corrected in the results and figures as presented.</p>
<p>Also, the study does not provide much information about the role of PLSCR1 in the regulation of Ifn-λr1 expression and function in immune cells. This would have been a plus.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the positive feedback and insightful comment regarding the roles of PLSCR1 and IFN-λR1 in immune cells. It is important to note that IFN-λR1 expression is highly restricted in immune cells and is primarily limited to neutrophils and dendritic cells[3]. While dendritic cells were not the focus of this study, we did examine all immune cell subsets in our single cell RNA seq data and performed infection experiments in <italic>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>/LysM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice. We have not observed any significant findings in these populations. On the other hand, we do have some interesting preliminary data suggesting a role for PLSCR1 in regulating Ifn-λr1 expression and function in neutrophils. These findings are discussed in detail in our response to reviewer #3’s recommendation #12.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1B, the Plscr1 label should be moved to the y-axis so that readers don't confuse it with the Plscr1-/- mice used in the other figure panels. The fact that WT mice were used should be added in the figure legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion in the figures. We have moved Plscr1 label to the y-axis in Figure 1B and have mentioned <italic>Wt</italic> mice were used in the figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 1C and D, the type of dose leading to the presented data should be added to help the reader. Also, shouldn't statistics be added?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion and have added doses to Figure 1C and 1D. We are confused about the request of adding statistics by the reviewer, as two-way ANOVA tests were used to compare weight losses, and the significance was labeled on the figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figures 1, F, and G, it is not indicated whether sublethal or lethal dose was used for the IAV infection. This should be very clear in the figure and figure legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion of infection doses used in the figures. We have added doses to Figure 1F, 1G and 1H.</p>

<p>(6) In Figures 3A and B, transcriptomes for each condition are from how many mice? Also, what do heatmaps show? Fold induction, differences, etc, and from what? What is compared with what? In addition, is there a discordance between the RNAseq data of Figure 3A and the qPCR data of Fig. 3C in terms of Ifnlr1 expression?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 3A and 3C (previously 3B), RNA from the whole lungs of 9 mice per PBS-treated group and 4 mice per IAV-infected group were pooled for transcriptomic analysis. Figure 3A represents a heatmap of differential gene expression, while Figure 3C (previously 3B) represents fold changes in gene expression relative to uninfected controls. In both heatmaps, gene expression values are color-coded from row minimum (blue) to row maximum (red), enabling comparison across groups within each gene (row). The major comparison of interest in these heatmaps is between <italic>Wt</italic> infected mice versus <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> infected mice. We have added this information to the figure legend.</p>
<p>We also acknowledge the reviewer’s observation regarding the discordance between the RNA seq data of Figure 3A and the qPCR data of Figure 3B (previously 3C) for Ifnlr1 expression. To address this, we have repeated the qRT-PCR experiment with additional samples at 7 dpi. In the updated results, <italic>Wt</italic> mice consistently show significantly higher <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> expression than <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> infected mice at both 3 dpi and 7 dpi, consistent with the RNA seq data. However, a time-dependent discrepancy between the RNA-seq and qRT-PCR datasets remains: <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic> expression continues to increase at 7 dpi in the RNA-seq data (Figure 3A), whereas it declines in the qRT-PCR results (Figure 3B). The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear and has been addressed in the Discussion section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figure 3D, have the authors checked whether the Ifnlr1 antibody they use is indeed specific for Ifnlr1? Have they used any blocking peptide for the anti-mouse Ifn-λr1 polyclonal antibody they are using? Also, in Figure 3E, the marker used for staining should be indicated in the pictures of the lung section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, a blocking peptide is not available for the anti-mouse Ifn-λr1 polyclonal antibody used in our study. To assess antibody specificity, we have performed immunofluorescence staining of Ifn-λr1 on lung tissues from <italic>Ifn-λr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice using the same antibody. No signal was detected (Supplemental Figure 5A), supporting the specificity of the antibody for Ifn-λr1.</p>
<p>As requested by the reviewer, we have added the marker (Ifn-λr1) to the pictures of the lung section in Figure 3E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In Figure 5, it's better to move each graph's label that stands to the top (e.g. PLSCR1, IFN-λR1 etc) to the y-axis label so that it doesn't get confused with the mouse -/- label.</p>

<p>We apologize for the confusion and have moved the top label to the y-axis in Figure 5.</p>

<p>(9) In Figure 6A, it is claimed that the 'two-dimensional UMAP demonstrated that these main lung cell populations (epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and immune) were dynamic over the course of infection.'. This is not clear by the data. The percentage of cells per cluster should be calculated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As requested by the reviewer, the proportion (Supplemental Figure 6A) and cell count (Supplemental Figure 6B) of each cluster have been calculated and included in “PLSCR1 Expression Is Upregulated in the Ciliated Airway Epithelial Compartment of Mice following Flu Infection” under “Results” section. Together with the two-dimensional UMAP (Figure 6A), these data demonstrate that the main lung cell populations (epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and immune) were dynamic over the course of infection. Following infection, many populations emerged, particularly within the immune cell clusters. At the same time, some clusters were initially depleted and later restored, such as microvascular endothelial cells (cluster 2). Other populations, such as interferon-responsive fibroblasts (cluster 20), showed a dramatic yet transient expansion during acute infection and disappeared after infection resolved.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) In Figure 6 B and C, the legend should indicate that these are Violin plots. Also, if AT2 cells don't express Plscr1, does that indicate that in these cells Plscr1 is not needed for IFN-λR1 expression?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As requested, we have indicated in the legend of Figure 6B and 6C that these are violin plots. <italic>Plscr1</italic> is expressed at low levels in AT2 cells. However, it is unclear whether Plscr1 is needed for Ifn-λr1 expression in AT2 cells, and it would be interesting to investigate further.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) In lines 302-304, it is stated that 'Among the various epithelial populations, ciliated epithelial cells not only had 303 the highest aggregated expression of Plscr1, but also were the only epithelial cell 304 population in which significantly more Plscr1 was induced in response to IAV infection.'. Which data/ figure support this statement?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 6B shows that among the various epithelial populations, ciliated epithelial cells had the highest aggregated expression of <italic>Plscr1</italic>. To better illustrate this statement, we have rearranged the order of cell clusters from highest to lowest <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression, and added red dots to indicate the mean expression levels for each cluster in Figure 6B.</p>
<p>Ciliated epithelial cells also had the most significant increase in <italic>Plscr1</italic> expression (p &lt; 2.22e-16 and p = 6.7e-05) in early IAV infection at 3 dpi (Figure 6C and Supplemental Figure 7A-7K). In comparison, AT1 cells were the only other epithelial cluster to show <italic>Plscr1</italic> upregulation at 3dpi, but to a much less extent (p = 0.033, Supplemental Figure 7J). Supplemental Figure 7 was added to better support the statement and the explanation was added to “PLSCR1 Expression Is Upregulated in the Ciliated Airway Epithelial Compartment of Mice following Flu Infection” under “Results” section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) As earlier, if Plscr1 is not expressed in neutrophils (Figure 6F), does that mean IFN-λR1 expression does not require Plscr1 in these cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although <italic>Plscr1</italic> is expressed at lower levels in neutrophils compared to epithelial cells, it is still detectable. In fact, our preliminary data suggest that <italic>IFN-λR1</italic> expression in neutrophils is dependent on <italic>Plscr1</italic>. We have isolated neutrophils from peripheral blood and BAL of IAV-infected <italic>Wt</italic> and <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice using a mouse neutrophil enrichment kit. Quantitative PCR results showed that <italic>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils exhibit significantly lower expression of <italic>Ifn-λr1</italic>, alongside elevated levels of <italic>Il-1β</italic>, <italic>Il-6</italic> and <italic>Tnf-α</italic> in IAV infection (see figures below). These findings suggest that Plscr1 may play an anti-inflammatory role in neutrophils by upregulating Ifn-λr1. These data were not included in the current manuscript because they are beyond the scope of current study, but we hope to address the role of PLSCR1 in regulating <italic>IFN-λR1</italic> expression and function in neutrophils in a future study.</p>
