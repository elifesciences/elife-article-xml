<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises a devastating and heterogeneous group of diseases, for which patient survival rates are dismal despite several new treatment options. Current cares are still mainly based on unselective chemotherapy but for most patients also with addition of more directed treatments after patient stratification based on genetic aberrations found at diagnosis. However, these strategies lead to cures in only a fraction of AML patients due to therapy resistance developed by the leukemic cells leading to relapse. Curative treatment usually needs allogenic stem cell transplantation, which is not applicable in many cases, highlighting the critical need to develop different approaches. The anti-apoptotic molecule BCL-2 has been a therapeutic target in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, as in many cancers overexpression of BCL-2 results in dysregulation of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). ABT-199 (venetoclax), is a specific BH3-mimetic that causes apoptosis by preventing BCL-2 from binding pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). However, complete responses occur in just ∼20% of AML patients treated with Venetoclax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In addition, many patients relapse, with regrowth initiated by therapy-resistant leukemic clones, suggesting that single agent administration is unlikely to yield lasting responses in most cases. Venetoclax is therefore used in combination with conventional therapies. Together with hypomethylating agents, Venetoclax is now standard of care for patients deemed unfit for intensive induction therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Resistance to venetoclax may result from overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins MCL1 or BCL2L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), or through changes in levels of other anti-apoptotic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Aberrant pro-survival regulation can also be achieved by inactivation of TP53 function, which controls many aspects of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). MCL1-dependent resistance to venetoclax can be overcome when the compound is combined with the MDM2 inhibitor RG7388, which causes p53 activation. A combination of BCL-2 inhibition and TP53 activation may thus provide an interesting therapeutic approach for treatment of AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Other combination approaches that promote apoptosis may also be of interest. The majority of ATP required for leukemia stem cell (LSC) function is generated by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Interestingly, venetoclax-resistant leukemic cells display increased levels of OXPHOS and are protected from mitochondrial stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). These data suggest approaches to specifically target OXPHOS in leukemia may be an attractive option. In support of this notion, inhibition of mitochondrial protein translation by antibiotics that reduce OXPHOS capacity results in a selective cytotoxic effect on leukemic cell when used in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Furthermore, LSCs from <italic>de novo</italic> AML patients display a unique dependency on amino acid metabolism to fuel OXPHOS. When venetoclax is combined with the hypomethylating agent azacytidine, the two compounds act in concert to inhibit amino acid uptake, leading to a drop in OXPHOS and thus cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). More recently, AML therapy using a combination of cytarabine (AraC) and venetoclax has highlighted the central role of mitochondrial adaptation during treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), indicating the need for a mitochondrial directed combination therapy for AML. Such a therapy may help to overcome existing treatment resistance.</p>
<p>Recently we developed novel, first-in-class inhibitors of mitochondrial transcription (IMTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). IMT treatment specifically targets mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) and reduce transcription of mitochondrial DNA, which codes for thirteen key components of the OXPHOS machinery, including subunits of respiratory complexes I, III, IV, and the ATP synthase. As a consequence, IMT treatment impairs OXPHOS system biogenesis in a dose-dependent manner and decreases cell viability in various tumor cells. Surprisingly, several weeks of per oral IMT treatment is well tolerated in mice and does not cause toxicity in normal tissues, despite inducing a strong anti-tumor response in human cancer xenografts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we examine AML cell lines for their sensitivity for treatment with IMT. We find that a combination of IMT and venetoclax displays a synergistic on cell growth and induction of apoptosis. We demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in leukemia mouse models generated by human AML cell lines as well as primary samples from AML patients.</p>

<title>Synergistic effect of IMT in combination with venetoclax on AML cell lines</title>
<p>We were curious whether our inhibitors of <underline>m</underline>itochondrial transcription (IMTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) could be effective against AML cells. The coumarin class of IMTs was optimized by medicinal chemistry to generate lead IMT compounds with improved metabolic stability in mice, such as LDC204857, herein simply referred to as IMT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, Fig. S1 and Table S1). IMT is a close analog of previously described IMT1B (Fig. S1) with a highly similar biochemical and cellular inhibition profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). It shows an extended half-life <italic>in vivo</italic> due to its increased metabolic stability (Table S1). Thus, by using IMT we could consistently reduce the mouse dose to 50 mg/kg per oral once daily, which is very well tolerated and does not exert any adverse effects in mice.</p>

</fig>
<p>Using four AML cell lines with different expression of TP53 (MV4-11 and MOLM-13 expressing wild type TP53; THP-1 and KG-1 expressing mutated TP53), we monitored the effects of increasing concentrations of IMT on cellular growth using a luminescence-based cell viability assay. Only marginal effects were observed after a 72-h period of exposure to IMT, but all cell lines displayed dose-dependent antileukemic activity after 144 h of treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), in line with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). We also monitored venetoclax sensitivity by assessing cell viability, and noted that, in line with published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), a dose-dependent reduction in cell growth occurs after three days and becomes more pronounced after 6 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To then investigate whether IMTs show a synergistic effect when combined with venetoclax, we conducted a combination study in AML cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). After six days of treatment, we found a clear synergistic effect on cell proliferation in MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cell lines, which express wild type TP53, as determined by combination analysis (Bliss-independence model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>)). Treatment of THP-1 and KG-1 cell lines, which harbor mutated TP53, only revealed a synergistic effect when using higher concentrations of both IMT and venetoclax (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, additional treatment data are shown in Fig. S2).</p>

<title>Combination of IMT and venetoclax synergistically induces apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells</title>
<p>To investigate the factors involved in the inhibition of cell growth with IMT and venetoclax, AML cell lines were treated with single agents (IMT or venetoclax) or a combination of the two (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), and the stages of apoptosis were monitored using Annexin V and PI staining. No detectable increase in apoptosis was induced by IMT exposure alone in any AML cell line. Venetoclax treatment resulted in both early and late apoptosis induction in MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cell lines, and employing a combination of IMT and venetoclax significantly enhanced apoptosis induction in these wild type cell lines. On the other hand, combination treatment did not induce apoptosis in THP-1 and KG-1 mutated cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>One distinctive feature of apoptosis is the disruption of mitochondrial function, which can be measured as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential due to membrane depolarization. As a combination of IMT and venetoclax could synergistically induce apoptosis, we were curious whether combination drug treatment thus affects mitochondrial membrane potential. We observed that venetoclax-sensitive cell lines (MV4-11 and MOLM-13) showed a dramatic loss of mitochondrial membrane potential when treated with both venetoclax and IMT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). On the other hand, mitochondrial membrane potential in THP-1 cells was not affected by single nor by combination treatment. Interestingly, although KG-1 was venetoclax insensitive, the combination treatment significantly enhanced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). These data suggest that a combination of IMT and venetoclax is cytotoxic and synergistically induces cell death in sensitive cells, presumably through disruption of mitochondrial function.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Combination of IMT and venetoclax significantly suppresses OXPHOS in AML cells</title>
<p>We next studied whether combination treatment with IMT and venetoclax affects OXPHOS in AML cells. OXPHOS was evaluated by determining oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), which was measured first as basal respiration and then oligomycin (OMY)-induced leak respiration (ATP-linked respiration) after the addition of oligomycin to inhibit ATP synthase. Stepwise carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) titrations were subsequently carried out to reach the electron transport chain respiratory capacity state. Finally, antimycin a (AMA) was added to inhibit complex I/III of the electron transport chain and to terminate respiration, allowing for the determination and correction of residual oxygen consumption, which is indicative of non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We noted that combination treatment significantly inhibits OXPHOS respiration in venetoclax-sensitive MOLM-13 and MV4-11 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In comparison, OXPHOS levels in venetoclax-resistant THP-1 cells were unaffected in the presence of single compound or combination treatments, confirming that the inhibition we observed is not a general effect of drug treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In addition, there was no conclusive OCR data obtained for KG-1 cell line.</p>

(<bold>B</bold>) AML cell lines (MV4-11, MOLM-13, and THP-1) were treated with either IMT (500 nM), venetoclax (5 nM), or a combination of both for four days. DMSO was added to control wells.

(<bold>C</bold>) AML cell lines were cultured in growth medium supplemented with either 5 mM glucose or galactose, and cell viability tests (ATP measurements) were performed after 24 and 48 h.

</fig>
<p>In normal hematopoietic cells, glycolysis is upregulated when OXPHOS is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). In contrast to normal hematopoietic cells, high energy turnover AML cells rely predominantly on OXPHOS due to poorly regulated metabolic adaptation. To verify the reliance on OXPHOS, AML cells were grown in growth medium supplemented with either glucose or galactose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Two ATP molecules are produced when cells use glucose for glycolysis, but if galactose is used instead, no ATP is generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). We observed no significant decrease in the level of ATP production (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) nor in cell counts (Fig. S3A) in the absence of glucose, indicating that glycolysis is not a major source of energy in AML cells. To test whether AML cells use glycolysis under treatment conditions, OCR was measured in the presence or absence of a high concentration of glucose (Fig. S3B). OCR measured for basal respiration was not significantly different with excess amounts of glucose, again indicating the inability of AML cells to switch to glycolysis when OXPHOS is disrupted.</p>

<title>Combination of IMT and venetoclax synergistically delays leukemia initiation in cell-derived leukemia mouse models</title>
<p>Following the confirmed synergy between IMT and venetoclax in AML cell lines, we proceeded to test the dual inhibition of mitochondrial transcription and BCL-2 in an AML cell-derived xenograft (CDX) transplantation mouse model. First, the pharmacokinetic profile of IMT was determined in plasma, liver, and bone marrow (BM) of mice, 1, 8, and 24 h post-administration (Fig. S4A). As described above (Fig. S1), the IMT mouse PK profile was superior to IMT1B. IMT was detected in all tissues at all time points when administered alone. To determine the concentration of IMT and venetoclax when administered in combination, plasma samples were then collected 8–11 h post-administration of single or combination formulations and the concentrations of IMT and/or venetoclax in samples were measured (Fig. S4B). Values obtained were all within the effective range, as combination treatment did not affect the individual compound concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). For xenograft experiments, NBSGW mice were intravenously transplanted with MV4-11 AML cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Two weeks after transplantation, engraftment of AML cells was confirmed (evaluated by gating on hCD45+ population by flow cytometry in peripheral blood). Treatment then began with vehicle, 50 mg/kg IMT, 100 mg/kg venetoclax, or a combination of IMT (50 mg/kg) and venetoclax (100 mg/kg) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), dosed as such based on previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The efficacy of treatments was determined by measuring the proportion of transplanted AML cells in peripheral blood and by survival analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In all treatment groups, the hCD45+ population dropped immediately after treatment, and vehicle- and venetoclax-treated mice then exhibited a rapid rebound. In contrast, in IMT-treated mice the increase in leukemic cell proportion was delayed until eight weeks post-transplantation, and in the combination-treated group for to up to 20 weeks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). These observations correlate with results from survival analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). IMT treatment of MV4-11 transplanted mice significantly delayed the development of leukemia, inducing a 37% increase in median overall survival (57.5 → 79 days). Development of leukemia was further delayed by combination treatment to 131% (57.5 → 133 days), and the group contained two mice that did not show any disease symptoms after 200 days (post-transplantation) when they had to be euthanized according to ethical permissions. Moreover, leukemic cells were not detectable in the BM of surviving mice at the time of termination. All other mice showed symptoms of leukemia and of these, all but one combination-treated mouse had an increased percentage of leukemic cells in BM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These results confirm that treatment with a combination of IMT and venetoclax significantly prolongs leukemia progression in mice. Moreover, the general condition of mice such as behavior, fur, mobility and weight, assessed before (week 2) and after treatment (week 5), were not altered in the IMT-, venetoclax-, or combination-treatment groups when compared to the vehicle-treated group (weights shown in Fig. S5B), suggesting that the treatments were well tolerated. As with single IMT therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), treatment with combination therapy did not display any evidence of organ toxicity or drug-associated death in the mice (Fig. S5C, D).</p>

<title>IMT and venetoclax synergistically decrease the tumor burden and increase the life span in an AML-PDX mouse model resistant to venetoclax</title>
<p>The CDX mouse model demonstrated IMT could sensitize AML cell lines to BCL-2 inhibitors <italic>in vivo</italic>. We next analyzed the effects of combination treatment on a more refined <italic>in vivo</italic> model by generating xenografts using AML patient-derived cells (AML PDX). We first tested an AML-PDX mouse model with resistance to venetoclax (AML sample harboring TP53 mutation). Two weeks post-transplantation with AML PDX cells, NSGS mice were orally treated with IMT, venetoclax, or a combination of the two for 21 days (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The efficacy of the treatments was determined based on the proportion of human AML cells (determined by hCD45+ population). Six out of 10 mice in each group were euthanized immediately after the last compound administration for end-of-treatment analysis. We found that the combination of IMT and venetoclax resulted in significant inhibition of tumor burden in blood, BM, and spleen of treated mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). By examining histology sections of BM and spleen, we found that tissues from combination-treated animals contained less engraftment of leukemic blasts than single- and vehicle-treated mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Accordingly, the frequencies of hCD45+ cells in the BM and spleens of the combination-treated group were largely reduced in comparison to other groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), and engrafted tumor cells in combination-treated PDX mice showed a lower proliferating percentage in comparison to single or vehicle treated groups (shown by KI67+/hCD45+ immunohistochemistry staining; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). This demonstrates a synergy between IMT and venetoclax in reducing tumor burden.</p>

<p>To further analyze the cellular effects of the IMT-venetoclax combination treatment, we analyzed transcriptomes of purified viable AML blasts isolated from PDX models at end of treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We confirmed that combination treatment had a more pronounced effect on gene transcription as compared to single treatments. In agreement with its more pronounced effect on tumor burden, combination treatment suppressed expression of a number of genes involved in leukemogenesis, including MX1, KCTD12, ITGA and RGL1 (Table S2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>

<p>We also analyzed survival by monitoring the mice for disease progression and morbidity. Peripheral blood engraftments were analyzed at regular intervals until the appearance of disease symptoms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and Fig. S6A). The leukemia burden immediately prior to euthanization demonstrated that the cytoreductive effect of the combination treatment persists (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, blood count (determined by RBCs and HGB levels) did not vary significantly between experimental groups, nor did the magnitude of splenomegaly or liver weight vary at the time of euthanization (Fig. S6B–D). Interestingly, mice treated with a combination of IMT and venetoclax succumbed to death significantly later than other treatment groups, with a median survival of 112 days vs 96, 99, and 102 days for vehicle-, IMT-, and venetoclax-treated groups, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<bold>C</bold></xref>). Combination treatment thus increases the life span of venetoclax-resistant AML mouse models, demonstrating that IMT can sensitize AML cells towards other therapies.</p>

<p>For comparison, we also monitored effects of combination treatment on a PDX model based on AML cells sensitive to venetoclax treatment (AML cells harboring FLT3-ITD, NMP1 and DNMT3A). As expected, we observed that venetoclax treatment significantly reduced the tumor burden in the blood and BM of mice. Combination treatment with IMT did not add to this effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). By examining histology sections, we found that both BM and spleen tissues from combination- and venetoclax-treated animals contained reduced proportion of leukemic blasts compared to IMT- and vehicle-treated mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). White blood counts (WBCs), red blood counts (RBCs), and hemoglobin (HGB) levels were not significantly different across experimental groups (Fig. S7A).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In recent years, the genetic complexity and heterogeneity of leukemia cell populations has become apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) and developing effective strategies to target human leukemia initiating cells has thus proven to be a challenging task. Currently, there is considerable interest in therapies, such as venetoclax, that can restore normal apoptosis of cancer cells by directly interacting with the BCL-2 family of proteins. These are effective for some leukemias, but many patients eventually become refractory to treatment and ultimately succumb to their disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). It has become increasingly important to determine which biological properties are relatively consistent in leukemic cell populations irrespective of genetic makeup (tumor population). Recent observations indicate that several cancer cell types, including AML, are reliant on OXPHOS for metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), making inhibition of mitochondrial function a promising therapeutic strategy for AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Therapy-resistant leukemic cells are more reliant on oxidative respiration than glycolysis for energy generation, suggesting that the OXPHOS dependency and lack of normal glycolytic activity in AML cells may be characteristic of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Understanding resistance mechanisms will allow for the design of strategies to counteract drug resistance or impede resistance from developing. In AMLs with aberrant expression of BCL-2, venetoclax can reduce OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) and trigger cell death. However, venetoclax resistance can occur in patients treated with the BCL-2 inhibitor and in some subtypes of AML patients with poor prognoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous work has indicated that AML cells display increased mitochondrial biogenesis and inhibition of mitochondrial translation can be used as a strategy for human AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). In our work, we target another process involved in mitochondrial gene expression, i.e., transcription. IMT treatment targets POLRMT, which has two main functions in mitochondria: it transcribes mtDNA encoded genes and provides the primers required to initiate mtDNA replication. Inhibition of POLRMT can thus deliver a double punch, both reducing mtDNA copy number and inhibit OXPHOS biogenesis. As demonstrated here inhibition of POLRMT can overcome venetoclax therapy resistance in AML. These observations are in line with recent reports of the importance of mitochondrial function in leukemia cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). By developing a clinically relevant and well-tolerated approach to deliver IMTs in immunodeficient mice transplanted with AML cells, we were able to reduce the tumor burden in all (cell- and patient-derived) xenografted mice treated with a combination of IMT and venetoclax. This demonstrates that reducing POLRMT activity results in successful targeting of leukemic cells. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations confirmed that the combination of IMT and venetoclax is necessary to significantly decrease ATP levels and consequently induce apoptosis. In addition, efficacy studies of AML PDX models showed that single compounds are not sufficient to eradicate AML cells, but that the combination regimen reduced AML tumor burden and prolonged survival in all treated mice. These data indicate the advantage of both downregulating POLRMT activity in combination with increasing apoptosis and highlights the importance of rational combination therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we have introduced a new therapeutic strategy to target therapy-resistant leukemia with OXPHOS-dependent properties. Despite several limitations with the design of pre-clinical cancer models and the intensity and duration of treatments, we demonstrate here that the combined inhibition of BCL-2 and mitochondrial transcription can target therapy-resistant AMLs. This combination treatment succeeds as IMT primes cell vulnerability to apoptosis induction. Consequently, our findings may be of value for the future development of better clinical strategies for the treatment of AML.</p>

<p>This <bold>solid</bold> study assesses a novel mitochondrial inhibitor in combination with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, with the aim to increase its activity in acute myeloid leukemia. It provides <bold>valuable</bold> findings of combinatorial efficacy using preclinical models, confirming the overall importance of targeting oxidative phosphorylation to overcome venetoclax resistance in acute myeloid leukemia, and could be strengthened through mechanistic studies demonstrating drug specificity, pharmacodynamic efficacy studies in vivo to test clinical utility and extended statistical analyses of the results. The study is of interest to hematologists because it addresses a key biomedical issue in acute myeloid leukemia (venetoclax resistance) and provides data regarding the safety and activity of a novel inhibitor of the mitochondrial polymerase addressed in combination with venetoclax.</p>

<p>This study exploits novel agent (IMT) that inhibits mitochondrial activity in combination with venetoclax. While the concept is not novel, the agent is novel (inhibitor of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, described in Nature in other tumor models), and quest for safe mitochondrial inhibitors is highly warranted. The strength is in vivo activity data shown in CLDX and in one of the two AML PDX models tested, and the apparent safety of the combination. However, the impact on survival is impressive in CLDX but not in PDX, and unclear why Ven-sensitive PDX is resistant to combination (opposite what cell line data show). The paper is lacking mechanistic data beyond Seahorse and standard apoptosis assays, and even transcriptome analysis from PDX cells is poorly analyzed. There is no real evidence that this agent overcome Ven resistance, which could be done for example in primary AML cells. Finally, no on-target pharmacodynamic endpoints are measured in vivo to support the activity of the compound on mitochondrial activity at the doses used (which are safe). These multiple weaknesses significantly reduce my enthusiasm for this manuscript.</p>
<p>The cell line data show additive/synergistic effects of IMT and Ven on cell viability in p53-WT cells. However, no mechanisms of synergy beyond OCR are shown, which is a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>No data are shown in primary AML cells in vitro. This could address venetoclax-resistant AML cells with distinct genomic profiles.</p>
<p>The in vivo CLDX model (MV4;11) data is quite impressive, showing reduction of tumor burden and meaningful extension of survival in combination cohort. It is unclear why venetoclax used at highest dose normally sued in vivo (100mg/kg) did not show any impact on survival in this Ven-sensitive model. It is disappointing that no biomarkers of mitochondrial activity (for example, simple pAMPK, or levels of mitochondrial subunits) are shown to support on-target pharmacodynamic activity. However, efficacy in human PDX is less impressive, for example in Fig 6C the combination has extended survival from 96 to 112 days, possibly due to early stopping of treatment (around day 30); and no extension of survival is seen in another PDX in Fig 7. Still, this is indicative of combinatorial activity in TP53-mutant PDX. There is however discrepancy with in vitro studies that show no impact of combination in TP53 mutant cells and synergy in TP53-wt cells, and the opposite findings in vivo, which is not explained. Overall, the activity of the combination is modest. The safety is encouraging, but again, no pharmacodynamic measurements are shown to support that IMT at least partially inhibited mitochondrial activity in AML cells.</p>
<p>In Discussion the statement that inhibition of POLRMT can overcome venetoclax resistance is not supported by the data, as no additive effects are seen in vitro in TP53 mutant cells, and no other resistant models (such as primary AML cells) are tested. In vivo as stated above there is some activity in TP53 mutant PDX but this alone cannot be sued to justify this strong statement. Also, the sentence that &quot;...we were able to reduce the tumor burden in all (cell- and patient-derived) xenografted mice treated with a combination of IMT and venetoclax&quot; is not supported by data in Fig 7.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Arabanian and colleagues presents studies showing how inhibition of mitochondrial transcription and replication with a novel inhibitor of the mitochondrial polymerase, IMT, can promote AML cell death in combination with the Bcl2 inhibitor venetoclax. They further show that this combinatorial efficacy is evident in vivo in both the AML cell line MV411 and in a PDX model. Given the multiple studies showing the importance of Oxphos in maintaining AML cell survival, the current studies provide an additional strategy to inhibit Oxphos and thus improve the therapeutic management of AML.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A novel aspect of this work is that IMT is a new class of mitochondrial inhibitor that acts by inhibiting the mitochondrial polymerase. In addition, the demonstration of therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo (including with PDX), together with some data showing minimal toxicity, adds to the impact of this work. Their overall conclusion that IMT increases the potency of Vex in treating AMLs is supported.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several deficiencies that should be addressed to substantiate the rigor and impact of this study. Of most importance, they need to show that IMT actually inhibits the mitochondrial polymerase in AML cells, and there are additional concerns with their models that if addressed would improve the ability of IMT to be developed clinically.</p>
