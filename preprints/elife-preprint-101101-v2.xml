<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> are maternally transmitted bacterial symbionts that are ubiquitous among arthropods. They can hijack host reproduction in various ways, including male killing (MK), where the sons of infected mothers are killed during development. The recent discovery of MK-associated <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes, i.e., <italic>oscar</italic> in <italic>Ostrinia</italic> moths and <italic>wmk</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies, stimulates our interest in the diversity and commonality of MK mechanisms, which remain largely unclear. We recently discovered that a <italic>Wolbachia</italic> symbiont of the moth <italic>Homona magnanima</italic> carries an MK-associated prophage region encoding homologs of <italic>oscar</italic> (<italic>Hm-oscar</italic>) and <italic>wmk</italic> (<italic>wmk-</italic>1–4). Here, we investigated the effects of these genes in the native host. Upon transient overexpression, <italic>Hm-oscar</italic>, but not <italic>wmk</italic>, induced male lethality in <italic>H. magnanima</italic>, in contrast to our observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the <italic>wmk</italic> homologs, but not <italic>Hm-oscar</italic>, killed the males. <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> disrupted sex determination in male embryos by inducing a female-type <italic>doublesex</italic> splicing and impaired dosage compensation, recapitulating the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> phenotype. Cell-based transfection assays confirmed that <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> suppressed the function of <italic>masculinizer</italic>, the primary male sex determinant involved in lepidopteran dosage compensation. Our study highlights the conserved roles of <italic>oscar</italic> homologs in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced lepidopteran MK and argues that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have evolved multiple MK mechanisms in insects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arthropods commonly carry microbial symbionts that are passed from mother to offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hurst &amp; Frost, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Werren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hurst, 2017</xref>). The maternally transmitted bacteria, belonging to the genus <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (Alphaproteobacteria), are estimated to be present in at least 40% of all insect species, making them one of the most widespread endosymbiont genera on the planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Werren et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zug &amp; Hammerstein, 2012</xref>). <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have achieved evolutionary success by manipulating host reproduction through various means that enhance endosymbiont transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Werren et al., 2008</xref>). Such manipulation of the host’s reproduction includes cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), parthenogenesis, feminization, and male killing (MK), each of which affects the biological features, distribution, and evolution of the host. Among these strategies, MK directly skews the sex ratio of the host population toward females by killing male offspring of infected mothers during development. The lack of symbiont transmission through male hosts often leads to the evolution of MK. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have been shown to induce MK in a wide range of insect taxa (e.g., dipterans, lepidopterans, and coleopterans) and other arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hurst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kageyama &amp; Traut, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hurst et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, various bacteria, viruses, and microsporidia induce MK phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kageyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fujita et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kageyama et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nagamine et al., 2023</xref>), and recent studies have postulated that these microbes have evolved their MK ability independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Harumoto &amp; Lemaitre, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kageyama et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nagamine et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arai et al., 2023a</xref>).</p>
<p>The evolution and molecular mechanisms underlying <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced MK have attracted considerable attention for decades. It has been hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying MK are associated with sex determination cascades in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hornett et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, some MK-inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains have been shown to directly interact with the sex determination system in lepidopteran insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sugimoto and Ishikawa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sugimoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fukui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arai et al., 2023a</xref>). The Lepidopteran sex determination system consists of multiple transcriptional regulators, some of which exhibit sex-linked expression and/or splicing isoforms. Lepidoptera generally have a female heterogametic sex chromosome system (e.g., WZ/ZZ) and employ dosage compensation, which equalizes the sex-linked (Z-chromosome-linked) gene dose between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>). Dosage compensation is regulated by the <italic>masculinizer</italic> gene (<italic>masc</italic>), which is critical for male development. <italic>masc</italic> also controls the downstream master regulator of sex determination and differentiation, <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>), which exhibits sex-dependent splicing isoforms (<italic>dsxF</italic> in females and <italic>dsxM</italic> in males) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Ostrinia</italic> and <italic>Homona</italic> male moths, MK-inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains impair dosage compensation by disrupting the expression of <italic>masc</italic>. Furthermore, they disrupt sex determination in male moths by inducing the “female” isoform of <italic>dsx</italic> (<italic>dsxF</italic>), leading to a “mismatch” between genetic sex (male: ZZ sex chromosome constitution) and phenotypic sex (female: based on <italic>dsxF</italic>) and consequently to male death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arai et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fukui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sugimoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sugimoto &amp; Ishikawa, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, a protein produced in <italic>Wolbachia w</italic>Fur strain named Oscar (<underline>Os</underline>ugoroshi protein containing <underline>C</underline>ifB C-terminus-like domain and many <underline>A</underline>nkyrin <underline>R</underline>epeats; Osugoroshi translates to male killing in Japanese) was shown to recapitulate the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced MK phenotype in the native host <italic>Ostrinia furnacalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Katsuma et al., 2022</xref>). The Oscar protein interacts with and degrades Masc protein, leading to the failure of dosage compensation and the production of female-type <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms in <italic>Ostrinia</italic> male moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fukui et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Katsuma et al., 2022</xref>). Although <italic>oscar</italic> homologs have been identified in several MK-inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains in Lepidoptera, some MK <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains in Diptera (<italic>Drosophila</italic>) and Lepidoptera do not carry this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arai et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arai et al., 2024a</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>oscar</italic> homologs are evolutionarily dynamic, with highly variable sequences and structures (classified as type I to type III <italic>oscar</italic> based on sequence homology) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arai et al., 2024a</xref>), making it difficult to assess their functional relevance. In addition to <italic>oscar</italic>, the helix-turn-helix domain-containing putative transcriptional regulator <italic>wmk</italic> is widely conserved among <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains and induces various toxicities in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies (i.e., no effect, weak male lethality [30% of males die], strong male lethality [90%–100% of males die], and death of all males and females) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Perlmutter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Perlmutter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Perlmutter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arai et al., 2023b</xref>). Although the mechanisms underlying the <italic>wmk</italic>-induced toxicities and their connection to sex determination systems remain unclear, these findings suggest that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains carry multiple factors that cause male lethality. However, the diversity and commonality of these functions in insects remain largely unknown, partly due to the technical challenges in validating gene functions in non-model insects.</p>
<p>We recently discovered a prophage region responsible for a <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced MK by comparing closely related non-MK <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (<italic>w</italic>Hm-c) and MK <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (<italic>w</italic>Hm-t) in the tea tortrix moth <italic>Homona magnanima</italic> (Tortricidae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arai et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Arai et al., 2024b</xref>). The MK-associated prophage element encodes potential MK causative genes–four <italic>wmk</italic> homologs (<italic>wmk</italic>-1 to <italic>wmk</italic>-4) as well as an <italic>oscar</italic> homolog (<italic>Hm-oscar</italic>, encoding 1181 aa protein), which differs significantly in sequence length and structure from the <italic>w</italic>Fur-encoded <italic>oscar</italic> (encoding 1830 aa protein) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). When these MK candidate genes are transgenically overexpressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>wmk-1</italic> and <italic>wmk</italic>-3 have a lethality of almost 100%, while <italic>wmk-2</italic>, <italic>wmk-4</italic>, and <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> induce no lethal effects when singly overexpressed. Furthermore, co-expression of the adjacent <italic>wmk-3</italic> and <italic>wmk-4</italic> has been shown to induce the death of 90% of male flies and restores female survival, suggesting their combined action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arai et al., 2023b</xref>). However, transgenic expression of genes from a moth-derived male killer in flies does not necessarily replicate the native host–bacteria interaction, and the mechanistic links between prophage-encoded <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes and MK in the native host <italic>Homona</italic> remain unclear.</p>

<p>In this study, we showed that the prophage-encoded <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> recapitulates <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced MK in <italic>H. magnanima</italic>.

<title><italic>Hm-oscar</italic> induces female-biased sex ratios</title>
<p>To achieve the transient overexpression of <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> and the four <italic>wmk</italic> genes (<italic>wmk</italic>-1, <italic>wmk</italic>-2, <italic>wmk</italic>-3, and <italic>wmk</italic>-4), constructed mRNA (cRNA) was injected into <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free <italic>H. magnanima</italic> embryos. Subsequently, the adult moths that emerged from the cRNA-injected embryos were sexed based on their external morphology. When <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> was overexpressed, the sex ratio of adults was strongly female-biased (42 males and 218 females in total, 14.4% ± 11.1% male ratio in 15 replicates), which was in sharp contrast with the ratios observed in the <italic>GFP</italic>-injected (126 females and 123 males in total, 49.1% ± 2.08% male ratio in 10 replicates) and non-injected (NSR) (201 females and 215 males in total, 51.4% ± 3.08% male ratio in 9 replicates) groups (P = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively, Steel–Dwass test, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Compared with the <italic>GFP</italic>-injected group, the sex ratio was not biased by the overexpression of <italic>wmk</italic>-1 (51.1% ± 7.27% male ratio in 6 replicates, P = 0.999), <italic>wmk</italic>-2 (53.2% ± 4.77% male ratio in 6 replicates, P = 0.810), <italic>wmk</italic>-3 (53.3% ± 7.91% male ratio in 5 replicates, P = 0.999), and <italic>wmk</italic>-4 (52.9% ± 3.47% male ratio in 5 replicates, P = 0.773). Although the dual expression of <italic>wmk</italic>-3 and <italic>wm</italic>k-4 induces strong male lethality in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arai et al., 2023b</xref>), here, it did not skew the sex ratio of <italic>Homona</italic> compared with the ratio detected in the <italic>GFP</italic>-injected group (57.9% ± 7.67% male ratio in 5 replicates, P = 0.704). Similarly, the dual expression of the tandemly arrayed <italic>wmk-</italic>1 and <italic>wmk-</italic>2 did not bias the sex ratio (49.4% ± 2.82% male ratio in 5 replicates) compared with the value in the <italic>GFP</italic>-injected group (P = 1.000). The sex ratio data of all replicates are available on the supplementary data file.</p>

<title>Males are killed mainly at the embryonic stage</title>
<p>The sex of unhatched embryos and hatched larvae (neonates) was determined by karyotyping for W chromatin, with the presence and absence of this substance indicating females and males, respectively. MK <italic>Wolbachia w</italic>Hm-t kills <italic>Homona</italic> males during embryogenesis, resulting in a female-biased sex ratio in hatched larvae (neonates) and a male-biased sex ratio in unhatched embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arai et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arai et al., 2020</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we showed that the phage-encoded <italic>Hm-oscar</italic>, but not <italic>wmk</italic>, induced male lethality and a female-biased sex ratio in <italic>H. magnanima</italic>. Furthermore, the overexpressed <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> impaired male sex determination in <italic>Homona,</italic> recapitulating the <italic>w</italic>Hm-t-induced phenotypes. Cell-based assays confirmed that <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> suppressed the masculinizing functions of <italic>masc</italic>. These results strongly suggested that <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> underlies the <italic>w</italic>Hm-t-induced MK function in <italic>H. magnanima</italic>. In light of our results and previous findings in <italic>Homona</italic>, <italic>Ostrinia,</italic> and <italic>Bombyx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arai et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Katsuma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>), we hypothesize the following molecular mechanisms for <italic>w</italic>Hm-t-induced MK: The Hm-Oscar protein targets and inhibits the function of the HmMasc protein, thereby resulting in female sex determination and disrupting dosage compensation, which ultimately leads to male death. Although the full mechanisms remain unclear, unbalanced Z-linked gene expression mediated by improper dosage compensation—resulting in Z-linked gene expression levels twice as high as those in normal males—appear to be lethal for lepidopteran males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fukui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Visser et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-encoded <italic>oscar</italic> homologs identified so far show diversity in sequence length and are classified as type I, II, and III based on their amino acid sequence homologies. Type I and II Oscar proteins, derived from MK-inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, contain many ankyrin repeats and a proteinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arai et al., 2024a</xref>). Although long ankyrin repeat sequences are postulated to be critical for the function of <italic>w</italic>Fur-encoded Oscar protein (1830 aa, type I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Katsuma et al., 2022</xref>), our study revealed that the functions of Hm-Oscar protein (1181 aa, type II), which encodes fewer ankyrin repeats, were comparable with those of Oscar protein carried by <italic>w</italic>Fur. Interestingly, type II <italic>oscar</italic> gene is also present in the feminizing <italic>Wolbachia w</italic>Fem in <italic>Eurema</italic> butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arai et al., 2024a</xref>). <italic>oscar</italic> homologs, which inhibit the masculinizing function and induce female sex determination, may have a conserved function in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced MK and feminization in Lepidoptera.</p>
<p>In contrast to the results of this study, we have previously demonstrated that the phage-encoded <italic>wmk</italic>, but not <italic>Hm-oscar</italic>, induces male lethality in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arai et al., 2023b</xref>). Although the means of expression are different (i.e., transient in <italic>Homona</italic> and transgenic in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), this finding highlighted the differences in the mode/range of action of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes between insect species. It has been hypothesized that microbes induce MK in insects by targeting molecular mechanisms involved in sex determination and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hornett et al., 2022</xref>). Sex determination systems in insects are diverse; for example, Lepidoptera (including <italic>H. magnanima</italic>) and Diptera (including <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) do not share any known sex-determining genes other than <italic>dsx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Suzuki, 2018</xref>). The different outcomes in <italic>Homona</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> are probably due to their different sex determination systems. Because <italic>oscar</italic> interacts with and suppresses <italic>masc</italic>, <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> could induce mortality in <italic>Homona</italic> males that possess <italic>masc</italic>, but not in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males that lack it. Considering that <italic>oscar</italic> homologs are not present in known MK <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains in dipteran insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Arai et al., 2024c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Katsuma et al., 2022</xref>), the mechanisms (i.e., causative genes) of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced MK probably differ between insect taxa (e.g., between Lepidoptera and Diptera). While the mechanisms underlying <italic>wmk</italic>-induced lethality remain unclear, the distinct effects associated with this gene between <italic>Homona</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> may also reflect their genetic backgrounds (e.g., presence/absence of host factor(s) that interact with <italic>wmk</italic>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Katsuma et al. (2022)</xref> reported that the <italic>wmk</italic> homologs encoded by <italic>w</italic>Fur did not affect the masculinizing function of <italic>masc in vitro</italic>, indicating that <italic>wmk</italic> likely targets factors other than <italic>masc</italic>. Our results strongly suggested that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains have acquired multiple MK genes through evolution.</p>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced phenotypes are known to be influenced by the genetic backgrounds of hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hornett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Veneti et al., 2012</xref>). Our study showed that the <italic>w</italic>Hm-t-encoded <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> suppresses the function of <italic>masc</italic> in <italic>H. magnanima</italic> more efficiently than the <italic>w</italic>Fur-encoded <italic>oscar</italic>, suggesting that this <italic>Wolbachia</italic> factor has undergone evolutionary tuning to adapt to its natural host. However, the mere presence of <italic>oscar</italic> and <italic>wmk</italic> homologs does not ensure MK expression. For example, <italic>w</italic>CauA, bearing type I <italic>oscar</italic>, did not induce MK in <italic>Ephestia</italic> (<italic>Cadra</italic>) <italic>cautella</italic> collected around 2000, although it did induce MK when transferred to the closely related host <italic>Ephestia kuehniella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>). An MK phenotype, presumably induced by <italic>w</italic>CauA, was also recorded in <italic>E. cautella</italic> around the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Takahashi &amp; Kuwahara, 1970</xref>). These findings suggest a suppressor evolution against <italic>w</italic>CauA-induced MK in <italic>E. cautella</italic>. In addition, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> typically encode a number of <italic>wmk</italic> homologs in their genomes, but their effects differ among insects and are not apparent in some species such as <italic>Homona,</italic> possibly due to the diversity in sex determination system or the evolution of suppressors. Nonetheless, given the high copy number of <italic>wmk</italic> homologs in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genomes, they may still contribute to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> biology as transcriptional regulators and potential virulence factors. Virulence genes often undergo duplication and substitution under strong selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hill et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jones &amp; Dangl, 2006</xref>). An intense evolutionary arms race between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and their hosts could have increased and diversified the MK-associated <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes. Conversely, natural selection favors the rescue of males by suppressing the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced reproductive manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hornett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hornett et al., 2014</xref>), which may involve changes in the sex determination system because <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains frequently hijack host reproduction systems. In this context, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and other MK-inducing microbes may be a hidden driver for the diversification of complex insect sex determination systems.</p>
<p>In this study, we clarified the conserved roles of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-encoded <italic>oscar</italic> homologs in Lepidoptera and demonstrated that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have evolved distinct MK mechanisms (through causative genes) in insect taxa. The diversification of phenotype/virulence-associated genes and the rampant horizontal transmission of phages carrying virulence genes between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains may have contributed to the outstanding success of this bacterial genus. In addition to <italic>oscar</italic> and <italic>wmk, Wolbachia</italic> may retain other uncharacterized genes that induce male lethality, and further studies on diverse <italic>Wolbachia</italic>–host systems are highly warranted. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary relationships between endosymbionts and their hosts, which may also contribute to the design of pest management strategies.</p>

<p>Sex-specific <italic>dsx</italic> splicing variants of <italic>H. magnanima</italic> were detected as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arai et al. (2023a)</xref>. In brief, total RNA (100–300 ng) extracted from sex-determined mature embryos was reverse-transcribed using PrimeScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) at 30°C for 10 min, 45°C for 60 min, and 70°C for 15 min. Then, cDNA was amplified using KOD-FX Neo (Toyobo Co., Ltd.) with the following two primers: Hmdsx_long3F (5′-TGCCTAAAGTGAAAACGCCGAGGAGCC-3′) and Hmdsx_Mrev (5′-TGGAGGTCTCTTTTCATCCGG-3′). The PCR conditions used were as follows: 94°C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 66°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 30 s. The amplicons were subjected to electrophoresis on 2.0% agarose Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (89 mM Tris-borate, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA) gels.</p>

<title>Quantification of Z chromosome-linked genes</title>
<p>The effects on dosage compensation were assessed by measuring differences in gene expression, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fukui et al. (2015)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arai et al. (2023a)</xref>. A total of 1.0 µg of the total RNA extracted from <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> or <italic>GFP</italic>-overexpressed mature embryos (108 hpo, approximately 40-50 sex determined embryos) was used to prepare mRNA-seq libraries via the NEBNext Poly (A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs) and the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The adaptor sequences and low-quality reads (Qscore &lt;20) were removed from the generated sequence data [150 bp paired-end (PE150)] using Trimmomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>). The trimmed reads were mapped to the previously assembled transcriptome database for <italic>H. magnanima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arai et al., 2023a</xref>) using Kallisto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bray et al., 2016</xref>) to generate the normalized read count data (transcripts per million, TPM). While we did not generate new RNA-seq data of the <italic>w</italic>Hm-t-infected and uninfected groups, the expression data included in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arai et al. (2023a)</xref> were re-analyzed along with the newly obtained RNA-seq data above. The binary logarithms of the TPM differences between males and females belonging to each <italic>H. magnanima</italic> group (i.e., <italic>Hm-oscar</italic>/<italic>GFP</italic>-expressed) were calculated to assess the fold-changes in gene expression levels between sexes. As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arai et al. (2023a)</xref>, the transcriptome data of <italic>H. magnanima</italic> were annotated using the <italic>B. mori</italic> gene sets obtained from KAIKOBASE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://kaikobase.dna.affrc.go.jp">https://kaikobase.dna.affrc.go.jp</ext-link>). The binary logarithms of the TPM differences between males and females in the <italic>B. mori</italic> chromosomes 1 to 28 were plotted.</p>
<p>To confirm the effects observed in the RNA-seq-based quantification of the Z chromosome genes, expression level of the Z-linked <italic>Hmtpi</italic> gene was quantified by reverse transcription-qPCR as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arai et al. (2023a)</xref>. Briefly, total RNA (100–300 ng) extracted from pooled male or female mature embryos (108 hpo) was reverse transcribed using PrimeScript II reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa) as described above. The cDNA was used to quantify relative gene expression levels, with normalization to the control gene elongation factor 1a (<italic>ef1a</italic>). qPCR was performed using primer sets for <italic>Hmtpi</italic> (HmTpi_F180702_212: 5′-GCTGCGAGTGGGTGATTTTG-3′; HmTpi_R180702_326: 5′-GCGATCACTTTCAGACCCGA-3′) and <italic>Hmef1a</italic> (Hmef1a_F_val1_85: 5′-TTTCCAGGGTGGTTGAGCA-3′; Hmef1a_R_val1_193: 5′-CCGTTAAGGAGCTGCGTCG-3′), and KOD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) in a LightCycler 96 system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The qPCR reaction was made with 5 µl KOD SYBR (TOYOBO), 0.4 µL forward primer [10 pmol/µl], 0.4 µl reverse primer [10 pmol/µl], and 3.2 µl water. The qPCR was performed under the following conditions: 180 s at 95°C, 40 cycles of 8 s at 98°C, 10 s at 60°C, and 10 s at 68°C, followed by heating to 90°C for melting curve analysis. Mean cycle threshold (<italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic>) values of samples were calculated for at least 13 replicates, and both Δ<italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic> (<italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic> Z gene – <italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic> ef1a) and ΔΔ<italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic> (Δ<italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic>male – Δ<italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic>fem) values were calculated.</p>

<p>The coding sequence of <italic>Hmmasc</italic> was amplified from cDNA derived from the RNA extracted from male embryos of the NSR line using KOD-one (TOYOBO) with the following primer set: HmMasc_CDS_HindIIIF: 5′-GCAAAGCTTCAACATGATCTCTCGCCAACCACAATCAACATCA-3′ and HmMasc_CDS_BamHI R: 5′-GCAGGATCCCAACCTACTGATAAGGAGGGAAGTAAGGCTGCTG-3′. The following PCR conditions were applied: 20 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 62°C for 5 s, and 68°C for 15 s. The amplicon was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and cloned into the pIZ/V5-His vector using the HindIII and BamHI enzymes (New England Biolabs). The codon-optimized <italic>oscar</italic> gene of <italic>w</italic>Fur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Katsuma et al. 2022</xref>) was also cloned into the pIZ/V5-His vector using the KpnI and NotI enzymes (TaKaRa).</p>
<p>To verify the masculinizing function of <italic>Hmmasc</italic>, BmN-4 cells (4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per dish, diameter 35 mm) were transfected with 1 µg of each plasmid DNA (pIZ/V5-His having <italic>Hmmasc</italic>) using FuGENE HD (Promega, WI, USA), as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Katsuma et al.

Three days after transfection, the cells were collected and subjected to RNA extraction via TRI REAGENT® (Molecular Research Center Inc., USA) and cDNA construction with AMV transcriptase (TaKaRa). The degree of masculinization in the BmN-4 cells (default female-type sex determination) was verified by quantifying the expression levels of <italic>BmImp<sup>M</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>), which is involved in male-specific sex determination cascades, using primers BmIMP_F: 5′-ATGCGGGAAGAAGGTTTTATG-3′ and BmIMP_R: 5′-TCATCCCGCCTCAGACGATTG-3′, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fukui et al.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Insects and their relatives are commonly infected with microbes that are transmitted from mothers to their offspring. A number of these microbes have independently evolved the ability to kill the sons of infected females very early in their development; this male killing strategy has evolved because males are transmission dead-ends for the microbe. A major question in the field has been to identify the genes that cause male killing and to understand how they work. This has been especially challenging because most male-killing microbes cannot be genetically manipulated. This study focuses on a male-killing bacterium called Wolbachia. Different Wolbachia strains kill male embryos in beetles, flies, moths, and other arthropods. This is remarkable because how sex is determined differs widely in these hosts. Two Wolbachia genes have been previously implicated in male-killing by Wolbachia: oscar (in moth male-killing) and wmk (in fly male-killing). The genomes of some male-killing Wolbachia contain both of these genes, so it is a challenge to disentangle the two.</p>
<p>This paper provides strong evidence that oscar is responsible for male-killing in moths. Here, the authors study a strain of Wolbachia that kills males in a pest of tea, Homona magnanima. Overexpressing oscar, but not wmk, kills male moth embryos. This is because oscar interferes with masculinizer, the master gene that controls sex determination in moths and butterflies. Interfering with the masculinizer gene in this way leads the (male) embryo down a path of female development, which causes problems in regulating the expression of genes that are found on the sex chromosomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a broad number of approaches to implicate oscar, and to dissect its mechanism of male lethality. These approaches include: a) overexpressing oscar (and wmk) by injecting RNA into moth eggs, b) determining the sex of embryos by staining female sex chromosomes, c) determining the consequences of oscar expression by assaying sex-specific splice variants of doublesex, a key sex determination gene, and by quantifying gene expression and dosage of sex chromosomes, using RNASeq, and d) expressing oscar along with masculinizer from various moth and butterfly species, in a silkmoth cell line. This extends recently published studies implicating oscar in male-killing by Wolbachia in Ostrinia corn borer moths, although the Homona and Ostrinia oscar proteins are quite divergent. Combined with other studies, there is now broad support for oscar as the male-killing gene in moths and butterflies (i.e. order Lepidoptera). So an outstanding question is to understand the role of wmk. Is it the master male-killing gene in insects other than Lepidoptera and if so, how does it operate?</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I found the transfection assays of oscar and masculinizer in the silkworm cell line (Figure 4) to be difficult to follow. There are also places in the text where more explanation would be helpful for non-experts.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wolbachia are maternally transmitted bacteria that can manipulate host reproduction in various ways. Some Wolbachia induce male killing (MK), where the sons of infected mothers are killed during development. Several MK-associated genes have been identified in Homona magnanima, including Hm-oscar and wmk-1-4, but the mechanistic links between these Wolbachia genes and MK in the native host are still unclear.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Arai et al. show that Hm-oscar is the gene responsible for Wolbachia-induced MK in Homona magnanima. They provide evidence that Hm-Oscar functions through interactions with the sex determination system. They also found that Hm-Oscar disrupts sex determination in male embryos by inducing female-type dsx splicing and impairing dosage compensation. Additionally, Hm-Oscar suppresses the function of Masc. The manuscript is well-written and presents intriguing findings. The results support their conclusions regarding the diversity and commonality of MK mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms and evolutionary aspects of Wolbachia-induced MK.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Overall, this is a clearly written manuscript with nice hypothesis testing in a non-model organism that addresses the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated male killing. The authors aim to determine how five previously identified male-killing genes (encoded in the prophage region of the wHm Wolbachia strain) impact the native host, Homona magnanima moths. This work builds on the authors' previous studies in which</p>
<p>
(1) they tested the impact of these same wHm genes via heterologous expression in Drosophila melanogaster</p>
<p>
(2) also examined the activity of other male-killing genes (e.g., from the wFur Wolbachia strain in its native host: Ostrinia furnacalis moths).</p>
<p>Advances here include identifying which wHm gene most strongly recapitulates the male-killing phenotype in the native host (rather than in Drosophila), and the finding that the Hm-Oscar protein has the potential for male-killing in a diverse set of lepidopterans, as inferred by the cell-culture assays.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strengths of the manuscript include the reverse genetics approaches to dissect the impact of specific male-killing loci, and use of a &quot;masculinization&quot; assay in Lepidopteran cell lines to determine the impact of interactions between specific masc and oscar homologs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is clear from Figure 1 that the combinations of wmk homologs do not cause male killing on their own here. While I largely agree with the author's conclusions that oscar is the primary MK factor in this system, I don't think we can yet rule out that wmk(s) may work synergistically or interactively with oscar in vivo. This might be worth a small note in the discussion. (eg at line 294 'indicating that wmk likely targets factors other than masc.&quot; - this could be downstream of the impacts of oscar; perhaps dependent on oscar-mediated impacts on masc first).</p>
<p>Regarding the perceived male-bias in Figure 2a: I think readers might be interpreting &quot;unhatched&quot; as &quot;total before hatching&quot;. You could eliminate ambiguity by perhaps splitting the bars into male and female, and then within a bar, coloring by hatched versus unhatched. But this is a minor point, and I think the updated text helps clarify this.</p>
<p>The new Figure 4b looks to be largely redundant with the oscar information in Figure 1a.</p>
<p>Updated statistical comparisons for the RNA-seq analysis are helpful. However these analyses are based on single libraries (albeit each a pool of many individuals), so this is still a weaker aspect of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The new information on masc similarity is useful (Fig 4d) - if the authors could please include a heatmap legend for the colors, that would be helpful. Also, please avoid green and red in the same figure when key for interpretation.</p>
<p>Figure 1A &quot;helix-turn-helix&quot; is misspelled. (&quot;tern&quot;).</p>

<p>Thank you for your comments. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains often carry <italic>wmk</italic> genes, but as observed in this study, the homologs in <italic>Homona</italic> showed no apparent MK ability. These showed strong male lethality in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, but it is still unclear whether the genes are the master male-killing gene in Diptera. It is also possible that the genes show toxicities in other lepidopteran insects as well as in other insect taxa. Further functional validation assays in different insects are warranted to clarify whether <italic>wmk</italic> shows toxicity in different insect taxa.

<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have thoroughly revised the manuscript to address all the questions, comments and suggestions you raised in “recommendations”. In particular, we have revised the section on the transfection assays of Oscar and Masc in Bm-N4 cells (result section “Hm-oscar suppresses the masculinizing functions of lepidopteran masc genes” starts on line 214 and Fig. 4; materials and methods section ”Transfection assays and quantification of <italic>BmIMP<sup>M</sup></italic>”, starts on line 483). We have also provided more detailed explanations for non-experts in some contexts (in response to your recommendation). We believe that the resulting revisions have significantly improved the quality and comprehensiveness of our manuscript.</p>

They also found that Hm-Oscar disrupts sex determination in male embryos by inducing female-type dsx splicing and impairing dosage compensation. Additionally, Hm-Oscar suppresses the function of Masc. The manuscript is well-written and presents intriguing findings. The results support their conclusions regarding the diversity and commonality of MK mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms and evolutionary aspects of Wolbachia-induced MK.</p>

<p>Strengths/weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors found that transient overexpression of Hm-oscar, but not wmk-1-4, in Wolbachia-free H. magnanima embryos induces female-biased sex ratios. These results are striking and mirror the phenotype of the wHm-t infected line (WT12). However, Table 1 lists the &quot;male ratio,&quot; while the text presents the &quot;female ratio&quot; with standard deviation. For consistency, the calculation term should be uniform, and the &quot;ratio&quot; should be listed for each replicate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the first results section (<italic>Hm-oscar</italic> induces female-biased sex ratios, starting from line 147) accordingly to maintain the consistency in the calculation term. In the revised manuscript, the 'male ratio' is now consistently used, in alignment with Fig. 1. In addition, we have included all sex ratio information (number of males and females) in the supplementary data file for transparency and clarity.</p>

<p>The large error bar on each chromosome (Fig.3a-d) likely reflect the overall variation in expression levels across different transcripts. Accordingly, we have included statistical data for Figure 3 based on the Steel-Dwass test for expression levels. However, displaying statistical significance directly on the whisker plots would make the figure too cluttered due to the numerous combinations. Instead, we have provided all the statistical data in the supplementary data file. To further support the claim that Z-linked genes are more highly expressed in wHm-t-infected/Hb-Oscar-injected embryos, we have included the expression data for a Z-linked gene tpi, along with its statistical data in the revised manuscript (Fig. 3e, lines 210-212).</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion.

<p>(4) Although the authors show that Hm-oscar is involved in Wolbachia-induced MK in Homona magnanima and interacts with the sex determination system in lepidopteran insects, the precise molecular mechanism of Hm-oscar-induced MK remains unclear. Further studies are needed to elucidate how Hm-oscar regulates Homona magnanima genes to induce MK, though this may be beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on our findings and previous studies in <italic>Homona</italic>, <italic>Ostrinia</italic> and <italic>Bombyx</italic> (Arai et al., 2023a; Katsuma et al., 2023; Kiuchi et al., 2014), we hypothesize that the molecular mechanisms underlying _w_Hm-induced MK are likely linked to impaired dosage compensation caused by the inhibition of Masc function by the Hm-Oscar protein. While the precise mechanisms remain unclear, unbalanced Z-linked gene expression due to the impaired dosage compensation (i.e., 2-fold higher Z-linked gene expression compared to normal males) is known to be lethal for lepidopteran males (Kiuchi et al., 2014; Fukui et al., 2015; Visser et al., 2021). We have outlined this hypothesis in the Discussion section (lines 245-254).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Overall, this is a clearly written manuscript with nice hypothesis testing in a non-model organism that addresses the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated male killing. The authors aim to determine how five previously identified male-killing genes (encoded in the prophage region of the wHm Wolbachia strain) impact the native host, Homona magnanima moths. This work builds on the authors' previous studies in which:</p>
<p>(1) They tested the impact of these same wHm genes via heterologous expression in Drosophila melanogaster.</p>
<p>(2) They examined the activity of other male-killing genes (e.g., from the wFur Wolbachia strain in its native host: Ostrinia furnacalis moths).</p>
<p>Advances here include identifying which wHm gene most strongly recapitulates the male-killing phenotype in the native host (rather than in Drosophila), and the finding that the Hm-Oscar protein has the potential for male-killing in a diverse set of lepidopterans, as inferred by the cell-culture assays.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strengths of the manuscript include the reverse genetics approaches to dissect the impact of specific male-killing loci, and the use of a &quot;masculinization&quot; assay in Lepidopteran cell lines to determine the impact of interactions between specific masc and oscar homologs.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestions. We have thoroughly revised the manuscript to provide clearer explanations for non-experts. In addition, we have included more detailed statistical data for Figure 3 and Figure 4 based on the Steel-Dwass tests. For Figure 3a-d, displaying statistical significance directly on the whisker plots would make the figure too cluttered due to the numerous combinations. Therefore, we have provided all the statistical data in the supplementary data file. To further support the claim that Z-linked genes are more highly expressed in _w_Hm-t-infected/Hm-Oscar-injected embryos, we have included the expression data for a Z-linked gene <italic>tpi</italic>, along with its statistical data in the revised manuscript (Fig.3e, lines 210-212). Regarding Figure 4, we have revised the Figure based on the reviewer’s suggestions, and provided more detailed information on how the expression data were analyzed (Transfection assays and quantification of <italic>BmIMP<sup>M</sup></italic>, lines 495-520). We have also included more detailed background information on the assay system (<italic>Hm-oscar</italic> suppresses the masculinizing functions of lepidopteran <italic>masc</italic> genes, lines 215-237). Although we did not observe statistical significance based on the Steel-Dwass test, likely due to limited replicates, the observed changes in the <italic>IMP</italic> gene expression remain clearly evident.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The manuscript I think would be much improved by providing more details regarding some of the genes and cross-lineage comparisons. I know some of this is reported in previous publications, but some summary and/or additional analysis would make this current manuscript much more approachable for a broader audience, and help guide readers to specific important findings. For example, a graphic and/or more detail on how the wmk/oscar homologs (within and across Wolbachia strains) differ (e.g., domains, percent divergence, etc) would be helpful for contextualizing some of the results. I recognize the authors discuss this in parts (e.g., lines 223-227), but it does require some bouncing between sections to follow. Similarly, the experiments presented in Figure 4 indicate that Hm-oscar has broad spectrum activity: how similar are the masc proteins from these various lepidopterans? Are they highly conserved? Rapidly evolving? Do the patterns of masc protein evolution provide any hints at how Oscar might be interacting with masc?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. To address this, we have included a visualization of the structural differences between the Oscar and wmk homologs in Figure 1a of the revised manuscript. In addition, we have included more detailed information for these genes and revised the introduction (lines 110-114; 124-137) and discussion (lines 255-266) to provide a clearer and more comprehensive overview. We have also described the similarity of the Masc proteins and Oscar proteins that we used, which is now reflected in the revised Figure 4b and 4d. More detailed information on these proteins is available in the supplementary data. Notably, Masc proteins exhibit high sequence variability with conserved domains (Figure 4d). Previous study identified the N-terminal region of Masc as crucial for the Oscar function (Katsuma et al., 2022). The wide spectrum of the actions of Hm-Oscar likely stems from these conserved structures of Masc, but the effects might have undergone evolutionary tuning through interactions with the native host as discussed in lines 293-294.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is clear from Figure 1 that the combinations of wmk homologs do not cause male killing on their own. Did the authors test if any of the wmk homologs impact the MK phenotype of oscar? It looks like a previous study tested this in wFur (noted in lines 250-252), but given that the authors also highlight the differences between the wFur-oscar and Hm-oscar proteins, this may be worth testing in this system. Related to this, what is the explanation for why there would be 4 copies of wmk in Hm?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. Unfortunately, we have not yet tested the effects of co-expression of wmk and Oscar. Due to a technical issue, the mixing of multiple constructs results in a reduced amount of mRNA (i.e. mixing wmk-3 and Hm-Oscar at the same concentration results in a 2-fold lower concentration in mRNA for both genes compared to mono-injected groups). In addition, we have previously tested injecting mRNA at the twofold higher concentration (i.e. 2 ug/ul mRNA), which resulted in very low hatchability regardless of the genes. Katsuma et al (2022) tested the effect of <italic>wmk</italic> on the sex determination system, but did not test the effect of co-injection/transfection of wmk and Oscar. Considering the results of this and previous studies (Katsuma et al., 2022; Arai et al., 2023), it is likely that the targets of the <italic>wmk</italic> and <italic>oscar</italic> genes are different (as discussed in lines 267-289). Co-injection of <italic>wmk</italic> and <italic>oscar</italic> may not produce additive effects. Nevertheless, we would like to test the results in future studies using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system as well.</p>
<p>As you point out, it is an interesting point that the moth-derived MK <italic>Wolbachia</italic> _w_Hm-t encodes four <italic>wmk</italic> genes, although they have no apparent effect on host survival. The exact functional relevance of these <italic>wmk</italic> homologs remains unclear. However, they may play a role in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> biology as transcriptional regulators, given that they encode HTH domains. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> generally encode several <italic>wmk</italic> homologs in their genome, regardless of whether they induce MK. This suggests that the functions of the <italic>wmk</italic> genes may be 'suppressed' in certain <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-host systems. The <italic>wmk</italic> and <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> genes are located within a prophage region, and some <italic>wmk</italic> genes are tandemly arrayed (as described in Arai et al., 2023). These <italic>wmk</italic> homologs may have increased in number by horizontal phage transfer, and the region containing <italic>wmk</italic> and adjacent sequences may act as a genomic island for virulence. So far, the function of <italic>wmk</italic> homologs has only been tested in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>H. magnanima</italic>, and further studies in other <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-host systems are highly warranted to test whether <italic>wmk</italic> exerts MK effects in other insect models. These points have been briefly discussed in the revised manuscript (lines 301-306; 318-320).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Why are some of the broods male-biased (2/3) rather than ~50:50? (Lines 170-175, Figure 2a). For example, there is a strong male bias in un-hatched oscar-injected and naturally infected embryos, whereas the control uninfected embryos have normal 50:50 sex ratios. It is difficult to interpret the rate of male-killing given that the sex ratios of different sets of zygotes are quite variable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The observed male-biased sex ratios in unhatched embryos are due to the occurrence of MK during embryogenesis. In the unhatched groups, the skew towards males reflects that fact that the male embryos were targeted and killed by <italic>Wolbachia</italic>/<italic>Oscar</italic>, leading to a surplus of unhatched male embryos. Conversely, hatched individuals show a higher proportion of females because many of the males were eliminated during embryogenesis. Thus, the unhatched embryos are more male-biased, while the hatched individuals are more female-biased in the <italic>Hm-oscar</italic>/_w_Hm-t treated groups. We have revised the relevant section (Males are killed mainly at the embryonic stage, lines 179-186) and provided more detailed information to clarify this explanation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 2b - it appears there are both male and female bands in the HmOsc male lane. I think this makes sense (likely a partial phenotype due to the nature of the overexpression approach), but this is worth highlighting, especially in the context of trying to understand how much of the MK phenotype might be recapitulated through these methods. Related, there is no negative control for this PCR.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. As you noted, a faint <italic>dsx-M</italic> band is visible in the <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> treated group in Figure 2b. This is consistent with previous findings by Arai et al. (2023), which reported that male embryos with low-density _w_Hm-t showed double bands of <italic>dsx-M</italic> and <italic>dsx-F</italic>, similar to what we observed in this study. This information has been included in the revised manuscript in lines 196-198, as follows:</p>
<p>“Notably, male embryos expressing <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> also exhibited weak male-type <italic>dsx</italic> splicing in addition to the female-type splicing, resembling the previously observed pattern in male embryos infected with low-titer _w_Hm-t (Arai et al., 2023a).”</p>
<p>Also, we appreciate your comment regarding the missing of negative control. The figure has now been revised as we realised that the negative control lane had been lost during the preparation of the figure. We also included the relevant molecular marker information in both the figure legends and Figure 2b.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It appears the RNA-seq analysis (Figure 3) is based on a single biological replicate for each condition. And, there are no statistical comparisons that support the conclusions of a shift in dosage compensation. Finally, it is unclear what exactly is new data here: the authors note &quot;The expression data of the wHm-t-infected and non-infected groups were also calculated based on the transcriptome data included in Arai et al. (2023a)&quot; - So, are the data in Figure 3c and 3d a re-print of previous data? The level of dosage compensation inferred by visually comparing the control conditions in 3b and 3d does not appear consistent. With only one biological replicate library per condition, what looks like a re-print of previous data, and no statistical comparisons, this is a weakly supported conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. In this study, we generated the RNA-seq data for the <italic>Hm-oscar</italic>/<italic>GFP</italic>-injected groups, but did not sequence the _w_Hm-t-infected/NSR lines. Instead, the previously generated RNA-seq data of _w_Hm-t-infected/NSR (Arai et al., 2023) were re-analyzed (rather than simply reprinted) to evaluate whether the expression patterns of <italic>Hm-oscar</italic>-injected and _w_Hm-t-infected groups are similar. We have revised the Results section (<italic>Hm-oscar</italic> impairs dosage compensation in male embryos, lines 200-212), the Materials and methods section (Quantification of Z chromosome-linked genes, lines 454-456), and the figure legends to provide more precise information about this analysis.</p>
<p>Although we did not perform replicates for the RNA-seq comparisons, it is important to note that each RNA-seq sample contains 50-60 male/female individuals. We believe the results are still robust and clearly indicative of the trends we observe. This was further supported by the quantification of <italic>Hmtpi</italic> gene expression, which we have visualized in Figure 3e (and lines 210-212). As you noted, the expression patterns in Figure 3b (<italic>GFP</italic> injected) and Figure 3d (NSR) are not completely identical. This discrepancy may be due to the differences between injection treatments and natural infections. Nevertheless, both treatments are consistent in showing that gene expressions on the Z chromosome (Chr01 and Chr15) are not upregulated.</p>
<p>We have also added more detailed statistical data for Figure 3 based on the Steel-Dwass tests. For Figure 3a-d, however, showing the statistical significance directly on the whisker plots would create excessive clutter due to the numerous combinations of chromosomes. Instead, we have provided the full statistical data in the supplementary data file. Furthermore, to support/strengthen our conclusion that Z-linked genes are highly expressed in _w_Hm-t-infected/<italic>Hm-Oscar</italic>-injected embryos, we have included expression data for the Z-linked gene <italic>tpi</italic>, along with statistical data, in the revised manuscript (Fig. 3e, lines 210-212).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 4: There are no statistics to support the conclusions presented here. Additionally, the data have gone through a normalization process, but it is difficult to follow exactly how this was done. The control conditions appear to always be normalized to 100 (&quot;The expression levels of BmImpM in the Masc and Hm-Oscar/Oscar co-transfected cells were normalized by setting each Masc-transfected cell as 100&quot;). I see two problems with this approach:</p>
<p>(1) This has eliminated all of the natural variation in BmImpM expression, which is likely not always identical across cells/replicates.</p>
<p>(2) How then was the percentage of BmImpM calculated for each of the experimental conditions? Was each replicate sample arbitrarily paired with a control sample? This can lead to very different outcomes depending on which samples are paired with each other. The most appropriate way to calculate the change between experimental and control would be to take the difference between every single sample (6 total, 3 control, 3 experimental) and the mean of the control group. The mean of the control can then be set at 100 as the authors like, but this also maintains the variability in the dataset and then eliminates the issue of arbitrary pairings. This approach would also then facilitate statistical comparisons which is currently missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. As you pointed out in (1), the previous analysis did indeed eliminate the natural variation in <italic>BmIMP-M</italic> expression. In the revised manuscript and Figure 4, we have reanalyzed the data following your suggestion and have described the variation across replicates.</p>
<p>For (2), the data shown in the previous manuscript were normalized to 100 for each Masc-treated group. In doing so, each replicate sample was arbitrarily paired with a control sample from the same cell lot to account for variations that might occur due to differences in cell lots. However, following your recommendation, we have revised the figure to set the average of the <italic>Hm-masc</italic> treated group to 100, rather than using arbitrary pairings. More detailed normalization procedures have been provided in the section 'Transfection assays and quantification of <italic>BmIMP</italic>' (lines 483-520). Additionally, we have provided more detailed background information on the assay system in lines 218-223. Although we did not observe statistical significance based on the Steel-Dwass test, likely due to the limited number of replicates, the differences in <italic>IMP</italic> gene expression between the <italic>Masc</italic>-treated and <italic>Masc</italic>&amp;<italic>Hm-oscar</italic>-treated groups remain evident.</p>

<p>Line 170: what is the explanation for the male-biased sex ratio instead of 50-50?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The male-biased sex ratio occurs because MK happens during embryogenesis.

Conversely, the hatched individuals display a female bias, as most of the males were eliminated during embryogenesis.

I am also a bit confused about the baseline control of Masc in these cell lines. If I understand Lepidoptera sex determination, then these cell lines are expressing high levels of female-specific piRNAs that suppress Masc. How specific are these piRNAs (i.e. do Bombyx piRNAs suppress Mascs from other Lepidoptera)? How much extra Masc will override endogenous piRNA?
