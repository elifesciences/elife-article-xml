<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Larvae of the ascidian <italic>Ciona</italic> initiate metamorphosis tens of minutes after adhesion to a substratum via their adhesive organ. The gap between adhesion and metamorphosis initiation is suggested to ensure the rigidity of adhesion, allowing <italic>Ciona</italic> to maintain settlement after losing locomotive activity through metamorphosis. The mechanism producing the gap is unknown. Here, by combining gene functional analyses, pharmacological analyses, and live imaging, we propose that the gap represents the time required for sufficient cAMP accumulation to trigger metamorphosis. Not only the Gs pathway but also the Gi and Gq pathways are involved in the initiation of metamorphosis in the downstream signaling cascade of the neurotransmitter GABA, the known initiator of <italic>Ciona</italic> metamorphosis. The mutual crosstalk of stimulatory and inhibitory G-proteins functions as the accelerator and brake for cAMP production, ensuring the faithful initiation of metamorphosis at an appropriate time and in the right situation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metamorphosis is a widespread feature of development that allows animals to have different functions between larval and adult stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. As larvae become adults, the shape and various characteristics of their physiology, gene expression, behavior, and lifestyle change. With these changes, animals can focus on a limited number of biological activities at each stage to increase feeding, growth, dispersal, and reproduction efficiencies. This biphasic mode of life is a widely conserved and ancient trait of animals, as evidenced by its presence in groups that maintain primitive states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, indicating that this long-conserved feature has contributed to animals’ flourishment. Therefore, to understand animal evolution, it is essential to elucidate the mechanisms underlying metamorphosis.</p>
<p>A key characteristic of metamorphosis is that both internal and external conditions determine its initiation. Sufficiently matured (or metamorphically competent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>) larvae start metamorphosis only when they meet an appropriate external condition to be adults. Various organic and inorganic external stimuli suited to the lifestyle of adulthood trigger metamorphosis. Many marine invertebrates exhibit a benthic lifestyle at the adult stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Their planktonic larvae have an adhesive organ that secretes adhesives and adheres to a substratum. The cues associated with the adhesion, such as the physical contact with the substratum and a chemical from organisms surrounding the adherence site, can trigger their metamorphosis. Upon starting metamorphosis, their larvae lose locomotive organs and transition into benthic adult forms. Determining the timing of metamorphosis is important for benthic animals, particularly sessile ones, to ensure their future survival and reproduction, as they become unable to relocate after metamorphosis. Therefore, sessile animals are suspected to have elaborate mechanisms to start metamorphosis only when a firm adhesion is achieved at an appropriate place. Although several reports describe this kind of phenomenon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, the mechanism by which the external condition is turned into an internal mechanism to trigger metamorphosis at the right timing remains elusive.</p>
<p>Ascidians are marine invertebrate chordates that are the closest living relatives to vertebrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The chordate features of ascidians are best represented by their tadpole larval shape. Like vertebrate tadpoles, ascidian larvae swim by beating their tail through neuromuscular activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, ascidians lose the tadpole shape during metamorphosis, and they exhibit a sessile lifestyle at the adult stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Ascidian metamorphosis comprises several key events, such as tail regression, body axis rotation, and adult organ growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Adhesion to a substratum triggers ascidian metamorphosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Ascidian larvae have adhesive organs called adhesive papillae, usually triangular protrusions at the anterior end. Adhesive papillae secrete a lectin-type mucus substance that is suspected to aid in binding to the substratum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, adhesive papillae serve as mechanical sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Although cells in the papillae are polymodal, sensing both mechanical and chemical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, the mechanical stimulus can trigger metamorphosis without such a chemical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> under laboratory conditions. The papilla is a neuronal organ that includes epidermal neurons positive for vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) and GABA, which innervate axons toward the sensory vesicle (larval brain)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The papilla neurons are responsible for initiating metamorphosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, our recent study suggests the involvement of a mechanoreceptor channel (the TRP channel) in the responsiveness to mechanical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. However, a simple physical adhesion is not sufficient to trigger metamorphosis. In our study using the model ascidian <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> Type A (it has been proposed that this species be renamed <italic>C. robusta</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and hereafter we call it <italic>Ciona</italic>), continuous adhesion for about 30 min is necessary before starting metamorphosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. When larvae detach before reaching the critical period, they must adhere for 30 min again for metamorphosis. Therefore, it is thought that ascidian larvae somehow sense the duration of adhesion and initiate metamorphosis only when adhesion is firm enough to be maintained for the required period. <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae continue tail beating during adhesion to push their body to the substratum. We showed that the strength of force generated by this swimming activity influences the timing of metamorphosis initiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In this phenomenon, abolishment of swimming activity elongates the time from settlement until metamorphosis is initiated. The mechanisms for measuring the duration of adhesion and the strength of the force generated by adhesion are unknown.</p>
<p>To elucidate the mechanisms triggering ascidian metamorphosis, the signaling pathways must be characterized. Many studies have discovered signaling molecules as possible inducers of ascidian metamorphosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. These molecules include neurotransmitters, suggesting that transmission of excitation in the nervous system, starting from the adhesive papillae, is crucial for metamorphosis. Recently, our group reported that the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA plays a pivotal role in initiating <italic>Ciona</italic> metamorphosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Knockout and knockdown of the genes encoding the enzyme synthesizing GABA called glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT or VGAT), and metabotropic GABA receptor (GABABR), resulted in the perturbation of metamorphosis. Moreover, GABA administration induces metamorphosis without adhesion. Our previous studies demonstrated that GABA induces the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>; however, it remains unknown how the inhibitory neurotransmitter activates neuronal functions for initiating metamorphosis.</p>
<p>In this study, we addressed the characterization of the downstream cascade stimulated by GABA. Because GABABR is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, we searched for trimeric G-proteins necessary for metamorphosis. These G-proteins are heterotrimers of an α β and γ subunit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Upon ligand binding, GPCR exchanges GDP of the α subunit to GTP, then the GTP-bound α subunit and the βγ complex are released from the GPCR. Although both the GTP-bound α subunit and the βγ complex have activities, the α subunit mainly determines the reaction specific to the G-protein type. Gαs and Gαi respectively activate and inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) synthesis. In contrast, Gαq increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration by promoting its secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum. We found that three G-proteins are activated in the downstream GABA cascade, resulting in cAMP elevation. Because the signaling includes stimulating and inhibiting cAMP synthesis, <italic>Ciona</italic> initiates metamorphosis only when a sufficient quantity of cAMP is accumulated due to sustained adhesion. Our results revealed the ingenious mechanism that permits <italic>Ciona</italic> to start metamorphosis only when achieving an appropriate adhesion firm enough to relinquish swimming ability and commence sessile adult life.</p>

<title>Characterization of G-proteins necessary for metamorphosis initiation</title>
<p>A previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> identified ten genes encoding Gα proteins from the <italic>Ciona</italic> genome, and we found nine gene models corresponding to these proteins in the latest genome assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Gα proteins are classified into four major groups (Gαs, Gαi, Gαq, and Gα12/13), which have distinct functional properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. <italic>Ciona</italic> has one gene encoding an unambiguous ortholog in each of the four groups (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). Moreover, a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> suggested the presence of another Gαq protein in the <italic>Ciona</italic> genome. Our phylogenetic tree suggested that Gαq (Gαq_Chr11) is orthologous to human GNA15 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>
<p>The remaining four <italic>Ciona</italic> genes (their gene models are KY21.Chr2.875, KY21.Chr4.943, KY21.Chr9.455, and KY21.Chr8.580) encode divergent Gα proteins. The Gα protein encoded by KY21.Chr8.580 has truncation at its N-terminal part, and we omitted this protein from the phylogenetic analysis. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that the remaining divergent Gα proteins have a strong affinity to the Gαi/o family proteins (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). Moreover, the amino acid residues at the C-terminal end of these proteins are more similar to human Gαi than the other Gα protein families (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). The C-terminal residues, particularly glycine at position 3, are essential for determining the Gi partner of GPCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. We tentatively name these proteins dvGαi_Chr2, dvGαi_Chr4, and dvGαi_Chr9. Gαi/o family proteins have inhibitory activity that suppresses cAMP production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To verify the possible contribution of G proteins to the initiation of metamorphosis, we quantified the expression level of the Gα genes in the adhesive papillae using RNA-seq surrounding this region (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Typical <italic>Gαq</italic> and three <italic>Gαi</italic> genes exhibited more abundant expression in the papillae, followed by <italic>Gαs</italic> and <italic>Gα12/13</italic>. Therefore, these Gα proteins were chosen as candidates for the protein(s) regulating metamorphosis initiation. Among them, we prioritized examining the Gα proteins having an excitatory function (Gαq and Gαs) rather than an inhibitory role, since previous studies suggested that excitatory events such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient and neuropeptide secretion occur when <italic>Ciona</italic> metamorphose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The primary function of Gα12/13 is the activation of Rho-mediated actin dynamics. Although this regulation is essential for tail regression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, this event occurs after metamorphosis initiation. Therefore, we omitted this gene from further analysis in this study.</p>
<p>We knocked down the <italic>Gαq</italic> and <italic>Gαs</italic> genes using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs). We found that both these genes are necessary for metamorphosis. The morphants of these genes showed a reduced rate of metamorphosis initiation even though they were allowed to adhere to the base of culture dishes, which was sufficient for control larvae to initiate metamorphosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-F</xref>). <italic>Gαs</italic> MO exhibited almost complete perturbation of metamorphosis, while the effect of <italic>Gαq</italic> MO was not strong (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>).</p>
<p>Gαq activates phospholipase C beta (PLCβ) to produce inositol triphosphate (IP3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. IP3 is received by its receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that releases calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>). The <italic>Ciona</italic> genome encodes two PLCβ (PLCβ1/2/3, PLCβ4) and one IP3 receptor (IP3R) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). We knocked down the <italic>PLCβ1/2/3</italic>, <italic>PLCβ4</italic>, and <italic>IP3R</italic> genes. The knockdown larvae of these three genes failed to start metamorphosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-I</xref>). The effect of <italic>PLCβ4</italic> MO was weaker than those of the other MOs, suggesting that this PLC plays an auxiliary role. These results suggest that Gαq initiates metamorphosis by the conventional Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway mediated by PLCβ and IP3/IP3R. To confirm this, we overexpressed constitutively active forms of Gαq (caGαq)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and of caPLCβ1/2/3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> throughout the entire nervous system with the <italic>cis</italic> element of the gene encoding prohormone convertase 2 (PC2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. When the microinjected animals reached the larval stage, they were cultured on agar-coated dishes after tail amputation to prevent adhesion. In this condition, the control larvae rarely started metamorphosis because of the absence of adhesion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). In contrast, ca<italic>Gαq</italic>- or ca<italic>PLCβ1/2/3</italic>-overexpressed larvae initiated metamorphosis without adhesion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K-M</xref>).</p>
<p>Adhesive papillae exhibit a Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase soon after sensing an adhesive stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We examined whether this Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient is dependent on the Gq pathway. Compared to controls, significantly fewer larvae injected with <italic>Gαq</italic> MO plus <italic>GCaMP8</italic> mRNA exhibited GCaMP8 fluorescence elevation in the adhesive papilla upon stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N, O</xref>). This result suggests that the Gq pathway is activated upon adhesion to cause a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in the adhesive papilla.</p>

<title>The Gs pathway initiates metamorphosis by activating cAMP synthesis</title>
<p>The involvement of Gs in metamorphosis was confirmed by the overexpression of a constitutively active form of Gαs (caGαs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> in the nervous system. This overexpression resulted in the enhanced initiation of metamorphosis without adhesion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>).

We previously reported that cAMP can induce metamorphosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.

We treated wild-type larvae with theophylline after tail amputation, and we observed that most theophylline-treated larvae completed tail regression without adhesion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-F</xref>). Theophylline has several target proteins in addition to PDE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.

<p>Using bPAC, we addressed whether enhanced cAMP production facilitates the initiation of metamorphosis. At 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf), only a few animals in both the <italic>bPAC</italic>-overexpressed and control groups initiated metamorphosis because 24 hpf is somewhat too early for <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae to be metamorphically competent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>).

Because many of the <italic>bPAC</italic>-overexpressed larvae did not initiate metamorphosis at 24 hpf, similar to control larvae, cAMP accumulation does not alter the timing of acquiring metamorphic competence.</p>

<title>Gq-Gs pathways work in the adhesive papillae for metamorphosis</title>
<p>The above results showed that activation of the Gq and Gs pathways are the key events in initiating metamorphosis. Gαq is necessary to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the adhesive papillae, suggesting that the Gq pathway functions in this region. If both Gq and Gs function in the papillae, they should be expressed in the adhesive papilla. The transcriptome analysis of the larval papilla region showed that the genes encoding Gq and Gs pathway proteins are expressed in this region (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Therefore, Gq and Gs could function in the papilla to initiate metamorphosis.</p>
<p>As shown above, theophylline induced metamorphosis without settlement. However, when the papillae were removed from larvae, the average rate of metamorphosis induction by theophylline was reduced from 100% to 30% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>). This suggests that cAMP elevation in the adhesive papillae is essential for starting metamorphosis. The overexpression of ca<italic>Gαq</italic>, ca<italic>PLCβ1/2/3</italic>, ca<italic>Gαs</italic>, and <italic>bPAC</italic> by the <italic>PC2 cis</italic> element resulted in the initiation of metamorphosis without adhesion. Like theophylline, amputation of the papillae reduced their effects in starting metamorphosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), confirming that activation of the Gq and Gs pathways in the adhesive papillae triggers metamorphosis. Among these experiments, ca<italic>PLCβ1/2/3</italic> overexpression was the most sensitive to papilla amputation, suggesting that PLCβ1/2/3 acts specifically in the papillae during metamorphosis.</p>

<p>If the Gs pathway is activated in the adhesive papillae, a cAMP increase should be observed in this region upon adhesion. We examined this possibility using a fluorescent cAMP indicator called Pink Flamindo (PF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. After stimulation, the fluorescence of PF in the papillae temporarily decreased on average by 0.83-fold (n=5) from the initial intensity, followed by a gradual increase by 0.0102 per min, to reach 1.17-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). The cAMP reduction and increase respectively started at 35 seconds and 4 min 40 seconds after stimulation on average. Such a reduction and increase in fluorescence intensity was not observed in the adhesive papillae of the larvae that had failed to initiate metamorphosis following stimulation (n=4; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). Therefore, increased cAMP in the papillae serves to indicate that sufficient stimuli of adhesion have been received to induce metamorphosis. This strengthens our hypothesis that cAMP accumulation in the adhesive papillae determines the initiation of metamorphosis. Both the <italic>Gαs</italic> and <italic>Gαq</italic> knockdowns abolished the temporal cAMP decrease, and reduced the rate of subsequent accumulation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), indicating that these two events are dependent on the Gs and Gq pathways. However, neither knockdown abolished the increase in cAMP completely (as shown by the slope scores), suggesting the presence of a mechanism producing cAMP without their activations.</p>

<title>GABA in the adhesive papillae is responsible for metamorphosis</title>
<p>Our previous study demonstrated that GABA is the chief neurotransmitter that induces metamorphosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. To gain insight into the relationships between the GABA, Gq, and Gs pathways, we addressed whether GABA functions in the adhesive papillae for initiating metamorphosis, similar to Gq and Gs.</p>
<p>The previous studies and our transcriptome data suggest that <italic>GAD</italic> is expressed in the adhesive papillae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, GABA-immunopositive signals have been detected in the papillae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Therefore, papillae can provide GABA to stimulate themselves. Next, we examined whether the adhesive papillae can receive GABA to initiate metamorphosis. We showed that the metabotropic GABA receptor is responsible for the initiation of metamorphosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Using whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, the previous study did not detect the expression of two GABAB receptor (GABABR) genes in the papillae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>; however, our transcriptome data detected the low-level expression of three genes encoding GABABR (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>) in the papillae, suggesting that adhesive papillae could receive GABA. GABA can induce metamorphosis without adhesion (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. However, the amputation of adhesive papillae suppressed this activity (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B-C</xref>), suggesting that GABA reception by the papillae is responsible for starting metamorphosis.</p>
<p>The larval brain is the major domain expressing <italic>GABABR</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Therefore, it remains possible that GABA signaling in the brain stimulates the papillae in a retrograde manner to initiate metamorphosis. The connectome analyses of the larval nervous system did not suggest a nerve that inputs into the papillae from the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>; however, retrograde stimulation would be possible through the volume transmission of a signaling molecule. To examine this possibility, we isolated larval fragments anterior to the brain (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref>), followed by the administration of GABA and theophylline. Through the application of these chemicals, anterior fragments exhibited increased clarity, elongation, and retraction of papillae, which are the signatures of metamorphosis (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E-G</xref>). Because their responses to GABA were weaker than those observed in the theophylline treatment, we further examined whether the anterior fragments can respond to GABA by monitoring the expression of GABA-responsive genes. By comparing expression levels between control and GABA-administered larvae, we made a list of the genes upregulated by GABA in the papillae (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Among them, we compared the expression levels of two genes (KY21.Chr5.240 and KY21.Chr8.489) between GABA-administered and control anterior fragments. GABA-treated anterior fragments expressed these genes at levels at least three times higher than controls (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5H</xref>). We concluded that GABA is secreted from and stimulates the papillae to start metamorphosis.</p>

<title>Gs/cAMP is downstream of the Gq pathway</title>
<p>Our next question is: What are the upstream or downstream relationships between GABA, Gq/Ca2+, and Gs/cAMP in the adhesive papillae?

Theophylline ameliorated metamorphosis-failed phenotypes in <italic>Gαq</italic>, <italic>PLCβ</italic>, and <italic>IP3R</italic> knockdowns (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-E</xref>).

<p>To gain further insight into the epistatic order of the Gq and Gs pathways, we overexpressed constitutive active forms of Gq pathway proteins in <italic>Gαs</italic> morphants with the <italic>PC2 cis</italic> element. If Gq is upstream of the Gs pathway, forced activation of the Gq pathway by caGαq or caPLCβ1/2/3 would not ameliorate the <italic>Gαs</italic> MO effect.

<p>However, puzzling results were obtained when we administered <italic>Gαq</italic>- and <italic>Gαs</italic>-knockdown larvae with GABA. If GABA is upstream of the Gq and Gs pathways, this chemical does not induce metamorphosis when the Gq or Gs pathway is disrupted.

Among the three morphants, GABA achieved more effective rescue in <italic>Gas</italic> knockdowns than <italic>Gαq</italic> or <italic>PLCβ</italic>.

<title>Contribution of Gi to metamorphosis</title>
<p>The function of GABA as the potential upstream factor of Gq could be easily explained if GABABR is coupled with Gq. Although a few studies suggest this possibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, Gi is regarded as the major G-protein coupled with GABABR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. A previous study demonstrated that the gene encoding typical <italic>Ciona</italic> Gαi is strongly expressed throughout the entire larval nervous system, including in adhesive papillae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, and our RNA-seq confirmed this (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). The knockdown of this gene (<italic>Gαi</italic>) exhibited a moderate (although statistically significant) reduction of metamorphosis rate (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref>), suggesting the presence of another Gαi regulating metamorphosis.</p>
<p>Indeed, the <italic>dvGαi_Chr2</italic> knockdown larvae failed to initiate metamorphosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>), and this phenocopy was rescued by theophylline and GABA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that <italic>dvGαi_Chr2</italic> is chiefly necessary for metamorphosis. The knockdown of <italic>dvGαi_Chr4</italic> resulted in a slight reduction of the metamorphosis rate (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref>), suggesting the supportive role of this Gαi in the metamorphosis initiation. These data strengthen the hypothesis that GABABR regulates metamorphosis through Gi. The rescue of <italic>dvGαi_Chr2</italic> morphants by GABA might be attributable to a redundant function of the typical Gαi and dvGαi_Chr4 proteins in the papillae; however, we could not fully address this hypothesis due to a technical limitation. That is, the simultaneous knockdown of <italic>dvGαi_Chr2</italic> and <italic>dvGαi_Chr4</italic> did not suppress the amelioration of metamorphosis by GABA (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6C</xref>). This might have been due to the presence of typical <italic>Gαi</italic>. The simultaneous knockdown of <italic>dvGαi_Chr2</italic> and typical <italic>Gai</italic> resulted in malformation of the body (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6D</xref>), and we could not examine their responsiveness to GABA.</p>

<p>We further explored the involvement of Gi upon metamorphosis as the upstream factor of the Gq-Gs pathways. Knockdown of <italic>dvGαi_Chr2</italic> resulted in the abolishment of temporal cAMP decrease and its subsequent accumulation upon adhesion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Because these cAMP fluctuations are Gq- and Gs-dependent (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C-D</xref>), their dependence on dvGai_Chr2 supports that Gi is upstream of the Gq-Gs pathways. Gi is known to activate PLCβ through the Gβγi complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Released βγ is inactivated by overexpressing normal (usually GDP-bound) Gα subunits because GDP-Gα quenches the βγ complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Overexpressing wild-type <italic>Gαi</italic> and <italic>Gαs</italic> in the nervous system significantly suppressed metamorphosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting that the activated βγ complex is necessary for initiating metamorphosis. To confirm that the wild-type Gαi exerts its effect through sequestration of the βγ complex, we overexpressed a dominant-negative form of Gαi (dnGαi)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> which has reduced GDP/GTP affinity while maintaining βγ binding activity. dnGαi significantly reduced the occurrence of metamorphosis (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6E</xref>), suggesting that the negative effect of Gαi on metamorphosis occurs through interaction with the βγ complex.</p>
<p>If Gβγ-mediated PLCβ activation is used in <italic>Ciona</italic> metamorphosis, PLCβ receives two independent inputs (Gαq and Gβγi) for its activation. These pathways could compensate for each other. We noticed that the MOs for GABA pathway genes and the <italic>Gαq</italic> MO did not disrupt metamorphosis as strongly as the <italic>Gαs</italic> MO (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C-D</xref>). The compensatory role could explain this phenomenon. Indeed, the simultaneous knockdown of <italic>GABABR1</italic> and <italic>Gαq</italic> resulted in a strong impairment of metamorphosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>), and these morphants initiated metamorphosis by overexpression of ca<italic>PLCβ1/2/3</italic> or ca<italic>Gαs</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>).</p>
<p>If the role of the GABA/Gi pathway relies specifically on PLCβ activation in the mechanism of metamorphosis, GABA administration would not rescue <italic>PLCβ</italic> morphants. However, GABA weakly but significantly induced metamorphosis in <italic>PLCβ1/2/3</italic> plus <italic>PLCβ4</italic> double-knockdown larvae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Therefore, GABA/Gi is likely to activate another pathway that bypasses PLCβ. Gβγi is known to activate group III AC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Its <italic>Ciona</italic> counterpart (AC5/6) is expressed in the adhesive papillae (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>), which could explain the results of the rescue experiments. In addition, there are two other major targets of Gβγi. One is the G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Our RNA-seq data on the papillae indicated the expression of two GIRK channel genes (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). The GIRK channel negatively regulates the excitation of neurons through hyperpolarization. If the metamorphosis of <italic>Ciona</italic> is induced by the excitation of papilla neurons as suggested previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, the GIRK channel is likely to regulate metamorphosis negatively. Indeed, the knockdown of one GIRK channel gene weakly enhanced the initiation of metamorphosis without settlement (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>). Although the negative role of the GIRK channel supports the involvement of Gβγi in the pathway of metamorphosis, this does not explain the PLCβ-independent activation of the metamorphic pathway by GABA/Gi.</p>
<p>The third function of Gβγi is to activate MAPK signaling through positive regulation of MEK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. PLCβ does not mediate this pathway. It has been suggested that MAPK signaling is required to induce metamorphosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. To show that MEK activation is necessary for inducing metamorphosis mediated by GABA, we treated adhesion-prevented larvae with GABA plus U0126, a potent MEK1/2 inhibitor repeatedly used in ascidians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. U0126 significantly reduced the rate of metamorphosis induction by GABA (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6F</xref>).</p>
<p>cAMP is also known to activate the pathway that involves MEK1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. We found that U0126 antagonized the effect of theophylline on metamorphosis (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6G</xref>). Therefore, GABA and cAMP have the same target (MEK1/2) to initiate metamorphosis, suggesting their compensatory function and/or that cAMP synthesis is upregulated by GABA-Gβγi. These bypassing pathways could explain the amelioration of the phenocopies of <italic>PLCβ</italic> and <italic>Gαs</italic> morphants by GABA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">H</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Among chordates, the tunicate ascidian is the only group that exhibits a sessile lifestyle at the adult stage. Understanding how ascidians acquired the mechanism to metamorphose into sessile adults is important for elucidating the evolution of chordates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Through extensive molecular, physiological, and pharmacological analyses, we identified signaling molecules responsible for the initiation of metamorphosis of the ascidian <italic>Ciona</italic>. Combining the results with previous knowledge, we described a schematic that best represents the cascades running in the adhesive papillae upon adhesion to initiate metamorphosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This working hypothesis will be the basis for future research on ascidian/tunicate metamorphosis. The hypothesis explains the characteristics of <italic>Ciona</italic> metamorphosis, the mechanisms of which have not yet been elucidated.

<title>Mechanisms measuring duration and strength of adhesions</title>
<p>One mystery of <italic>Ciona</italic> metamorphosis is that its initiation requires continuous adhesion with the adhesive organ for a certain period. This requirement is suggested for the faithful achievement of metamorphosis only when adhesion is firm enough to allow the transition out of the free-living larval stage. Our previous study suggested that approximately 30 min of adhesion is necessary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. A shorter duration of adhesion does not trigger metamorphosis. Larvae that experience short-term adhesion (such as detaching before 30 min) need to adhere again for 30 min to initiate metamorphosis, suggesting that the experience of temporal adhesion is erased. Our recent study showed that the force given to the papillae by adhesion also affects metamorphosis initiation: weaker force extends the time requirement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae likely possess a mechanism that somehow measures the duration and strength of adhesion and the ability to cancel transient excitations of the adhesive organ. Because fewer than 300 neurons constitute the larval nervous system of <italic>Ciona</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>, how the larva measures the strength and duration of adhesion with its simple nervous system is an important question to address the mechanisms of metamorphosis.</p>
<p>This study showed that cAMP is an essential second messenger molecule for triggering metamorphosis. Because PDE constitutively degrades cAMP, accumulation of this molecule requires persistent and/or strong activation of the metamorphic pathway that overcomes PDE activity. In other words, the duration and strength of adhesion could be converted into the quantity of cAMP, and when its quantity reaches a threshold, metamorphosis can be initiated. The time between the start of adhesion and metamorphosis initiation may be the period necessary to accumulate sufficient cAMP. This “cAMP timer” mechanism does not demand a complicated neuronal network system and could work in the simple nervous system of <italic>Ciona</italic>. Prior to triggering the cAMP timer, <italic>Ciona</italic> temporarily decreases cAMP quantity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref>). This reduction is also associated with metamorphosis initiation, suggesting that <italic>Ciona</italic> does not simply sense the cAMP increase. There are two plausible functions of this reduction. One is guaranteeing that the requirement of long-term adhesion will be met until a sufficient quantity of cAMP is accumulated, irrespective of the initial quantity of cAMP. The other one is multiplying the degree of cAMP increase. By reducing the initial value, larvae can increase the amount of this molecule several fold, even though the maximum quantity remains the same. Such an elevated difference in cAMP quantity may be adopted to ensure that the timing of metamorphosis initiation is appropriate using this ubiquitous molecule.</p>

<title>G-protein signaling relay for metamorphosis</title>
<p>This study showed that three major G-proteins are involved in the initiation of metamorphosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This complicated mechanism stands in contrast to the simple determination of metamorphosis initiation by cAMP quantity. What factor promoted the ancestor of ascidians to acquire this complicated signaling network of metamorphosis? We suspect that incorporating multiple components increases the chance of generating the crosstalk between molecules, providing rigidity and flexibility to the system. Particularly, the involvement of Gi may have been important for achieving metamorphosis at the correct time and condition. GABA and Gi have inhibitory and excitatory functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. <italic>Ciona</italic> larvae must ignore transient adhesion or stimulation on the papilla, which may occur frequently during swimming by colliding with an object or by strong water flows. At the same time, larvae must maintain sensing ability and start metamorphosis when they encounter an appropriate stimulus. Through the GIRK channel and Gαi, GABA can suppress the excitation and cAMP accumulation in the papilla. The GIRK channel could increase the excitation threshold of papilla neurons, allowing them to ignore weak stimuli. The transient reduction of cAMP at the onset of adhesion could be partly explained by the inhibitory function of Gαi on ACs. Not only Gi, but Gq and Gs are also necessary for this cAMP reduction. PDE1 is known to be activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Because PDE1 is abundantly expressed in the papillae (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>), the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon adhesion by Gi and Gq could also trigger sudden cAMP reduction through PDE1. The contribution of Gs to cAMP reduction is surprising because the general role of this complex is to increase cAMP. However, it is known that an important target of the Gs pathway for the termination of cAMP synthesis is PDE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. The involvement of three G-protein pathways suggests that the acute cAMP reduction is a special event that is distinct from its constitutive degradation.</p>
<p>Together with its inhibitory function, GABA can activate the Gq pathway, which promotes metamorphosis through Gβγi. Group III AC and MEK could also be the targets of Gβγi. When adhesion is long enough, their activations somehow overcome the inhibitory functions of GABA. The GABA pathway is an ideal player that fulfills multiple requirements in the regulation of metamorphosis through its excitatory and inhibitory functions. We suspect that papillae themselves are the source of GABA for metamorphosis initiation. Because VIAAT/VGAT is not expressed in the papillae, the secretion of GABA from the papilla neurons requires an atypical mechanism. GABA is detected in the cell body of the neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The release of cytosolic GABA may be triggered by the reception of mechanical stimuli using the TRP channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. A VIAAT-independent cytosolic GABA release is observed in pancreatic beta cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. Curiously, papilla neurons express transcription factor Islet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>, which is homologous to the vertebrate transcription factor responsible for β cell function. The atypical secretion of GABA might depend on a transcription factor like Islet shared between <italic>Ciona</italic> papilla neurons and vertebrate beta cells.</p>
<p>A recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> provided several lines of evidence suggesting that PNs can serve as the sensors of several chemicals in addition to mechanical stimuli. This finding and our model could be mutually related because these chemicals could modify Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP production. G protein signaling allows <italic>Ciona</italic> to reflect various environmental stimuli to initiate metamorphosis either mechanically or chemically according to the situation.</p>

<title>GPCRs for initiating metamorphosis and atypical Gαq activity</title>
<p>Future studies need to specify the mechanisms underlying Gαi, Gαq, and Gαs activation as well as the interaction between them more precisely. The activation of trimeric G-proteins relies on GPCRs, suggesting the presence of the receptors coupled with Gi, Gq, and Gs for metamorphosis initiation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Among them, Gi is likely to be coupled with GABABR; however, the expression of GABABR in the papillae is weak, and their interaction needs to be clarified in the future. We found that wild-type Gαq exhibits constitutive activity that does not require activation through adhesion. The constitutive Gαq activity requires GTP binding. If a GPCR owns this Gαq activation, its ligand should be supplied constitutively. Wild-type <italic>Ciona</italic> does not initiate metamorphosis without adhesion even though Gαq is expressed in the adhesive papillae, suggesting that the quantity of Gαq is strictly regulated to prevent autonomous metamorphosis in normal conditions.</p>
<p>We did not identify the GPCR coupled with Gs in the metamorphic mechanism. We suspect that GnRH receptors (GnRHRs) are strong candidates for this role. Our previous studies showed that GnRHs can induce metamorphosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> as a downstream factor of GABA. Among the four genes encoding GnRHR proteins, <italic>GnRHR1</italic> and <italic>GnRHR2</italic> are expressed in the adhesive papillae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. These GnRHRs stimulate cAMP signaling, and the ligand GnRHs for GnRHR1 are also expressed in the papillae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. Therefore, GnRHs could be secreted from adhesive papillae as downstream molecules of GABA and stimulate the Gs pathway through GnRHR1. Future studies targeting the regulation of the secretion and reception of GnRH peptides after stimulation of papillae will improve our understanding of the signaling cascade conducting <italic>Ciona</italic> metamorphosis.</p>
<p>Understanding whether the G-protein signaling relay occurs in cell-autonomous or non-autonomous fashions is crucial for deepening our understanding of <italic>Ciona</italic> metamorphosis. Each papilla comprises approximately 20 cells, including four papilla neurons (PNs). We showed that activation of Gq and Gs pathways in PNs is sufficient for initiating metamorphosis. This coincides with the previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> that the loss of PNs by disrupting the POUIV transcription factor caused the complete arrest of metamorphosis. However, we do not think PNs are the only cells that activate G-proteins, because Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP imaging showed upregulation of fluorescence in the entire papillae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. A recent study also reports Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in another cell type than PNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Other papilla cells are likely responsible for activating G-proteins by directly responding to adhesion and by receiving signal input from adjacent cells, thereby enhancing the signal strength to accumulate a sufficient quantity of cAMP in the PNs to initiate metamorphosis. In this study, technical limitations prevented us from characterizing cells exhibiting increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP; we need to address this question in future studies.</p>

<title>Evolutionary implications</title>
<p>Sessile or benthic marine invertebrates lose locomotive activity when they undergo metamorphosis triggered by adhesion to a substratum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. These animals are suspected of having a system to control the adhesion state, allowing them to repeat attachment and detachment before meeting the appropriate conditions for metamorphosis. For example, barnacle larvae “walk” on the substratum before adhering firmly by secreting cement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. Like <italic>Ciona</italic>, the larvae of some sessile/benthic animals may have a system to initiate metamorphosis only when appropriate adhesion is provided, while erasing stimuli from transient and inappropriate adhesion. GABA serves as the metamorphosis inducer of some benthic invertebrates, including mollusks and echinoderms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>.

To prevent larvae from initiating metamorphosis, the tail’s posterior half was manually cut with a scalpel. Removing the tail prevents larvae from swimming efficiently, and these larvae are usually unable to adhere to a substrate. These adhesion-prevented larvae do not metamorphose, since adhesion is required to initiate metamorphosis. Larvae developed from dechorionated eggs were cultured on a 2% agar-coated dish after tail amputation to prevent metamorphosis.

After isopropanol extraction, genomic DNA removal and reverse transcription were carried out using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara Bio #RR047). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was done using a SYBR Premix Ex TaqII Dimer Eraser (Takara Bio #RR091) and a Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System III (Takara Bio). The gene encoding elongation factor 1α (<italic>EF1α</italic>) was used to normalize RNA quantity according to a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>. qPCR primers are listed below. KY21.Chr5.240, 5’- TCTTCTCAAAGTTGCACATTCC-3’ and 5’-CAGCAGCAACCAAACGATAAAC-3’; KY21.Chr8.489, 5’- CAATGCAACTTTGACTGCATAC-3’ and 5’- TCCAAACTGCATTCCACATATC-3’; <italic>EF1α</italic>, 5’-CATGTCACGGACAGCGAAACG- 3’ and 5’- CAATGTGTGTTGAGGCATTCCAAG-3’.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors use gene functional analysis, pharmacology and live imaging to develop a proposed model of diverse G protein family signalling that takes place in the papillae during the ascidian Ciona larval adhesion to regulate the timing of initiation of the morphological changes of metamorphosis. Their experiments provide solid evidence that antagonistic G protein signalling regulates cAMP levels in the papillae, which provides a threshold for triggering metamorphosis that is reflective of a larva keeping a strong and sustained level of contact with a substrate for a minimum period of approximately half an hour. The authors discuss their reasoning and address different specific aspects of their proposed timing mechanism to provide a logical flow to the manuscript. The results are nicely linked to the ecology of Ciona larval settlement and will be of interest to developmental biologists, neurobiologists, molecular biologists, marine biologists as well as provide information relevant to antifouling and aquaculture sectors.</p>
<p>First, the authors knock down the G proteins Gaq and Gas to show that these genes are important for Ciona larval metamorphosis. They then provide evidence that the Gaq protein acts through a Ca2+ pathway mediated by phospholipase C and inositol triphosphate by showing that inositol phosphate and phospholipase C gene knockdown also inhibits metamorphosis, while overexpression of Gaq or phospholipase C allows larvae to undergo metamorphosis even in the absence of their mechanosensory cue, which is deprived by removing the posterior half of the tail and culturing the larvae on agar-coated dishes. The authors used calcium imaging with a genetically encoded fluorescent calcium sensor to show that Gq knockdown larvae lack a Ca2+ spike in their papillae after mechanostimulation, confirming that Gaq acts through a Ca2+ pathway. Similarly the authors show that overexpression of Gas also enables larvae to metamorphose in the absence of mechanostimulation, suggesting a role for both Gaq and Gas in this process.</p>
<p>To confirm that Gas acts through cAMP signalling, the authors use pharmacological treatment or overexpression of a photoactivating adenylate cyclase to increase cAMP, and show that this also enables larvae to metamorphose in the absence of mechanostimulation, but only when their adhesive papillae are still present. Transcriptome data indicate that both Gs and Gq pathway genes are expressed in the adhesive papillae of the Ciona larva. The authors use a fluorescent cAMP indicator, Pink Flamindo, to show that cAMP increases in the papillae upon adhesion to a substrate, and this increase is lost in Gs and Gq knockdown larvae. Complementary to this, larvae that fail to undergo metamorphosis lack a cAMP increase in papillae.</p>
<p>The authors then provide evidence that GABA signalling within the papillae is acting downstream of the G proteins to induce metamorphosis. Transcriptome data shows that the genes for the GABA-producing enzyme (GAD), and for GABAb receptors, are both expressed in papillae. Pharmacological experiments show that GABA induces metamorphosis in the absence of mechanosensory cues, but only in larvae that retain their papillae. To show that GABA signalling within the papillae, rather than from the brain of the larva is important, the authors also demonstrate that anterior segments of larvae lacking the brain, can also be stimulated to metamorphose by GABA, and show changes in gene expression caused by GABA.</p>
<p>The authors then use a combination of pharmacology and knockdown experiments in the presence or absence of mechanosensory cues to show that Gq/Ca2+ signalling acts upstream of Gs/cAMP signalling. As elevation of cAMP by pharmacology or photoactivating adenylate cyclase rescued GABA pathway mutant larvae, the Gq and Gs pathways were concluded to be downstream of GABA signaling. However, as GABA treatment could still induce Gaq- and Gas-knockdown larvae to metamorphose, suggesting an alternative pathway to metamorphosis, which the authors deduce to be through a third G protein, Gai. They identify an unusual Gai protein that based on transcriptome data is strongly expressed in the papillae. Gai knockdown larvae fail to metamorphose but are rescued by GABA treatment, which can be explained by a potential additional Gai protein being still present (this is confirmed experimentally with MO knockdown experiments). The authors then use overexpression and knockdown experiments to show that the Gai protein acts through Gβγi complex to activate phospholipase C. Their experiments also indicate potential for a complementary or compensatory role for Gai and Gaq signalling through Gβγi. By inhibiting the potassium channel GIRK through knockdown, and the MAPK pathway gene MEK1/2 by pharmacology, the authors also establish a role for these in their proposed model of signalling, allowing GABA and cAMP to compensate or interact with each other.</p>
<p>The strength of this paper is the meticulous and extensive experiments, which are carefully designed to be able to precisely target specific genes in the putative signalling pathway to build step by step a complex model that can demonstrate how metamorphosis of the ascidian larva is timed so as to only occur when strongly attached to a suitable substrate. The unique possibility of inhibiting mechanosensory-induced metamorphosis by removing some of the tail and smoothing the attachment substrate allows the authors to investigate potential effects on both activation and inhibition of metamorphosis, and to confirm that specific signalling pathways are clearly downstream of the initial mechanosensory stimulation. The study is also clear about which aspects of the model still remain unknown, such as which ligands and receptors may be responsible for the binding and activation of Gaq and Gas. Experiments testing metamorphosis of just the anterior region of the larvae nicely demonstrate the need for signalling in the region of the papillae, as do experiments where the papillae are removed, which then block metamorphosis in treatments that would otherwise stimulate it. The final model makes a clear summary of how the extensive experiments all fit together into a cohesive potential signalling network, which can be built upon in the future to potentially integrate the role of sensory cues additional to mechanosensation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work aims to characterize the neural signaling cascade underlying the initiation of metamorphosis in Ciona larvae. Combining gene-specific functional analyses, pharmacological experiments, and live imaging approaches, the authors identify the molecular players downstream of GABA to initiate Ciona metamorphosis. The results of this study will serve as a useful framework for future research on animal metamorphosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the Ciona model system, the authors meticulously conducted genetic manipulation and pharmacological experiments to test the epistatic relationships among the signaling players controlling the initiation of Ciona metamorphosis. The experiments were well designed, and the results were convincing. Based on the experimental data, the final working model proposed by the authors will server as an important foundation for further investigation on metamorphosis controls in Ciona and other marine invertebrate larvae.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In this revised manuscript, the authors have greatly improved the descriptions of their experimental results, and have clarified my previous concerns. I do not have further comments on &quot;weaknesses&quot;.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments, which helped us improve our manuscript. We will make the following modifications in the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) In the first paragraph of the Result section, we will provide a summary of trimeric G proteins in <italic>Ciona</italic> and explain how we focused on Gαs and Gαq in the initial phase of this study.</p>
<p>We added a summary of trimeric G proteins in <italic>Ciona</italic> in the initial part of the Results section (page 6, line 23 to page 8, line 5). In this summary, we added the following sentence explaining the reason we focused on Gas and Gaq in the initial phase of this study: &quot;Among them, we prioritized examining the Gα proteins having an excitatory function (Gαq and Gαs) rather than inhibitory roles since previous studies suggested that excitatory events like Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient and neuropeptide secretion occur when <italic>Ciona</italic> metamorphose.&quot;</p>
<p>(2) As the reviewer 1 suggests, the polymodal roles of papilla neurons are interesting. Although we could not address this through functional analyses in this study, we will add a discussion regarding this aspect. The sentences will be something like the following:</p>
<p>“The recent study (Hoyer et al., 2024) provided several lines of evidence suggesting that PSNs can serve as the sensors of several chemicals in addition to the mechanical stimuli. This finding and our model could be mutually related because these chemicals could modify Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP production. The use of G protein signaling allows <italic>Ciona</italic> to reflect various environmental stimuli to initiate metamorphosis in the appropriate situation, both mechanically and chemically.”</p>
<p>We added a discussion related to the recent publication by Hoyer and colleagues on page 23, lines 13-18: &quot; A recent study[19] provided several lines of evidence suggesting that PNs can serve as the sensors of several chemicals in addition to mechanical stimuli. This finding and our model could be mutually related because these chemicals could modify Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP production. G protein signaling allows <italic>Ciona</italic> to reflect various environmental stimuli to initiate metamorphosis either mechanically or chemically according to the situation.&quot;</p>
<p>(3) As both reviewers suggested, imaging cAMP on the backgrounds of some G protein knockdowns is essential, and we will conduct the experiments.</p>
<p>We added the data on cAMP imaging in Gas, Gaq, and dvGai_Chr2 knockdown larvae in Supplementary Figure S4C-D and Figure 6E.</p>
<p>(4) We carefully modify the text throughout the manuscript so that the descriptions suitably reflect the results.</p>
<p>We modified the descriptions of experimental results so that the text reflects the results more precisely.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Pg1 - need to add an additional '6' to the author list to clarify which two or more authors contributed equally.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a 6 as suggested. Thank you for pointing this out.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Pg3 - note that larval adhesive organ applies to not all benthic adults, but to benthic sessile adults this makes it sound like the adhesive organ can trigger metamorphosis but has that been shown? In Ciona or others? Need to specify the role of cells secreting adhesive, vs sensory cells that trigger metamorphosis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We divided the corresponding sentence into two to clearly state that adhesion and triggering metamorphosis are related but could be different events. Moreover, we modified the sentence to state that physical contact is one example of a cue triggering metamorphosis. We then added another example of a factor triggering metamorphosis—i.e., chemicals from the organisms surrounding the adherence site (page 3, lines 16-20 of the revised version):</p>
<p>&quot;Many marine invertebrates exhibit a benthic lifestyle at the adult stage[4]. Their planktonic larvae have an adhesive organ that secretes adhesives and adheres to a substratum. The cues associated with the adhesion, such as the physical contact with the substratum and a chemical from organisms surrounding the adherence site, can trigger their metamorphosis.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Pg 4 - although mechanosensation is the focus here, could there also be chemoreception/chemoreceptors involved in Ciona metamorphosis? For example, Hoyer et al. 2024 (Current Biology 34(6):1168-1182) concluded that some palp sensory neurons were multimodal and could be both chemo- and mechano-sensory.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added statements about this recent finding in the Introduction and Discussion sections. In the Introduction (page 4, lines 16-18), however, we also stated that a mechanical stimulus can trigger metamorphosis in the lab without the need to supply these chemicals. This is to emphasize that the mechanical stimulus is the focus of this study. In the Discussion, we added a statement that G-protein signaling could also be used to receive the chemical stimuli (page 23, lines 13-18).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Pg 6 - Before starting functional characterizations, it would be useful to give an overview (table?) of the G proteins found in papillae, and what receptor they are suspected of binding to, or if this is completely unknown, and which downstream pathways they likely activate. That is, to show some results about which G proteins are found in Ciona, and which are found in papillae. In this way, it will make more sense for readers when the Gai is suddenly introduced later, following the sections of Gaq and Gas.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your idea to improve the readability of this manuscript. In the initial part of the Results section (page 6, line 22 to page 8, line 5), we added descriptions of the repertoire of trimeric G-proteins in <italic>Ciona</italic>, including phylogenetic analyses, and expression in the papillae based on RNA-seq data, followed by the reason why we initially focused on Gaq and Gas. The data are displayed in Supplementary Figure S1. The phylogenetic analyses were modified from those shown in Supplementary Figure S5 of the previous version. We also added the general downstream activities of Gas, Gai and Gaq in the Introduction section (page 6, lines 10-12). Considering the contents, the general function of Ga12/13 was stated in the Results section (page 8, lines 2-3).</p>
<p>We did not add the information about their partner receptors in this early section. This is because there are many candidates, and we could not pick some of them. Instead, we described our current suppositions about their possible partners in the Discussion (page 23, line 22 to page 24, line 19). However, we suspect that there are more candidates, and we wish to promote unbiased research in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Pg 9 - would be good to know the timing of this PF fluorescence increase and the timing of stimulation in the text here, relevant to the 30-min gap before metamorphosis initiation</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the start times for the cAMP reduction and re-upregulation in the following sentence (page 11, lines 17-18): &quot;The cAMP reduction and increase respectively started at 35 seconds and 4 min 40 seconds after stimulation on average.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Pg 28 - Phylogenetic analysis: Given that the results may be of interest to metamorphosis in other marine invertebrates as discussed in the last paragraph of the paper, it would be useful to include G proteins from these other animal phyla where available in the phylogenetic tree. Similarly, in Figure S5A it would be useful to highlight further all the different Ciona G proteins, and the different protein families, through the use of additional colour/labelling (regardless of whether this remains Fig S5A, or becomes part of the main figures)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We drew a phylogenetic tree of G-proteins including those in some sessile and benthic animals (barnacle, sea anemone, hydra, sponge, sea urchin and shell). However, we decided not to add the tree in the revised version because, unfortunately, the bootstrap values of many branches were not high enough to have confidence in the results. We hope you understand our decision. <italic>Ciona</italic> divergent G-proteins are likely to be specific to <italic>Ciona</italic>.</p>
<p>According to your comment, we highlighted all <italic>Ciona</italic> G alpha proteins in red in Figure S5A, which is now Figure S1A in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3E and Figure S3 - is the data shown as an average of all larvae measured (n=5 and n=4) or is it data from one representative larva out of the 4-5 measured? This needs clarification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The original graphs in Figure 3E and Figure S3 are typical examples. We added the graphs summarizing data of all larvae in each experimental condition in Supplementary Figure S4 (corresponding to Supplementary Figure S3 of the original version). Figure 3E remains as a typical example of the result of a single larva to explain our data analysis in detail.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Experimental suggestion - As mentioned above, one missing detail seems to be the need for evidence that cAMP is elevated in the papillae directly as a result of Gs activation- this could be shown with measurement of cAMP via PF in Gs knockdown larvae that are mechanically stimulated compared to wildtype stimulated and non-stimulated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. The experiments are indeed important. We added the data of Pink Flamindo imaging in the <italic>Gas</italic>, <italic>Gaq</italic> and <italic>dvGai_Chr2</italic> knockdown conditions. The results of <italic>Gas</italic> and <italic>Gaq</italic> knockdowns are described in page 11, line 24 to page 12, line 5, and are displayed in Supplementary Figure S4C-D. The result of <italic>dvGai_Chr2</italic> knockdown is given on page 16, lines 20-22 and shown in Figure 6E.</p>
<p>In order to insert the data of cAMP imaging of <italic>dvGai_Chr2</italic> knockdown larvae, we transferred some panels of Figure 6 to Supplementary Figure S6. In addition, the knockdown data of <italic>dvGαi_Chr4</italic> and double knockdowns of <italic>Gai</italic> genes are also included in Supplementary Figure S6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Page 6, line 3-4 in the first paragraph of the &quot;Results&quot;; the authors state &quot;Neither morphant showed any signature of metamorphosis even though both were allowed to adhere to the base of culture dishes...&quot;. However, judging from Fig. 1E, &quot;the percentage of metamorphosis initiation&quot; (indicated by the initiation of tail regression) in Gαq morphans is not close to 0 (average about 40%), thus I am not convinced this observation can be described as &quot;Neither morphant showed any signature of metamorphosis...&quot; in this sentence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. In writing the original text, we oversimplified some of the descriptions when trying to improve the readability. We agree this resulted in imprecision in places. We have revised all these passages in our revision. In this particular case, we softened the overly emphatic statement to better reflect the results, changing “... any signature of metamorphosis...” to “... reduced rate of metamorphosis initiation...” In addition, we stated that the effect of <italic>G</italic>α<italic>q</italic> MO was weaker than that of <italic>G</italic>α<italic>s</italic> MO on page 8, lines 10-12. The weaker effect of <italic>Gaq</italic> MO was due to the redundant role of the Gi pathway, which is shown on page 17, lines 10-17, and in Figure 6G-H.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, in the next paragraph describing the knockdown of PLCβ1/2/3, PLCβ4, and IP3R genes, the authors appear to neglect there is a weaker effect of the PLCβ4 MO, and simply described the results as &quot;The knockdown larvae of these three genes failed to start metamorphosis&quot;. Based on Fig. 1H, about 30% of the PLCβ4 MO-injected animals still initiated tail regeneration. This difference may have some biological meanings and thus should be described more precisely.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the following sentence on page 8, lines 18-19 of the revised version: “The effect of <italic>PLCβ4</italic> MO was weaker than those of the other MOs, suggesting that this PLC plays an auxiliary role.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 7, second paragraph, on the description of GCaMP8 fluorescence and also at the end of Fig. 1O legend, the citation to &quot;Figure S1&quot; is confusing; Fig. S1 is the phylogenetic tree of PLCβ proteins. Is there additional data regarding this Gαq MO plus GCaMP8 mRNA injection experiment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure S1 of the original version corresponds to Figure S2 of the revised version. To avoid confusion, we deleted this citation from the legend of Figure 1O. By this modification, the sentence stating the repertoire of PLCb and IP3R in Ciona (page 8, lines 15-16) is the only sentence citing Figure S2 in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 8, first sentence; The purpose of theophylline treatment is not to prevent larvae from adhesion, thus I would suggest modifying this sentence to: &quot;We treated wild-type larvae with theophylline after tail amputation, and we observed that most theophylline-treated larvae completed tail regression without adhesion (Figure 2D-F)&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We modified the sentence according to your comment. Thank you for your suggestion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 9, second paragraph; judging from the data presented in Fig. 3C, I think this description: &quot;when papillae were removed from larvae, theophylline failed to induce metamorphosis&quot; is not accurate, because about ~30% of the Papilla cut +Theophylline-treated larvae still initiated their tail regression. This needs to be explained clearly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We modified the sentence (page 11, lines 2-3) as follows: “...the average rate of metamorphosis induction by theophylline was reduced from 100% to 30%...”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly in the next few sentences regarding the results presented in Fig, 3D, the effects of overexpressing those genes are not uniform. While amputation of papillae in larvae overexpressing caPLCβ1/2/3 could inhibit metamorphosis almost completely, papilla cut seems to have a weaker effect on caGαq, caGαs, and bPAC-overexpressing larvae.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a description explaining that ca<italic>PLCβ1/2/3</italic> was the most sensitive to papilla amputation, and the possibility that PLCβ1/2/3 works specifically in the papillae (page 11, lines 9-11): “Among these experiments, ca<italic>PLCβ1/2/3</italic> overexpression was the most sensitive to papilla amputation, suggesting that PLCβ1/2/3 acts specifically in the papillae during metamorphosis.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 9, the paragraph on using the fluorescent cAMP indicator; there is a discrepancy between the described developmental time when the authors conducted this experiment and the metamorphosis competent timing (after 24hpf) described on page 7. On page 26, the authors describe &quot;The Pink Flamindo mRNA-injected larvae were immobilized on Poly L lysine-coated glass bottom dishes at 20-21 hpf...&quot;. Did the authors start stimulating the larvae to observe the fluorescent signal soon after immobilization, or wait several hours until the larvae passed 24hpf and then conduct the experiment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The latter is the case. The immobilized larvae were kept until they acquired the competence for metamorphosis and then stimulation/recording was carried out. This point is described in the Materials and Methods section of the revised version (page 29, lines 16-18):</p>
<p>&quot;The Pink Flamindo mRNA-injected larvae were immobilized on Poly L lysine-coated glass-bottom dishes at 20-21 hpf, and stimulated their adhesive papillae around 25 hpf.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 10, the description &quot;...Gαq morphants initiated metamorphosis when caGαs was overexpressed in the nervous system (Figure 4F)&quot;. It should be noted that the result is only a partial rescue. To be precise, this description needs to be modified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We changed the sentence to reflect the results more precisely (page 14, lines 2-3): “Moreover, ca<italic>Gαs</italic> overexpression in the nervous system significantly, although not perfectly, ameliorated the effect of <italic>Gαq</italic> MO (Figure 4F).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 12-13, This description and the figure 5E presented is a bit confusing to me. The figure legend for 5E: &quot;GABA is necessary for Ca2+ transient in the adhesive papillae (arrow)&quot; But the arrow in this image points to a place with no fluorescent signal, and on the upper corner it labeled as &quot;29% (n=17)&quot;. Does that mean the proportion of &quot;no Ca2+ increase after stimulation&quot; was 29% among the 17 samples examined? Or actually, is the other way around that 81% of the examined larvae did not show Ca2+ signal increase after stimulation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The latter is the case. We added a caption explaining this clearly in the Figure legend: “The percentage and number exhibit the rate of animals showing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in the papillae.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 13, second paragraph; I do not agree with the overly simplified description that &quot;GABA significantly ameliorated the metamorphosis-failed phenocopies of Gαq, PLCβ, and Gαs morphants&quot;. As shown in Fig. 5F-H, adding GABA exerts different levels of partial rescue effect on each morphant, and thus should be described clearly.</p>

<p>When the outliers are neglected, the effect of GABA is most evident in <italic>Gαs</italic> knockdowns. This suggests that the target(s) of GABA signaling is more likely to be Gq pathway components. We added the following sentence to the revised version (page 15, lines 14-16):</p>
<p>“Among the three morphants, GABA exhibited the most effective rescues in <italic>Gαs</italic> knockdowns than <italic>Gαq</italic> and <italic>PLCβ</italic>.”</p>
<p>In addition, we think this sentence establishes a more logical connection with the sentence that follows it: “These results could be explained by assuming enhancement of the Gq pathway by GABA through PLCβ and another GABA-mediated metamorphic pathway bypassing Gq components.” Thank you for your suggestion.</p>
<p>The section &quot;Contribution of Gi to metamorphosis&quot; confirmed the possibility that GABA signaling targets Gq pathway components.</p>

<p>Page 13, the first paragraph on &quot;Contribution of Gi to metamorphosis&quot;; the description that &quot;The knockdown of this gene (Gαi) exhibited a significantly reduced rate of metamorphosis;...&quot; is misleading. I would suggest modifying the entire sentence as &quot;The knockdown of this gene (Gαi) exhibited a moderate (although statistically significant) reduction of metamorphosis rate, suggesting the presence of another Gαi regulating metamorphosis&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We modified the sentence (page 16, lines 2-4 in the revised version) as recommended. We believe the description is much improved.</p>

<p>Page 20, the last sentence about Ciona papilla neurons expressing transcription factor Islet; the authors seem to attempt to make some comparison with the vertebrate pancreatic beta cells in this paragraph, but the comparison and the argument are not fully developed in this current format.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To deepen this discussion, we added the following sentence (page 23, lines 10-12): “The atypical secretion of GABA might depend on the transcription factor like Islet shared between <italic>Ciona</italic> papilla neurons and vertebrate beta cells.”</p>
<p>However, we would like to limit the depth of our discussion on this point, as we hope to expand on it further in future studies.</p>

<p>Page 4, second paragraph: In the first sentence, the author states the current understanding of chordate phylogeny and cites Delsuc et al. 2006 Nature paper at the end of this sentence. However, in this paper cephalochordates were erroneously grouped with echinoderms, and thus chordates did not form a monophyletic clade. A later paper by Bourlat et al, (Nature 444:85-88, 2006) corrected this problem, and subsequently Dulsuc et al. also published another paper (genesis, 46:592-604, 2008) with broader sampling to overcome this problem. These later publications need to be included for the sake of correctness.</p>

<p>Page 14, regarding the redundant function of the typical Gαi protein in the papillae; the authors may try double KD of Gαi and dvGαi_Chr2 in their experimental system to test this idea.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We carried out double knockdown of typical Gai and dvGαi_Chr2. However, we could not address their redundant role sufficiently because most of the double knockdown larvae exhibited severe shape malformation.</p>
<p>dvGαi_Chr4 is also expressed in the papillae. We carried out knockdown of this gene, to find that the knockdown resulted in very minor but statistically significant reduction of the metamorphosis rate, suggesting that this Gai also plays a supportive role in metamorphosis. We also carried out double knockdown of dvGαi_Chr2 and dvGαi_Chr4. The double KD larvae exhibited responsiveness to GABA, probably because of the presence of typical Gai.</p>
<p>These results are described on page 16, lines 2-18, and the data are shown in Supplementary Figure S6A-D of the revised version.</p>
