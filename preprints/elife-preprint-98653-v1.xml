<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The CA3 region of the hippocampus is the major site of sharp wave initiation, a form a network activity involved in learning and memory. Highly recurrent connectivity within its excitatory network is thought to underlie processes involved in memory formation. Recent work has indicated that distinct subpopulations of pyramidal neurons within this region may contribute differently to network activity, including sharp waves, in CA3. Exactly how these contributions may arise is not yet known. Here, we disentangle the local connectivity between two distinct CA3 cell types: thorny and athorny pyramidal cells. We find an asymmetry in the connectivity between these two populations, with athorny cells receiving strong input from both athorny and thorny cells. Conversely, the thorny cell population receives very little input from the athorny population. Computational modelling suggests that this connectivity scheme may determine the sequential activation of these cell types during large network events such as sharp waves.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diversity among pyramidal neuron populations is often overlooked when considering the role of these cells within neuronal circuits. Despite reports of variation within the pyramidal population in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bilkey and Schwartzkroin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fitch et al., 1989</xref>), much more attention has been paid to the hetero-geneity of interneurons. However, several studies have reported functional and morphological heterogeneity within the pyramidal CA3 cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bilkey and Schwartzkroin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Marissal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Attention is now turning to this rich assortment of pyramidal cells, and recent efforts have begun to tease apart the distinct roles of these sub-types in functional circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cembrowski and Spruston, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Soltesz and Losonczy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Valero and de la Prida, 2018</xref>). In the hippocampus, CA3 is considered the main generator of sharp waves (SPWs), and thus, plays an integral role in memory consolidation. A recent study described two distinct sub-types of CA3 pyramidal neurons, differentiated by the presence or absence of complex spine structures called thorny excrescences (the post-synaptic site of input coming from mossy fibres of the dentate gyrus granule cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>). The study showed that cells lacking these thorny excrescences, termed athorny pyramids, fire before thorny pyramids during SPWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is proposed that athorny cells play an important role in SPW initiation and, in turn, in memory processing in CA3. However, it is unknown how these two sub-types of pyramidal neuron are embedded in the local microcircuit. We have previously shown that CA3 pyramidal cells connect to each other at a high rate (8.8 %) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sammons et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we investigate the local sub-type specific connectivity between thorny and athorny CA3 pyramids and find a distinct asymmetry. When implementing this asymmetry into a computational model, we find that sub-type specific connectivity is crucial for the distinct firing times of athorny and thorny cells during SPWs.</p>

<title>Results &amp; Discussion</title>
<p>To examine the connectivity between thorny and athorny pyramidal cells in CA3, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from up to 8 cells simultaneously. Cells were posthoc classified as thorny or athorny using biocytin labelling and confocal microscopy to determine the presence or absence of thorny excrescences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In total, we recorded from 348 CA3 pyramids, of which 229 were thorny and 119 were athorny (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We measured the distance from the soma to the first branch on the apical dendrite and found that thorny cells branched significantly closer to the soma than athorny cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>; median [IQR] for thorny: 12.5 [20.9] <italic>µ</italic>m, athorny: 51.4 [38.0] <italic>µ</italic>m; <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001, Mann-Whitney-U test). Furthermore, we found that athorny cells tended to be located deeper in the pyramidal layer, towards the stratum oriens. Meanwhile, thorny cells were found throughout the deep-superficial axis of the pyramidal cell layer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, median [IQR] for thorny: 28 [32] <italic>µ</italic>m, athorny: 12 [14] <italic>µ</italic>m, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001, Mann-Whitney-U test). These results resemble findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Marissal et al. (2012)</xref> who observed similar differences in soma location and primary apical dendritic length between early and late born CA3 neurons, suggesting that thorny and athorny neurons may be developmentally distinct.</p>

<p>Next, we looked at connection rates between these two pyramidal populations. In our whole-cell patch clamp recordings, each cell was stimulated to elicit 4 action potentials, and post-synaptic traces were examined for potential synaptic coupling. We found a high rate of connectivity (15%) between athorny cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Ai</xref>), and from thorny onto athorny cells (11%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Aii</xref>). Thorny cells connected to each other at a rate of 8% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Aiii</xref>). Meanwhile, connections from athorny onto thorny cells were the least common, occurring at a rate of 4% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Aiv</xref>). The overall rate of connectivity (65/734 = 8.9 %) corresponds well to our previously reported high level of connectivity within the general CA3 pyramidal population (8.8 %) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sammons et al., 2024</xref>). Synaptic connections were strongest amongst athorny-athorny cells, although no statistically significant differences were present across connection types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Bi</xref>, median [IQR] amplitudes for athorny-athorny: 1.08 [0.56] mV; ii, thorny-athorny: 0.88 [1.03] mV; iii, thorny-thorny: 0.57 [0.55] mV; iv, athorny-thorny: 0.66 [0.25] mV; <italic>p</italic> = 0.370, Kruskal-Wallis test). EPSPs across all connection types had latencies below 3 ms (with the exception of a single connection between two athorny cells which had a latency of 3.58 ms) indicating that identified connections were monosynaptic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We further looked at the failure rate of each synapse type. Athorny-athorny synapses had the lowest failure rate, although no statistical difference was observed between groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, median [IQR] failure rate for athorny-athorny: 11.5 [20.5] %, thorny-athorny: 33.0 [36.2] %, thorny-thorny: 21.0 [36.3] %, athorny-thorny: 12.0 [47.5] %, p=0.729, Kruskal-Wallis test). Additionally, we looked at synaptic dynamics to determine if synapse types had different plasticity qualities. Connections from thorny onto athorny neurons showed significantly more synaptic depression than athorny-athorny connections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.008 Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s posthoc with Bonferroni correction; all other comparisons <italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05).</p>

<p>To determine the overall impact of each connection type within the local network, we calculated the synaptic product. This metric takes into account connection probability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Ai</xref>), connection strength (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Aii</xref>), and size of the presynaptic population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Aiii</xref>), thereby giving an estimate of how large the input onto the particular cell type is for any given presynaptic population. Thorny-athorny connections show the highest synaptic product, followed by athorny-athorny connections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Aiv</xref>). Together, our results demonstrate a strong pattern of input onto athorny neurons and much weaker input onto thorny cells, particularly from the athorny sub-population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Athorny (A) cells have been reported to fire before thorny (T) cells during SPWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>) suggesting that activity flows along this axis. The low athorny-thorny (A<italic>→</italic>T) and the high thorny-athorny (T<italic>→</italic>A) connectivities might thus appear surprising. To understand what dynamics such a CA3 microcircuit implies, we constructed a model network in which T and A neurons are connected according to the experimentally observed connectivities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In addition to the two pyramidal cell populations, we included two classes of interneurons that have been suggested to play fundamental roles in SPW generation: PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells (B), which are active during SPWs, and a putative class of anti-SPW interneurons (C), which fire during non-SPW (NSPW) times and keep the other populations inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Evangelista et al., 2020</xref>). Strong reciprocal coupling between the two inhibitory populations gives rise to an underlying SPW-NSPW bistability, and the network alternates between these two states due to adaptation in pyramidal cells, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Levenstein et al. (2019)</xref> as the driving mechanism of SPWs. We tuned model parameters (see Materials and Methods) such that the event incidence is <italic>≈</italic> 1/s (with stochastic onset timings driven by finite-size fluctuations) and the average event duration is <italic>≈</italic> 80 ms.</p>

</fig>
<p>An event starts when B cells suppress enough C cells to disinhibit pyramidal neurons, which increase activity if their adaptive currents are weak enough. Athorny neurons activate first, due to their lower rheobase (documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al. (2018)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Linaro et al. (2022)</xref>, and our own data (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>)) and steeper f-I curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Linaro et al., 2022</xref>). Thorny neurons follow them in a clearly distinct peak, with an average 29 ms delay. This delay, which can be observed in both the firing rate and the spike raster plot (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Bi-ii</xref>), matches the data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al. (2018)</xref> and can be explained in the following way: immediately after the onset of a SPW, when A neurons are highly active, T neurons are inhibited by the B cells that are excited by the early active A cells. The direct A<italic>→</italic>T excitation is so little that the main effect of A on T is inhibitory. Only when the firing rate of A cells decreases due to a surge in adaptation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Biii</xref>), the activity of T neurons can also grow.</p>
<p>To confirm this intuition and test the robustness of these dynamics, we investigated the effects of varying each of the four excitatory connectivities. We found that the order of firing (A before T) does not depend on connectivity, while the delay between the peaks is strongly affected by it. In particular, for lower values of A<italic>→</italic>A connectivity, the peaks of A and T are almost simultaneous and the firing times strongly overlap, while they become even more clearly separated when increasing this connectivity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Ci</xref>). This happens because the A<italic>→</italic>A connections amplify the activity of A neurons more strongly and quickly, hence more effectively suppressing T neurons. The A<italic>→</italic>T connectivity has an opposite effect, with the difference that a second A peak can emerge for particularly low connectivities, because the delay is so long that A cells can partially recover from adaptation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Cii</xref>). The role of A<italic>→</italic>A and A<italic>→</italic>T connections can thus be understood in relation to each other: if A cells targeted T and A cells in the same proportion (both 15% or both 4% in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Ci</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Cii</xref>), the two populations would be recruited at almost the same time. On the contrary, if direct excitation from A to T neurons were absent, T cells could only fire after most A cells have adapted and fallen silent, with delays even over 100 ms. On the other hand, connections from T neurons have a strong impact on the relative size and amplitude of the peaks of T and A neuron activities, but not much effect on the delay between them (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Ciii-iv</xref>) because these connections play a role only in the second part of the event. In summary, not only can T cells activate after A cells even if the A<italic>→</italic>T connectivity is low, but such a low connectivity is also crucial to explain the delay seen in the data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al. (2018)</xref> and in our model.</p>
<p>In summary, our experimental results show that athorny CA3 pyramidal cells preferentially synapse onto one another, rather than onto their thorny counterparts. This difference is crucial for SPW events to have two distinct peaks and only partially overlapping firing times, as revealed by our spiking model. The model dynamics resemble the data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al. (2018)</xref> much more closely than the model proposed in the same paper, in which all neurons fire in a few ms and the athorny neurons immediately recruit the thorny cells. The long delay in our model is explained by the ambivalent role of athorny cells, which switch the system to the SPW state, but initially suppress, rather than excite, the thorny pyramids, and later adapt and release the suppression. Our modeling perspective assumes anti-SPW interneurons, which were proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Evangelista et al. (2020)</xref> to explain the paradoxical triggering of SPWs by <italic>in-vitro</italic> stimulation of PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Schlingloff et al., 2014</xref>). Although their existence in CA3 has not yet been demonstrated, in CA1 there are NSPW-active interneurons which fall silent during SPWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>), including a class of CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cells which has also been shown to have a strong reciprocal inhibition with PV<sup>+</sup> baskets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>). However, unlike the model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Evangelista et al. (2020)</xref>, SPW-NSPW alternations in our model do not depend on synaptic depression on the connections between these interneurons, but on adaptation in pyramidal cells, a mechanism that has been proposed in a different model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Levenstein et al. (2019)</xref> and whose efficacy we demonstrated in a spiking network with realistic neural dynamics.</p>

<p>Recordings were performed in ACSF at 32–34<sup><italic>◦</italic></sup>C in a submerged-type recording chamber. Cells in the CA3 were identified using infrared differential contrast microscopy (BX51WI, Olympus). We performed somatic whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (pipette resistance 3–5 MΩ) of up to eight cells simultaneously. One cell was stimulated with a train of four action potentials at 20 Hz, elicited by 2–3 ms long current injections of 1.5–4 nA. For characterization to confirm pyramidal cell targeting, increasing steps of current were injected (1 s, increment: 50 pA). In some cells, hyperpolarizing or depolarizing holding current was applied to keep the membrane potential at <italic>−</italic>60 mV.

<title>Data Analysis — Connectivity</title>
<p>Cells with a membrane potential less negative than <italic>−</italic>50 mV and a series resistance higher than 30 MΩ were discarded. The connectivity screen underwent a quality control step such that only sweeps were kept if presynaptic action potentials reversed above 0 mV and the membrane potential did not deviate by more then 10 % within a sweep or with reference to the first sweep. Synaptic connections were identified when there was a postsynaptic potential corresponding to the presynaptic stimulation in the averaged trace from 40–50 sweeps. A baseline period (2 ms) just prior to the stimulation and the averaged postsynaptic peak during the first action potential was used for the analysis of the EPSP amplitudes and synaptic delays. Only those pairs in which the first postsynaptic peak was clearly discernible were used for analysis. To analyse short-term plasticity dynamics, postsynaptic traces were deconvolved as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Richardson and Silberberg (2008)</xref>. The time constant, <italic>τ</italic>, was set to 55 ms and the deconvolved trace was low-pass filtered. Subsequent evoked EPSP peaks were then normalised to the first evoked EPSP in the trace. Synaptic dynamics were compared across connection types by comparing the ratio of the first and fourth EPSPs across groups. Failure rate was calculated by dividing the number of sweeps in which an EPSP was observed by the total number of sweeps. This value was calculated for each of the possible four EPSPs corresponding to the four presynaptic action potentials, and then a total sum for each cell was taken. For all boxplots, boxes cover quartiles and whiskers show entire distribution of data excluding outliers, which are shown additionally as filled black circles and considered to be 1.5 x interquartile range.

<p>After recording, slices were transferred into a fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Biocytin labelling was revealed by incubating slices in streptavadin conjugated to Alexa 488 (diluted 1:500) overnight in a solution of PBS containing 2.5% normal goat serum and 1% Triton.

<p>Neurons are modeled as adaptive exponential (AdEx) integrate-and-fire neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brette and Gerstner, 2005</xref>). This level of complexity (two dynamic variables: voltage and adaptation) is necessary to capture the diverse firing patterns of different neural populations. In addition, neuronal adaptation has been proposed as the main mechanism governing the SPW-NSPW alternation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Levenstein et al., 2019</xref>).

<title>Single neuron parameters</title>
<p>We consider four different neural populations: thorny pyramids (T), athorny pyramids (A), PV<sup>+</sup>-basket cells (B), and anti-SPW interneurons (C). The latter are modeled as CCK<sup>+</sup>-basket cells. For each population, parameters were chosen in order to be close to the single-neuron physiology. For A and T neurons, we follow the main figures and supplementary data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al. (2018)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Linaro et al. (2022)</xref>, since they performed detailed single-neuron physiological characterization of the two neuron types. Namely, athorny neurons were shown to have a higher input resistance, a higher resting potential, and a lower firing threshold than their thorny counterparts, and both kinds have a high reset potential. In particular, we reset athorny neurons above the threshold, because this is how the AdEx model produces bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Naud et al., 2008</xref>), a feature that has been reported in this cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>). Our parameters result in a lower rheobase for athorny than for thorny neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al. (2018)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Linaro et al. (2022)</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Interneuron parameters were based on data from CA3, if available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fidzinski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>), or otherwise from other hippocampal subfields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ledri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pawelzik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tricoire et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The parameters of adaptation cannot be directly compared to physiological values, because this variable summarizes a multitude of different currents, each with its own size and timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Benda, 2021</xref>). Therefore, we firstly aimed at reproducing the f-I curves of different neurons, when available (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). Thorny and athorny f-I curves were compared to those measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Linaro et al. (2022)</xref>, while for PV<sup>+</sup>-basket cells we used CA3 data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fidzinski et al. (2015)</xref>. In addition, the large spike-coupling <italic>b</italic> and long timescale <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub> of pyramidal adaptation allow to reproduce the strong firing rate accommodation typical of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Storm, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>), while these parameters are smaller in A and especially B cells, which can sustain a high firing rate without significant accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). In the AdEx model, if the voltage-coupling <italic>a</italic> is strong enough, spiking happens through a Hopf bifurcation, which is responsible for phenomena like transient spiking and class 2 behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Touboul and Brette, 2008</xref>). Therefore we set this parameter to 0 for thorny cells, in which these behaviours are absent, and to a higher value for athorny cells, which seem to exhibit transient spiking for intermediate values of a constant input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>), and for interneurons. In particular, for B cells, we could reproduce the discontinuity around 15 Hz typical of fast-spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gerstner et al., 2014</xref>). Neuronal parameters and their values are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Network parameters</title>
<p>Each population size is based on an estimation of its representation in a 400-<italic>µm</italic>-thick CA3 slice, according to the quantitative assessment by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bezaire and Soltesz (2013)</xref>. Pyramidal neurons are divided into thorny and athorny according to the 66%-34% ratio that we determined experimentally. The background currents <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>ext</italic></sub> are constant and correspond to the non-transient rheobase <italic>ρ</italic>, plus 10%, with the exception of population A, which receives +40% because it is responsible for keeping the other neurons inhibited for most of the time. This assumption is reasonable, since CCK<sup>+</sup>-basket cells “receive a far less efficient local excitatory drive, but are exposed to modulatory effects of extrinsic inputs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Freund, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Neurons are connected to each other with a probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>IJ</italic></sub>, depending on the pre- and post-synaptic population <italic>J</italic> and <italic>I</italic>. For excitatory-to-excitatory connections, these probabilities have the values that we assessed experimentally. For the other connections, the existent literature is too inconsistent to derive coherent conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gulyás et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Maccaferri et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mátyás et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bezaire and Soltesz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Campanac et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kohus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>): therefore, in order to minimize the number of assumptions not based on solid evidence, they were all given the same probability 0.2.</p>
<p>Excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic weights were all set to 0.2 nS, since differences in EPSP sizes were not found to be significant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This values corresponds to an EPSP size of 0.1 mV, which is lower than the ones measured experimentally, but compensates for the fact that they directly affect the (somatic) membrane potential of the post-synaptic neurons neurons and that connections are homogeneous. The other weights were chosen in order to satisfy the basic requirements for bistability and disinhibition dynamics, other than to produce realistic incidence and duration of SPWs and firing rates of the different populations. The search for the bistable region of the parameter space was guided by the insights previously obtained in the bifurcation analysis of a three-population model of CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Evangelista et al., 2020</xref>). Although our model has one more population, we found that the basic requirements are the same: pyramidal cells need to more strongly excite interneurons B and to be more strongly inhibited by interneurons C. In addition, populations C and B need to have strong inhibitory couplings between each other. For firing rate requirements, we assumed, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Evangelista et al. (2020)</xref>, that C neurons fire <italic>∼</italic>10 spikes/s in NSPW states and are almost silent during SPWs. For B neurons, we based on estimates of 5-10 spikes/s in the NSPW periods and fast spiking at 50–70 during SPWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lapray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Varga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hájos et al., 2013</xref>). Pyramidal neurons are almost silent (0–1 spikes/s) in NSPW periods and fire on average 10–20 spikes/s in SPW events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lapray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hájos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">English et al., 2014</xref>). In order to satisfy these requirements, excitatory weights needed to be about one order of magnitude smaller than inhibitory ones, which is partially in accordance with the hippocampal interneuron literature mentioned above, and partially necessary because not all kinds of interneurons are included in the network.</p>
<p>Regarding the other synaptic parameters, all the latencies were set to 1 ms, glutamatergic and GABAergic reversal potentials have the typical values of 0 mV and −70 mV respectively, and the former are assumed to be twice as fast as the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Geiger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bartos et al., 2002</xref>).

<p>This study represents <bold>valuable</bold> findings on the asymmetric connectivity pattern of two different types of CA3 pyramidal cell types showing that while athorny cells receive strong inputs from all other cell types, thorny cells receive weaker inputs from athorny neurons. Computational modeling is used to evaluate the impact of this connectivity scheme on the sequential activation of different cell types during sharp wave ripples. The experimental evidence supporting the authors' claims is <bold>solid</bold>, although improvements to the modelling aspect of the study would strengthen the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sammons, Masserini et al. examine the connectivity of different types of CA3 pyramidal cells (&quot;thorny&quot; and &quot;athorny&quot;), and how their connectivity putatively contributes to their relative timing in sharp-wave-like activity. First, using patch-clamp recordings, they characterize the degree of connectivity within and between athorny and thorny cells. Based upon these experimental results, they compute a synaptic product matrix, and use this to inform a computational model of CA3 activity. This model finds that this differential connectivity between these populations, augmented by two different types of inhibitory neurons, can account for the relative timing of activity observed in sharp waves in vivo.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The patch-clamp experiments are exceptionally thorough and well done. These are very challenging experiments and the authors should be commended for their in-depth characterization of CA3 connectivity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The computational elements of this study feel underdeveloped. Whereas the authors do a thorough job experimentally characterizing connections between excitatory neurons, the inhibitory neurons used in the model seem to be effectivity &quot;fit neurons&quot; and appear to have been tuned to produce the emergent properties of CA3 sharp wave-like activity. Although I appreciate the goal was to implicate CA3 connectivity contributions to activity timing, a stronger relationship seems like it could be examined. For example, did the authors try to &quot;break&quot; their model? It would be informative if they attempted different synaptic product matrices (say, the juxtaposition of their experimental product matrix) and see whether experimentally-derived sequential activity could not be elicited. It seems as though this spirit of analysis was examined in Figure 4C, but only insofar as individual connectivity parameters were changed in isolation.</p>
<p>(2) Additional explanations of how parameters for interneurons were incorporated in the model would be very helpful. As it stands, it is difficult to understand the degree to which the parameters of these neurons are biologically constrained versus used as fit parameters to produce different time windows of activity in types of CA3 pyramidal cells.</p>

<p>Sharp wave ripples are transient oscillations occurring in the hippocampus that are thought to play an important role in organising temporal sequences during the reactivation of neuronal activity. This study addresses the mechanism by which these temporal sequences are generated in the CA3 region focusing on two different subtypes of pyramidal neurons, thorny and athorny. Using high-quality electrophysiological recordings from up to 8 pyramidal neurons at a time the authors measure the connectivity rates between these pyramidal cell subtypes in a large dataset of 348 cells. This is a significant achievement and provides important data. The most striking finding is how similar connection characteristics are between cell types. There are no differences in synaptic strength or failure rates and some small differences in connectivity rates and short-term plasticity. Using model simulations, the authors explore the implications of the differences in connectivity rates for the temporal specificity of pyramidal cell firing within sharp-wave ripple events. The simulations show that the experimentally observed connectivity rates may contribute to the previously observed temporal sequence of pyramidal cell firing during sharp wave ripples.</p>
<p>The conclusions drawn from the simulations are not experimentally tested so remain theoretical. In the simple network model, the authors include basket cell and anti-SWR interneurons but the connectivity of these cell types is not measured experimentally and variations in interneuron parameters may also influence temporal specificity of firing. In addition, the influence of short-term plasticity measured in their experiments is not tested in the model. Interestingly, the experimental data reveal a large variability in many of the measured parameters. This may strongly influence the firing of pyramidal cells during SWRs but it is not represented within the model which uses the averaged data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The hippocampal CA3 region is generally considered to be the primary site of initiation of sharp wave ripples-highly synchronous population events involved in learning and memory although the precise mechanism remains elusive. A recent study revealed that CA3 comprises two distinct pyramidal cell populations: thorny cells that receive mossy fiber input from the dentate gyrus, and athorny cells that do not. That study also showed that it is athorny cells in particular that play a key role in sharp wave initiation. In the present work, Sammons, Masserini, and colleagues expand on this by examining the connectivity probabilities among and between thorny and athorny cells. First, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, they find an asymmetrical connectivity pattern, with athorny cells receiving the most synaptic connections from both athorny and thorny cells, and thorny cells receiving fewer. They then demonstrate in spiking neural network simulations how this asymmetrical connectivity may underlie the preferential role of athorny cells in sharp wave initiation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide independent validation of some of the findings by Hunt et al. (2018) concerning the distinction between thorny and athorny pyramidal cells in CA3 and advance our understanding of their differential integration in CA3 microcircuits. The properties of excitatory connections among and between thorny and athorny cells described by the authors will be key in understanding CA3 functions including, but not limited to, sharp wave initiation.</p>
<p>As stated in the paper, the modeling results lend support to the idea that the increased excitatory connectivity towards athorny cells plays a key role in causing them to fire before thorny cells in sharp waves. More generally, the model adds to an expanding pool of models of sharp wave ripples which should prove useful in guiding and interpreting experimental research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The mechanism by which athorny cells initiate sharp waves in the model is somewhat confusingly described. As far as I understood, random fluctuations in the activities of A and B neurons provide windows of opportunity for pyramidal cells to fire if they have additionally recovered from adaptive currents. Thorny and athorny pyramidal cells are then set in a winner-takes-all competition which is quickly won by the athorny cells. The main thesis of the paper seems to be that athorny cells win this competition because they receive more inputs both from themselves and from thorny cells, hence, the connectivity &quot;underlies the sequential activation&quot;. However, it is also stated that athorny cells activate first due to their lower rheobase and steeper f-I curve, and it is also indicated in the methods that athorny (but not thorny) cells fire in bursts. It seems that it is primarily these features that make them fire first, something which apparently happens even when the A to A connectivity is set to 0-albeit with a very small lag. Perhaps the authors could further clarify the differential role of single cell and network parameters in determining the sequential activation of athorny and thorny cells. Is the role of asymmetric excitatory connectivity only to enhance the initial intrinsic advantage of athorny cells? If so, could this advantage also be enhanced in other ways?</p>
<p>Although a clear effort has been made to constrain the model with biological data, too many degrees of freedom remain that allow the modeler to make arbitrary decisions. This is not a problem in itself, but perhaps the authors could explain more of their reasoning and expand upon the differences between their modeling choices and those of others. For example, what are the conceptual or practical advantages of using adaptation in pyramidal neurons as opposed to short-term synaptic plasticity as in the model by Hunt et al.? Relatedly, what experimental observations could validate or falsify the proposed mechanisms?</p>
<p>In the data by Hunt et al., thorny cells have a higher baseline (non-SPW) firing rate, and it is claimed that it is actually stochastic correlations in their firing that are amplified by athorny cells to initiate sharp waves. However, in the current model, the firing of both types of pyramidal cells outside of ripples appears to be essentially zero. Can the model handle more realistic firing rates as described by Hunt et al., or as produced by e.g., walking around an environment tiled with place cells, or would that trigger SPWs continuously?</p>
