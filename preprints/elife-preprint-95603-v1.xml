<title>Summary</title><p>Proliferative quiescence in β-cells is required to maintain functional competence. While this presents a significant hurdle in regenerative therapy for diabetes, the molecular underpinnings of this reciprocal relationship remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that TEAD1, the transcription effector of the mammalian-Hippo pathway, drives developmental stage-specific β-cell proliferative capacity in conjunction with its functional maturation. TEAD1 promotes adult β-cell mature identity by direct transcriptional control of a network of critical β-cell transcription factors, including, <italic>Pdx1, Nkx6.1, and MafA,</italic> while its regulation of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> maintains proliferative quiescence. Consequently, mice with either constitutive or inducible genetic deletion of <italic>TEAD1</italic> in β-cells developed overt diabetes due to a severe loss of secretory function despite induction of proliferation. Furthermore, we show that TEAD1 has a similar regulatory role in human β-cells. Consistent with this function in β-cells, variants in <italic>TEAD1</italic> have been associated with c-HOMA-B in American Indians. We propose that TEAD1 is an essential intrinsic molecular switch coordinating adult β-cell proliferative quiescence with mature identity and its differential modulation may be necessary to overcome the challenge of inducing proliferation with functional competence in human beta cells.</p>

<sec id="s1">
<p>Diabetes has assumed epidemic proportions with over 422 million people affected by it worldwide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. A reduction of functional β-cell mass underlies all forms of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, there is an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells, while type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by significant insulin resistance with varying degrees of reduction in β-cell mass and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Current strategies to promote proliferative capacity in adult β-cells are often limited by the concurrent loss of mature function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Hence, a better understanding of the balance between proliferation and functional competence in mature β-cells is critical to enhancing functional β-cell mass to prevent and treat diabetes.</p>
<p>Tead family of transcription factors (Tead1-4) and their upstream modulators of the mammalian Hippo-Tead pathway are important regulators of cell proliferation to control organ size in embryonic development and tissue remodeling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Tead1, a canonical downstream transcriptional effector of the Hippo pathway is expressed ubiquitously, but its physiological function in mature differentiated cells is largely unknown. The Hippo signaling pathway consists of a core kinase cascade involving Mst1&amp;2 kinases that phosphorylate Lats1&amp;2, which in turn phosphorylate coactivators, Yap and Taz. Phosphorylated Yap/Taz are retained in the cytoplasm and subsequently targeted for degradation. In the absence of this kinase signaling Yap and Taz remain dephosphorylated, translocate to the nucleus and bind to Tead to regulate transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Interestingly, although various Hippo signaling components have been studied in pancreas biology, the role of Tead transcription factors in β-cells is unknown. Deletion of Mst1/2 in pancreatic progenitors resulted in Yap activation, ductal metaplasia and pancreatitis without overt β-cell defects in proliferation or function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. During early pancreatic development Yap-Tead1 activate transcriptional events to control pancreatic progenitor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, while Yap functions as an inhibitor of endocrine lineage specification, both in vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and during differentiation of iPS cells into β-cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In contrast, though Yap is normally absent in adult β-cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, its overexpression promotes β-cell proliferation in human islets ex vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, while CTGF/CCN2, a transcriptional target of Hippo-Tead1 pathway, also regulates β-cell proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. All this strongly suggest that the Hippo-Tead1 pathway regulates β-cell proliferation. However, the role of Tead1 in adult β-cell proliferation and function has remained unexplored.</p>
<p>In this study, employing cell-type and developmental stage-specific genetic tools to systematically probe Tead1 function in β-cells, we uncover its surprising role in driving mature β-cell identity and glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), while maintaining proliferative quiescence by direct transcriptional activation of a network of critical transcription factors and genes that confer functional competence and limit proliferation. Our study thus identifies Tead1, the Hippo effector, as a non-redundant reciprocal regulator of the proliferative drive and functional competence in β-cells. Differential modulation of these activities may allow an increase in functional β-cell mass without a loss of critical glucose homeostatic function as a therapeutic approach to diabetes.</p>

<title>Tead1 is expressed in embryonic and adult beta cells</title>
<p>Tead family of transcription factors regulate proliferative pathways and determine organ size in many tissues during development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, their role in β-cell development and function are unknown. Examination of islets at different developmental stages revealed that Tead1 was preferentially expressed in adult mouse islets, and highly enriched as compared to other members of the Tead family that are present at 10-fold lower level (Tead2) or not detected (Tead 3 &amp;4) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1A</xref></bold>). Of the two canonical Tead1 co-activators Yap and Taz, only Taz was robustly expressed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1A</xref></bold>), as were many upstream signaling components of Hippo pathway (Mst1&amp;2, Lats1&amp;2 and others), suggesting the Hippo-Tead pathway is functional in islets. Expression dynamics of Tead1 by immunostaining during islet development revealed it was most abundant at e15.5 in all pancreatic tissues, but its high expression was restricted to islets around weaning and persisted at a high level in adult β-cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1B</xref></bold>). While Taz was robustly expressed throughout, from e15.5 into adult stage, Yap was absent in the islets at all stages examined (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1B</xref></bold>), a finding that is consistent with previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Human islets also expressed robust levels of TEAD1 and Taz but not YAP <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>)</bold>. In contrast to mouse islets, human islets express higher levels of Tead4. Based on the robust, yet restricted expression of Tead1 in mature β-cells, we selectively deleted Tead1 in a developmental stage-specific manner by crossing mice with Tead1 floxed (Tead1<sup>F/F</sup>) alleles carrying a floxed exon 3 that encodes the DNA binding TEA domain (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A-C</xref></bold>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> with three distinct Cre lines, namely Rip-Cre, Ins1-Cre (Thorens), and Mip-CreERT.</p>

<title>Tead1 deletion in β-cells leads to diabetes</title>
<p>Early constitutive deletion at e15.5 (Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup>), using Rip-Cre deletor mice, led to a loss of β-cell Tead1 expression, as indicated by &gt;80% reduction in transcript (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>) and near absence Tead1 protein (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>) in whole islets. Loss of Tead1 immunostaining was specific to β-cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>), but not other hormone-producing islet cells (data not shown). These Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice with embryonic deletion of Tead1 developed progressive hyperglycemia (fasting and fed) within 2 weeks of weaning at 5 weeks of age. At 2 months of age, they became diabetic with fed plasma glucose &gt;500mg/dl (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>). Indicative of a severe defect in β-cell secretory function, the Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice lacked the first phase insulin secretion (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>)</bold>, a feature that is lost very early in type 2 diabetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and displayed marked glucose intolerance during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing (GTT) due to a blunted GSIS (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I-J</xref></bold>). These results were not secondary to changes in body weight (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref></bold>) or insulin sensitivity (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref></bold>). Overall energy balance was similar to controls as indicated by food intake and whole body energy expenditure, VC02, V02, and RER (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1F-J</xref></bold>). To exclude potential confounding effect of hypothalamic expression or potential secretory dysfunction due to the Rip-Cre transgene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we applied another Ins1-Cre deletor line <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> for specific genetic targeting of Tead1 in β-cells by generating the Ins1-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup>mice. These Ins1-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> phenocopied the Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> indicated by marked glucose intolerance with a significant blunting of GSIS in vivo during GTT <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K-L</xref>).</bold></p>
<p>While the findings in Ins1-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> and Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup>mice demonstrated the requirement of Tead1 function in β-cells in maintaining insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in vivo, these models that involve embryonic deletion starting at e15.5 could also engender chronic compensatory changes. Hence, we tested whether Tead1 modulates adult β-cell function using Mip-CreERT mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> to achieve tamoxifen (TM)-inducible deletion (Mip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice). Tamoxifen administration (100mg/kg every other day for 5 doses by gavage) in 5-week-old Mip-β-Tead1<sup>F/F</sup> mice largely abolished-Tead1 protein expression in whole islet lysates when examined after 6 weeks, (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref></bold>), along with an absence of Tead1 nuclear immunostaining in ∼85% of β-cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N</xref></bold>). Strikingly, this restricted inactivation of Tead1 only in mature β-cells led to a marked glucose intolerance due to a blunting of in vivo GSIS with a loss of early phase insulin secretion (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1O-P</xref></bold>), demonstrating severe β-cell secretory deficits within 2 months post-TM treatment. Taken together, the three loss-of-function models of Tead1, during β-cell development (Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> and Ins1-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup>) or after maturation (Mip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup>) demonstrate the essential role of Tead1 in maintaining β-cell secretory capacity and glucose homeostasis.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Tead1 transcriptional control of a regulatory network is critical for maintaining functional mature β-cell identity</title>
<p>Using isolated Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> islets, we next determined the specific functional deficits induced by a loss-of-Tead1 function.

<p>To determine the regulatory pathways mediating Tead1 function in islets, we performed global transcriptome analysis in Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> islets that revealed 259 (down) and 296 (up) differentially regulated genes as compared to age-matched floxed controls (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref> and Supplementary table 3</bold>). In agreement with the profound defects in GSIS, among the differentially regulated genes by RNA-seq analysis distinct components of the insulin secretory pathway including the glucose transported Glut2 (Slc2a2) and glucokinase (Gck) were down-regulated in Tead1-deficient islets. In addition, key transcription factors known to specify and maintain adult β-cell function were suppressed, such as Pdx1, MafA. (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). Further analysis using an unbiased Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed a global down-regulation in adult β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> islets of genes significantly enriched in mature adult as compared to immature neonatal islets (GSE47174) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>)</bold>. Interestingly, many disallowed genes in normal adult β-cells that comprise the neonatal islet transcriptome signature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and are highly expressed in immature neonatal islets were not altered in Tead-1 deficient islets (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref></bold>). These findings suggest a loss of mature β-cell characteristics, rather than de-differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> of Tead1-null β-cells. Further support of this notion was found in the transcriptomic signatures of key processes that are critical for acquisition and maintenance of mature secretory function in β-cells, including OXPHOS, substrate metabolism, protein secretion and export, vesicular transport and UPR were consistently suppressed with loss of Tead1 (GSEA, q&lt;0.25) <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref></bold>). We further validated that in Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> islets, transcript (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>)</bold> of Ins1, Glut2, Pdx1, NeuroD, MafA and Nkx6.1 were all significantly decreased along with Ucn3, a hallmark of mature β-cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The protein levels of many of these genes were also significantly reduced by immunostaining (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref></bold>) or western blotting <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2L</xref>)</bold> with respective quantifications (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2M</xref></bold>).

<p>We interrogated whether Tead1 exerts direct transcriptional regulation of this gene network driving β-cell function and identity. Analysis of Tead1 occupancy by ChIP-seq in adult mouse islets on regulatory regions of transcription factors that are critical for β-cell function, including Pdx1, MafA, Nkx6.1, revealed its enrichment on these genes that were downregulated by loss of Tead1 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). ATAC-seq further confirmed that the identified promoter regions with Tead1 occupancy in islets occurred in open chromatin regions that are transcriptionally active (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>)</bold>. ChIP-qPCR using either endogenous Tead1 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>) or tagged Myc-Tead1 (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref></bold>) in mouse insulinoma cell line further validated Tead1 binding to cis-promoter elements (containing Tead consensus binding sequences of GGAATG) of Pdx1, MafA, Nkx6.1, Ucn3.</p>

<p>Since Pdx1 is a master regulator of mature β-cell function, we undertook a detailed analysis of Tead1 regulation of Pdx1 transcription. Interestingly, we found multiple Tead1 responsive elements in the Pdx1 promoter region as represented in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>, including the Tead1 consensus sequence present in Area IV region known to be critical for β-cell specific Pdx1 expression and postnatal mature β-cell function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In ChIP pull down with Myc-Tead1 in Ins2 cells, this site exhibited the highest enrichment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). In a promoter luciferase assay, expression of Tead1 together with its co-activator, Taz, activated transcription of the native Pdx1-promoter containing Tead1 response elements, demonstrating Tead1 functional regulation of Pdx1 transcription (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). Furthermore, Tead1 knockdown decreased Pdx1 protein level in Ins2 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-G</xref>)</bold>; whereas its overexpression by adenoviral vector in Ins2 cells increased Pdx1 expression (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H-I</xref></bold>). Overexpression of TEAD1 in additional human β-cell models including human β-cell line (EndoC-βh2) <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J-K</xref></bold>) or human cadaveric islets (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref></bold>) augmented PDX1 expression. It is noteworthy that TEAD1 and PDX1 protein levels detected by western blotting in individual human islet samples exhibited significant linear correlation (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>)</bold>. Thus, TEAD1 transcriptional control of PDX1 is conserved in human β-cells. Taken together, these data provide direct support of Tead1 as a direct transcriptional regulator that orchestrates a transcription factor network regulatory network critical to acquire and maintain mature β-cell function.</p>

<title>Tead1 mediates proliferative quiescence in adult β-cells</title>
<p>Tead1 drives cell proliferation in various tissue development processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. We postulated that Tead1 deficiency during islet development may limit β-cell proliferation to reduce β-cell mass. Surprisingly, Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> islets from 12 week old mice contained increased number of β-cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>), which was also reflected by increased DNA content in similar-sized islets (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref></bold>). However, these β-cells were significantly smaller (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>)</bold>, which offset the increase in numbers, so β-cell mass in Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice remained normal compared to that of the floxed controls (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>). Similar findings were observed when these were repeated in 5-6 month old Ins1-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> islets (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B-D</xref></bold>). Tead1 deletion only in adult β-cells in the inducible line of 9 month old adult Mip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice yielded similar findings with a significant decrease in single β-cell area (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4E</xref></bold>), but resulted in no change in total β-cell area (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4F</xref></bold>) or islet size (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4G</xref></bold>). Further analysis indicated that increased β-cell number in Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> islets was not due to apoptosis (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4H-I</xref></bold>), but rather because of higher proliferation rate, as reflected by a significantly elevated Ki67 positive β-cells (2% vs. 0.62% in 12 week old Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> and Tead1<sup>F/F</sup> controls, respectively; p&lt;0.01) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-F</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To test if Tead1 regulates β-cell proliferation at distinct developmental stages, we analyzed in vivo BrdU incorporation into β-cells in neonatal (postnatal day 12), post-weaning (4 weeks) and adult (12 weeks) mice. Notably, while there was no significant difference in proliferation at postnatal day 12 between Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> and Tead1<sup>F/F</sup> littermate controls, higher rate of BrdU incorporation was observed at 4 (5.31% vs. 4.08%; p&lt;0.03) and 12 weeks of age (0.5% vs. 0.2%; p&lt;0.05) respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G-H</xref>),</bold> with similar increase (0.03% vs. 0.1%; p&lt;0.05)seen in 5-6 month old Ins1-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> islets compared to floxed controls (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref></bold>). This data indicate that Tead1 did not contribute physiologic neonatal β-cell proliferative expansion when the proliferative drive is high, but rather was required for attaining proliferative quiescence as β-cells mature in adult mice.</p>
<p>β-cells have a short quiescence phase of ∼7 days after mitosis before they can re-enter cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Hence, we assessed if Tead1 could regulate total pool of actively proliferating β-cells by labelling all cycling β-cells over a 6 day period with BrdU via drinking water and found that active proliferation was ∼4 fold higher in Tead1-deficient β-cells than that of controls (17.1% vs. 4.46%) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I-J</xref></bold>). However, the fraction of proliferating β-cells in S-phase (BrdU-positive) to actively cycling Ki67-positive cells did not differ between the Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> and controls (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref></bold>) indicating that loss of Tead1 did not affect cell cycle kinetics, once the cells entered cell cycle. Together, these data supports the notion that higher proliferation in Tead1-deficient β-cells likely occurred as a result of more cells entering cell cycle (G1) from the G0 quiescent state. We then asked if Tead1 affects age-associated proliferative quiescence when most β-cells become resistant to proliferative signals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Tead1 deletion in β-cells in 9 months old TM-treated Mip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a 2-fold increase in proliferation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>)</bold>, similar as young adult mice. Thus, Tead1 was required to maintain quiescence in adult β-cells, while its inactivation releases cells from age-associated quiescence into active cell cycle.</p>
<p>The augmented β-cell proliferation in 4 week old Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>) preceded the onset of hyperglycemia at 5 weeks of age (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>), suggesting that the observed increase in proliferation is not secondary to hyperglycemia-induced compensation. However, to conclusively exclude non-cell autonomous effects, such as hyperglycemia, as a potential cause of proliferation, we leveraged the mosaic β-cell Tead1 deletion often seen with Mip-CreERT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Using this model, we pulse labelled cycling β-cells for 2 hours using BrdU and analyzed islets in which ∼50% of β-cells had deletion of Tead1. We found that within the same pool of islets in Mip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice with Tead1-positive and Tead1-negative β-cells, the proliferative rate was ∼ 5 fold higher in Tead1-negative than that of the Tead1-positive β-cells (0.58% vs. 0.11%; p&lt;0.05) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M-N</xref></bold>), indicative of cell-autonomous effect of Tead1 on proliferation.</p>

<title>Tead1 is a direct transcriptional activator of p16 in adult β-cells</title>

We inactivated Ezh2 in β-cells of Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice (DKO) by crossing Ezh2 flox mice with Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. As expected of Ezh2 regulation of p16, the loss of Ezh2 in Tead1-null β-cells restored the level of p16 to a comparable level in wild type controls (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref></bold>). Notably, 6 month old Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> β-cells without Ezh2 showed much lower proliferation rates than that seen in Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G-H</xref>) and at a level comparable to the control flox mice, (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref></bold>). Therefore, restoring p16 through the modulation of Ezh2 was sufficient to achieve/rescue proliferative quiescence in Tead1-null β-cells. Interestingly, the restoration of proliferative rates to normal was not sufficient in restoring glucose tolerance in these DKO mice, as these mice exhibited persistence glucose intolerance as compared to the floxed controls though there was some improvement as compared to littermate Rip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>).

Here, we identify Tead1 as mediating this reciprocal regulation of proliferative quiescence and maintenance of mature function in β-cells by direct transcriptional activation of a critical network of genes regulating these processes (schematically shown in <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>) in both mouse and human β-cells. We demonstrate that in adult β-cells Tead1 functions to limit proliferation and maintain mature identity and functional competence and its loss-of-function leads to β-cell failure and diabetes. Recent studies have highlighted limitations of individual insulin-promoter driven Cre-lines, such as potential secretory defects and hypothalamic expression in Rip-Cre, Gh minigene effects in Mip-Cre/ERT and possibility of low efficiency in Ins1-Cre and Mip-Cre/ERT lines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. To overcome these limitations we have used a combination of multiple β-cell Cre-line derived genetic models to decipher the critical and non-redundant function that Tead1 exerts in adult β-cells.</p>

<p>β-cells are highly proliferative before weaning, with proliferative rates as high as 4-6% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. After weaning, they acquire GSIS with robust expression of gene networks regulating glucose sensing, transport, mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation, and secretory machinery. However, as they gain functional competence, adult β-cells repress their proliferative program, lose their high basal proliferative rate having largely exited from cell cycle and self-renew at low rates that decline further with aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. While many pathways that regulate proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> and others that determine functional competence have been identified, mechanisms that evolved to coordinate these two programs remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify Tead1, as the critical mediator of this coordination of proliferative quiescence and functional competence in adult β-cells.</p>
<p>In the mature state, p16<sup>INK4A</sup> (encoded by <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>) and its regulators in the polycomb repressive complex (PRC 1 and 2) are one of the primary enforcers of proliferative quiescence in adult β-cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. These exhibit a significant age-dependent regulation of proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. The unexpected finding that Tead1 is required for maintaining proliferative quiescence in mature β-cells led us to identify Tead1 as a novel transcriptional regulator of p16 and a loss of this regulation led to a reacquisition of a high proliferative rate. Deletion of Ezh2 to restore p16 expression in Tead1-deficient β-cells demonstrated that modulation p16 mediated the Tead1 enforced proliferative quiescence in mature β-cells. It is possible that Tead1 also interacts with other regulators of p16 including Ezh2, Bmi1 among others, especially in an age-related manner to restrict β-cell proliferation. In addition, concurrent work revealed that Tead1 also directly interacted with corepressors VGLL4 and MENIN to keep adult β-cells in proliferative quiescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. How to modulate these Tead1 related regulatory mechanisms to enhance functional β-cell mass will be a subject for future studies.</p>
<p>Neonatal β-cells express many genes that are ‘disallowed’ in mature β-cells, including hexokinase1 (HK1), AldolaseB, Ldha, Acot7, MCT1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, many of which have been associated with immature function characterized by blunted GSIS. In rodent β-cells, high expression of a network of critical β-cell transcription factors, including Pdx1, Neurod1, Nkx6.1, a switch from MafB to high MafA expression along with and their target genes including Glut2, Glucokinase, Ucn3 and others, establishes functional competence and mature identity exemplified by robust GSIS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Repression of these genes is associated with a loss of mature function accompanied by a fetal/immature gene expression phenotype with expression of ‘disallowed ‘genes, with high MafB and loss of MafA expression. Interestingly, loss of Tead1 function leads to a decrease in expression of this gene network and loss of functional competence, but is not associated with re-expression of many of the disallowed genes, such as <italic>Ldha</italic>, nor a re-expression of MafB, hallmarks of de-differentiation to an immature state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. This is in contrast to that seen in proliferating β-cells with activation of c-Myc <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> or Notch <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, suggesting that the loss of mature function with Tead1 deletion may be independent of the proliferation phenotype. Interestingly, the β-cell deletion of Eed, an interactor of Ezh2 in PRC2, was reported to have a severe β-cell phenotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> with βEedKO mice having significant diabetes along with a significant loss of mature identity and increased expression of immature markers, although no proliferative rates were reported. While there are similarities in the loss of mature identity in these studies, the salient distinction with loss of Tead1 function is that the markers of de-differentiation are not increased, supporting the assertion that Tead1 promotes maintenance of mature identity.</p>
<p>While the requirement of Tead1 for normal β-cell function is demonstrable in these studies, it would be interesting to speculate whether this is dysregulated in disease states. While factors that regulate upstream hippo kinase cascade can certainly play a role, other stimuli may also play a direct role in regulating Tead1 function, independent of the hippo kinase cascade. Recent studies have shown that Tead1 subcellular localization could be altered by p38 Map kinase activation and glucose itself <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> or its stability of co-factor binding can be regulated by palmitoylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. This raises the intriguing possibility that stress pathways and glucolipotoxicity could affect β-cell function via changes in Tead1 localization and activity. Could then glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity or other stress-induced induced β-cell dysfunction be modulated by regulation of Tead1 activity and provide novel therapeutic targets? Answers to these questions in future studies could uncover new druggable targets for therapy of diabetes.</p>
<p>This reciprocal regulation of mature function and proliferative quiescence enforced in β-cells, by Tead1, could underpin the hurdles in inducing β-cell proliferation without loss of function. Intriguingly, recent studies in human islets demonstrate that although YAP is not normally expressed in adult β-cells, its overexpression and activation of TEAD1 pathway could lead to proliferation without loss of function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. This is also consistent with Tead1 regulation of PDX1 observed in this study. These observations suggest that Tead1 activity could be determined by the specificity of upstream coactivators and open the possibility that there are as yet undetermined pathways that are regulated by Tead1. While the regulators of Tead1 action in β-cells need further exploration, identification of these would allow therapeutic modulation of Tead1 activity to enhance β-cell replacement therapy.</p>
<p>In summary, Tead1 is a critical β-cell transcription factor required for coordinating adult β-cell proliferative quiescence, mature identity and functional competence to maintain glucose homeostasis. Modulation of this reciprocal regulation could help overcome hurdles in inducing β-cell proliferation without loss of function.</p>

Tead1 floxed ES cells were obtained from KOMP (Clone Name: EPDO207_2_H11), wherein the DNA binding domain coding Exon 3 is floxed. Targeted ES cells were injected into blastocysts to generate chimeric mice and those that demonstrated germline transmission were crossed with mice expressing FLP recombinase to remove the neomycin resistance cassette to generate Tead1 loxP alleles [floxed exon: ENSMUSE00000203030]. The homologous recombination was verified by long range PCR using primer set #1 (forward: GCAGTGCTCTCAGGAGTGCTGAGTGCGAC; reverse: AGAAGCCACAGTGCCCTGGAAGTGT) and primer set #2 (forward: GCCTTCTGAGTGCTGGCATTAAAGG; reverse: CACTGCAGCGCGCATAGCCTATGCTCCTTC) (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref></bold>). Mice were genotyped using <italic>Tead1</italic>-flox-forward (GCCTTCTGAGTGCTGGCATTAAAGG) and reverse (AAGGCAGACTCCTTCATTGGAATGG) primers. Floxed Tead1 (Tead1<sup>F/F</sup>) mice were crossed with Rip-Cre or Ins1-Cre (Thorens) transgenic mice to generate β-cell-specific Tead1 deletion during embryonic development. For adult β-cell inducible deletion, Tead1 <sup>F/F</sup> mice were crossed with Mip-CreERT transgenic mouse (Ins1 promoter driven Cre-ER) to generate Tead1 <sup>F/F</sup> Mip-CreERT<sup>+</sup> mice that when treated with Tamoxifen (TM) 100 mg/ kg every other day by gavage for 5 doses induced β-cell-specific Tead1 deletion (Mip-β-Tead1<sup>-/-</sup>). Ezh2 flox mice were obtained from Jackson labs (Stock#02616) and crossed into the Tead1<sup>F/F</sup> background to obtain double floxed mice and crossed with Rip-Cre mice to obtain double knockout mice.

<p>Total RNA samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) ≥8 were used for transcriptome sequencing. Total RNA (10ng) from a pooled sample from 1 year old mice (n=3) each for two independent samples for each group was used for amplified double-stranded cDNA that was sheared to 200-300bp and ligated to Illumina paired-end adaptors using the Illumina TruSeq DNA library preparation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA). PCR amplification was performed to obtain the final cDNA library using Illumina kits. Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) analysis was used to verify fragment size after amplification, library size and concentration before clustering. A total of 10pM of the library was then used for paired-end sequencing on the HiSeq 2500 at the Sequencing core at Brigham Young University. All further analysis were performed using the CLC genomics workbench ver 12. Raw RNA sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome build 10 (UCSCmm10/GRCm38). Mapped reads were counted using the feature counts and differential expression between the samples analyzed using multiple hypothesis testing. Pathway analysis: Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA, version 2.2.3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/">http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/</ext-link>) was performed on normalized count per million (CPM) or on ranked gene lists. Ranked lists were created based on the expression levels of DEGs in Rip-Tead1 KO vs. Flox controls (q&lt;0.05). Significance was assessed by analyzing signal-to-noise ratio and gene permutations based on 1,000 permutations.

<title>ATAC-Seq</title>
<p>Flash-frozen tissue was sent to Active Motif to perform the ATAC-seq assay. The tissue was manually disassociated, isolated nuclei were quantified using a hemocytometer, and 100,000 nuclei were tagmented as previously described (Buenrostro et al. 2013), with some modifications based on (Corces et al. 2017) using the enzyme and buffer provided in the Nextera Library Prep Kit (Illumina). Tagmented DNA was then purified using the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen), amplified with 10 cycles of PCR, and purified using Agencourt AMPure SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter). Resulting material was quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina platforms (KAPA Biosystems), and sequenced with PE42 sequencing on the NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina). Analysis of ATAC-seq data was very similar to the analysis of ChIP-Seq data. Reads were aligned using the BWA algorithm (mem mode; default settings). Duplicate reads were removed, only reads mapping as matched pairs and only uniquely mapped reads (mapping quality &gt;= 1) were used for further analysis. Alignments were extended in silico at their 3’-ends to a length of 200 bp and assigned to 32-nt bins along the genome. The resulting histograms (genomic “signal maps”) were stored in bigWig files. Peaks were identified using the MACS 2.1.0 algorithm at a cutoff of p-value 1e-7, without control file, and with the –nomodel option.

<title>ChIP-seq</title>
<p>Frozen tissue was sent to Active Motif Services (Carlsbad, CA) to be processed for ChIP-Seq. In brief, tissue was submersed in PBS + 1% formaldehyde, cut into small pieces and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Fixation was stopped by the addition of 0.125 M glycine (final). The tissue pieces were then treated with a TissueTearer and finally spun down and washed 2x in PBS. Chromatin was isolated by the addition of lysis buffer, followed by disruption with a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were sonicated and the DNA sheared to an average length of 300-500 bp. Genomic DNA (Input) was prepared by treating aliquots of chromatin with RNase, proteinase K and heat for de-crosslinking, followed by ethanol precipitation. Pellets were resuspended and the resulting DNA was quantified on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Extrapolation to the original chromatin volume allowed quantitation of the total chromatin yield. An aliquot of chromatin (10 ug for islets and 30 ug for hearts) was precleared with protein G agarose beads (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA regions of interest were isolated using 20 ul of antibody against Tead1. Complexes were washed, eluted from the beads with SDS buffer, and subjected to RNase and proteinase K treatment. Crosslinks were reversed by incubation overnight at 65 C, and ChIP DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Quantitative PCR (QPCR) reactions were carried out in triplicate on specific genomic regions using SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The resulting signals were normalized for primer efficiency by carrying out QPCR for each primer pair using Input DNA. Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared from the ChIP and Input DNAs by the standard consecutive enzymatic steps of end-polishing, dA-addition, and adaptor ligation. Steps were performed on an automated system (Apollo 342, Wafergen Biosystems/Takara). After a final PCR amplification step, the resulting DNA libraries were quantified and sequenced on Illumina’s NextSeq 500 (75 nt reads, single end). Reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using the BWA algorithm (default settings). Duplicate reads were removed and only uniquely mapped reads (mapping quality &gt;= 25) were used for further analysis. Alignments were extended in silico at their 3’-ends to a length of 200 bp, which is the average genomic fragment length in the size-selected library, and assigned to 32-nt bins along the genome. The resulting histograms (genomic “signal maps”) were stored in bigWig files. Peak locations were determined using the MACS algorithm (v2.1.0) with a cutoff of p-value = 1e-7.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Hippo pathway activity is required for pancreas morphogenesis, but its role in endocrine pancreas function remains elusive. The author aims to study the function of the TEAD1 gene in b-cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors generated TEAD1 conditional knockout animals by crossing the TEAD1f/f mice with three Cre strains (RIP-Cre, Ins1-Cre, and MIP-CreERT). In all of them, the KO animals showed progressive loss of insulin secretion with normal beta cell mass. Further characterization of the animals indicated glucose-induced insulin secretion defect and increased beta cell proliferation rate. RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq experiments identified Pdx1, MafA, and Glut2, etc. as direct targets of TEAD1, which might be responsible for the insulin secretion defect in the animals. Of interest, the authors also uncovered the cell cycle-related gene p16 as a direct target of TEAD1. Reduction of p16 is likely to drive the beta cell proliferation in the TEAD1 knockout model. Thus, they proposed that TEAD1 is a regulator of the proliferative quiescence process in beta cells. Overall, the evidence provided by the authors is highly relevant and supports their conclusion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors don't explicitly mention that some results appeared in a previous publication (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac1063">https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac1063</ext-link>) from them.</p>
<p>(2) The authors begin their story by introducing TEAD1 as part of the Hippo pathway. They showed Taz expression data in Figure 1. Did they do any experiments to detect Taz in their TEAD1 model? Did the authors detect any expression changes in CTGF following TEAD1 knockout? I could not see this changed. The phenotype characterization data presented here contrasts with what has been shown in TAZ b-cell knockout mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.31.494216">https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.31.494216</ext-link>). Based on the data presented here, Hippo is not involved, which should at least be discussed in length.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 1B - TAZ staining looks different in the three-month age group.</p>
<p>(4) TEAD ChIP-seq data doesn't look very convincing to me. It's hard to tell whether those highlighted regions in Figures 3A and 5J were signals or background noise. Although the authors also performed ChIP-qPCR in MIN6, it's unclear whether these binding events occur in vivo. The analysis of ChIP-seq dataset is limited as well. How many peaks called? What proportion of differentially expressed genes are bound by TEAD1? Was TEAD1 also detectable at NGN3 and NEUROD1 gene regions? If acquiring enough cells is not possible, the authors could try CUT&amp;RUN or CUT&amp;Tag to improve the data quality.</p>
<p>(5) The authors should perform RNA-seq or gene expression studies in MIP-CreERT to confirm, which could help narrow down the actual targets of TEAD1 as well.</p>
<p>(6) Figure 6 - the experiment lacks a control: Ezh2 beta cell KO. In addition to p16, Ezh2, and PRC2 have other targets in beta-cells, the authors could not rule out the contribution of those to the phenotype, so the implication of this experiment is vague.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Lee et al. assessed the role of Tead1 in mouse beta cells using three Cre-driver lines: Rip-Cre, Ins-Cre, and Mip-CreERT. The authors demonstrate that loss of TEAD1 during development and in mature beta cells leads to increased cell-autonomous beta cell proliferation and reduced insulin secretion. The phenotype of Tead1 knockout is not surprising, given that it is a key player in the Hippo pathway - a well-characterized pathway controlling cell proliferation. However, as the authors suggested, the phenotype observed in Tead1 might be through other non-Hippo pathway factors as well. The authors further convincingly established PDX1 and p16 as the target of Tead1 in controlling beta cell function and proliferation correspondingly. I have the following specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) As the authors mentioned, there are concerns over the usage of some Cre transgenic lines. Another useful control would be the naive Cre line that is not bred to floxed mutant, in addition to the floxed mice used by the authors in the manuscript here.</p>
<p>(2) The logic to rely on the deletion of Ezh2 to restore p16 in the Tead1 knockout mice is unclear. Ezh2 has so many more targets than p16. Why not a direct rescue experiment by overexpression of p16?</p>
<p>(3) The observed correlation of PDX1 and TEAD1 in expression in human islets is intriguing. But does this correlation translate to beta cell proliferation and function? Does TEAD1 knockout in human islets elicit a similar proliferation versus function response?</p>
<p>(4) The argument of Tead1 only controls maturation but not differentiation and that maturation function versus proliferation phenotype is independently controlled is weak. It appears that this conclusion is only based on that &quot;many disallowed genes...were not altered in Tead1-deficient islets&quot;. Perhaps the authors can perform a formal comparison between the transcriptomic changes of Tead1 knockout and Myc overexpressing/Notch gain of function beta cells and show that these two processes are different. In addition, what are the signatures of genes that are upregulated in Tead1 knockout compared with controls?</p>
