<title>Abstract</title><p>Vitamin D possesses immunomodulatory functions and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with the rise in chronic inflammatory diseases, including asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Vitamin D supplementation studies do not provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms of vitamin D mediated immunoregulation. Here we provide evidence for vitamin D regulation of two human chromosomal loci, Chr17q12-21.1 and Chr17q21.2, reliably associated with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). We demonstrate increased vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in mouse lung CD4+ Th2 cells, differential expression of Chr17q12-21.1 and Chr17q21.2 genes in Th2 cells based on vitamin D status and identify the IL-2/Stat5 pathway as a target of vitamin D signaling. Vitamin D deficiency caused severe lung inflammation after allergen challenge in mice that was prevented by long term prenatal vitamin D supplementation. Mechanistically, vitamin D induced the expression of the <italic>Ikzf3</italic> encoded protein Aiolos to suppress IL-2-signaling and ameliorate cytokine production in Th2 cells. These translational findings demonstrate mechanisms for the immune protective effect of vitamin D in allergic lung inflammation with a strong molecular genetic link to the regulation of both Chr17q12-21.1 and Chr17q21.2 genes and suggest further functional studies and interventional strategies for long-term prevention of asthma and other autoimmune disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The vitamin D receptor was genetically associated with asthma in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) and high intake of vitamin D by pregnant women is associated with about a 50% reduction in asthma risk in the mother’s offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Together, these findings led to a comprehensive theory about how vitamin D deficiency could influence asthma occurrence through its effects on lung and immune system development and that progressive decreases in vitamin D intake from 1946 onward could be contributing to the epidemic of allergic and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Vitamin D deficiency is the most common vitamin deficiency in the world today and is particularly prevalent in pregnant women where the fetal lung and immune system are developing in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the impact of vitamin D supplementation, we have previously performed a clinical trial, the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Trial (VDAART) in pregnant women who either had allergies or asthma or had family members with these conditions. The participants were given either 4400 IU of vitamin D3 or 400 IU and were followed throughout their pregnancy and for the first six years of the life of the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). The results of the trial were not statistically significant using conventional intent to treat analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) but the reasons were complex, as is often seen when the effects of nutrients are studied. Most importantly, unlike conventional drug trials where one compares drug to no drug or alternative drug, in nutrient trials there is nutrient already present in the placebo group. This creates misclassification that can reduce trial power. When we performed a meta-analysis of the two pregnancy related trials of vitamin D, we got a statistically significant reduction in asthma in the offspring of women who had the higher vitamin D intake during pregnancy and, when we adjusted for the baseline level of vitamin D in the meta-analysis, we got a reduction in asthma risk of 50 percent, exactly what we saw in the observational studies performed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>To link the results of the VDAART trial directly to the chr17q12 locus, our group then genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12936231, located in ZPBP2, the gene adjacent to ORMDL3, and stratified the VDAART trial results by maternal genotype at this locus. This study found that the vitamin D effect in the trial was significantly influenced by genotype, with the GG genotype exhibiting a protective effect on asthma risk in the child and the CC or GC genotype not being responsive to vitamin D; additionally this result was related to sphingolipid production with the children protected from asthma having higher sphingolipid production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>This SNP (rs12936231) is one of two SNPs (the other being rs4065275) that alter the chromatin state of a regulatory domain, specifically two CTCF binding sites, in the chr17q12-21.1 locus that are correlated with the expression of ORMDL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). 4C-seq assays previously demonstrated that the ORMDL3 promoter interacts with a long-range enhancer in IKZF3 that promotes (or represses) transcription of ORMDL3 in cells expressing both genes and the binding of CTCF per the G allele of rs12936231 in ZPBP2 blocks this interaction, resulting in reduced transcription of ORMDL3 on haplotypes with the rs12936231-G allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). If rs12936231 is not activated, then there is activation of the other CTCF binding site (rs4065275) intronic to ORMDL3, thus favoring the expression of ORMDL3 and increased asthma risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Mouse models have contributed to our understanding of ORMDL3 function as mice expressing the ORMDL3 transgene exhibit spontaneous increases in airway hyper responsiveness (AHR), the essential feature of asthma. This increase in AHR was associated with airway remodeling and peri bronchial fibrosis without airway inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). ORMDL3 is pleotropic, influencing Ca++ signaling, and the unfolded protein response. Most importantly, increased expression of ORMDL3 inhibits the enzyme serine palmityl-transferase, the rate limiting step in the production of sphingolipids, and ORMDL3 transgenic mice have reduced levels of sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). What has been unclear so far is how ORMDL3 is controlled.</p>
<p>In the current manuscript we provide evidence for vitamin D regulation of two human chromosomal loci, Chr17q12-21.1 and Chr17q21.2, reliably associated with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. We demonstrate increased vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in mouse lung CD4+ Th2 cells, differential expression of these Chr17q12-21.1 and Chr17q21.2 genes in Th2 cells based on vitamin D status and identify the IL-2/Stat5 pathway as a target of vitamin D signaling. Vitamin D induced the expression of the <italic>Ikzf3</italic> encoded protein Aiolos to suppress IL-2-signaling and ameliorate cytokine production in Th2 cells thus demonstrating a mechanism for how vitamin D influences autoimmunity.</p>

<title>In silico analysis of VDR binding sites on Chr17q12-21</title>
<p>For our <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis, we focused on two genomic regions that are known to harbor variants associated with asthma and autoimmune disease susceptibility. The first one is a 240 kb region that covers parts of the 17q12 and 17q21.1 loci and contains IKZF3, ZPBP2, ORMDL3, GSDMA and GSDMB (chr17: 37,899,254–38,139,253; hg19) and the second one is a 420 kb region in the 17q21.2 locus that includes STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B (chr17: 40,330,000-40,750,000; hg19). When selecting these genomic ranges, our criterion was to make the window inclusive of any potential enhancer regions targeting the above genes of interest. We used the GeneHancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) track in the UCSC Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>) to determine predicted enhancer-target gene interactions. We obtained VDR, IKZF3, CTCF and Vitamin D-sensitive CTCF binding sites from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), converted their genomic coordinates to hg19 if a different genome build was used in the original publication, and added them as custom tracks on the Genome Browser. We retrieved the known disease and trait associations in these loci from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog (downloaded on 7/26/2021) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and retained all hits that were deemed significant (p&lt;10<sup>-</sup> <sup>5</sup>). We downloaded significant single-tissue eQTLs for IKZF3 and PSMCIP3 in all tissues from the Common Fund (CF) Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) Analysis Release V8 (dbGaP Accession phs000424.v8.p2), through the GTEx Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gtexportal.org/home/">https://www.gtexportal.org/home/</ext-link>) in July 2021. We calculated linkage disequilibrium (LD) using the NCI LDmatrix Tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/?tab=ldmatrix">https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/?tab=ldmatrix</ext-link>), and by selecting all available populations.</p>

<title>The Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Trial (VDAART)</title>
<p>The design, eligibility and initial results of the trial have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Pregnant women were recruited from 3 clinical sites across the United States – Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA; Washington University at St. Louis, St. Louis, MO; and Kaiser Permanente Southern California Region, San Diego, CA. The Data Coordinating Center was based in the Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA. Eligible participants were women between the ages of 18 and 39 years, who presented between the estimated gestational ages of 10 and 18 weeks; who had a history of asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis, or whose partner (biologic father of the child) had a history of asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis; who was a non-smoker; and who was English– or Spanish-speaking, with intent to participate for 4 years (up to the 3<sup>rd</sup> birthday of the child). The VDAART study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at each participating institution and at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. All women provided a written informed consent. The trial was registered with clinical trials.gov: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00920621.</p>

<title>Gene expression analysis in VDAART cohort</title>
<p>To understand the putative mechanism linking IKZF3 expression and Vitamin D to asthma risk we considered umbilical cord blood (CB) RNA-seq data from the VDAART trial. <bold>Figure 1-figure supplement 1<italic>C</italic></bold> shows the study design. Total RNA was isolated from cord blood using the QIAGEN PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quality was assessed using the Nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Sequencing libraries were constructed with the TruSeq® Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Globin Kit (Illumina) and the NEXTflex Small RNA sequencing Kit v3 (Boo Scientific). Sequencing was performed using a NextSeq 550 instrument (Illumina). Trimmed reads were mapped to The GRCh38 reference genome using STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Read counts were computed with htseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The data includes 443 expression profiles of pregnant women with and without asthma undergoing measurements of Vitamin D levels in their CB. Each sample is matched with the observed patterns of wheezing and asthma in the newborn. We filtered all the samples where information about Vitamin D levels, asthma/wheezing patterns or other covariates were missing, obtaining 393 expression profiles. Data was normalized with the voom function of the edgeR R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), and Vitamin D levels were binarized using 30 ng/ml as threshold. We performed logistic regression of asthma status as a function of the expression levels of IKZF1 and IKZF3, including their interaction term and the interaction between IKZF3 and Vitamin D.

<p>All animal studies were approved by the institutional animal care committee. Mice were maintained in a virus– and parasite-free animal facility under a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle. C57BL6/J wild type (WT) mice were bred and housed at the MGH animal facility. Vitamin D-deficient mice (C57BL6/J) were bred and maintained in a UV-free environment and weaned onto a similar diet lacking vitamin D metabolites (TD97340; Harlan Teklad) that results in undetectable circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). VDR<sup>-/-</sup> mice (Vd<sup>rtm1Mbd/J</sup>), on C57BL6/J background, were bred and housed at the MGH animal facility, weaned at 18 d on a diet that maintains normal mineral ion homeostasis in the absence of VDR signaling (2% calcium, 1.25% phosphorus, 20% lactose supplemented diet, TD96348; Harlan Teklad, Madison WI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). BALB/c male and female mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories at 6–8 weeks of age and fed with diets supplemented with varying amounts of vitamin-D3 (TD97340 was used as base diet and supplemented with either 400 IU vitamin D/kg, 1000 IU vitamin D/kg or 4000 IU vitamin D/kg). Mice were bred on the specific diets for two generations to assure stabilization of vitamin D levels. Resulting F2 litters were used for the experiments. Mice were housed under standard conditions with free access to rodent chow and water. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as well as guidelines prescribed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (2016N000357), Massachusetts General Hospital (2004N000113) and Harvard Medical Area (05115) (AAALAC 1729).</p>

CD3, CD28, IL-4R, IL-13R were selected based on their role in Th2 differentiation. The IL-2R complex was included due to being a target of vitamin D signaling. TGFβRs were selected based on the immunomodulatory activity of this signaling path in CD4+ T cells. role in mediating immunoregulation. Using this subset of receptors and transcription factors as input for the implementation of our network analysis, we computed all the shortest paths connecting each receptor-transcription factor pair on the PPI network. For both control and calcitriol stimulated Th2 cells, we ranked each network path based on the average expression of the path’s nodes. The top selected paths represent the most active downstream processes in Th2 cells in each condition.</p>

<title>Integrative bioinformatics identifies the potential control of key asthma and autoimmune loci in 17q12-21.1 and 17q21.2 by vitamin D</title>
<p>To address the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D can influence asthma, allergic and autoimmune disease risk, we studied the genetic loci of two chromosome regions of interest: 1) the 17q12-21.1 region, that includes the well-known asthma-associated <italic>ORMDL3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), and 2) the 17q21.2 region, that includes the <italic>STAT5</italic> gene, known to be extensively associated with autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). We first examined the entire set of significant disease and trait associations in the Chr17q12-21.1 (181 associations) and Chr17q21.2 (100 associations) loci using the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Both regions had multiple Th1 and Th2 diseases associations with at least one significant SNP. Chr17q12-21.1 had the highest number of associations related to Th2 diseases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1<italic>A</italic></bold></xref>) and 17q21.2 had the highest number of associations related to Th1 diseases (<bold>Figure 1-figure supplement 1<italic>A</italic></bold>). To address the possible link to vitamin D intake, we next investigated a potential overlap of these SNPs with VDR binding sites. Out of the 169 VDR binding sites on Chr17, seven were in the 17q12-21.1 locus, concentrated in two bands on or near <italic>IKZF3</italic> and <italic>ZPBP2</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1<italic>B</italic></bold></xref>). These VDR binding sites also overlapped with RXRA binding sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1<italic>B</italic></bold></xref>). To assess their functional relevance, we searched for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in these VDR binding regions. We found that four cis-eQTLs control <italic>IKZF3</italic> expression in whole blood and EBV-transformed lymphocytes: rs2941522 and rs12946510 in the enhancer region targeting <italic>ORMDL3</italic> and <italic>IKZF3</italic>, and rs1453559 and rs35564481 in the enhancer region targeting <italic>ORMDL3</italic>, <italic>GSDMA</italic> and <italic>GSDMB</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1<italic>B</italic></bold></xref>). Rs1453559 and rs2941522 have previous GWAS associations with both asthma and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), rs12946510 has previous GWAS associations with autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), and rs35564481 has no known GWAS associations. For the 17q21.2 locus, the only VDR binding site resides near the gene <italic>PSMC3IP</italic> in an enhancer site targeting <italic>STAT5A</italic> (<bold>Figure 1-figure supplement 1<italic>B</italic></bold>). PSMC3IP expression is controlled by three eQTLs overlapping with this VDR binding site (rs4793244, rs62078362 and rs111708606), none of which have any known disease associations. These results suggest that vitamin D binding is critical in this genomic region.</p>
<p>We next examined the linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern between the Th1/Th2-associated SNPs and the SNPs in the VDR binding sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1<italic>C</italic></bold></xref>). Out of the seven SNPs with VDR binding sites identified in 17q12-21.1 and 17q21.2, the first four in 17q12-21.1 (rs2941522, rs12946510, rs35564481, rs1453559) were in a high-LD block with many other Th1-Th2 associated SNPs in the same region. These same four SNPs in 17q12-21.1 were also in high-LD with two SNPs in <italic>ZPBP2</italic> and <italic>ORMDL3</italic> (rs12936231 and rs4065275, respectively) that were previously shown to be functionally relevant to asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Additionally, two of the three SNPs with VDR binding sites in 17q21.2 (rs4793244 and rs62078362) were in strong-LD with three other Th1-Th2 associated SNPs in the17q21.2 region (rs11871801, rs2006141, rs4793090). Overall, these results highlight strong statistical association between vitamin D binding sites and multiple genotypic variations linked to asthma, autoimmune and allergic diseases.</p>
<p>Two SNPs in <italic>ZPBP2</italic> and <italic>ORMDL3</italic> (rs12936231 and rs4065275, respectively) that were previously shown to be functionally relevant to asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), were also in high linkage disequilibrium with the four SNPs that we identified in the VDR binding regions of the 17q12-21.1 loci (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1<italic>C</italic></bold></xref>). Importantly, in both the 17q12-21.1 and 17q21.2 regions, the VDR binding sites coincide with CTCF and IKZF3 binding sites, as well as H3K27ac peaks indicating active enhancer sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1<italic>B</italic></bold></xref>, <bold>Figure 1-figure supplement 1<italic>B</italic></bold>). In particular, the two enhancer sites in 17q12-21.1 (GH17J039753 and GH17J039859) were both predicted to interact with the <italic>ORMDL3</italic> promoter region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1<italic>B</italic></bold></xref>), and the enhancer site in 17q21.2 (GH17J042576) was predicted to interact with the <italic>STAT5A</italic> promoter region (<bold>Figure 1-figure supplement 1<italic>B</italic></bold>). This suggests a similar mechanism to the one described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), whereby SNPs in LD with each other in these enhancer sites affect VDR and CTCF binding, the co-dependence of which in turn could modulate <italic>ORMDL3</italic> and <italic>STAT5A</italic> expression. Although it has been shown that CTCF binding sites can be vitamin D-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), no such sites were found in our genomic regions of interest (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1<italic>B</italic></bold></xref>, <bold>Figure 1-figure supplement 1<italic>B</italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated cord blood gene expression data in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) (see Methods) and looked at the genes of interest in the 17q12 and 17q21 regions and their interaction with cord blood vitamin D levels as predictors of asthma/wheeze risk at age 3 year of age. After adjusting for relevant covariates (see Methods), the baseline expression term of <italic>IKZF3</italic> was not found to be significantly associated with asthma risk, while the interaction between vitamin D and <italic>IKZF3</italic> was statistically significant (p-val. &lt; 0.05), suggesting that the association of <italic>IKZF3</italic> expression with asthma risk was mediated by vitamin D levels in the cord blood (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref><bold>-table supplement 1; Figure 1-figure supplement 1<italic>C</italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Based on our bioinformatic analysis of the Chr17q12 and 17q21 regions, we hypothesize that low vitamin D tissue levels is associated with decreased <italic>IKFZ3</italic> expression and increased expression of <italic>ORMDL3</italic>, <italic>STAT3</italic>, <italic>STAT5A</italic>, <italic>STAT5B</italic>, and <italic>IL2</italic>.</p>

<title>Vitamin-D receptor (VDR) is expressed in Th2 cells in allergic airway inflammation</title>
<p>To test our hypothesis of vitamin D activity at the Chr17q12-21 locus we utilized a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation and identified vitamin D responsive leukocyte subsets in house dust mite (HDM)-sensitized and challenged mice using flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2<italic>A</italic></bold></xref>, <bold>Figure 2-figure supplement 1<italic>A-C</italic></bold>). VDR expression was significantly induced in HDM sensitized and challenged mice and almost absent in leukocytes isolated from control (vehicle) lungs (<bold>Figure 2-figure supplement 2<italic>C</italic></bold>). Within the CD45+ population, VDR expression was high in CD4+ T cells (p= 0.0357), while only very few CD8+ T cells and CD19+ B cells expressed VDR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2<italic>B</italic></bold></xref>, <bold>Figure 2-figure supplement 1<italic>B</italic> HDM</bold>). Within the CD4+ T cell population, highest VDR expression was detected in Gata3+ Th2 cells (p= 0.002 vs Tbet+ and p&lt; 0.0001 vs Foxp3+ T cells). VDR expression was very low in Tbet+ Th1 and CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg cells (<bold>Figure 2-figure supplement 1<italic>C</italic> HDM</bold>). The differential expression of VDR in Th2 cells was further validated by western blot analysis using naïve CD4+ T cells immediately after isolation (0hrs), after activation with CD3/CD28 for 48 hrs and in <italic>in vitro</italic> polarized Th1, Th2 and iTreg cells with well-defined culture conditions (<bold>Figure 2-figure supplement 2<italic>A</italic></bold>, see Methods section). VDR expression appeared as early as day 1 of Th2 culture conditions and gradually increased during the polarization process (<bold>Figure 2-figure supplement 2<italic>B</italic></bold>). In the absence of the VDR ligand vitamin D, VDR expression localized to the cytoplasm of Th2 cells. Addition of the VDR ligand calcitriol led to a strong translocation of VDR into the nucleus, suggesting functionality of the expressed receptor in the presence of its ligand (<bold>Figure 2-figure supplement 2<italic>C</italic></bold>). These results identify Th2 cells as vitamin D targets in allergic airway inflammation.</p>

<title>Vitamin D status regulates the expression of key genes on Chromosome17q12-21.1 and Chr17q21.2</title>
<p>Taking cell type specific gene expression and selective expression of VDR in Th2 cells into account, we next analyzed the expression of genes encoded on Chr17q12-21.1 and 17q21.2 loci in WT and vitamin D deficient Th2 cultures as well as in Th2 cells post calcitriol stimulation.</p>
<p>Vitamin D deficiency differentially regulated the expression levels of several Chr17q12-21.1 encoded genes, with lower expression of <italic>Ikzf3</italic>, <italic>Ormdl3</italic> and <italic>Gsdma</italic> (all p=0.0286) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2<italic>D</italic></bold></xref>). Conversely, stimulation with calcitriol induced the expression of the same genes (all p=0.043) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2F</bold></xref>). Expression of the Chr17q21.2 genes <italic>Stat3</italic>, <italic>Stat5a</italic> and <italic>Stat5b</italic> was not affected by vitamin D deficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2<italic>E</italic></bold></xref>). However, after calcitriol stimulation <italic>Stat5a</italic> (p=0.0082) and <italic>Stat5b</italic> (p=0.003) genes were strongly suppressed and <italic>Stat3</italic> (p= 0.0048) expression was increased in Th2 cells. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2<italic>G</italic></bold></xref>).

<title>Deficiency in vitamin D signaling augments allergic airway inflammation</title>
<p>To decipher the protective role of vitamin D signaling in allergic airway inflammation, we employed vitamin D deficient and VDR<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>A</italic></bold></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). HDM sensitization of vitamin D deficient mice led to a stronger reaction to the allergen resulting in more prominent peri-bronchial and perivascular leukocytic infiltrates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>B</italic></bold></xref>). This phenotype was accompanied by lower VDR expression in CD4+ T cells isolated from HDM-exposed lungs compared to WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>C</italic></bold></xref>). Vitamin D deficiency led to a robust increase in total immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>D</italic></bold></xref>). Histological findings were associated with higher total BAL leukocyte (p= 0.0008) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>E</italic></bold></xref>), eosinophil (p= 0.0002) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>F</italic></bold></xref>) and lymphocyte (p= 0.0023) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>G</italic></bold></xref>) numbers in vitamin D deficient mice, while neutrophil numbers were not affected (<bold>Figure 3-figure supplement 1<italic>A)</italic></bold>. Th2 cell numbers (p= 0.0127) were also higher in the HDM exposed mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>H</italic></bold></xref>) in a manner that was independent of T helper cell skewing (<bold>Figure 3-figure supplement 1<italic>B, C</italic></bold>). Differentiation and recruitment of Th17 and IL-10 producing CD4+ T cells was not affected by vitamin D deficiency (<bold>Figure 3-figure supplement 1<italic>A, B</italic></bold>). To validate these findings from vitamin D deficiency, we next employed VDR<sup>-/-</sup> mice (see Methods). As with the vitamin D deficient mice, HDM sensitization and challenge of VDR<sup>-/-</sup> mice led to an increased Th2 immune response. The lung phenotype in the VDR<sup>-/-</sup> mice was marked by dense leukocytic infiltrates around and mucus plugs in the airways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>B</italic></bold></xref>). The augmented systemic and local immune response increased total IgE titers (p= 0.0489), and total BAL (p&lt; 0.0001 vs WT HDM and p= 0.003 vs Vit D deficient HDM), eosinophil (p&lt; 0.0001 vs WT HDM and Vit D deficient HDM), total lymphocytes (p=0.0194 vs WT HDM and p= 0.0421vs Vit D deficient HDM) and Th2 cells (p= 0.0009 vs WT HDM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>D-H</italic></bold></xref>). VDR<sup>-/-</sup> did not significantly affect recruitment of neutrophils, Treg and Th17 cells (<bold>Figure 3-figure supplement 1<italic>A, B, C</italic></bold>).</p>

<p>To explore the mechanisms underlying the augmented Th2-phenotype in the lungs of vitamin D deficient and VDR<sup>-/-</sup> mice after HDM allergen challenge, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles of in vitro polarized Th2 cells from WT and vitamin D deficient mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>I</italic></bold></xref>). Differential expression and enrichment analysis revealed dysregulation of several pathways implicated in Th2-cell activation, cytokine production, proliferation, and survival with prominent changes in the IL-2/ STAT5 – pathway in vitamin D deficient Th2 cells (p= 0.0014) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>J</italic></bold></xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref><bold>-table supplements 1, 2</bold>). The effects of impaired vitamin D signaling on these pathways was confirmed by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. Baseline expression of IL-2 was markedly increased at both the RNA (p= 0.0286)) and protein levels (p= 0.0079) in vitamin D deficient and VDR<sup>-/-</sup> Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3<italic>K</italic></bold></xref><bold><italic>, L</italic></bold>). In Vitamin D deficient and VDR<sup>-/-</sup> Th2 cell <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation, the elevated IL-2 levels were accompanied by a sharp increase in IL-13 production (VitD deficient: p&lt; 0.0001; VDR<sup>-/-</sup>: p= 0.0141) (<bold>Figure 3-figure supplement 2</bold>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate a critical role for vitamin D/VDR signaling in regulating type 2 inflammation and identify the IL-2/ Stat5 pathway as a downstream target of vitamin D in Th2 cells.</p>

<title>Vitamin D suppresses the activation of the IL-2/Stat5 pathway and cytokine production in Th2 cells</title>
<p>To ascertain the vitamin D dependent regulation of the IL-2/Stat5 pathway and the impact on the effector program of Th2 cells, we first analyzed the transcriptional profile of WT Th2 cells exposed to calcitriol during differentiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4<italic>A</italic></bold></xref>). Gene ontology enrichment analysis of biological processes revealed regulation of several processes impacting inflammatory responses, including chemotaxis and activation of cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref><bold>-table supplement 1</bold>). Calcitriol stimulation of Th2 cells affected several immune related disease pathways, including asthma (<bold>Figure 4-figure supplement 1,</bold> <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref><bold>-table supplement 2</bold>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), performed on the differentially expressed genes, highlighted the negative regulation of IL-2/Stat5 pathway in Th2 cells by calcitriol (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4<italic>B</italic></bold></xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref><bold>-table supplement 3</bold>).

<p>Next, the impact of calcitriol stimulation on the effector function of Th2 cells was assessed by flow cytometric analysis for the T2 cytokine IL-13. Activation of the vitamin D/VDR pathway led to significant suppression of IL-13 production in CD4+ T cells (p= 0.0012) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4<italic>E</italic></bold></xref>).</p>
<p>To further delineate the molecular impact of vitamin D on Th2 cell biology, we integrated the murine transcriptional profile with a recently developed human Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). By modeling the signal transduction process as a sequential path on the PPI network that starts from a receptor and propagates downstream to a transcription factor via multiple intermediate proteins (for details see Methods section, <bold>Figure 4-figure supplement 2<italic>A</italic></bold>), we inferred the active signaling flow in Th2 cells for control (vehicle) and calcitriol stimulated Th2 cells. As input of our network analysis, we selected a subset of receptors and transcription factors that are known to be involved in CD4+ T cell activation, Th2 cell differentiation, and cytokine production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref><bold>-table supplement 4</bold>). For clarity of the figure, we display the gene names. Corresponding protein names are attached in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref><bold>-table supplement 5</bold>. In control Th2 cells, our network analysis revealed the engagement of a variety of receptors including IL4R, IL2RA, CD28, and TNF-receptors. Downstream to these receptors, the most active signaling paths highlighted the activation of STAT3, STAT5A/B, NFkB1, and IKZF1 transcription factors (<bold>Figure 4-figure supplement 2<italic>B</italic></bold>) via multiple adapter proteins of the TRAF and JAK family. Interestingly, these transcription factors are known to be involved in differentiation and activation pathways in Th2 cells Conversely, after calcitriol stimulation, signal from IL4R, CD28 and TNFSF8 propagated over different interaction partners (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4<italic>F</italic></bold></xref>). Calcitriol specific edges are highlighted in orange color. Molecular mediators included the cytoskeletal proteins VAV1 and RACK1 and emphasized activation of the transcription factors AP-1 (FOS/JUND dimer) and NFATC1.</p>
<p>Our network analysis highlighted a central role of the transcriptional repressor IKZF1 (IKAROS) upon calcitriol stimulation, which was targeted by multiple downstream mediators including IKZF3 (AIOLOS). Notably, the IKZF3 gene encodes for the AIOLOS protein, a direct interaction partner of the IKZF1-encoded IKAROS. Both transcription factors, as homo– and heterodimers, suppress IL-2 expression on the transcriptional levels in mouse and human lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Calcitriol increased the number of edges connecting intermediate proteins to the transcriptional repressor IKAROS. Among the connecting proteins, AIOLOS interaction with IKAROS was implicated in repression of IL-2 expression in Th2 cells by vitamin D.</p>
<p>Absence of STAT5A/B mediators in the active signaling paths of calcitriol stimulated Th2 cells further suggested repression of the Th2 cell STAT5 pathway with calcitriol compared to control (<bold>Figure 4-figure supplement 2<italic>B</italic></bold>). To ensure that the above findings were not restricted to the C57BL/6 mouse strain, the inverse experiment was performed in Balb/c mice. This mouse strain is commonly used for type 2 driven inflammation.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that the specific suppression of the IL-2/Stat5 pathway by vitamin D results in reduced cytokine production by Th2 cells. Our findings suggest that this suppression was mediated by the vitamin D dependent regulation of IKAROS (IKZF1) through the induction of AIOLOS (IKZF3).</p>

<title>Vitamin D supplementation alleviates the allergic phenotype in the lung by suppressing type 2 cytokine production in a dose dependent manner</title>
<p>To test if vitamin D supplementation prevents the development of T2 driven allergic inflammation in the lung, custom rodent diets with select vitamin D doses were used: 400 IU/kg chow (400 IU; low), 1000 IU/kg chow (1000 IU; regular) and 4000 IU/kg chow (4000 IU; high) (<bold>Figure 5-figure supplement 1<italic>A</italic>,</bold> see Methods section). The 1000 IU group was used as the control group, as it contains the average amount of vitamin D fortified in standard rodent chow. HDM exposure led to recruitment of leukocytes into the lung tissue and BAL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5<italic>A</italic></bold></xref><bold><italic>, B;</italic> Figure 5-figure supplement 1<italic>B</italic></bold>), with a predominant eosinophilic and lymphocytic infiltrate as well as high numbers of IL-13+ Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5<italic>C-E</italic></bold></xref>). There were trends for higher cellular infiltration in the airways when mice were supplemented with the low vitamin D doses (400 IU), but these inflammatory responses were not significantly different from the phenotype observed with 1000 IU. Lung and airway pathology were similar between these dosing groups, with similar numbers and frequencies of the different leukocyte populations. In sharp contrast, dietary supplementation with the higher vitamin D dose (4000 IU) decreased the inflammatory phenotype in HDM exposed mice compared to the 400 IU and 1000 IU dosed animals. Concordant with the histological findings, BAL leukocytes (p&lt; 0.0001) were decreased with marked reductions in BAL eosinophil (p=0.0016), lymphocyte (p=0.026) and neutrophil numbers (p=0.0005) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5<italic>B</italic></bold></xref><bold><italic>, D;</italic> Figure 5-figure supplement 1<italic>C</italic></bold>), and the frequency of IL-13+ Th2 cells was significantly reduced in the lungs with 4000 IU of vitamin D (p= 0.0066 vs 400 IU HDM; p=0.0011 vs 1000 IU HDM) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5<italic>E</italic></bold></xref>). Of note, dietary supplementation with high vitamin D levels, increased VDR expression in CD4+ T cells from HDM exposed lungs (p&lt; 0.0001) (<bold>Figure 5-figure supplement 1<italic>C</italic></bold>).</p>

<p>To ascertain that dietary supplementation with vitamin D specifically altered mouse Th2 cell differentiation and the effector program, splenic naïve CD4+ T cells from 400 IU and 4000 IU mice were studied. Of interest, naïve CD4+ T cells did not express VDR until they were exposed to Th2 polarizing conditions. Gata3 expression on per cell basis was lower in 4000 IU Th2 cells (p= 0.0286) (<bold>Figure 5-figure supplement 2<italic>A</italic></bold>). This was accompanied by higher VDR protein expression (p= 0.0286) (<bold>Figure 5-figure supplement 2<italic>B</italic></bold>). The expression of IL-2 (p= 0.0004) and the Th2 cytokines IL-13 (p= 0.0159) and IL-5 (p= 0.0159) were lower in 4000 IU Th2 cultures (<bold>Figure 5-figure supplement 2<italic>C-E</italic></bold>).</p>
<p>To explore the specific induction of Aiolos expression for vitamin D mediated suppression of IL-2 production in Th2 cells, Aiolos expression was monitored throughout Th2 differentiation. Aiolos expression gradually increased under Th2 polarizing conditions in CD4+ T cells, starting as early as day 1 of in vitro culture (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5<italic>F</italic></bold></xref>). Simultaneous exposure to calcitriol further increased Aiolos protein levels compared to vehicle in Th2 cells (p= 0.0079) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5<italic>G</italic></bold></xref>).</p>
<p>To test if vitamin D exerts its inhibitory effect on IL-2 production via Aiolos induction, Ikzf3<sup>-/-</sup> mice were employed, exposed to Th2 polarizing conditions and assessed for IL-2 production after calcitriol exposure. IL-2 production in control Ikzf3<sup>-/-</sup> Th2 cultures was significantly higher compared to WT Th2 cells. Calcitriol significantly reduced IL-2 levels in both, WT (p= 0.0001) and Ikzf3<sup>-/-</sup> Th2 cells (p= 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5<italic>H</italic></bold></xref>); however, the suppressive effect of calcitriol on IL-2 production was significantly higher in WT Th2 cells (∼ 65% inhibition) compared to Ikzf3<sup>-/-</sup> Th2 cells (∼40% inhibition) (p= 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5<italic>H</italic></bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicated that vitamin D can regulate Aiolos expression and suggested a role for Aiolos as a downstream effector for selectively fine-tuning Th2 cell IL-2 production by vitamin D.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We utilized human genetics to identify SNPs on chromosome 17q12-21.1 and 17q21.2 that were within GWAS regions for Th1 and Th2 autoimmune diseases. Of note, many of these SNPs were within VDR binding sites. We then determined by eQTL analysis of the genes in these two genomic regions that IKZF3 expression was controlled by four cis-eQTLs in the enhancer region targeting ORMDL3 and IKZF3, and in the enhancer region targeting ORMDL3, GSDMA and GSDMB. Next, we demonstrated that two SNPs in CTCF binding sites were in strong LD with these 4 eQTL SNPs and that the two enhancer sites in 17q12-21.1 were both predicted to interact with the ORMDL3 promoter region, and the enhancer site in 17q21.2 was predicted to interact with the STAT5A promoter region thus, suggesting a plausible human molecular genetic mechanism by which vitamin D could activate IKZF3 to repress ORMDL3 and immune system development. Finally, we leveraged bulk RNAseq in the cord blood of the VDAART trial to show that an interaction for vitamin D level and IKZF3 expression that was associated with reduced asthma risk at 3 years of age. <bold>Figure 5-figure supplement 3</bold> depicts the influence of vitamin D binding sites on the genes in the 17q12-21 region.</p>
<p>To confirm our human molecular genetic findings, we chose to utilize mouse models of allergic lung inflammation. We show strong VDR expression in CD4+ Th2 cells and alterations in chr17q12-21.1 and 17q21.2 gene expression induced by vitamin D status. Expression of VDR has been reported for airway epithelial cells and different immune cell types present in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). In lymphocytes, <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies describe low baseline VDR transcript expression levels that were transiently increased by activating signals and calcitriol stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Here, we report a differential VDR expression pattern in CD4+ T cell subsets from allergic inflamed lungs and post lineage specific cytokine stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic>, with strongest expression in Th2 cells. Activation of VDR suppressed IL-2, IL-5, and IL-13 production by Th2 cells. The expression of VDR in Gata3+Th2 cells in the lung might represent an endogenous control mechanism to curb the pathogenic cell activity and cytokine production after repetitive allergen contact. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> Th1, nTreg and iTreg cells expressed low VDR protein levels at baseline. It remains to be determined whether other Th-subsets described in allergic inflammation express VDR at baseline and if either calcitriol or other secondary signals, specific for each subset, could induce VDR expression during inflammation.</p>
<p>Vitamin D deficiency that had been introduced over two generations, impaired vitamin D signaling and led to an augmented allergic phenotype in the lung after allergen exposure with a dominating Th2-signature locally and systemically. This was likely due to specific deregulation of Th2 cells instead of Th cell skewing, since neither Th17 nor Treg development and recruitment were significantly affected. Similar findings regarding the effects of vitamin D in controlling Treg/IL-10 and dampening Th2 responses have been reported, e.g., in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) and in offspring of mice that had been subjected to vitamin D deficiency in the third trimester of their pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). In contrast, in mice supplemented with high vitamin D doses over two generations, VDR expression and consequently vitamin D responsiveness was higher in CD4+ T cells from the animals’ lungs, almost completely abrogating the inflammatory process in the lung after allergen challenge. Additional pathways, including the induction of IL-10 production by CD4+ T cells as well as a direct induction of Foxp3+ T reg cells could have further contributed to the observed protective effect of vitamin D supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). While the vitamin D dose in the mice was chosen to replicate the VDAART trial dose in the mouse model, the duration of supplementation was adapted to the protocol for generating vitamin D deficient mice. Both factors might influence the outcome here compared to prior rodent studies with inconclusive results. We provide a discussion of vitamin D toxicity in our response to the reviewers. More work to determine the exact levels of vitamin D that confer this protective effect in the mice would also be worthy of further investigation.</p>
<p>Differentiation of Th2 cells is driven by IL-4 induced Gata3 expression in naïve CD4+ T cells. This process depends on a positive feedforward loop by IL-2 and its downstream STAT5 signaling pathway for the effective expression of IL-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Therefore, either interfering with Gata3 expression or with the IL-2 pathway represents a promising strategy to finetune Th2-driven immunity. Our data highlight the specific regulation of the IL-2/STAT5 pathway by vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency and impaired VDR signaling caused elevated IL-2 production by Th2 cells, leading to high IL-13 production. Elevated IL-13 levels <italic>in vivo</italic>, could amplify the local T2 responses in the lung. In sharp contrast, exposure of polarizing Th2 cells to calcitriol was able to suppress IL-2 production, reduce expression and activation of STAT5A/B and therefore reduce IL-13 production by Th2 cells. The transcription factor AIOLOS has previously been shown to suppress IL-2 expression at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). We report here a vitamin D mediated induction of Aiolos expression in Th2 cells, that is impaired by vitamin D deficiency. High Aiolos expression coincided with lower IL-2 production, ameliorated STAT5A/B expression, and reduced IL-13 production in Th2 cells. <italic>In vitro</italic> Th2 polarization of naïve CD4+ T cells isolated from mice supplemented with higher vitamin D levels, without further exogenous calcitriol stimulation, developed a weakened Th2 phenotype, characterized by lower IL-2, IL-5, and IL-13 production. Since naïve CD4+ T cells do not express VDR, these results, together with our human data, implicate changes in chromosomal accessibility by high vitamin D in the developing immune system, which needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Experiments here with Ikzf3<sup>-/-</sup> mice demonstrated significant reductions in vitamin D mediated control of Th2 cell cytokine production, but the vitamin D response was not completely impaired, suggesting additional mechanisms for vitamin D regulation of Th2 cells – several possibilities were uncovered by our PPI analyses. These will be the subject of future research. In addition, we only investigated a Th2 mouse model of asthma and have not extended our mouse work to Th1 models of autoimmunity. We acknowledge that the impact of vitamin D on Th2 biology is conflicting in the literature. While several groups report Th2 promoting activity, we, and others, show inhibition of type 2 cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). These discrepancies could be due to the model system studied, e.g., PBMC and purified CD4+ T cells, or the dose of vitamin D or the mouse strain.</p>
<p>We have still to consider other asthma genes that might be linked to these two genetic loci as there are likely other VDR binding sites of importance in both asthma and Th1 autoimmunity. Our preliminary results confirm that three asthma susceptibility loci: 2q12.1 (IL1RL1), 6p21.32 (HLA-DQA1/B1/A2/B2) and 22q12.3 (IL2RB) each have VDR and IKZF3 binding sites either in enhancers predicted by GeneHancer to target these genes or within these genes themselves. It is important to consider other data that might have enhanced the results that we present here. For our human genetic data, additional use of ChIP or co-IP to establish STAT induction and activation would have been of potential value. For our mouse studies, additional cytokine measurements in the mice as well as measurement of airway resistance would have added to the pathophysiological data linking IKFZ3 expression to TH2 response. Finally, quantification of histology and confocal images could provide an overview of VDR expression in the lungs.</p>
<p>In summary, we have leveraged clinical trial data, molecular genetic bioinformatic data and mouse model data to outline for the first time, a comprehensive molecular genetic mechanism for how vitamin D influences not only asthma development, but both Th1 and Th2 autoimmune disease. The significance of these findings relates to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, especially during pregnancy, and the strong possibility that the epidemic of asthma and autoimmunity might be significantly reduced if serum vitamin D levels were elevated worldwide.</p>

Here, bioinformatic approaches help to identify a role of VDR in inducing the expression of the key regulator Ikzf3, which possibly suppresses the IL-2/STAT5 axis, consequently blunting the Th2 response and mitigating allergic airway inflammation. These are <bold>important</bold> findings based on <bold>convincing</bold> evidence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This study seeks to advance our knowledge of how vitamin D may be protective in allergic airway disease using both adult and neonatal mouse models. The rationale and starting point are important human clinical, genetic/bioinformatic data, with a proposed role for vitamin D regulation of 2 human chromosomal loci (Chr17q12-21.1 and Chr17q21.2) linked to risk of immune-mediated/inflammatory disease. The authors have historically made significant contributions to this work specifically in airway disease/asthma. They now link these data to propose a role for vitamin D in regulating IL-2 in Th2 cells implicating genes associated with these loci in this process.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Here the authors draw together evidence from multiple interdisciplinary lines of investigation to propose that amongst murine CD4+ T cell populations, Th2 cells express high levels of VDR, and that vitamin D regulates many of the genes on the chromosomal loci identified to be of interest, in these cells. The bottom line is the proposal that vitamin D, via Ikfz3/Aiolos, suppresses IL-2 signalling in Th2 cells. This is a novel concept and whilst the availability of IL-2 and the control of IL-2 signalling is generally thought to play a role in the capacity of vitamin D to modulate both effector and especially regulatory T cell populations, this study provides new insights.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Ultimately the data are associative, nevertheless this study makes an important and innovative contribution to our understanding of the mechanism whereby vitamin D may beneficially control immune/inflammatory disease, specifically Th2 driven allergic airway inflammation. Future work advancing these studies, including in humans, are awaited with interest.</p>
<p>Wider impact: Maternal 17q21 genotype has an important influence on the protective effects of high dose vitamin D3 supplementation in pregnancy against the development of asthma/recurrent wheeze in her offspring. The current study provides exciting mechanistic data that may underpin this important observation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study seeks to advance our knowledge of how vitamin D may be protective in allergic airway disease in both adult and neonatal mouse models. The rationale and starting point are important human clinical, genetic/bioinformatic data, with a proposed role for vitamin D regulation of 2 human chromosomal loci (Chr17q12-21.1 and Chr17q21.2) linked to the risk of immune-mediated/inflammatory disease. The authors have made significant contributions to this work specifically in airway disease/asthma. They link these data to propose a role for vitamin D in regulating IL-2 in Th2 cells implicating genes associated with these loci in this process.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Here the authors draw together evidence form. multiple lines of investigation to propose that amongst murine CD4+ T cell populations, Th2 cells express high levels of VDR, and that vitamin D regulates many of the genes on the chromosomal loci identified to be of interest, in these cells. The bottom line is the proposal that vitamin D, via Ikfz3/Aiolos, suppresses IL-2 signalling and reduces IL-2 signalling in Th2 cells. This is a novel concept and whilst the availability of IL-2 and the control of IL-2 signalling is generally thought to play a role in the capacity of vitamin D to modulate both effector and especially regulatory T cell populations, this study provides new data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, this is a highly complicated paper with numerous strands of investigation, methodologies etc. It is not &quot;easy&quot; reading to follow the logic between each series of experiments and also frequently fine detail of many of the experimental systems used (too numerous to list), which will likely frustrate immunologists interested in this. There is already extensive scientific literature on many aspects of the work presented, much of which is not acknowledged and largely ignored. For example, reports on the effects of vitamin D on Th2 cells are highly contradictory, especially in vitro, even though most studies agree that in vivo effects are largely protective. Similarly other reports on adult and neonatal models of vitamin D and modulation of allergic airway disease are not referenced. In summary, the data presentation is unwieldy, with numerous supplementary additions, that makes the data difficult to evaluate and the central message lost. Whilst there are novel data of interest to the vitamin D and wider community, this manuscript would benefit from editing to make it much more readily accessible to the reader.</p>
<p>Wider impact: Strategies to target the IL-2 pathway have long been considered and there is a wealth of knowledge here in autoimmune disease, transplantation, GvHD etc - with some great messages pertinent to the current study. This includes the use of IL-2, including low dose IL-2 to boost Treg but not effector T cell populations, to engineered molecules to target IL-2/IL-2R.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have addressed a significant number of concerns raised. The restructuring and incorporation of a number of discussion points have improved the readability. Moreover, the authors have also incorporated some more figures to address certain questions raised.</p>
<p>However, the authors could reconsider a few more points which would improve the readability of the manuscript.</p>
<p>For e.g.</p>
<p>1. While it is appreciated that the authors have provided the schematic of the study design for the VDAART trial, the visualization for the RNA-seq analysis may be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have created a visualization of the workflow for the RNA seq analysis as part of Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Quantification of images would not require any additional experiments, yet can reinforce the results with objectivity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment. We chose to display histology images to allow a glimpse at the inflammatory condition in the lung tissue. For histological quantification, lung tissue should have been harvested and analyzed in a systematic and randomized way as well as in sufficient animal numbers to allow statistical analyses. This has not been done for these mouse models since the focus was in analyzing cytokine production by lung tissue CD4+ T cells as the driver of inflammation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors have not addressed the discrepancy of the sample sizes in the experiments. Some dot plots still don't match the legends, and there is a wide variation in the numbers chosen for different experiments and different groups in the same experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the thorough screening of our manuscript and apologize for this oversight. We corrected the errors in the respective figure legends.</p>
<p>The in vivo experiments comprise studies performed in (A) VDR-KO mice and (B) WT mice fed with vit-D supplemented chow.</p>
<p>Sample size calculations for the mouse models of allergic airway inflammation based on BAL cell numbers revealed a minimum of n=8 per group for correct statistical analysis. In both experimental settings, the respective mouse lines were bred in the mouse facilities of MGH (A) and BWH (B). Depending on the litter sizes, additional mice were added in the HDM group, since bigger variability was expected in this group than the saline group.</p>
<p>Intracellular CD4+ cytokine staining was performed for all mice, however some stainings failed and could not be reliably interpreted and were therefore excluded.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors have largely replied to the reviewer comments, amended some noted typos &amp; figure legend issues, as well as discussed the reviewers concerns in text and in their rebuttal.</p>
<p>The data presented are novel and of significant interest, conceptually moving this field forward, but in this reviewer's opinion reflect one pathway, of likely several, linked to protective effects of vitamin D on airway disease. This reviewer recommends a further slight editing of the text to present this broader scenario.</p>
<p>i) Treg cells are highly dependent on IL-2 (both Foxp3+ and IL-10+ cells, not always the same population), constitutively express the IL-2R, and there is already a significant literature regarding vitamin D and IL-10/Treg in control of immune-mediated conditions. A simple statement acknowledging this and that there are likely more than one mechanisms by which vitamin D may regulate allergic airway disease (directly or indirectly) would be appreciated - this is no way detracts from the novelty and contribution of the current findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added the following statement to the manuscript (lines 623-625):</p>
<p>“Additional pathways, including the induction of IL-10 production by CD4+ T cells as well as a direct induction of Foxp3+ T reg cells could have further contributed to the observed protective effect of vitamin D supplementation (PMID: 21047796; 22529297).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>ii) More comprehensive referencing of earlier papers proposing effects of vitamin D in controlling Treg/IL-10 and dampening Th2 responses in mouse (and human) models</p>
<p>(e.g. Taher, Y. A., van Esch, B. C. A. M., Hofman, G. A., Henricks, P. A. J. &amp; van Oosterhout, A. J.

</disp-quote>
<p>We have included the reference in the discussion section of our manuscript in lines 617-619:</p>
<p>“Similar findings regarding the effects of vitamin D in controlling Treg/IL-10 and dampening Th2 responses have been reported, e.g., in (PMID: 18390702) and in offspring of mice that had been subjected to vitamin D deficiency in the third trimester of their pregnancy (PMID: 24943330).”</p>
