<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT), a recurent cause of male infertility, is the most frequent disorder of spermatogenesis with a probable genetic cause. Patients and mice bearing mutations in the <italic>ARMC2</italic> gene have a decreased sperm concentration, and individual sperm show multiple morphological defects and a lack of motility – a canonical OAT phenotype. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is required to treat such a condition but it is associated with a small increase in birth defects in comparison to pregnancies not involving assisted conception . Consequently, new targeted treatments are needed to restore fertility. Here, a combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> injection and electroporation of capped and poly-A-tailed naked mRNA is tested as a strategy to treat <italic>ARMC2</italic>-related infertility in mouse. mRNAs coding for several reporter genes are tested and the efficiency and the kinetic of expression are assessed using <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> 2D and 3D imaging experiments. We show that mRNA-coded reporter proteins are detected for up to 3 weeks in germ cells, making the use of mRNA possible to treat infertility. We compare these results with those obtained with a non-integrative plasmid Enhanced Episomal Vector (EEV), which induces low and transient expression in spermatogenic cells. Consequently, injection and electroporation of naked mRNA-<italic>Armc2</italic> into the testes of <italic>Armc2</italic>-deficient males were performed and we show the presence of normal and motile sperm in the epididymis. These motile sperm were able to produce embryos by IVF and ICSI. This study shows for the first time that mRNA-<italic>Armc2</italic> efficiently restores fertility and opens new paths for male infertility treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worldwide, 10-15 % of couples (or 70 million) face infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Infertility is thus a major public health issue presenting significant medical, scientific and economic challenges (a multibillion € annual market)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. A significant proportion of infertilities is due to altered gametogenesis, where the sperm and eggs produced are incompatible with fertilization and/or embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Approximately 40 % of cases of infertilities involve a male factor, either exclusively, or associated with a female deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Male gametogenesis, or spermatogenesis, is a highly complex physiological process which can be split into three successive steps: proliferation (mitosis of spermatogonia), reduction of the number of chromosomes (meiosis of spermatocytes), and morphogenesis of spermatozoa (spermiogenesis). The whole process involves around two thousands of genes, 60 % of which are expressed exclusively in the testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Because of this multiplicity of genes, spermatogenesis is strongly affected by genetic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], with most severe disorders likely to be of genetic origin.</p>
<p>Among infertility disorders, oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT) is the most frequent (50 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]) and it is likely to be of genetic origin. Spermatocytograms of OAT patients show a decrease in sperm concentration, multiple morphological defects and defective motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Because of these combined defects, patients are infertile and can only conceive by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).</p>
<p>ICSI can efficiently overcome the problems faced. Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding the potential risks associated with this technique, including blastogenesis defect, cardiovascular defect, gastrointestinal defect, musculoskeletal defect, orofacial defect, leukemia, central nervous system tumors, and solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Statistical analyses of birth records have demonstrated an elevated risk of birth defects, with a 30-40 % increased likelihood in cases involving ICSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], and a prevalence of birth defects between 1 % and 4 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. To overcome these drawbacks, a number of experimental strategies have been proposed to bypass ARTs and restore spermatogenesis and fertility, including gene therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Gene therapy consists of introducing a DNA sequence into the genome to compensate for a defective gene. It can thus rescue production of a missing protein, and is now applied both in research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and for the treatment of human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] .</p>
<p>Given the genetic basis of male infertility, the first strategy, tested in mice, was to overcome spermatogenic failure associated with monogenic diseases by delivery of an intact gene to deficient germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Gene therapy is effective in germ cells, as numerous publications have shown that conventional plasmids can be transferred into spermatogonia in several species with success, allowing their transcription in all cells of the germinal lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Most experiments were performed in mouse models, delivering DNA constructs into living mouse germ cells by testis electroporation after microinjection of a DNA-containing solution into the seminiferous tubules. Using this method, it was possible to rescue meiosis and fertility in mouse models of infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. However, the genetic changes induced are transmitted to any descendants. Consequently, gene therapy cannot be used to treat infertility in humans, both for ethical reasons and to avoid any eugenic deviations, and currently transmissible changes in humans are illegal in 39 countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the genetic modification of germ cell lines poses biological risks, including the induction of cancer, off-target effects, and cell mosaicism. Errors in editing may have adverse effects on future generations. It is exceedingly challenging to anticipate the consequences of genetic mosaicism, for instance, in a single individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Gene therapies have thus raised both ethical controversy and long- term safety issues.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we decided to test an alternative strategy to DNA transfection based on the use of naked mRNA. Thanks to this change, the risk of genomic insertion is avoided, and thus there is no question of heritable alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].The first part of this study presents a characterization of the protein expression patterns obtained following transfection of naked mRNA coding for reporter genes into the testes of mice. The second part is to apply the protocol to a preclinical mouse model of OAT. Patients and mice carrying mutations in the <italic>ARMC2</italic> gene present a canonical OAT phenotype and are infertile. The preclinical <italic>Armc2</italic> deficient (<italic>Armc2</italic> KO) mouse model is therefore a valuable model to assess whether <italic>in vivo</italic> injection of naked mRNA combined with electroporation can restore spermatogenesis. We chose this model for several reasons: first, <italic>Armc2</italic> KO mice are sterile and all sperm exhibit short, thick or coiled flagella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. As a result, 100 % of sperm are immobile, thus it should be easy to determine the efficacy of the technique by measuring sperm motility with a CASA system. Second, the <italic>Armc2</italic> gene codes for an 867-amino acid protein and this large size represents a challenge for expression in the testis following electroporation.</p>
<p>To determine the efficacy of naked mRNA transfection as a method to achieve protein expression in the testes, we first assessed the level of transcription of reporter proteins after mRNA injection compared to the injection of a non-integrating plasmid, the Enhanced Episomal Vector (EEV). EEV is a vector derived from Epstein-Barr virus, it includes an origin of replication (EBV Ori) and the EBNA1 protein. Both elements, allows the synchronous initiation of extra-chromosomal EEV replication with host DNA at each S phase of the cell cycle and the segregation of the EEV episome in daughter cells. It is notable that EEV is maintained at a rate of 90-95% per cell division. It does not integrate or modify the host genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present <italic>in vivo</italic> work, we injected and electroporated three distinct mRNAs coding for the following reporter proteins: green fluorescent protein (GFP), luciferase (Luc) and mCherry, and an EEV episome vector containing the sequences coding for both GFP and luciferase reporter proteins. The initial step was to characterize and validate the method of injection in adult males. Subsequently, the kinetics and patterns of expression of the electroporated mRNAs and EEV were compared using a variety of methods, including whole testis imaging, <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging, and tissue clearing. Subsequently, the mRNA transfection protocol was tested in a preclinical mouse model of OAT with the objective of restoring fertility.</p>

<p>Adult mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and then transcardiac perfused with 1X PBS (Sigma Aldrich, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France). The testes were extracted and fixed for two days at 4 °C in 4 % PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA ,USA). Samples were then washed with PBS for at least two days. Mouse testes were subsequently dehydrated in graded series of tert-butanol solutions (Sigma Aldrich, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France) at 35 °C as follows: 30 % overnight (O/N), 50 % for 24 h, 70 % for 10 h, 80 % O/N, 90 % for 10 h, 96 % O/N, and 100 % for 10 h. The testes were cleared in clearing solution (96 % Histodenz, 2 % Sorbitol, 20 % Urea) for 2 days. Then, nuclei were stained with 3.6 μM DAPI (20 % DMSO; 2 % Triton, 1 % BSA) for 2 days.

<p>The optically-cleared mouse testes were imaged using a ‘ConfoBright’ system which is a unique adaptive optics confocal microscope (Nikon A1R MP, Nikon Europe B.V., The Netherlands) equipped with a deformable mirror module (AOS-micro, AlpAO, Montbonnot, France) to correct geometrical aberrations. Indeed, the 3D confocal imaging of cleared sample requires long distance objectives for deep tissue imaging, resulting in optical aberrations due to inhomogeneous refractive index. The ‘ConfoBright’ microscope corrects these geometric optical aberrations both in excitation and detection light path and restores locally the high diffraction-limited spatial resolution and the best possible photon collection efficiency. The driving metrics based on molecular brightness was used to optimize the adaptive optics in the isoplanatic patch of ca. 100 mm at each imaged depth. Images were acquired using an apo LWD 40x/1.15 water immersion objective (WD 600 µm) and a Plan apo 10x/0.45 objective.

<label>1.</label><title><italic>In vivo</italic> microinjection and electroporation of mouse testes</title>
<p>Two routes have been described for microinjection of DNA into the testes: direct injection through the <italic>tunica albuginea,</italic> or injection into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules via the <italic>rete testis</italic>. We chose the <italic>rete testis</italic> route and evaluated the efficacy of the microinjection protocol. In particular, we wished to better characterize the diffusion of the injected solution in the volume of the testis, as we were unable to find any information on this parameter in the literature. The efficacy of microinjection <italic>via rete testis</italic> was assessed using fluorescent i- particles NIRFiP-180, and by measuring their diffusion in testis cross sections examined by microscopy 3 days post-injection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). To avoid lesions due to overfilling, the injection was controlled by measuring the expansion of the staining of the peripheral seminiferous tubules during the injection. Injections were stopped when the testes were filled to 2/3 of their capacity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A-B</xref>). In testis cross sections, the fluorescent i-particles NIRFiP-180 were heterogeneously distributed, and mainly observed in seminiferous tubules located in the peripheral region of the testes, with fewer particles present in the center of the testes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C- D</xref>). Moreover, no fluorescent i-particles NIRFiP-180 were visible in the peritubular space.

<p>Next, we assessed the overall safety of the <italic>rete testis</italic> microinjection and electroporation of mRNA and EEV into testes. The safety of the protocol was evaluated by comparing macroscopic and microscopic anatomies of control (injected with control solution, PBS, 0.05 % FG), and treated testes (injected either with EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> (PBS, 0.05 % FG) or <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA (PBS, 0.05 % FG)). Three days post-injection, the testes were first observed under a binocular microscope to identify possible macroscopic degeneration of the seminiferous tubules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> A1 and 2 B1). Degenerations appears as pearly white lesions at the surface of the testis as illustrated in Supp <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> following over electroporation. With the protocol we have developed, no such lesions were observed. Next, the testes were measured and weighed. No statistical differences in length and weight were observed between control and treated testes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> A2, A3, B2, B3). Then, microscopic differences were sought by histological analysis of 5 µm sections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). No difference was observed between the control condition and EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> or <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA on the full cross sections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> C1, C2, C3). Next, we observed all the different testicular cells, including all germ cell types and Sertoli cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> D1, D2, D3) for each condition. The layered structure of germ cells was identical in all conditions. Analysis of the histological sections revealed no differences in the tubules area of the testes injected either with EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> or <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2 E</xref>). At last, Harris-Shorr staining of the epididymal sperm cells demonstrated that there were no increases in morphological defects when mRNA and EEV were used in comparison with the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> F4).

<label>2.</label><title>Analysis of EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA testicular expression by whole testis imaging</title>
<p>After validating the injection method, we compared the kinetics of GFP expression and the maintenance of the fluorescent signals for mRNA and EEV. To do so, we injected and electroporated one testis of adult B6D2 mice with EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> (n=129) or with <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA (n=65). At 0-, 1-, 7-, 15-, 21-, 28-, 35-, 42- and 49-days post-injection, the whole testes were observed under an inverted microscope. The exogenous fluorescence was directly visible at the surface of the testes when illuminated with light at the appropriate wavelength (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). No testicular lesions were observed on the testes at any post injection time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> A1-H1 and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> A1-F1). In addition, both <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA and EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> induced GFP expression in the testes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> A2-H2 and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> A2-F2). It is worth noting that both vectors induced GFP expression at one day post-injection. However, the duration of fluorescent signals were different. For EEV, GFP fluorescence was still observable on day 42 for 100 % of samples, and 56 % of samples were positive on day 49, indicating that expression lasted around 1.5 months (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). In contrast, for mRNA, 100 % of testes were labeled on day 21, but none showed any fluorescence on day 28 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). Thus, EEV transfection allowed a considerably longer duration of expression than mRNA. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). It is important to underline that the signal measured is the fluorescence emitted by the GFP. This signal is dependent on both the half-lives of the plasmid/mRNA and the GFP. Therefore, the kinetic of the signal persistence (which is called here expression) is a combination of the persistence of the vector and the synthesized protein. In addition to differences in duration of expression, the GFP expression patterns were clearly different: mRNA produced a large, diffuse pattern, highlighting the shape of the seminiferous tubules; EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> produced a punctiform pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>.) These results suggest that <italic>GFP</italic>-mRNA and EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> targeted different seminiferous cell types, such as Sertoli cells and all germline cells, or that there were differences in terms of transfection efficiency.</p>

<p>To further assess and compare the kinetics of the expression of the two vectors, we expressed exogenous luciferase in the testis using EEV or mRNA and observed the level of luciferase by <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging. For EEV, we took advantage of the fact that the EEV plasmid contains the DNA sequence of the luciferase protein (<italic>CAGs-GFP-T2A-Luciferase</italic>) in addition to the DNA sequence of the GFP fluorescent protein (Supp <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). For mRNA, we injected commercial naked <italic>luciferase</italic>-mRNA into the <italic>rete testis</italic> according to the same protocol as used for <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA. For this set of experiments, we injected the EEV-<italic>GFP-Luc</italic> and <italic>luciferase-</italic>mRNA into the testes of 6 adult mice on day 0. We injected a similar number of copies of mRNA and EEV. The testes were imaged <italic>in vivo</italic> to detect bioluminescence expression, on day 1 and weekly until disappearance of the signal, no more than 120 days post-injection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). For EEV-<italic>GFP-Luciferase</italic>, the bioluminescence induced by transfection was detected from day 1.

For <italic>Luciferase</italic>-mRNA, expression was also detected from day 1.

Overall, our results indicated a stronger expression for mRNA than for EEV, but with expression decreasing rapidly over-time, and almost no remaining signal after 3 weeks.

From this 3D reconstruction, we determined the volume of the testis stained with GFP by measuring the GFP-positive area in each image and multiplying it by the thickness of the z-step (10 µm). Due to optical issues, only half part of the whole testis was acquired, then the sample was turned by 180 ° to acquire the other half part. A total GFP-stained volume of 0.51 mm<sup>3</sup> and 0.23 mm<sup>3</sup> was determined from the face A and the face B, respectively. The corresponding total volume of half part of the testis was measured as 60 mm<sup>3</sup>, therefore 0.81 % and 0.24 % of the testis was transfected for the face A and the face B, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6 B</xref>).</p>

<p>Because the GFP fluorescence patterns were different for the two nucleic vectors when observed under the inverted microscope (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), we wondered whether the same cell types were targeted in both cases. To address this question, the whole optical cleared testes from EEV-<italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA-transfected mice were imaged using a confocal microscope. The different cell types were identified based on their positions within the seminiferous tubule, their cellular shape and their nuclear morphology - revealed by nuclear staining. For instance, Sertoli cells have an oval to elongated nucleus and the cytoplasm presents a complex shape (“tombstone” pattern) along the basement membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].

<p>Heterologous expression is well known to depend on the protein studied, we therefore tested the same reporter proteins to compare the mRNA and EEV vectors in the experiments presented above. Apart from the bioluminescence experiments with luciferase, we compared only GFP protein expression. To validate and confirm the capacity of naked mRNA to express proteins in the testes after injection and electroporation, we further challenged the method with mCherry, another reporter protein (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 1BD</xref>). We injected homemade naked mRNA coding for mCherry into the testes. As previously with <italic>GFP-</italic>mRNA, no testicular lesions were observed (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 3</xref> A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1).</p>
<p>The assessment of the temporal persistence of testicular mCherry fluorescent protein expression revealed a robust red fluorescence from day 1 post-injection, which remained detectable for at least 15 days (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 3</xref> B2, C2, and D2).

<p>By analyzing the RNA-seq database produced by Gan’s team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], we show that the mRNA encoding ARMC2 starts to be expressed at the pachytene spermatocyte stage, then shows a gradual increase at the round spermatid stage, and finally becomes predominantly expressed at the elongated spermatid stage (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 6C</xref>), a result in agreement with a post-meiotic function of the protein. Finally, we also consistently observed a staining at the base of the manchette of elongating spermatids but we have no explanation for that (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A3</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results presented here demonstrate that the ARMC2 protein is expressed and translated at the late stages of spermatogenesis.</p>

<p>We next tested whether the injection and electroporation of <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA molecules had any deleterious effects on testis anatomy and seminiferous tubule structure. We first verified the quality of <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA synthesis by transfecting HEK cells and performing Western blot (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 7</xref>).

<p>We then assessed whether the injection of <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA into the testes in <italic>Armc2</italic> KO mice restored sperm motility. We examined motility of sperm cells present in the caudal part of the epididymis at different times post-injection (3- to 35-days post-injection). For each condition, between 3 and 16 KO mice were used.</p>
<p>The <italic>Armc2</italic> KO model used is known to produce sperm cells with short and irregular flagella that are therefore immotile on day 0. No motile sperm were observed on days 3, 6, 10, 15 or 28 after surgery (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11 A</xref>). However, motile sperm cells were found in the epididymis of some <italic>Armc2</italic> KO mice at 21- and 35-days post-treatment (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11 A</xref>). Indeed, 1 in 3 mice had motile sperm at 21 days post-surgery, rising to 3 in 4 mice at 35 days post-injection. Nevertheless, the number of motile sperm observed remained low: 5.5 % after 21-days and 7.15 % after 35- days post-injection (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref> <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">A1</xref>). The sperm motility parameters of <italic>Armc2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-rescued motile sperm were characterized in comparison to those of <italic>Armc2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> sperm using the computer- assisted semen analysis (CASA) system (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref> <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">A2</xref>). These parameters included VAP, VSL, VCL, ALH, BCF, and STR. We have observed significant differences between WT and rescued sperm. In particular, the VSL and LIN parameters are lower for rescued sperm. Next sperm were sorted as progressive, intermediate, hyperactivated, or slow according to motility parameters of motile sperm and recorded from their track (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A3</xref>). The percentage of hyperactivated sperm and the proportion of intermediates in the <italic>Armc2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-rescued motile sperm population were found to be increased in comparison to the control.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The challenge of treating male infertility remains to be addressed. Current assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs) are unable to treat all patients, and alternative strategies need to be developed to meet the legitimate desire to be a father. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of naked mRNA as a means to induce an expression of exogenous proteins in male germ cells in a preclinical adult mouse model. Based on previous studies using electroporation, we investigated whether the combination of the injection of naked mRNA and in <italic>vivo</italic> electroporation could lead to an efficient protein expression in spermatogenic cells. We chose to first study the efficiency of capped and poly(A)-tailed mRNA coding for reporter proteins and compared the results to those obtained with a non-integrative enhanced episomal vector plasmid. No EEV plasmid has ever been tested in the context of infertility treatment before this study.</p>
<p>Using an adult mouse model, we optimized the micro-injection and electroporation method described by Michaelis et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. We show that the microinjection through the <italic>rete testis</italic> did not provide a homogenous distribution of the particles throughout the seminiferous tubules. Nevertheless, the seminiferous tubules remained intact, with no signal detected in the peritubular space. The peripheral expression observed was due to the close vicinity of cells to the electrodes, and to a peripheral dispersal of the injected solution, as shown by the distribution of the fluorescent i-particles NIRFiP-180. Our results also showed that the combination of injection and electroporation did not perturb spermatogenesis when electric pulses are carefully controlled. Using such a protocol, we were able to induce the expression of 3 reporter proteins, GFP, mCherry and luciferase in the testis by mRNA injection/electroporation.</p>
<p>Using whole testicular optical clearing, the reporter proteins were synthesized from the injected mRNA in different types of cells including Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, round spermatids, and mature spermatids from day 1, and were still detectable after 1 week. These results deserve two comments: first, the expression is very fast and synthesized protein is detectable 24 h injection, second all cell types have the ability to translate mRNAs. Furthermore, the fact that we observed motile sperm at 21 days after injection confirms that spermatids are transfected and that the translation of the protein of interest is possible at this stage. For EEV, we have a similar result at day 1. However, the yields of seminiferous tubules and cellular transfection are lower. In particular, a lower level of transfection of germ cells was observed than with the mRNA. It is worth noting that after one week, the reporter proteins synthesized from injected EEV, were only discernible in the Sertoli cells.</p>
<p>Based on whole testes fluorescence and, for the first time, <italic>in vivo</italic> bioluminescence imaging of testes, we characterized the kinetics of mRNA expression. The signal measured is the fluorescence or the bioluminescence emitted by the GFP or luciferase. This signal is dependent on both the half-lives of the plasmid/mRNA and the proteins. Therefore, the kinetic of the signal persistence is a combination of the persistence of the vector and the synthesized protein. For mRNA, it’s difficult to determine the lifespan of our mRNAs because these mRNAs have been modified at different levels including 5’CAP, mRNA body, poly(A)tail, which increase mRNA stability and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, their half-lives should not exceed a few days and therefore the fluorescent signal observed, ranging from 15- to 21-days, depending on the molecule being expressed, likely corresponds to the persistence of the protein synthesized during the time window of mRNA expression. The persistence of the reporter proteins is in line with the fact that proteins involved in spermatogenesis exhibit a markedly low turnover rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. This is due to the fact that these proteins are stored within sperm organelles, such as the acrosome, manchette, centrioles or fibrous sheath. These organelles, made during spermiogenesis, remain stable for weeks until the fertilization process occurs because there is no protein synthesis in mature sperm. For example, the Cav3.2 calcium channel is expressed during meiosis at the pachytene stage and contributes to calcium signaling during acrosome reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. When using the EEV vector, expression persisted for longer – up to 119 days – due to the intrinsic property of the EEV plasmid which allows its replication in synchronous manner with the host genome.</p>
<p>These results suggest that although EEV expression lasted longer, mRNAs, by targeting more efficiently male germ cells and allowing higher transfection yields of seminiferous tubules, could be a more effective and potent tool to express exogenous proteins in germ cells. By expressing a missing protein in the case of male infertility due to monogenic causes, it could be possible to restore failed spermatogenesis and thus to treat infertility.</p>
<sec id="s5a">
<title>ARMC2 is expressed in late spermatogenesis stages</title>
<p>We show that ARMC2 was localized in the flagellum of spermatids obtained by enzymatic dissociation. No <italic>Armc2</italic> expression was detected in earlier germ cell type lineages like spermatogonia or spermatocytes. These results suggest that the ARMC2 protein is expressed late during spermatogenesis, which explains why motile sperm were found in the cauda epididymis from 3-weeks after injection in our treated mice. Indeed, full spermiogenesis (from round cells to sperm) takes around 15 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], and the journey across the epididymis lasts around 8 days, making a total of 3-weeks. Our results also confirm those recently published by Lechtreck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] from their study of the role of ARMC2 in the Intra-Flagellar Transport (IFT) of radial spokes in <italic>Chlamydomonas.</italic> They suggested that the transport of the radial spokes along the flagellum involves ARMC2, acting as an IFT adapter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. The presence of ARMC2 in the flagella of elongating spermatid supports this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Exogenous <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA expression rescued the motility of oligo-astheno- teratozoospermic sperm</title>
<p>This is the first demonstration that proteins can be expressed in the testis following electroporation with optimized, capped and poly(A)-tailed mRNA.</p>
<p>Our objective was to develop a new targeted therapeutic approach for infertility associated with monogenic defects. The objective of this preclinical study was to ascertain the efficacy of messenger RNA (mRNA) in expressing a missing protein, ARMC2, in a mouse model exhibiting oligo-astheno-teratozospermia due to the absence of <italic>Armc2</italic>, with the aim of restoring flagellar motility and fertility. Our results strongly suggest that the strategy did not alter spermatogenesis, as injection and electroporation of <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA or EEV-<italic>Armc2</italic> had no effect on testicular morphology or weight. More importantly, the technique was effective, with motile sperm cells found in cauda epididymis 3 and 5 weeks after <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA injection into testes from <italic>Armc2</italic> KO males. Nevertheless, it should be noted that not all injected mice were efficiently treated. For example, only 87.5% of the treated mice (14 of the 16) exhibited motile sperm after 5 weeks. The absence of motile sperm at 5 weeks may be attributed to the specific types of spermatogenic cells that were transfected during the electroporation phase. It is possible that the transfected cells may differ between individuals, potentially influenced by the injection and the position of the electrodes during electroporation. If the mRNA transfection occurs in a spermatogonia, it may take more than six weeks (including the time required to cross the epididymis) before motile epididymal sperm cells emerge. This potential timeline could explain the absence of motile sperm in some mice at 5 weeks.</p>
<p>Due to the quantity of motile sperm obtained, it was not possible to produce offspring through natural mating. However, the <italic>Armc2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-rescued sperm exhibited normal morphology, motility, and <italic>in vitro</italic> fertility. Indeed, the <italic>Armc2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-rescued motile spermatozoa have successfully fertilized eggs and produced embryos that were capable of developing properly into blastocysts. These results provide compelling evidence that the method can effectively produce fertile sperm. It worth to note that the significant modifications of the CASA parameters observed for rescued sperm did not impact their fertilizing potential. Naked mRNA injection/electroporation is therefore a promising method to treat infertility. In contrast, no motile spermatozoa were found after injection/electroporation of EEV-<italic>Armc2</italic>, confirming our previous results suggesting that this nucleic tool does not efficiently enter or transfect germ cells.</p>
<p>Despite this success, the transfection rate deserves to be improved to obtain a larger number of sperm cells to produced offspring through natural mating. To increase the testicular transfection rate, encapsulation of mRNA into lipids nanoparticles could be used, as used for Covid vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. During the writing of this manuscript, Dong team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], used a self- amplifying RNA (saRNA) encapsulated in cholesterol-amino-phosphate derived lipid nanoparticle to restore spermatogenesis in infertile mice. They successfully restore the expression of the DNA Meiotic Recombinase 1 (DMC1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] in <italic>Dmc1</italic> KO infertile mice by injecting a self-amplifying RNA-<italic>Dmc1</italic> in the testes. saRNA are genetically engineered replicons derived from self-replicating single-stranded RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. The saRNA contains the alphavirus replicase genes and encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex which amplifies synthetic transcripts in situ and the target RNA sequence. The target RNA is expressed at high levels as a separate entity. As a result of their self-replicative activity, saRNAs can be delivered at lower concentrations than conventional mRNA to achieve comparable expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Moreover, saRNA constructs need to be condensed by a cationic carrier into a nanoparticle measuring ∼100 nm to enable their uptake into target cells and protect the saRNA from degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Finally, saRNA will amplify the RNA without cellular regulation. For all these reasons, if such a strategy is to be pursued, a potential toxicity effect due to saRNA over expression must be investigated in the testes and progeny. Another difficulty with saRNA relates to the size of the molecular construct. saRNA sequences are large and complex. The length of the sequence RdRP is around 7 kilobases, which often makes the full length of saRNA more than 9 kilobases once the sequence for the protein of interest has been integrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Dong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] successfully used their saRNA construct to rescue spermatogenesis failure induced by the absence of the small protein Dmc1 (37 KDa), but it may be more challenging with larger proteins such as the structural proteins involved in OAT, including the 98-kDa ARMC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Our next step will be to assess whether encapsulating <italic>Armc2</italic>-mRNA in LNP-CAP could allow a larger number of germ cells to be transfected.</p>

<title>Naked mRNA, a new therapeutic strategy to treat severe infertility</title>
<p>Non-obstructive Azoospermia (NOA) and severe oligozoospermia (SO) are the most severe disorders of spermatogenesis and are the most likely to be of genetic origin. NOA is defined by the complete absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. Approximately 10–15 % of infertile men have azoospermia, and a further 15 % have SO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. For patients with NOA, few clinical solutions are currently available. Generally, testicular sperm extraction is attempted to collect some spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubules, which can then be used for ICSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. When no sperm are retrieved, intra-conjugal conception is impossible. The results of this study strongly suggest that transient mRNA expression of a missing protein in NOA testes by electroporation could be sufficient to produce normal sperm for IVF and obtain embryos.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this paper presents the first <italic>in vivo</italic> testicular injection and electroporation of capped and poly(A)-tailed mRNA, demonstrating that it is an efficient strategy to transfect male germ cells and that the duration of the expression of the resulting proteins is compatible with restoring spermatogenesis. Our comprehensive study revealed mRNA to be more efficient than an episomal vector, despite longer-lived expression in male germ cells with EEV. The difference was linked to EEV achieving a lower rate of seminiferous tubule transfection and a shorter duration of expression in germ cells. Our findings have also demonstrated, for the first time, that sperm motility and fertility can be restored in mice with an oligo-astheno- teratozoospermia phenotype through a technique that combines injection and electroporation of capped and poly(A)-tailed mRNA. The findings presented open new opportunities to develop efficient strategies to treat male infertility with monogenic causes.</p>

<p>This study reports an approach for restoring sperm motility in mice. The strength lies in in the novelty of the methodology being developed, but the evidence for the success of the method or its mechanism is <bold>inadequate</bold>. Additional experimental support would be required to support the conclusions of the authors.</p>

<p>The authors assess the effectiveness of electroporating mRNA into male germ cells to rescue the expression of proteins required for spermatogenesis progression in individuals where these proteins are mutated or depleted. To set up the methodology, they first evaluated the expression of reporter proteins in wild-type mice, which showed expression in germ cells for over two weeks. Then, they attempted to recover fertility in a model of late spermatogenesis arrest that produces immotile sperm. By electroporating the mutated protein, the authors recovered the motility of ~5% of the sperm; although the sperm regenerated was not able to produce offspring using IVF, the embryos reached the 2-cell state (in contrast to controls that did not progress past the zygote state).</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive evaluation of the mRNA methodology with multiple strengths. First, the authors show that naked synthetic RNA, purchased from a commercial source or generated in the laboratory with simple methods, is enough to express exogenous proteins in testicular germ cells. The authors compared RNA to DNA electroporation and found that germ cells are efficiently electroporated with RNA, but not DNA. The differences between these constructs were evaluated using in vivo imaging to track the reporter signal in individual animals through time. To understand how the reporter proteins affect the results of the experiments, the authors used different reporters: two fluorescent (eGFP and mCherry) and one bioluminescent (Luciferase). Although they observed differences among reporters, in every case expression lasted for at least two weeks.</p>
<p>The authors used a relevant system to study the therapeutic potential of RNA electroporation. The ARMC2-deficient animals have impaired sperm motility phenotype that affects only the later stages of spermatogenesis. The authors showed that sperm motility was recovered to ~5%, which is remarkable due to the small fraction of germ cells electroporated with RNA with the current protocol. The sperm motility parameters were thoroughly assessed by CASA. The 3D reconstruction of an electroporated testis using state-of-the-art methods to show the electroporated regions is compelling.</p>
<p>The main weakness of the manuscript is that although the authors manage to recover motility in a small fraction of the sperm population, it is unclear whether the increased sperm quality is substantial to improve assisted reproduction outcomes. The authors found that the rescued sperm could be used to obtain 2-cell embryos via IVF, but no evidence for more advanced stages of embryo differentiation was provided. The motile rescued sperm was also successfully used to generate blastocyst by ICSI, but the statistical significance of the rate of blastocyst production compared to non-rescued sperm remains unclear. The title is thus an overstatement since fertility was never restored for IVF, and the mutant sperm was already able to produce blastocysts without the electroporation intervention.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors clearly show that electroporating mRNA can improve spermatogenesis as demonstrated by the generation of motile sperm in the ARMC2 KO mouse model.</p>

<p>The authors inject, into the rete testes, mRNA and plasmids encoding mRNAs for GFP and then ARMC2 (into infertile Armc2 KO mice) in a gene therapy approach to express exogenous proteins in male germ cells. They do show GFP epifluorescence and ARMC2 protein in KO tissues, although the evidence presented is weak. Overall, the data do not necessarily make sense given the biology of spermatogenesis and more rigorous testing of this model is required to fully support the conclusions, that gene therapy can be used to rescue male infertility.</p>
<p>In this revision, the authors attempt to respond to the critiques from the first round of reviews. While they did address many of the minor concerns, there are still a number to be addressed. With that said, the data still do not support the conclusions of the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) The authors have not satisfactorily provided an explanation for how a naked mRNA can persist and direct expression of GFP or luciferase for ~3 weeks. The most stable mRNAs in mammalian cells have half-lives of ~24-60 hours. The stability of the injected mRNAs should be evaluated and reported using cell lines. GFP protein's half-life is ~26 hours, and luciferase protein's half-life is ~2 hours.</p>
<p>(2) There is no convincing data shown in Figs. 1-8 that the GFP is even expressed in germ cells, which is obviously a prerequisite for the Armc2 KO rescue experiment shown in the later figures! In fact, to this reviewer the GFP appears to be in Sertoli cell cytoplasm, which spans the epithelium and surrounds germ cells - thus, it can be oft-confused with germ cells. In addition, if it is in germ cells, then the authors should be able to show, on subsequent days, that it is present in clones of germ cells that are maturing. Due to intracellular bridges, a molecule like GFP has been shown to diffuse readily and rapidly (in a matter of minutes) between adjacent germ cells. To clarify, the authors must generate single cell suspensions and immunostain for GFP using any of a number of excellent commercially-available antibodies to verify it is present in germ cells. It should also be present in sperm, if it is indeed in the germline.</p>
<p>Other comments:</p>
<p>70-1 This is an incorrect interpretation of the findings from Ref 5 - that review stated there were ~2,000 testis-enriched genes, but that does not mean &quot;the whole process involves around two thousand of genes&quot;</p>
<p>74 would specify 'male'</p>
<p>79-84 Are the concerns with ICSI due to the procedure itself, or the fact that it's often used when there is likely to be a genetic issue with the male whose sperm was used? This should be clarified if possible using references from the literature, as this reviewer imagines this could be a rather contentious issue with clinicians who routinely use this procedure, even in cases where IVF would very likely have worked</p>
<p>199 Codon optimization improvement of mRNA stability needs a reference; in one study using yeast transcripts, optimization improved RNA stability on the order of minutes (e.g., from ~5 minutes to ~17 minutes); is there some evidence that it could be increased dramatically to days or weeks?</p>
<p>472-3 The reported half-life of EGFP is ~36 hours - so, if the mRNA is unstable (and not measured, but certainly could be estimated by qRT-PCR detection of the transcript on subsequent days after injection) and EGFP is comparatively more stable (but still hours), how does EGFP persist for 21 days after injection of naked mRNA??</p>
<p>Curious why the authors were unable to get anti-GFP to work in immunostaining?</p>
<p>In Fig. 3-4, the GFP signals are unremarkable, in that they cannot be fairly attributed to any structure or cell type - they just look like blobs; and why, in Fig. 4D-E, why does the GFP signal appear stronger at 21 days than 15 days? And why is it completely gone by 28 days? This data is unconvincing. If the authors did a single cell suspension, what types or percentage of cells would be GFP+? Since germ cells are not adherent in culture, a simple experiment could be done whereby a single cell suspension could be made, cultured for 4-6 hours, and non-adherent cells &quot;shaken off&quot; and imaged vs adherent cells. Cells could also be fixed and immunostained for GFP, which has worked in many other labs using anti-GFP.</p>
<p>In Fig. 5, what is the half-life of luciferase? From this reviewer's search of the literature, it appears to be ~2-3 h in mammalian cells. With this said, how do the authors envision detectable protein for up to 20 days from a naked mRNA? The stability of the injected mRNAs should be shown in a mammalian cell line - perhaps this mRNA has an incredibly long half-life, which might help explain these results. However, even the most stable endogenous mRNAs (e.g., globin) are ~24-60 hrs.</p>
<p>527-8 The Sertoli cell cytoplasm is not just present along the basement membrane as stated, but also projects all the way to the lumina</p>
<p>529-30 This is incorrect, as round spermatids are never &quot;localized between the spermatocytes and elongated spermatids&quot; - if elongated spermatids are present, rounds are not - they are never coincident in the same testis section</p>
<p>Fig. 7 To this reviewer, all of the GFP appears to be in Sertoli cell cytoplasm</p>
<p>In Figs 1-8 there is no convincing evidence presented that GFP is expressed in germ cells! In fact, it appears to be in Sertoli cells</p>
<p>Fig. 9 - alpha-tubuline?</p>
<p>Fig. 11 - how was sperm morphology/motility not rescued on &quot;days 3, 6, 10, 15, or 28 after surgery&quot;, but it was in some at 21 and 35? How does this make sense, given the known kinetics of male germ cell development?? And at least one of the sperm in the KO in Fig. B5 looks relatively normal, and the flagellum may be out-of-focus in the image? With only a few sperm for reviewers to see, how can we know these represent the population?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors used a novel technique to treat male infertility. In a proof-of-concept study, the authors were able to rescue the phenotype of a knockout mouse model with immotile sperm using this technique. This could also be a promising treatment option for infertile men.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In their proof-of-concept study, the authors were able to show that the novel technique rescues the infertility phenotype of Armc2 knockout spermatozoa. In the revised version of the manuscript, the authors have added data on in vitro fertilisation experiments with Armc2 mRNA-rescued sperm. The authors show that Armc2 mRNA-rescued sperm can successfully fertilise oocytes that develop to the blastocyst stage. This adds another level of reliability to the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some minor weaknesses identified in my previous report have already been fixed. The technique is new and may not yet be fully established for all issues. Nevertheless, the data presented in this manuscript opens the way for several approaches to immotile spermatozoa to ensure successful fertilisation of oocytes and subsequent appropriate embryo development.</p>
<p>[Editors' note: The images in Figure 12 do not support the authors' interpretation that 2-cell embryos resulted from in vitro fertilization. Instead, the cells shown appear to be fragmented, unfertilized eggs. Combined with the lack of further development, it seems highly unlikely that fertilization was successful.]</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors assess the effectiveness of electroporating mRNA into male germ cells to rescue the expression of proteins required for spermatogenesis progression in individuals where these proteins are mutated or depleted. To set up the methodology, they first evaluated the expression of reporter proteins in wild-type mice, which showed expression in germ cells for over two weeks. Then, they attempted to recover fertility in a model of late spermatogenesis arrest that produces immotile sperm. By electroporating the mutated protein, the authors recovered the motility of ~5% of the sperm, although the sperm regenerated was not able to produce offspring using IVF.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We actually did not write that “sperm regenerated was not able to produce offspring using IVF” but rather that IVF was not attempted because the number of rescued sperm was too low. To address this important point, the ability of sperm to produce embryos was therefore challenged by two different assisted reproduction technologies, that are IVF and ICSI. To increase the number of motile sperm for IVF experiments, we have injected both testes from one male. We also conducted intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) experiments, using only rescued sperm, identified as motile sperm with a normal flagellum. The results of these new experiments have demonstrated that the rescued ARMC2 sperm successfully fertilized eggs and produced embryos at the two-cell stage by IVF and blastocysts by ICSI. These outcomes are presented in Figure 12.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This is a comprehensive evaluation of the mRNA methodology with multiple strengths. First, the authors show that naked synthetic RNA, purchased from a commercial source or generated in the laboratory with simple methods, is enough to express exogenous proteins in testicular germ cells. The authors compared RNA to DNA electroporation and found that germ cells are efficiently electroporated with RNA, but not DNA. The differences between these constructs were evaluated using in vivo imaging to track the reporter signal in individual animals through time. To understand how the reporter proteins affect the results of the experiments, the authors used different reporters: two fluorescent (eGFP and mCherry) and one bioluminescent (Luciferase). Although they observed differences among reporters, in every case expression lasted for at least two weeks.</p>
<p>The authors used a relevant system to study the therapeutic potential of RNA electroporation. The ARMC2-deficient animals have impaired sperm motility phenotype that affects only the later stages of spermatogenesis. The authors showed that sperm motility was recovered to ~5%, which is remarkable due to the small fraction of germ cells electroporated with RNA with the current protocol. The 3D reconstruction of an electroporated testis using state-of-the-art methods to show the electroporated regions is compelling.</p>
<p>The main weakness of the manuscript is that although the authors manage to recover motility in a small fraction of the sperm population, it is unclear whether the increased sperm quality is substantial to improve assisted reproduction outcomes. The quality of the sperm was not systematically evaluated in the manuscript, with the endpoints being sperm morphology and sperm mobility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their comments. As previously stated above, we produced additional rescue experiments and performed CASA, morphology observation, IVF and ICSI with the rescued sperm. The rescued ARMC2 sperm exhibited normal morphology (new figure 11 and Supp Fig 8), motility (figure 11), and fecundity (figure 12).  Whereas sperm from untreated KO males were unable to fertilize egg by IVF, the rescued sperm fertilized eggs in vitro at a significant level (mean 62%, n=5), demonstrating that our strategy improves the sperm quality and assisted reproduction outcome (from 0 to 62%).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some key results, such as the 3D reconstruction of the testis and the recovery of sperm motility, are qualitative given the low replicate numbers or the small magnitude of the effects. The presentation of the sperm motility data could have been clearer as well. For example, on day 21 after Armc2-mRNA electroporation, only one animal out of the three tested showed increased sperm motility. However, it is unclear from Figure 11A what the percentage of sperm motility for this animal is since the graph shows a value of &gt;5% and the reported aggregate motility is 4.5%. It would have been helpful to show all individual data points in Figure 11A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We provide now in figure 11A, a graph showing the percentage of rescued sperm for all animals. (scatter dot plot). Moreover, we performed additional CASA experiments to analyze in detail sperm motility (Figure 11A2-A3). Individual CASA parameters for motile sperm cells were extracted as requested by reviewer 3 and represented in a new graph (Fig 11 A2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The expression of the reporter genes is unambiguous; however, better figures could have been presented to show cell type specificity. The DAPI staining is diffused, and it is challenging to understand where the basement membranes of the tubules are. For example, in Figures 7B3 and 7E3, the spermatogonia seems to be in the middle of the seminiferous tubule. The imaging was better for Figure 8. Suboptimal staining appears to lead to mislabeling of some germ cell populations. For example, in Supplementary Figure 4A3, the round spermatid label appears to be labeling spermatocytes. Also, in some instances, the authors seem to be confusing, elongating spermatids with spermatozoa, such as in the case of Supplementary Figures 4D3 and D4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comments, some spermatogenic cells were indeed mislabeled as you mentioned. We have therefore readjusted the labeling accordingly. We also changed spermatozoa to mature spermatids. The new sentence is now: “At the cellular level, fluorescence was detectable in germ cells (B1-B3) including Spermatogonia (Sg), Spermatocytes (Scytes),round Spermatids (RStids), mature spermatids (m-Sptids) and Sertoli cells (SC)”. Moreover, to indicate the localization of the basal membrane, we have also labelled myoid cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The characterization of Armc2 expression could have been improved as well. The authors show a convincing expression of ARMC2 in a few spermatids/sperm using a combination of an anti-ARMC2 antibody and tubules derived from ARMC2 KO animals. At the minimum, one would have liked to see at least one whole tubule of a relevant stage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the remark.</p>
<p>We present now new images showing transversal section of seminiferous tubules as requested (see supp fig 6). In this new figure, it is clear that Armc2 is only expressed in spermatids. We have also added in this figure an analysis of the RNA-seq database produced by Gan's team (Gan, Wen et al. 2013), confirming that ArmC2 expression is predominantly expressed at the elongated spermatid stage. This point is now clearly indicated in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, the authors show that electroporating mRNA can improve spermatogenesis as demonstrated by the generation of motile sperm in the ARMC2 KO mouse model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here, the authors inject naked mRNAs and plasmids into the rete testes of mice to express exogenous proteins - GFP and later ARMC2. This approach has been taken before, as noted in the Discussion to rescue Dmc1 KO infertility. While the concept is exciting, multiple concerns reduce reviewer enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The approach, while not necessarily novel, is timely and interesting.  Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the writing and text can be improved and standardized - as an example, in some places in vivo is italicized, in others it's not; gene names are italicized in some places, others not; some places have spaces between a number and the units, others not. This lack of attention to detail in the preparation of the manuscript is a significant concern to this reviewer - the presentation of the experimental details does cast some reasonable concern with how the experiments might have been done. While this may be unfair, it is all the reviewers have to judge. Multiple typographical and grammatical errors are present, and vague or misleading statements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comment, we have revised the whole manuscript to remove all the mistakes. We have also added new experiments/figures to strengthen the message. Finally, we have substantially modified the discussion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors used a novel technique to treat male infertility. In a proof-of-concept study, the authors were able to rescue the phenotype of a knockout mouse model with immotile sperm using this technique. This could also be a promising treatment option for infertile men.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In their proof-of-concept study, the authors were able to show that the novel technique rescues the infertility phenotype in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some minor weaknesses, especially in the discussion section, could be addressed to further improve the quality of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have substantially modified the discussion, following the remarks of the reviewers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is very convincing that the phenotype of Armc2 KO mice could (at least in part) be rescued by injection of Armc2 RNA. However, a central question remains about which testicular cell types have been targeted by the constructs. From the pictures presented in Figures 7 and 8, this issue is hard to assess. Given the more punctate staining of the DNA construct a targeting of Sertoli cells is more likely, whereas the more broader staining of seminiferous tubules using RNA constructs is talking toward germ cells. Further, the staining for up to 119 days (Figure 5) would point toward an integration of the DNA construct into the genome of early germ cells such as spermatogonia and/or possibly to Sertoli cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comment. We would like to recall the peculiar properties of the non-insertional Enhanced Episomes Vector (EEV) plasmid, which is a non-viral episome based on the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV: Epstein-Barr Virus). It allows the persistence of the plasmid for long period of time without integration. Its maintenance within the cell is made possible by its ability to replicate in a synchronous manner with the host genome and to segregate into daughter cells. This is due to the fact that EEV is composed of two distinct elements derived from EBV: an origin of replication (oriP) and an EpsteinBarr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1) expression cassette (Gil, Gallaher, and Berk, 2010).   The oriP is a locus comprising two EBNA1-binding domains, designated as the Family of Repeats (FR) and Dyad Symmetry (DS). The FR is an array of approximately 20 EBNA1-binding sites (20 repeats of 30 bp) with high affinity, while the DS comprises four lower-affinity sites operating in tandem (Ehrhardt et al., 2008).</p>
<p>The 641-amino-acid EBNA1 protein contains numerous domains. The N-terminal domains are rich in glycines and alanines, which enable interaction with host chromosomes. The C-terminal region is responsible for binding to oriP (Hodin, Najrana, and Yates, 2013). The binding of EBNA1 to the DS element results in the recruitment of the origin of replication. This results in the synchronous initiation of extra-chromosomal EEV replication with host DNA at each S phase of the cell cycle (Düzgüneş, Cheung, and Konopka 2018). Furthermore, EBNA1 binding to the FR domain induces the formation of a bridge between metaphase chromosomes and the vector during mitosis. This binding is responsible for the segregation of the EEV episome in daughter cells (Düzgüneş, Cheung, and Konopka 2018). It is notable that EEV is maintained at a rate of 90-95% per cell division.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic properties of EEV described above, the presence of the reporter protein at 119 day after injection was likely due to the maintenance of the plasmid, mostly in Sertoli cells, and not to the DNA integration of the plasmid.</p>
<p>Of note, the specificity of EEV was already indicated in the introduction (lines 124-128 clean copy). Nevertheless, we have added more information about EEV to help the readers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given the expression after RNA transfection for up to 21 days (Figure 4) and the detection of motile sperm after 21 days (Figure 11), this would point to either round spermatids or spermatocytes.  These aspects need to be discussed more carefully (discussion section: lines 549-574).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a sentence to highlight that spermatids are transfected and protein synthetized at this stage and this question is discussed in details (see lines 677-684 clean copy).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would also be very interesting to know in which testicular cell type Armc2 is endogenously expressed (lines 575-591)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the remarks. We present now new images showing the full seminiferous tubules as requested by reviewer 1 (see supp fig 6). In this new figure, it is clear that Armc2 is only expressed in spermatids. We have also added in this figure an analysis of the RNA-seq database produced by Gan's team (Gan, Wen et al. 2013), confirming that Armc2 is predominantly expressed at the elongated spermatid stage. This point is now clearly indicated in the text. (lines 570-579 clean copy).</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The article is well-structured and easy to read. Nonetheless, there are typos and mistakes in some places that are distracting to the reader, such as the capitalization of the word &quot;Oligo-&quot; in the title of the manuscript, the use of the word &quot;Materiel&quot; in the title of the Materials and methods and the presence of space holders &quot;Schorr staining was obtained from Merck (XXX)&quot;.  Thank you, we corrected the misspelling of &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; and corrected our error: &quot;obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany)&quot;. We also carefully corrected the manuscript to remove typos and mistakes.</p>
<p>The discussion is too lengthy, with much repetition regarding the methods used and the results obtained. For example, these are two sentences from the discussion. &quot;The vector was injected via the rete testis into the adult Armc2 KO mice. The testes were then electroporated.&quot; I would recommend shortening these passages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments, we removed the sentences and we have substantially modified the discussion, following the remarks of the reviewers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The work is extensive, and many experiments have been done to prove the points made. However, a more in-depth analysis of critical experiments would have benefited the manuscript significantly. A more thorough analysis of sperm mobility and morphology using the CASA system would have been an initial step.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to the observations made, additional CASA experiments and sperm motility analysis were conducted, as illustrated in Figure 11 (A2-A3). Individual CASA parameters for motile sperm cells were extracted as suggested and represented in a new graph (Fig 11 A2). We have observed significant differences between WT and rescued sperm. In particular, the VSL and LIN parameters were lower for rescued sperm. Nevertheless, these differences were not sufficient to prevent IVF, maybe because the curvilinear velocity (VCL) was not modified.</p>

<p>In the case of ARMC2 localization, an analysis of the different stages of spermatogenesis to show when ARMC2 starts to be expressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the remarks. This is an important remark pointed out by all reviewers. As explained above, we have performed more experiments. We present now new images showing transversal section of seminiferous tubules as requested (see supp fig 6). In this new figure, it is clear that Armc2 is only expressed in spermatid layers. We have also added in this figure an analysis of the RNA-seq database produced by Gan's team (Gan, Wen et al. 2013), confirming that ArmC2 expression is predominantly expressed at the elongated spermatid stage. This point is now clearly indicated in the text. (lines 575579 clean copy).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, exploring additional endpoints to understand the quality of the sperm generated, such as the efficiency of ICSI or sperm damage, could have helped understand the degree of the recovery.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This point was underlined in public review. We paste here our answer: “To address this important point, the ability of sperm to produce embryos was therefore challenged by two different assisted reproduction technologies, that are IVF and ICSI. To increase the number of motile sperm for IVF experiments, we have injected both testes from one male. We also conducted intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) experiments, using only rescued sperm, identified as motile sperm with a normal flagellum.

<p>Thanks, we changed it accordingly: &quot;Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is required to treat such a condition, but it has limited efficacy and has been associated with a small increase in birth defects&quot; and &quot;such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)&quot;.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>40 Just thinking through the logic of the argument thus far - the authors lay out that there are people with OAT (true), ICSI must be used (true), ICSI is bad (not convincing), and therefore a new strategy is needed... so is this an alternative to ICSI? And this is to restore fertility, not &quot;restore spermatogenesis&quot;</p>
<p>- because ICSI doesn't restore spermatogenesis. This logic flow needs to be cleaned up some</p>

<p>70 &quot;almost exclusively&quot; is an odd term, and a bit of an oxymoron - if not exclusively, then where else are they expressed? Can you provide some sense of scale rather than using vague words like &quot;large&quot;, &quot;almost&quot;, &quot;several&quot;, &quot;strongly&quot; and &quot;most...likely&quot; - need some support for these claims by being more specific:</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment, we changed the sentence: &quot;The whole process involves around two thousand genes, 60% of which are expressed exclusively in the testes.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>73 &quot;severe infertility&quot; is redundant - if they are infertile, is there really any more or less about it? I think what is meant is patients with immotile sperm can be helped by ICSI - so just be more specific...</p>

<p>We changed the transition : “Among infertility disorders, oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia  (OAT) is the most frequent (50 % (Thonneau, Marchand et al. 1991); it is likely to be of genetic origin. Spermatocytograms of OAT patients show a decrease in sperm concentration, multiple morphological defects and defective motility. Because of these combined defects, patients are infertile and can only conceive by IntraCytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI). IntraCytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) can efficiently overcome the problems faced. However, there are …”</p>

<p>76-7 Again, be specific - &quot;real&quot; has little meaning - what is the increased risk, in % or fold? This is likely a controversial point, so make sure you absolutely support your contention with data .</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comment, we have reworded the sentence: “Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding the potential risks associated with this technique, including blastogenesis defect, cardiovascular defect, gastrointestinal defect, musculoskeletal defect, orofacial defect, leukemia, central nervous system tumors, and solid tumors. Statistical analyses of birth records have demonstrated an elevated risk of birth defects, with a 30–40% increased likelihood in cases involving ICSI, and a prevalence of birth defects between 1% and 4%.” We have added a list of references to support these claims.</p>

<p>79-81 So, basically transgenesis?

</disp-quote>
<p>Your feedback is greatly appreciated. In response to your comments, the sentence in question has been amended to provide a more comprehensive understanding. Indeed, the text refers to experiences carried in mice. The revised wording is as follows: “Given the genetic basis of male infertility, the first strategy, tested in mice, was to overcome spermatogenic failure associated with monogenic diseases by delivery of an intact gene to deficient germ cells (Usmani, Ganguli et al. 2013).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>84-5 &quot;efficiently&quot; and &quot;high&quot; - provide context so the reader can understand what is meant - do the authors mean the experiments work efficiently, or that a high percentage of cells are transfected?

</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comment, we have reworded the sentence: Gene therapy is effective in germ cells, as numerous publications have shown that conventional plasmids can be transferred into spermatogonia in several species with success, allowing their transcription in all cells of the germinal lineage (Usmani, Ganguli et al. 2013, Michaelis, Sobczak et al. 2014, Raina, Kumar et al. 2015, Wang, Liu et al. 2022).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The expert poses an interesting question, but one that unfortunately remains unanswered at present. Most papers on mRNA therapy state that there is no risk concerning genomic integration, but no reference is given (for instance see mRNA-based therapeutics: looking beyond COVID-19 vaccines. Lancet. 2024 doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(23)02444-3). This is an important question, which deserves to be evaluated, but is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

Preclinical studies are conducted prior to any testing in humans. Our KO mouse model has been shown to mimic human infertility.

<p>Your observation that the epididymal spermatozoa from wild-type animals exhibited defective morphology is indeed true.

To provide a more comprehensive representation, we conducted a Harris-Shorr staining procedure and included a histogram of the percentage of normal sperm in each condition (new figure 2F4). Furthermore, Harris-Shorr staining of the epididymal sperm cells revealed that there were no discernible increases in morphological defects when mRNA and EEV were utilized, in comparison with the control.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>390  Given the duration of mouse spermatogenesis (~35 days), for GFP to persist past that time suggests that it was maintained in SSCs? How can the authors explain how such a strong signal was maintained after such a long period of time? How stable are the episomally-maintained plasmids, are they maintained 100% for months? And if they are inherited by progeny of SSCs, shouldn't they be successively diluted over time? And if they are inherited by daughter cells such that they would still be expressed 49 days after injection, shouldn't all the cells originating from that SSC also be positive, instead of what appear to be small subsets as shown in Fig. 3H2? Overall, this reviewer is struggling to understand how a plasmid would be inherited and passed through spermatogenesis in the manner seen in these results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the comment.</p>
<p>This point was already underlined in public review. We paste here our answer: “The non-insertional Enhanced Episomes Vector (EEV) plasmid is a non-viral episome based on the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV: Epstein-Barr Virus). Its maintenance within the cell is made possible by its ability to replicate in a synchronous manner with the host genome and to segregate into daughter cells. This is due to the fact that EEV is composed of two distinct elements derived from EBV: an origin of replication (oriP) and an Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1) expression cassette (Gil, Gallaher, and Berk, 2010).   The oriP is a locus comprising two EBNA1-binding domains, designated as the Family of Repeats (FR) and Dyad Symmetry (DS). The FR is an array of approximately 20 EBNA1-binding sites (20 repeats of 30 bp) with high affinity, while the DS comprises four lower-affinity sites operating in tandem (Ehrhardt et al., 2008).</p>
<p>The 641-amino-acid EBNA1 protein contains numerous domains.The N-terminal domains are rich in glycines and alanines, which enable interaction with host chromosomes. The C-terminal region is responsible for binding to oriP (Hodin, Najrana, and Yates, 2013a). The binding of EBNA1 to the DS element results in the recruitment of the origin of replication. This results in the synchronous initiation of extra-chromosomal EEV replication with host DNA at each S phase of the cell cycle (Düzgüneş, Cheung, and Konopka 2018a). Furthermore, EBNA1 binding to the FR domain induces the formation of a bridge between metaphase chromosomes and the vector during mitosis. This binding is responsible for the segregation of the EEV episome in daughter cells (Düzgüneş, Cheung, and Konopka 2018b). It is notable that EEV is maintained at a rate of 90-95% per cell division.”</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic properties of EEV described above, the presence of the reporter protein at 119 day after injection was likely due to the maintenance of the plasmid, mostly in Sertoli cells, and not to the DNA integration of the plasmid.</p>
<p>Of note, the specificity of EEV was already indicated in the introduction. Nevertheless, we have added more information about it to help the readers (lines 124-128 clean copy)</p>

<p>398 Which &quot;cell types&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Your feedback is greatly appreciated, and the sentence in question has been amended to provide a more comprehensive understanding. The revised wording is as follows: These results suggest that GFPmRNA and EEV-GFP targeted different seminiferous cell types, such as Sertoli cells and all germline cells, or that there were differences in terms of transfection efficiency.</p>

<p>409 Why is it important to inject similar copies of EEV and mRNA? Wouldn't the EEV be expected to generate many, many more copies of RNA per molecule than the mRNAs when injected directly??</p>

<p>415 How is an injected naked mRNA stably maintained for 3 weeks? What is the stability of this mRNA?? Wouldn't its residence in germ cells for 21 days make it more stable than even the most stable endogenous mRNAs? Even mRNAs for housekeeping genes such as actin, which are incredibly stable, have half-lives of 9-10 hours.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your inquiry and concur with your assessment that mRNA stability is limited.  It is our hypothesis that the source of the confusion lies in the fact that we injected mRNA coding for the GFP protein, rather than mRNA tagged with GFP. After a three-week observation period, we did not observe the mRNA, but we observed the expression of the GFP protein induced by the mRNA. To draw the reader's attention to this point, we have added the following sentence to the text “It is important to underline that the signal measured is the fluorescence emitted by the GFP. This signal is dependent of both the half-lives of the plasmid/mRNA and the GFP. Therefore, the kinetic of the signal persistence (which is called here expression) is a combination of the persistence of the vector and the synthetized protein. See lines 469-472 clean copy.</p>
<p>This being said, it is difficult to compare the lifespan of a cellular mRNA with that of a mRNA that has been modified at different levels, including 5’Cap, mRNA body, poly(A)tail modifications, which both increase mRNA stability and translation (see The Pivotal Role of Chemical Modifications in mRNA Therapeutics  (2022) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2022.901510">https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2022.901510</ext-link>).

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their comment. This figure provides actually a global view of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression at the surface of the testis.

<p>We did not perform IF experiments further than 7 days after injection, a time too short to observe what the reviewer suggested. Moreover, if at 1 day after injection, GFP synthesized from injected EEV was found in both germ cells and Sertoli cells (Fig 7), after one week, the reporter proteins were only observable in Sertoli cells. This result suggests that EEV is maintained only in Sertoli cells, thus preventing the observation of stained clones.</p>

<p>For Figure 4, with the mRNA-GFP, why does the 1-day image (which looks similar to the plasmidtransfected) look so different from days 7-21?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your feedback. It is an excellent question. Because of the low resolution of the whole testis epifluorescences imaging and light penetration issue, we decided to carry-out whole testis optical clearing and three-dimensional image reconstructions experiments, in order to get insights on the transfection process. At day 1, GFP synthesized from EEV injection was found in spermatogonia, spermatocytes and Sertoli cells (Fig 7).  After one week, the reporter protein synthesized from injected EEV was only observable in Sertoli cells.</p>
<p>In contrast, for mRNA, on day 1 and day 7 post-injection, GFP fluorescent signal was associated with both Sertoli cells and germ cells. This explains why patterns between mRNA-GFP and EEV-GFP are similar at day 1 and different at day 7 between both conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Why do the authors think the signal went from so strong at 21 to undetectable at 28? What changed so drastically over those 7 days?</p>
<p>What is the half-life of this mRNA supposed to be? It seems that 21 days is an unreasonably long time, but then to go to zero at 28 seems also odd... Please provide some explanation, and context for whether the residence of an exogenous mRNA for 21 days is expected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As previously stated, it is our hypothesis that the source of the confusion lies in the fact that we injected mRNA coding for the GFP protein, rather than mRNA tagged with GFP. After a three-week observation period, we did not observe the mRNA, but we observed the GFP protein produced by the mRNA. The time of observation of the reporter proteins expressed by the respective mRNA molecules (mCherry, luciferase, or GFP) ranged from 15 to 21 days. Proteins have very different turnover rates, with half-lives ranging from minutes to days. Half-lives depend on proteins but also on tissues. As explained in the discussion, it has been demonstrated that proteins involved in spermatogenesis exhibit a markedly low turnover rate and this explains the duration of the fluorescent signal.</p>

<p>For the GFP signal to be maintained past 35 days, the plasmid must have integrated into SSCs - and for that to happen, the plasmid would have to cross the blood-testis-barrier... is this expected?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for your observation.</p>
<p>First, as explained above, we do not think that the plasmid has been integrated.</p>
<p>Concerning the blood-testing barrier.  It bears noting that electroporation is a technique that is widely utilized in biotechnology and medicine for the delivery of drugs and the transfer of genes into living cells (Boussetta, Lebovka et al. 2009). This process entails the application of an electric current, which induces the formation of hydrophilic pores in the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane (Kanduser, Miklavcic et al. 2009). The pores remain stable throughout the electroporation process and then close again once it is complete. Consequently, as electroporation destabilizes the cell membrane, it can also destabilize the gap junctions responsible of the blood-testis barrier. This was actually confirmed by several studies, which have observed plasmid transfection beyond the blood-testis barrier with injection into rete testis following electroporation (Muramatsu, Shibata et al. 1997, Kubota, Hayashi et al. 2005, Danner, Kirchhoff et al. 2009, Kanduser, Miklavcic et al. 2009, Michaelis, Sobczak et al. 2014).</p>

<p>Figure 9 - authors should show &gt;1 cell - this is insufficient; also, it's stated it's only in the flagella, but it also appears to be in the head as well. And is this just the principal piece?? And are the authors sure those are elongating vs condensing spermatids? Need to show multiple tubules, at different stages, to make these claims</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have partly answered to this question in the public review; We pastehere  our answer</p>
<p>“We present now new images showing the full seminiferous tubules as requested (see supp fig 6). In this new figure, it is clear that Armc2 is only expressed in spermatids. We have also added in this figure an analysis of the RNA-seq database produced by Gan's team (Gan, Wen et al. 2013), confirming that ArmC2 expression is predominantly expressed at the elongated spermatid stage. This point is now clearly indicated in the text.”</p>
<p>Concerning the localization of the protein in the head, we confirm that the base of the manchette is stained but we have no explanation so far. This point is now indicated in the manuscript.</p>

<p>We are grateful for your feedback. We concede that the quality of the image was not optimal. Consequently, We have replaced it with an alternative.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors)</bold>:</p>
<p>In this study, Vilpreux et al. developed a microinjection/electroporation method in order to transfect RNA into testicular cells. The authors studied several parameters of treated testis and compared the injection of DNA versus RNA. Using the injection of Armc2 RNA into mice with an Armc2 knockout the authors were able to (partly) rescue the fertility phenotype.</p>
<p>Minor points.</p>
<p>Figure 6 + lines 553+554: might it be that the staining pattern primarily on one side of the testis is due to the orientation of the scissor electrode during the electroporation procedure and the migration direction of negatively charged RNA molecules (Figure 6)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Your input is greatly appreciated. We concur that the observed peripheral expression is due to both the electroporation and injection. Accordingly, we have amended the sentence as follows: &quot;The peripheral expression observed was due to the close vicinity of cells to the electrodes, and to a peripheral dispersal of the injected solution, as shown by the distribution of the fluorescent i-particles NIRFiP-180.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Discussion of the safety aspect (lines 601-608): The authors state several times that there are no visible tissue changes after the electroporation procedure. However, in order to claim that this procedure is &quot;safe&quot;, it is necessary to examine the offspring born after microinjection/electroporation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Your input is greatly appreciated. Consequently, the term &quot;safe&quot; has been replaced with &quot;did not perturb spermatogenesis&quot; in accordance with the provided feedback. Your assertion is correct; an examination of the offspring born would be necessary to ascertain the safety of the procedure. Due to the quantity of motile sperm obtained, it was not possible to produce offspring through natural mating. However, novel Armc2-/--rescued sperm samples have been produced and in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) experiments have been conducted. The results demonstrate that the Armc2-/--rescued sperm can successfully fertilize eggs and produce two-cell embryos by IVF and blastocysts by ICSI. These outcomes are visually represented in Figure 12. The development of embryos up to the blastocyst stage is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>The discussion section could be shortened. Lines 632-646 are largely a repetition of the introductory section. In addition, the Dong paper (ref. 25) may be interesting; however, this part could also be shortened (lines 647-676). This reviewer would prefer the authors to focus on the technique (different application sites and applied nucleotides) and proof of concept for (partial) phenotype rescue in the knockout mice.</p>

<p>Your contribution is highly valued. In light of your observations and the latest findings, we have substantially revised the discussion accordingly.</p>

<p>Line 63: oocytes rather than eggs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for your input, but we have decided to retain our current position and to use the term &quot;eggs&quot; rather than &quot;oocytes&quot; in our writing because the definition of an oocyte is a female gametocyte or germ cell involved in reproduction. In other words, oocyte corresponds to a germ cell inside the ovary and after ovulation become an egg.</p>
