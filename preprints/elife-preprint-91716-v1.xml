<title>Abstract</title><p>Orexin signaling in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra promotes locomotion and reward processing, but it is not clear whether dopaminergic cells directly mediate these effects. We show that dopaminergic neurons in these areas mainly express orexin receptor subtype 1 (Ox1R). In contrast, only a minor population in the medial ventral tegmental area express orexin receptor subtype 2 (Ox2R). To analyze the functional role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons, we deleted Ox1R specifically in dopamine transporter-expressing neurons of mice and investigated the functional consequences. The deletion of Ox1R increased locomotor activity and exploration during exposure to novel environments or when intracerebroventricularely injected with orexin. Spontaneous activity in home cages, anxiety, reward processing, and energy metabolism did not change. Positron emission tomography imaging revealed that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons affected distinct neural circuits depending on the stimulation mode. In line with an increase of neural activity in lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) of Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, we found that dopaminergic projections innervate the LPGi in regions where the inhibitory dopamine receptor subtype D2 but not the excitatory D1 subtype resides. These data suggest a crucial regulatory role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons in novelty-induced locomotion and exploration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Orexin neurons are exclusively located in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and adjacent regions in the brain, including perifornical area, and dorsomedial and posterior hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Soya &amp; Sakurai, 2020</xref>). Abundant orexin fibers innervate the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN), which together contain the majority of dopaminergic neurons in humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fadel &amp; Deutch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hrabovszky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Peyron et al., 1998</xref>). There are also some dopaminergic neurons in other brain regions, although not all of these neurons express the dopamine transporter (DAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Koblinger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sharples et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Turiault et al., 2007</xref>). Both the orexin and dopaminergic systems control food intake, locomotor activity, reward processing as well as energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Howe &amp; Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Inutsuka &amp; Yamanaka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Narayanan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Palmiter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tsujino &amp; Sakurai, 2013</xref>). The nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, containing the dopaminergic projections from SN to the dorsal striatum, predominantly regulates action selection and exploratory behaviors, while the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic systems, which consist of the dopaminergic pathways from the VTA to ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex, predominantly regulate motivation, cognition, reward, and aversion signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Roeper, 2013</xref>). Orexin A injection into the VTA increases cocaine- and morphine-related reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mahler et al., 2012</xref>), and intra-SN injection of orexin A induces hyperlocomotion and stereotypic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>). On the other hand, systemic injection of dopamine receptor antagonists reduces orexin A-induced increase of hyperlocomotion, stereotypic and grooming behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>). However, whether the above effects of orexin signaling in the VTA and SN is mediated by dopaminergic or non-dopaminergic cells is not clear yet.</p>
<p>The orexin system consists of the two peptides orexin A and B, which are derived from the precursor, prepro-orexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">de Lecea et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>). Both are endogenous ligands for two G-protein-coupled receptors, orexin receptor subtype 1 (Ox1R), and 2 (Ox2R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>). Orexin A activates both receptors, while orexin B predominantly activates Ox2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>). The mRNA detection by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization revealed the expression of both receptors in VTA and SN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Marcus et al., 2001</xref>). However, the cell-type specific expression of Ox1R and Ox2R in the VTA and SN is not well understood. Electrophysiological studies showed that orexin receptors are present in dopaminergic VTA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baimel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Korotkova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tung et al., 2016</xref>), whereas data for the SN seem controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Korotkova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we aim to map the expression patterns of Ox1R and Ox2R in dopaminergic VTA and SN neurons and investigate the functional role of Ox1R using conditional knockout mice.</p>

<title>Ox1R is the predominant orexin receptor in dopaminergic neurons</title>
<p>To analyze the expression patterns of orexin receptors in dopaminergic VTA and SN neurons, we performed fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (RNAscope) of tyrosine hydroxylase (<italic>Th</italic>), Ox1R (<italic>Hcrtr1</italic>) and Ox2R (<italic>Hcrtr2</italic>) in control (Ox1R flox/flox, DAT wt/wt) mice and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> (Ox1R fl/fl, DAT-Cre tg/wt) mice, from the same breeding crossing mice carrying a loxP-flanked Ox1R-allele (Ox1R fl/fl) with DAT-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ekstrand et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In control mice, Ox1R was expressed in 44 - 58% of dopaminergic neurons in all VTA and SN sub-regions, including the interfascicular (IF), paranigral (PN), parainterfascicular (PIF) and parabrachial (PBP) subnuclei of the VTA and SN. In contrast, Ox2R-positive dopaminergic neurons were mainly located in the medial VTA, including IF, PN, and PIF, with 25 to 42% of dopaminergic neurons expressing the Ox2R (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, C, D, G, H</xref>; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). While the above data were calculated as the mean percentages in the investigated mice, we also calculated the mean dopaminergic neuron numbers, separately for those expressing both or exclusively one of the orexin receptor types. Thus, we could analyze the distribution of Ox1R-, Ox2R-, Ox1R and Ox2R-, and none (of orexin receptors)-expressing dopaminergic neurons in each VTA subregions and SN, which was shown in the schematic illustration with pie charts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). It showed similar results to the above: 47 - 59% of dopaminergic neurons expressed Ox1R in all VTA and SN sub-regions, and Ox2R was mainly expressed by 26 - 41% of dopaminergic neurons in the medial VTA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). 19 - 25% of dopaminergic neurons in the medial VTA expressed both Ox1R and Ox2R (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Of note, abundant Ox1R and Ox2R expression was present in Th-negative neurons in the VTA and SN and neighboring regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, C, D</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).</p>

<p>Since the vast majority of dopaminergic neurons express Ox1R, we focused on the functional analysis of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons. Ox1R was specifically inactivated in dopaminergic (DAT-expressing) neurons of mice (Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup>). In Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, Ox1R expression in dopaminergic neurons was significantly reduced and remained unchanged in Th-negative cells. In contrast, the Ox2R expression patterns remained similar to that in the control mice, indicating the successful and specific knockout of Ox1R in dopaminergic neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, E-H</xref>; Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). To test if orexin activates dopaminergic SN neurons and to functionally validate the deletion of Ox1R signaling, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging on dopaminergic SN neurons from control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice using the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6 expressed in dopaminergic (DAT expressing) neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J-L</xref>, Figure1—figure supplement 2). During the experiments, GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic input was blocked. The orexin A-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were expressed as a percentage of the maximum fluorescence induced by KCl (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K, L</xref>, Figure1—figure supplement 2). Bath-applied 100 nM orexin A significantly increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in dopaminergic SN control neurons (p &lt; 0.0001, n = 71, one-sample t-test). An analysis on the level of individual cells (3 sigma criterion) showed that ∼60% of dopaminergic SN neurons responded to 100 nM orexin A. In dopaminergic SN neurons from Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, 100 nM orexin A had no effect (p = 0.5, n = 86, one-sample t-test) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K, L</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, Ox1R is the main orexin receptor expressed in dopaminergic VTA and SN neurons and mediates their activation by orexin. Therefore, we wanted to determine further the functional role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons. By comparing data from control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, we first identified behaviors modulated by orexin via dopaminergic neurons. In a second step, we used PET imaging to define and map neuronal pathways modulated by orexin..</p>

<title>Ox1R in dopaminergic neurons regulates novelty-induced locomotion and exploration</title>
<p>The behavioral test included an analysis of locomotor behavior, novelty exploration, reward processing, anxiety, and energy homeostasis. Since sex differences exist in orexin- and dopamine-mediated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Durairaja &amp; Fendt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Freeman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lippert et al., 2020</xref>), we analyzed behavioral phenotypes in both males and females. Compared to controls, Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice did not show significant changes in spontaneous locomotor activity in home cages (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). When exposed to a novel open field, both male and female Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice exhibited an increase in locomotion and exploration, with increased traveling distance, ambulating time, and vertical activity in the open field test (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C, E-G</xref>). Female Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice also showed increased stereotypic activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, H</xref>). Furthermore, intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of orexin A (1 nmol) induced a more pronounced increase of locomotor activity in both female and male Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, compared to control mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I-L</xref>).</p>

<p>In a hole-board test, female Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice showed increased nose pokes into the holes in early (1st and 2nd) sessions compared to control mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). This effect disappeared later when mice became familiar with the environment (3rd – 8th session) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). In the novel object recognition test, female Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice spent more time with each of the two identical objects in an open field compared to control mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 2E). One hour later, when female mice were exposed to the same environment except that one object was replaced by a novel object, there was no significant difference between control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice in exploring the novel object (Figure 2—figure supplement 2F). In contrast, male Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice did not behave differently in the hole-board and novel object recognition tests from controls (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, C, D). This indicates that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons is more important for females in novelty-induced exploration, which was independent of novel object discrimination.</p>
<p>The behavioral changes seemed not related to alterations in anxiety, since there were no detectable changes in anxiety-related behaviors in an open field test, dark/light box test or 0-maze test (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Ox1R deletion in dopaminergic neurons did not change energy metabolism and reward processing</title>
<p>The orexin and dopaminergic systems are well known to regulate energy metabolism and reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Howe &amp; Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Inutsuka &amp; Yamanaka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Narayanan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Palmiter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tsujino &amp; Sakurai, 2013</xref>). Therefore, we measured the impact of Ox1R deletion in dopaminergic neurons on metabolism and reward-related behaviors. We found that, compared to control mice, neither male or female Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice showed significant changes in the two-bottle preference test (comparing sweet solution and water drinking), conditional place preference test (comparing cocaine and saline injection) or energy metabolism, including body weight, fat mass, respiratory exchanging ratio, energy expenditure, feeding behaviors, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (Figure 2—figure supplement 4 and 5).</p>

<title>Ox1R in dopaminergic neurons regulates specific neural pathways under different conditions</title>

<title>Dopamine receptors in the dorsal BNST and LPGi</title>
<p>Based on the PET imaging findings, we analyzed the dopaminergic pathways into the dorsal BNST and LPGi that could have been affected by the Ox1R. To this end, we injected Cre-dependent AAV-EYFP bilaterally into the VTA and SN of DAT-Cre (DAT<sup>EYFP</sup>) and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> (DAT<sup>ΔOx1R;</sup> <sup>EYFP</sup>) mice, and discovered dopaminergic projections in the dorsal BNST and LPGi (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), suggesting that VTA and SN dopaminergic neurons could directly modulate neuronal activity in the dorsal BNST and LPGi. To further explore this idea, we assessed expression of Fos and dopamine receptors in the dorsal BNST and LPGi by immunostaining and RNAscope experiments.</p>
<p>Orexin injection (1 nmol, ICV) induced higher c-Fos expression levels in LPGi of male Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice compared to control mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, C</xref>). Only the inhibitory D2 but not excitatory D1 subtypes of dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD1) could be detected in LPGi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref>). Both receptors were detected around the lateral ventricle (as positive control), whereas no signal was detectable in LPGi incubated with negative control probe for mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, G). Th-positive fibers were detected in LPGi but not Gi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kitahama et al., 2000</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that Ox1R deletion in dopaminergic neurons results in the disinhibition of dopaminergic signaling in LPGi.</p>

<p>Orexin injection increased c-Fos expression in the dorsal BNST in control but not in Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>, J). The expression of DRD1 was significantly reduced, and DRD2 expression levels showed a tendency towards a decrease in dorsal BNST of Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K-M</xref>). The Th expression levels were not changed between genotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>, I).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main findings of this study are based on RNAscope and optophysiological experiments. These data show that Ox1R is the most abundant orexin receptor in the midbrain and the only orexin receptor in the SN. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments on SN dopaminergic neurons from control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice functionally confirm these results. They show that orexin-induced activation of SN dopaminergic neurons is exclusively mediated by Ox1R. In addition, the behavioral experiments, PET imaging and Fos analyses provide important evidence of these data’s systemic relevance. They should serve as a basis for developing testable working hypotheses on the systemic physiological role of orexin signaling. Ox1R deficiency in DAT-expressing neurons causes an increase in novelty-induced locomotion and exploration without altering energy metabolism and anxiety- or reward-processing-related behaviors. PET imaging, and Fos and DRD expression analysis provide some indications about the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>Earlier studies showed that orexin-induced activation of VTA dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baimel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Korotkova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tung et al., 2016</xref>). At the end of whole-cell patch clamp recordings, mRNA measurement of the individual recorded VTA neurons revealed fewer Ox2R-than Ox1R-positive dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Korotkova et al., 2003</xref>), which is in line with our findings. While our data clearly show an orexin A-induced activation of dopaminergic SN neurons when GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic input is blocked, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Korotkova et al., 2002</xref>) or <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) studies were controversial about whether orexin A could activate dopaminergic neurons in the SN. Since Ox1R and Ox2R are expressed by non-dopaminergic neurons around the SN, recordings in the absence of synaptic blockers, could detect a mixed direct and indirect orexin-induced response in dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nair-Roberts et al., 2008</xref>). This may partially explain their controversial findings.</p>
<p>We found that Ox1R deficiency in dopaminergic neurons caused an increase in novelty-induced locomotion and exploration, which could indicate elevated arousal levels and hyperactivity. Interestingly, children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have lower orexin A but unaltered orexin B levels in plasma compared to the healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baykal et al., 2019</xref>). ADHD patients exhibit impaired dopaminergic functions, and medicine improving dopaminergic signaling is used to treat ADHD in clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Feldman &amp; Reiff, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Volkow &amp; Swanson, 2013</xref>). Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons might be important to limit novelty-induced arousal and hyperactivity, which are related to task performance and learning capability.</p>
<p>We did not observe significant impact of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons on reward processing. Previous studies reported that Ox1R signaling in VTA promoted reward processing with pharmacological methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tsujino &amp; Sakurai, 2013</xref>). The difference could have resulted from the involvement of non-dopaminergic neurons in VTA or different behavioral models. It would be interesting to identify the effect under other conditions, such as obesity and operant reward learning, in the future.</p>
<p>The PET imaging results suggest that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons affects separate and distinct neuronal circuits, depending on the mode of stimulation. Orexin and dopaminergic systems are known to increase arousal in mammals’ sleep-wake transitions, locomotor activity, and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Furlong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahler et al., 2014</xref>). The orexin system responds to various environmental stimuli, such as stress and novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>). Projection-defined dopaminergic populations in the VTA exhibited different responses to orexin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baimel et al., 2017</xref>). Our PET imaging experiments, without orexin application, indicate that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons modulates brain regions (MPA, Pir, endopiriform claustrum, LSS, SubCV, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sp5, IRt and Gi) important for olfaction, eating, arousal and sleeping (Supplementary table 1).When central orexin levels were increased by orexin injection, Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons regulates HDB, MCPO, Pir, DEn, S1, V2L, V1, BNST, LPGi and M2, which are important for sensation, emotion, exploration, and action selection (Supplementary table 1). In future studies, it would be interesting to investigate the direct and indirect downstream pathways of Ox1R-expressing dopaminergic neurons. Interestingly, in the fruitfly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, it has been shown that the dopaminergic system oppositely regulates sleep-wake arousal and environmentally stimulated arousal, and the authors discussed the possibility to identify similar patterns in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lebestky et al., 2009</xref>). It was further suggested that the dopaminergic system differentially regulates arousal levels under different stimulating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lebestky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lima &amp; Miesenbock, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We found a potential direct impact of dopaminergic neurons on LPGi and BNST. DRD1 and DRD2 in the BNST regulate anxiety, fear, and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Bundel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eiler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Giardino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Krawczyk et al., 2013</xref>). LGPi regulates exploratory behaviors and locomotor speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Takatoh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arber &amp; Costa, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Capelli et al., 2017</xref>). There are few publications on the functional relevance of dopaminergic projections in the LPGi. Future studies would be very interesting to functionally analyze DRD2 signaling in the LPGi and to understand how orexin-interacts with DRD2 signaling.</p>

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title>
<p>Calcium dynamics were measured in dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons using the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6. Experiments were performed on brain slices from 18-19 week-old male control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice. A minimum of 4 weeks separated the GCaMP6 virus injection and the imaging experiments. Animals were kept under standard laboratory conditions, with tap water and chow available ad libitum, on a 12h light/dark cycle. The animals were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (B506; AbbVie Deutschland GmbH and Co KG, Ludwigshafen, Germany) and decapitated. Coronal slices (280 µm) containing SN were cut with a vibration microtome (VT1200 S; Leica, Germany) under cold (4°C), carbogenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), glycerol-based modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (GaCSF). GaCSF contained (in mM): 244 Glycerol, 2.5 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 HEPES, 21 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 5 Glucose adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH.

To reduce GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic input the aCSF contained 10<sup>-4</sup> M PTX (picrotoxin, P1675; Sigma-Aldrich), 5 x 10<sup>-6</sup> M CGP (CGP-54626 hydrochloride, BN0597, Biotrend), 5 x 10<sup>-5</sup> M DL-AP5 (DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, BN0086, Biotrend), and 10<sup>-5</sup> M CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, C127; Sigma-Aldrich).</p>
<p>The imaging setup consisted of a Zeiss AxioCam/MRm CCD camera with a 1388x1040 chip and a Polychromator V (Till Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany) that was coupled via an optical fiber into the Zeiss AxioExaminer upright microscope (Objective W “Plan-Apochromat” 20x/1.0 DIC D=0.17 M27 75mm). The camera and polychromator were controlled by the software Zen pro, including the module ‘Physiology’ (2012 blue edition, Zeiss). The SN neurons were identified according to their anatomical location and expression of the GCaMP6. Calcium signals in GCaMP6 expressing cells were monitored by images acquired at 470 nm excitation wavelengths with 20 ms exposure time at ∼0.2 Hz. The emitted fluorescence was detected through a 500-550 nm bandpass filter (BP525/50), and data were acquired using 4x4 on-chip binning. Images were recorded in arbitrary units (AU) and analyzed as 16-bit grayscale images.</p>
<p>Orexin A (ab120212, Abcam) in the concentration of 100 nM was applied for 8 min. To analyze the orexin effect, we compared the fluorescence measured during 4 min intervals that were recorded immediately before and at the end of the peptide application. This protocol was followed by applying high K<sup>+</sup> concentration saline (40 mM KCl; osmolarity was adjusted by reducing the NaCl concentration accordingly) to elicit the maximal calcium response.</p>
<p>The image analysis was performed offline using Image J (version 1.53a), Igor Pro 6 (WaveMetrics, USA), and Prism 8 (GraphPad, California, USA). After the experiments, regions of interest (ROI) were defined based on the high K<sup>+</sup> saline responses. The mean AU values of the ROIs were calculated in Image J. Time series analysis was performed with Igor Pro 6. To correct for bleaching artifacts, the baseline fluorescence (without orexin application) was fit. The extended fit was subtracted from the raw data. The orexin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were normalized to the high (40 mM) K<sup>+</sup> response. On the single-cell level, a neuron was considered orexin-responsive if the change in fluorescence induced by orexin was 3 times larger than the standard deviation (SD) (3 sigma criterion) of the baseline fluorescence.</p>

Mice always started at the same corner which was between the two fixed objects and were allowed to explore and learn the experimental area and objects. In the 2nd session which started after a 1-h break in the home cage, one of the two identical objects was replaced with a novel object (Lego <sup>○R</sup> Primo brick), and mice were allowed again to explore the environment and objects. The positions of the mouse nose, tail and center were monitored with a video tracking system TSE VideoMot 2. The interaction with a fixed object was identified when the nose was facing the object within a distance of 2 cm.</p>

<title>Conditioned place preference test for cocaine</title>
<p>The test was modified from previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ruud et al., 2019</xref>), and was performed in a polycarbonate box with non-transparent walls. The box was separated into 3 compartments with 2 independent partitions. It contains a left compartment with zebra stripes (white and black) painted on the wall and a rough ground (16.5 x 13.2 x 21.2 cm), a small middle area (7.0 x 13.2 x 21.2 cm), and a right compartment with a white wall and smooth ground. Mouse movement was monitored with TSE VideoMot 2 for 30 min per session, 1 session per day. Mice started from the middle area and had access to both left and right compartments through an opening (4.0 cm x 4.2 cm) in the partition during the habituation and pre-test days (d1-3) and on the test day (d10), and were put into and kept in either the left or right compartment without an opening in the partition during the conditioning phase (d4-9). The preference of the two compartments by nature was analyzed during the pre-test days. At the conditioning phase, on alternative days, mice received i.p. injection of cocaine (5 mg/kg BW) or saline immediately before entering the respective compartments. Cocaine and saline were always paired to the non-preferred and preferred compartments, which were determined by pre-tests, respectively. There was no injection on the habituation, pre-test or test days. The percentage of time spent in the reward-paired compartment was calculated: 100 x time spent in the compartment / (total time - time spent in the middle area). The CPP score was then analyzed using the calculated percentage of time: 100 x (time on the test day – time on pre-test days)/ time on pre-test days.</p>

<title>Sucrose/sucralose preference test</title>
<p>Two-bottle tests were performed with 2 15-ml falcon tubes connected to sippers. Mice were single caged 1 week before the beginning of the experiment. 2 falcon tubes filled with water (side-by-side) replaced the normal water bottle. Water intake was monitored for a week to make sure mice adjusted to drinking from the sippers. When the test started, 2 new sipper tubes of water were used for 2 days of baseline measurement and were then replaced with one containing water and one containing sucrose/sucralose solution for 2 days of preference measurement. Animals received a 0.5%, 1% and 2% (w/v) sucrose solution and 1 mM sucralose solution in sequential. Between the preference tests of different solutions, 2 days of baseline measurement were performed with 2 new sipper tubes of water as a washout. To avoid side bias, the positions of 2 sipper tubes were switched every day, with the sucrose/sucralose tube always starting on the non-preferred position, which was determined by water intake on the day before the preference measurement. Sipper tubes were weighed every day.</p>

<title>ICV cannula implantation and injection</title>
<p>12-wk-old mice received 1 mg/ml of tramadol in drinking water 2 d before the surgeries. On the day of surgery, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and a bolus of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg BW) was given (i. p.) to reduce pain. Brain regions were identified according to the atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Franklin &amp; Paxinos, 2007</xref>). After alignment of the brain in the stereotaxic surgery platform, one small hole was drilled in the skull and the ICV cannula (26 gauge, Plastics One) was immediately implanted (AP: -0.2 mm, ML: +1 mm, DV: -2.4 mm) and fixed to the skull with dental acrylic (Super-Bond C&amp;B). The dummy cannula caps were inserted to close and protect the cannula. Mice received a bolus of meloxicam (5 mg/kg BW, s.c.), and tramadol in drinking water for 3 d after surgeries to relieve pain. BW was checked twice a day. Experiments started at least 1 week later. For injection, the catheter was attached to an injector (Plastics One), which was inserted through the cannula. orexin A (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) was injected slowly at the dose of 1 nmol dissolved in 2 ul of saline. Starting from 5 days before the injection, mice and the dummy cannula caps were handled for acclimation daily. The locomotion activity was measured in a PhenoMaster System (TSE Systems), and mice were acclimated to the system at least 5 days before the test.</p>

<title>PET imaging</title>
<p>PET imaging was performed using an Inveon preclinical PET/CT system (Siemens). Male mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in 65%/35% nitrous oxide/oxygen gas, injected with saline or orexin A and positioned on a dedicated mouse carrier (MEDRES, Germany) carrying two mice. Body temperature was maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5°C by a thermostatically controlled water heating system. For injection of the radiotracer, a catheter consisting of a 30G cannula connected to a polythene tubing (ID = 0.28 mm) was inserted into the tail vein and fixated by a drop of glue. After starting the PET scan, 7- 8 MBq of [18F]FDG in 50-100 µl saline were injected per mouse. Emission data were acquired for 45 minutes. Thereafter, animals were automatically moved into the CT gantry, and a CT scan was performed (180 projections/360°, 200 ms, 80 kV, 500 µA). The CT data were used for attenuation correction of the PET data, and the CT image of the scull was used for image co-registration. Plasma glucose levels were determined from a tail vein blood sample using a standard glucometer (Bayer) after removing the tail vein catheters. PET data were histogrammed in time frames of 12x30s, 3x60s, 3x120s, 7x240s, Fourier rebinned, and images were reconstructed using the MAP-SP algorithm provided by the manufacturer. For co-registration, the imaging analysis software Vinci was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cizek et al., 2004</xref>). Images were co-registered to a 3D mouse brain atlas constructed from the 2D mouse brain atlas published by Paxinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Paxinos et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Kinetic modeling</title>
<p>An image-derived input function was extracted from the PET data of the aorta, which could be identified in the image of the first time frame of each animal. Input function data were corrected for partial volume effect by assuming a standardized volume fraction of 0.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Green et al., 1998</xref>). Parametric images of the [18F]FDG kinetic constants K<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, k<sub>3</sub>, and k<sub>4</sub> were determined by a voxel-by-voxel (voxel size = 0.4 mm x 0.4 mm x 0.8 mm) fitting of data to a two- tissue-compartment kinetic model. K<sub>1</sub> is the constant for transport from blood to tissue, k<sub>2</sub> for transport from tissue to blood, k<sub>3</sub> the constant for phosphorylation of [18F]FDG to [18F]FDG-6-phosphate, and k<sub>4</sub> the constant for dephosphorylation. The ratio of tissue and plasma glucose concentrations (C<sub>E</sub>/C<sub>P</sub>) is a measure for glucose transport and is given by C<sub>E</sub>/C<sub>P</sub> = K<sub>1</sub>/(k<sub>2</sub> + k<sub>3</sub>/0.26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Backes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jais et al., 2016</xref>). Since neuronal activation is accompanied by increased glucose transport and this parameter is less sensitive to changes in plasma glucose level, we use alterations of glucose transport (C<sub>E</sub>/C<sub>P</sub>) as surrogate for alterations in neuronal activation.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical testing was performed by application of a voxel-wise t-test between groups. 3D maps of p- values allow for the identification of regions with significant differences in the parameters. From these regions, we defined volumes of interest (VOIs) and performed additional statistical testing for these VOIs. For presentation only, 3D maps of p-values were re-calculated on a 0.1 mm x 0.1 mm x 0.1 mm grid from the original dataset using trilinear interpolation.</p>

<title>Virus injection</title>
<p>Male mice received 1 mg/ml of tramadol in drinking water 2 d before the surgeries. On the day of surgery, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and a bolus of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg BW) was given (i. p.) to reduce pain. Brain regions were identified according to the atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Franklin &amp; Paxinos, 2007</xref>). After alignment of the brain in the stereotaxic surgery platform, 1 or 4 small holes were drilled in the skull at specific coordinates. The virus, pAAV-Ef1a-DIO EYFP (∼1x10<sup>13</sup> GC/ml, 300 nl, Addgene) was bilaterally injected into VTA and SN of 10 wk old mice, with micropipettes pulled in house with a heating system. The coordinates from Bregma were: anterior-posterior, AP: -3.4 mm; medial-lateral, ML: ±0.5/1.25 mm; dorsal-ventral, DV: -4.2 mm. The GCaMP6 virus (AAV1.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40, ∼4x10<sup>12</sup> GC/ml, 300 nl, Penn Vector Core) was injected to left SN (AP: -3.4 mm, ML: 1.1 mm, DV: -4.2 mm) of 12 wk old mice, to specifically express GCaMP6 in dopaminergic neurons. After virus injection, mice received a bolus of meloxicam (5 mg/kg BW, s.c.), and tramadol in drinking water for 3 d after surgeries to relieve pain. BW was checked twice a day. Experiments started at least 4 weeks later than virus injection to allow virus expression.</p>

<p>This manuscript describes <bold>valuable</bold> findings on the expression pattern of orexin receptors in the midbrain and how manipulating this system influences several behaviors, such as context-induced locomotor activity and exploration. The overall strength of evidence - which includes anatomical, viral manipulation studies, and brain imaging - is <bold>solid</bold> and broadly supports claims in the paper, however, there are several areas in which the conclusions are only partially supported by the data provided. These results have implications for understanding the neural underpinnings of reward and will be of interest to neuroscientists and cognitive scientists with an interest in the neurobiology of reward.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, the role of orexin receptors in dopamine neurons is studied. Considering the importance of both orexin and dopamine signalling in the brain, with critical roles in arousal and drug seeking, this study is important to understand the anatomical and functional interaction between these two neuromodulators. This work suggests that such interaction is direct and occurs at the level of SN and VTA, via the expression of OX1R-type orexin receptors by dopaminergic neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The use of a transgenic line that lacks OX1R in dopamine-transporter-expressing neurons is a strong approach to dissecting the direct role of orexin in modulating dopamine signalling in the brain. The battery of behavioural assays to study this line provides a valuable source of information for researchers interested in the role of orexin-A in animal physiology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The choice of methods to demonstrate the role of orexin in the activation of dopamine neurons is not justified and the quantification methods are not described with enough detail. The representation of results can be dramatically improved and the data can be statistically analysed with more appropriate methods.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript examines the expression of orexin receptors in the midbrain - with a focus on dopamine neurons - and uses several fairly sophisticated manipulation techniques to explore the role of this peptide neurotransmitter in reward-related behaviors. Specifically, in situ hybridization is used to show that dopamine neurons predominantly express the orexin receptor 1 subtype and then go on to delete this receptor in dopamine neurons using a transgenic strategy. Ex vivo calcium imaging of midbrain neurons is used to show that in the absence of this receptor orexin is no longer able to excite dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra.</p>
<p>The authors proceed to use this same model to study the effect of orexin receptor 1 deletion on a series of behavioral tests, namely, novelty-induced locomotion and exploration, anxiety-related behavior, preference for sweet solutions, cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, and energy metabolism. Of these, the most consistent effects are seen in the tests of novelty-induced locomotion and exploration in which the mice with orexin 1 receptor deletion are observed to show greater levels of exploration, relative to wild-type, when placed in a novel environment, an effect that is augmented after icv administration of orexin.</p>
<p>In the final part of the paper, the authors use PET imaging to compare brain-wide activity patterns in the mutant mice compared to wildtype. They find differences in several areas both under control conditions (i.e., after injection of saline) as well as after injection of orexin. They focus on changes in the dorsal bed nucleus of stria terminalis (dBNST) and the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) and perform analysis of the dopaminergic projections to these areas. They provide anatomical evidence that these regions are innervated by dopamine fibers from the midbrain, are activated by orexin in control, but not mutant mice, and that dopamine receptors are present. Thus, they argue these anatomical data support the hypothesis that behavioral effects of orexin receptor 1 deletion in dopamine neurons are due to changes in dopamine signaling in these areas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Understanding how orexin interacts with the dopamine system is an important question and this paper contains several novel findings along these lines. Specifically:</p>
<p>
(1) The distribution of orexin receptor subtypes in VTA and SN is explored thoroughly.</p>
<p>
(2) Use of the genetic model that knocks out a specific orexin receptor subtype from only dopamine neurons is a useful model and helps to narrow down the behavioral significance of this interaction.</p>
<p>
(3) PET studies showing how central administration of orexin evokes dopamine release across the brain is intriguing, especially since two key areas are pursued - BNST and LPGi - where the dopamine projection is not as well described/understood.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The role of the orexin-dopamine interaction is not explored in enough detail. The manuscript presents several related findings, but the combination of anatomy and manipulation studies does not quite tell a cogent story. Ideally, one would like to see the authors focus on a specific behavioral parameter and show that one of their final target areas (dBNST or LPGi) was responsible or at least correlated with this behavioral readout. In addition, some more discussion on what the results tell us about orexin signaling to dopamine neurons under normal physiological conditions would be very useful. For example, what is the relevance of the orexin-dopamine interaction blunting novelty-induced locomotion under wildtype conditions?</p>
<p>In some places in the Results, insufficient explanation and reporting is provided. For example, when reporting the behavioral effects of the Ox1 deletion in two bottle preference, it is stated that &quot;[mutant] mice showed significant changes...&quot; without stating the direction in which preference was affected.</p>
<p>The cocaine CPP results are difficult to interpret because it is unclear whether any of the control mice developed a CPP preference. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that the knockout animals were unaffected by drug reward learning. Similarly, the sucrose/sucralose preference scores are also difficult to interpret because no test of preference vs. water is performed (although the data appear to show that there is a preference at least at higher concentrations, it has not been tested).</p>
