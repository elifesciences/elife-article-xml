<title>Abstract</title><p>Copious expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is associated with poor survival in many types of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia. We observed that a specific acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) cell line (6133) derived from RBM15-MKL1 knock-in mice exhibited heterogeneity in Prmt1 expression levels. Interestingly, only a subpopulation of 6133 cells expressing high levels of Prmt1 caused leukemia when transplanted into congenic mice. The PRMT1 inhibitor, MS023, effectively cured this PRMT1-driven leukemia. Seahorse analysis revealed that PRMT1 increased the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and decreased the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Consistently, PRMT1 accelerated glucose consumption and led to the accumulation of lactic acid in the leukemia cells. The metabolomic analysis supported that PRMT1 stimulated the intracellular accumulation of lipids, which was further validated by FACS analysis with BODIPY 493/503. In line with fatty acid accumulation, PRMT1 downregulated the protein level of CPT1A, which is involved in the rate-limiting step of fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, administering the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) delayed AMKL progression and promoted cell differentiation. Ectopic expression of Cpt1a rescued the proliferation of 6133 cells ectopically expressing PRMT1 in the glucose-minus medium. In conclusion, PRMT1 upregulates glycolysis and downregulates fatty acid oxidation to enhance the proliferation capability of AMKL cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells requires metabolic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kreitz et al., 2019</xref>). AML cells rely heavily on glucose for unchecked proliferation. Using <sup>18</sup>F-Fluoro-deoxy-Glucose (<sup>18</sup>FDG) as a marker, Cunningham et al. detected high glucose uptake in the bone marrow of AML patients, and pyruvate and 2-hydroxy-glutarate concentrations negatively correlate with patient survival rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Dysregulated metabolic enzyme and mitochondrial activities have been reported to be the causes of chemoresistance to AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jones et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lagadinou et al., 2013</xref>) as well as solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Faubert et al., 2020</xref>). Metabolites such as acetyl-CoA, α-ketoglutarate, vitamin C (aka ascorbic acid), and <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) are cofactors for histone and DNA modifications. Thus, metabolic reprogramming transforms the epigenetic landscape in leukemia cells. Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases, IDH1/2, produce 2-hydroxyl-glutarate (2-HG) instead of α-ketoglutarate. 2-HG inhibits demethylases that erase methylation marks on histones and DNA and hydroxylases such as FIH (factor inhibiting HIF) in leukemia and glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">L et al., 2017</xref>). However, mutations of metabolic enzymes in cancer are relatively rare. Usually, metabolic reprogramming is achieved mainly by expressing oncogenic transcription factors such as p53 mutants, HIF1, and FOXOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Choi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Humpton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Laplante and Sabatini, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Schwartzenberg-Bar-Yoseph et al., 2004</xref>). Dysregulation of signaling pathways, such as KRAS mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Faubert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ferrer et al., 2014</xref>) and upregulation of the mTOR pathway during leukemogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kalaitzidis et al., 2012</xref>), also alter metabolic pathways in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, how epigenetic regulators involved in leukemogenesis regulate metabolic reprogramming still needs more research.</p>
<p>The protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family has nine members, with PRMT1 responsible for most of the enzymatic activity in mammalian cells. PRMT1 is an epigenetic regulator via methylation of histone H4 and transcription factor RUNX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). The oncogenic roles of PRMT1 have been demonstrated in many types of solid cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avasarala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baldwin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cho et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cho et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guendel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Karkhanis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Le Romancer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yang and Bedford, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yoshimatsu et al., 2011</xref>). The importance of PRMT1 in leukemia has been shown in FLT3-ITD, AML1-ETO, and MLL-EEN-associated acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zou et al., 2012</xref>). Targeting PRMT1 is effective in treating leukemia with splicing factor mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fong et al., 2019</xref>). PRMT1 expression levels are low in quiescent hematopoietic stem cells but are elevated in stressed HSCs. Furthermore, the upregulation of PRMT1 enhances glycolysis through the methylation of PFKFB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Watanuki et al., 2024</xref>). Yet, how PRMT1 is involved in cancer metabolic reprogramming has not been explored, albeit the known role of PRMT1 in metabolic regulation in model organisms.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation of Hmt1 (PRMT1 ortholog in yeast) controls cell cycle progression in response to nutrition signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Butcher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Messier et al., 2013</xref>). PRMT1 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans and Trypanosoma</italic> is responsible for methylation of proteins inside mitochondria, although PRMT1 is not inside mitochondria, while PRMT1-null worms have dysfunctional mitochondria. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fisk and Read, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sha et al., 2016</xref>). In Trypanosomes, PRMT1 promotes glycolysis and is required for virulent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kafkova et al., 2018</xref>). When quiescent yeast re-entered fresh glucose-rich medium, Hmt1 the yeast PRMT1 homolog is among nearly 240 genes that were induced (by ≥5-fold) in the presence of fermentable sugars like glucose, suggesting its crucial role in supporting cells under rapid growth and fermentation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brejning et al., 2003</xref>-03-11). When transitioning from glucose to non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol, Hmt1 is downregulated, implying that is likely repressed to facilitate this vital adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Roberts and Hudson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is a subtype of AML with leukemia cells stuck at the differentiation stage of immature megakaryocytes. It is a rare leukemia often associated with Down syndrome. In cases not related to Down syndrome, AMKL is caused by chromosomal translocations. Although AMKL can occur in adults, it occurs more commonly in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Athale et al., 2001</xref>). Chromosomal translocation t(1;22) that generates the RBM15-MKL1 fusion protein was discovered in childhood AMKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mercher et al., 2001</xref>). RBM15-MKL1 is a fatal disease without available targeted therapy.</p>
<p>Copious expression of PRMT1 is a poor prognostic marker for AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, PRMT1 is expressed at an even higher level in AMKL than in other types of AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Constitutive expression of PRMT1 blocks terminal MK differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), while inhibition of PRMT1 activity promotes terminal MK differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Su et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that inhibiting PRMT1 activity could be a pro-differentiation therapy for AMKL. A leukemia cell line called 6133 is derived from Rbm15-MKL1 knock-in mice. When transplanted, 6133 cells can cause AMKL with low penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mercher et al., 2009</xref>). Using this leukemia mouse model, we report here that the elevated level of PRMT1 maintains the leukemic cells via upregulation of glycolysis and that leukemia cells with high PRMT1 expression are vulnerable to the inhibition of fatty acid metabolic pathways.</p>

<title>PRMT1 promotes the progression of RBM15-MKL1-initiated leukemia</title>
<p>The 6133 cells can be transplanted into recipient mice to induce low penetrant leukemia with symptoms closely recapitulating human AMKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mercher et al., 2009</xref>). To find additional factors needed to transform 6133 cells fully, we have reported a fluorescent probe (E84) that can be used to sort live cells according to PRMT1 protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Su et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). We sorted 6133 cells into two populations for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) according to E84 staining intensities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). All mice that received 6133 cells expressing higher levels of PRMT1 (6133/PRMT1 cells) developed leukemia and died rapidly, while 6133 cells expressing lower levels of PRMT1 did not develop leukemia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistently, a higher percentage of leukemia cells were detected in bone marrow and peripheral blood in recipient mice transplanted with E84-high (i.e., density staining of E84) 6133 cells according to FACS analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Given that E84-high cells can initiate leukemia, we introduced PRMT1 into 6133 cells (aka 6133/PRMT1 cells) using a lentivirus vector. Overexpression of PRMT1 rendered 6133/PRMT1 cells to increase in a cytokine-independent fashion in cell culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 D</xref>), and recipient mice transplanted with 6133/PRMT1 cells developed leukemia and died within 25 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 E</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Although PRMT1-mediated methylation triggers the degradation of RBM15, PRMT1 overexpression does not affect the stability of the RBM15-MKL1 fusion (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2 A</xref>&amp;<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). The leukemic mice displayed splenomegaly. Intriguingly, the leukemia mice were paralyzed with observable spinal bleeding during dissection, although the bone density was still normal (data not shown). In a xenograft model with human RBM15-MKL1 leukemia cells, leukemia also caused spinal bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Thiollier et al., 2012</xref>). Collectively, PRMT1 is essential for the initiation of overt AMKL expressing the RBM15-MKL1 fusion protein, and leukemia initiated by 6133/PRMT1 cells in mice resembles several characteristics of human AMKL.</p>

<title>MS023, a PRMT1 inhibitor, cures mice with Rbm15-MKL1-initiated leukemia</title>
<p>MS023 was reported to be a potent inhibitor of Type-I PRMTs including PRMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Su et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, MS023 has been tested safe on mice at 80 mg/kg of body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Su et al., 2021</xref>). The 6133/PRMT1 cells were intravenously injected into sub-lethally irradiated recipient mice. A week after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we injected MS023 intraperitoneally every other day for a month. Notably, while the untreated group of mice exhibited rapid illness and developed moribund symptoms, such as severe weight loss and rear limb paralysis, within 30 days, the majority of mice treated with MS023 remained healthy and symptom-free. Treatment with MS023 significantly alleviated the leukemia burden, as shown by FACS analysis of the percentages of leukemia cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). We also validated that the bone marrow cells from MS023-treated mice had reduced global levels of arginine methylation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1C</xref>). Leukemia-associated splenomegaly was also alleviated in MS023-treated mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the MS023-treated group was effectively cured after 120 days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), with only residual leukemia cells detected in bone marrow and peripheral blood (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 D</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Expression of c-MPLW515L mutant in 6133 cells can render the 6133 cells fully penetrant for leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mercher et al., 2009</xref>), and in vitro treatment with MS023 reduced their proliferation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Subsequently, we transplanted 6133/cMPLW515L cells into congenic mice. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2 G-I</xref> illustrate that MS023 also cures leukemia, suggesting that PRMT1 could be a valid target for leukemia or myeloid proliferative diseases driven by c-MPLW515L. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PRMT1 is critical for sustaining Rbm15-MKL1-initiated leukemia in mice, and pharmacological targeting of PRMT1 represents an effective strategy for treating leukemia.</p>

<title>PRMT1 promotes glycolysis in leukemia cells</title>
<p>Given that the role of PRMT1 in metabolic regulation has been well-documented, we then investigated whether PRMT1 is involved in transforming 6133 cells through metabolic reprogramming. To assess this, we conducted Seahorse assays to measure the changes in ECAR (extracellular acidification rate) in 6133/PRMT1 cells compared to the parental 6133 cells. The ECAR curve of 6133/PRMT1 cells was elevated compared to that of 6133 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, the addition of FCCP, which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from the TCA cycle, did not increase acidification levels. Similarly, antimycin did not cause a significant drop in acid concentration. Remarkably, we treated 6133 cells with MS023 overnight prior to Seahorse assays and observed a reduction in ECAR levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These findings suggest that PRMT1 is responsible for the observed increase in acidification. In this experiment, glycolysis contributes the most to acidification in the 6133 leukemia cells, as the addition of mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors only moderately reduces acidification levels according to the principles outlined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Divakaruni et al., 2014</xref>). Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), the final key enzyme in glycolysis that converts pyruvate to lactate for NAD+ regeneration, was found to be influenced by PRMT1 overexpression. Specifically, PRMT1 overexpression stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of LDHA, thereby activating its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fan et al., 2011</xref>) despite an overall decrease in LDHA levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistently, when we directly measured the intracellular and extracellular lactate levels in 6133 and 6133/PRMT1 cells, we observed that 6133/PRMT1 cells not only released more lactate into the medium but also exhibited higher intracellular lactate levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We concluded that PRMT1 promotes cellular glycolysis and lactate production, which predominantly contributes to the observed increase in acidification.</p>

<title>PRMT1 reduces oxygen consumption in mitochondria</title>
<p>The Seahorse assays have demonstrated that the cellular OCR (oxygen consumption rate) was reduced in 6133/PRMT1 cells. Additionally, it was observed that these cells had a limited capacity for reserve respiration, as the maximum respiration level was nearly identical to the basal OCAR level, regardless of the expression levels of PRMT1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Conversely, when the 6133/PRMT1 cells were pre-treated with MS023 overnight before the Seahorse assays, there was an increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption compared to the non-treated controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). These findings further support the notion that PRMT1 plays a role in mediating metabolic reprogramming by enhancing glycolysis and reducing mitochondrial oxygen consumption.</p>

<p>We demonstrated that PRMT1 increases the number of mitochondria in MEG-01 cells, a human acute megakaryocytic leukemia cell line, by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In this experiment, FACS analysis with MitoTracker staining (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and real-time PCR analysis of mitochondrial DNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) further validated that PRMT1 upregulated mitochondrial biogenesis in 6133 cells. H2DCFDA staining showed that PRMT1 elevated global ROS levels in 6133 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Interestingly, when we performed Mito-Sox staining for ROS levels within mitochondria, we found reduced levels of ROS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). These data imply that most of the ROS detected by H2DCFA may be generated from the cytoplasm rather than from mitochondria, which aligns with the Seahorse data indicating that oxidation consumption in mitochondria is reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we conducted TMRE staining for mitochondrial membrane potential. 6133/PRMT1 cells exhibited reduced staining, suggesting that PRMT1 decreases membrane potential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). This result also cross-validated the Seahorse findings that PRMT1 reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption.</p>
<p>Since the cytoplasmic ROS level significantly increased with PRMT1 expression, we measured the ratios of two redox pairs: glutathione and NADP<sup>+</sup>. Interestingly, activation of PRMT1 raised the ratios of both GSH/GSSG and NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup>. Given the crucial roles of GSH and NADPH in biomass synthesis, the upregulation of PRMT1 may promote anabolism, consistent with PRMT1’s role in supporting cell proliferation.</p>

<title>Metabolomic analysis of PRMT1-induced metabolic changes</title>
<p>To further probe the complexity of PRMT1-mediated metabolic reprogramming, we established a new 6133 cell line that can conditionally express PRMT1 upon adding doxycycline to the medium. We compared the metabolomic status of 6133 cells before and after 12 hours of PRMT1 induction. The cells were grown in standard RPMI1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, with high concentrations of glucose and essential amino acids for 12-hour growth. We repeated the metabolomic analysis five times. Principle component analysis (PCA) indicated that PRMT1 caused a significant shift in metabolite profiles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>, see supplemental table 1). Notably, PRMT1 activation led to increased ATP production and the accumulation of succinyl-CoA, alanine, serine, and short-chain fatty acids and depletion of SAM, aspartic acid, nicotinamide, succinyl-homoserine, oxidized glutathione (which is consistent with the increased ratio of GSH/GSSG shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>), and alpha-ketoglutarate (aka oxoglutaric acid) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These findings suggest that the beta-oxidation of fatty acids may be impaired, leading to the accumulation of fatty acids such as docosadiencic acid, caproic acid and suberic acid, while the levels of palmitoyl-carnitine are reduced. Furthermore, the reduced levels of alpha-ketoglutarate indicate potential alterations in the TCA cycle and glutaminolysis. Overall, our data highlights the profound metabolic changes induced by PRMT1, particularly in amino acid biosynthesis, one-carbon metabolism as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> generated by the metaboAnalyst software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pang et al., 2024</xref>).</p>

<title>PRMT1-transformed leukemia cells are highly dependent on glucose consumption</title>
<p>After determining that glycolysis was enhanced in PRMT1-overexpressing cells, we performed glucose colorimetric assays to measure glucose concentrations in the cell culture medium when the 6133 and 6133/PRMT1 cells grew exponentially. A more significant reduction of glucose in 6133/PRMT1 cells was observed compared to parental 6133 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that the elevated glucose consumption via glycolysis is due to PRMT1 upregulation. Next, we cultured the cells in both glucose-containing and glucose-depleted media. Cell viability assays showed that 6133/PRMT1 cells grew more slowly in a glucose-free medium, while parental cells were less affected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Accordingly, we used 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a glucose analog that competes with glucose in glycolysis. The proliferation of 6133/PRMT1 cells was notably inhibited by 2-DG, while the proliferation of 6133 cells was barely affected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These results are consistent with Seahorse analysis indicating that 6133/PRMT1 cells rely on glycolysis for growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Next, we tested whether blocking glucose could impede AMKL progression in mice. Four days after the transplantation of the 6133/PRMT1 cells, we administered 2-DG to the mice at a dosage of 0.5g/Kg body weight every other day for a month. 2-DG treatment significantly delayed disease progression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).

<title>Targeting fatty acid metabolic pathways for leukemia therapy</title>
<p>Rapidly growing cancer cells need de novo synthesis of fatty acids to meet the demand for building cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Menendez and Lupu, 2007</xref>). De novo fatty acid synthesis uses acetyl-CoA generated from fatty acid oxidation. Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation has been shown to kill leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Samudio et al., 2010</xref>). Carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase (CPT1A) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of fatty acid oxidation by transporting fatty acids across the mitochondrial outer membrane. RBM15 binds to the 3’ UTR of CPT1A mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, PRMT1 regulates the stability of the RBM15 protein. We demonstrated that the expression of both isoforms of PRMT1 lowered the mRNA levels of CPT1A (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). We then performed Western blotting and confirmed that the protein level of CPT1A was correspondingly reduced in 6133 cell lines ectopically expressing PRMT1 isoforms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). The downregulation of CPT1A leads to reduced consumption of long-chain fatty acids. We consistently observed greater lipid accumulation in 6133/PRMT1 cells than in 6133 cells through FACS analysis with a lipid-binding fluorescent dye i.e. BODIPY 493/503 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Metabolomic analysis also indicated the accumulation of fatty acids such as suberic acid and caproic acid, alongside a decrease in palmitoyl-carnitine, which is a product of CPT1A (see supplemental table 1 for metabolomic data). We then treated leukemia cells with etomoxir, which inhibits CPT1A enzymatic activity. The 6133/PRMT1 cells were more sensitive to etomoxir than the 6133 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Orlistat, a FASN inhibitor, also suppressed the proliferation of 6133/PRMT1 cells more effectively than that of 6133 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). While CPT1A is responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids, short-chain fatty acids can be directly transported to mitochondria. We added acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the form of triglycerides to a glucose-free medium. Strikingly, all three forms of short-chain fatty acids supported the proliferation of 6133/PRMT1 cells better than the parental 6133 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). The data suggest that leukemia cells with elevated levels of PRMT1 expression can utilize short-chain fatty acids to compensate for their need for glucose. We then used a lentivirus to express CPT1A in 6133/PRMT1 cells ectopically. CPT1A wild type and mutant (H473A) that does not have succinylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kurmi et al., 2018</xref>) dampens the proliferation rates of 6133/PRMT1 cells cultured under standard conditions. Intriguingly, the enzymatically inactive CPT1A mutant (G710E) inhibits the proliferation of the 6133/PRMT1 cells, suggesting that the 6133 cells still rely on fatty acid oxidation for de novo lipid synthesis necessary for proliferation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Taken together, we demonstrated that although PRMT1 downregulates fatty acid oxidation as an energy source, PRMT1 upregulates using short-chain fatty acids as an alternative energy source for mitochondria.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This report demonstrates that PRMT1 promotes glycolysis and reprograms mitochondrial metabolism to support leukemia progression in mice with RBM15-MKL1-initiated leukemia. Notably, only leukemia cells with elevated levels of PRMT1 can be transplanted to initiate leukemia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This indicates that PRMT1 assists leukemia cells in adapting to the bone marrow niche necessary for leukemia initiation, suggesting that leukemia stem cells likely express high levels of PRMT1. Moreover, since normal hematopoietic stem cells express low levels of PRMT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Su et al., 2018</xref>), targeting this protein may help protect normal hematopoietic stem cells from damage. Considering the crucial role of PRMT1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with various gene mutations—including RBM15-MKL1, FLT3-ITD, MLL-EEN, and AML1-ETO fusions—as well as mutations in splicing factor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fong et al., 2019</xref>), PRMT1-mediated metabolic reprogramming may be significant for the previously mentioned AML.</p>
<p>The potential mechanism of PRMT1-mediated metabolic reprogramming can be learned from published data. PRMT1 methylates phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) at arginine 206, which enhances its phosphorylation at serine 203 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, PRMT1 methylates phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) at arginine 236, activating the enzyme and stimulating the synthesis of serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yamamoto et al., 2024</xref>). Furthermore, PRMT1-mediated methylation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) prevents its localization in the nucleus of LPS-activated macrophages, protecting these macrophages from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cho et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, these findings underscore PRMT1’s significant role in boosting glycolytic activity and tumorigenesis through the targeted methylation of glycolytic enzymes.</p>
<p>RBM15 plays a crucial role in regulating the homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells and the differentiation of megakaryocytes. Our previous paper in eLife demonstrated that RBM15 is methylated by PRMT1, and this modification affects RBM15-mediated RNA splicing of key transcription factors, including RUNX1, GATA1, TAL1, and TPOR (also known as c-mpl), which are essential for megakaryocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, we found that nearly 50% of RBM15 targets are metabolic enzymes, with their mRNAs’ 3’ UTR regions bound by RBM15. Among these targets, CPT1A mRNA stands out as particularly significant. Our metabolomic analysis indicated that overexpression of PRMT1 leads to an accumulation of intracellular lipids (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistently, we also observed that PRMT1 downregulates the CPT1A protein level (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A,B</xref>) and detected lipid accumulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>) using FACS analysis. Our unpublished data further validate that PRMT1 downregulates CPT1A in platelets expressing high levels of PRMT1.</p>
<p>Although PRMT1 reduces oxygen consumption and membrane potential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), it does not fully inhibit the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or the electron transport chain. Cells expressing PRMT1 (designated as 6133/PRMT1) continue to proliferate using galactose, which does not produce ATP via glycolysis in glucose-deficient medium. Moreover, the 6133/PRMT1 cells can thrive on glycerol combined with substrates such as acetate (in the form of triacetin), propionate (tripropionin), and butyrate (tributyrin), indicating that mitochondria can still utilize short-chain fatty acids (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). These are converted into acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and butyryl-CoA, which can then enter the TCA cycle independently of CPT1A. This adaptation allows 6133/PRMT1 cells to consume short-chain fatty acids and non-fermentable carbon sources like glycerol and galactose in glucose-deficient medium when CPT1A is downregulated. RBM15 also binds to several mRNAs that encode enzymes involved in glycolysis, such as LDHA and HK1. Although we did not detect increased protein expression of HK1 and LDHA, we observed an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) by PRMT1. Phosphorylation is known to activate LDHA, indicating that PRMT1 upregulation enhances glycolytic flux. The decreased NADP/NADPH ratio and aspartate concentration suggest a metabolic shift favoring glycolysis in proliferating cells.</p>
<p>The accumulation of succinate and the corresponding decrease in aspartate and alpha-ketoglutarate levels, as demonstrated by PRMT1 overexpression, is consistent with findings from earlier research involving T cells that have undergone succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). This alteration inhibits α–KG–dependent dioxygenases, including Jumonji-domain histone demethylases and DNA demethylases (such as TET), vital for the demethylation of histones and DNA. As a result, this affects chromatin accessibility and influences gene expression patterns. We propose that changes in SDH activity may allow PRMT1 to modify the epigenetic landscapes of mammalian cells indirectly in response to metabolic shifts. Given the succinate accumulation, we expect that the HIF1α complex will be stabilized, leading to pseudohypoxia phenotypes in cells with elevated PRMT1 expression, akin to those seen in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, our findings indicate that PRMT1 expression is significantly increased in samples from MDS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Su et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>PRMT1-mediated metabolic reprogramming indicates that mitochondria in PRMT1-overexpressing cancer cells primarily function to produce biosynthetic precursors instead of generating oxidative ATP. Our findings further support that PRMT1 overexpression promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, as previously reported and validated here (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). However, the increase in mitochondrial quantity did not correlate with increased oxygen consumption. Instead, we observed lower mitochondrial ROS levels per cell, consistent with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased oxygen consumption. Mitochondria play a crucial role in cancer cell metabolism, functioning not only as powerhouses for ATP production but also as central hubs for metabolic intermediates vital for biomass synthesis. While many cancer cells display a glycolytic phenotype, known as the Warburg effect, mitochondria remain essential for sustaining cell proliferation.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, although mitochondrial ROS levels were reduced, we detected an overall increase in cytoplasmic ROS. Since lipid accumulation can stimulate ROS generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), we speculate that intracellular lipid accumulation due to PRMT1 overexpression may drive the increased cytoplasmic ROS levels we observed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. The regulation of oxidative stress by PRMT1 appears to involve a complex interplay between mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and glycolytic flux. In cancer cells with high PRMT1 expression, mitochondria may function as biosynthetic factories, channeling metabolic intermediates for nucleotide, amino acid, and lipid synthesis rather than oxidative phosphorylation. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which PRMT1 regulates metabolic pathways and redox homeostasis may open new therapeutic avenues for targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this study is that we used only one mouse leukemia cell line for the metabolic investigation. In our unpublished data, we have examined the expression of CPT1A in megakaryocytes and platelets derived from Pf4-cre PRMT1 transgenic mice. Additionally, we validated that PRMT1 downregulated CPT1A in the megakaryocyte lineages. Considering that RBM15 and PRMT1 are expressed in mammalian cells across different species, we suggest that the PRMT1-mediated metabolic programming is conserved.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>PRMT1 overexpression is linked to poor survival in cancers, including acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL). This manuscript describes the important role of PRMT1 in the metabolic reprograming in AMKL. In a PRMT1-driven AMKL model, only cells with high PRMT1 expression induced leukemia, which was effectively treated with the PRMT1 inhibitor MS023. PRMT1 increased glycolysis, leading to elevated glucose consumption, lactic acid accumulation, and lipid buildup while downregulating CPT1A, a key regulator of fatty acid oxidation. Treatment with 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) delayed leukemia progression and induced cell differentiation, while CPT1A overexpression rescued cell proliferation under glucose deprivation. Thus, PRMT1 enhances AMKL cell proliferation by promoting glycolysis and suppressing fatty acid oxidation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study highlights the clinical relevance of PRMT1 overexpression with AMKL, identifying it as a promising therapeutic target. A key novel finding is the discovery that only AMKL cells with high PRMT1 expression drive leukemogenesis, and this PRMT1-driven leukemia can be effectively treated with the PRMT1 inhibitor MS023. The work provides significant metabolic insights, showing that PRMT1 enhances glycolysis, suppresses fatty acid oxidation, downregulates CPT1A, and promotes lipid accumulation, which collectively drive leukemia cell proliferation. The successful use of the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) to delay AMKL progression and induce cell differentiation underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting PRMT1-related metabolic pathways. Furthermore, the rescue experiment with ectopic Cpt1a expression strengthens the mechanistic link between PRMT1 and metabolic reprogramming. The study employs robust methodologies, including Seahorse analysis, metabolomics, FACS analysis, and in vivo transplantation models, providing comprehensive and well-supported findings. Overall, this work not only deepens our understanding of PRMT1's role in leukemia progression but also opens new avenues for targeting metabolic pathways in cancer therapy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript explores the role of PRMT1 in AMKL, highlighting its overexpression as a driver of metabolic reprogramming. PRMT1 overexpression enhances the glycolytic phenotype and extracellular acidification by increasing lactate production in AMKL cells. Treatment with the PRMT1 inhibitor MS023 significantly reduces AMKL cell viability and improves survival in tumor-bearing mice. Intriguingly, PRMT1 overexpression also increases mitochondrial number and mtDNA content. High PRMT1-expressing cells demonstrate the ability to utilize alternative energy sources dependent on mitochondrial energetics, in contrast to parental cells with lower PRMT1 levels.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a conceptually novel and important finding as PRMT1 has never been shown to enhance glycolysis in AMKL, and provides a novel point of therapeutic intervention for AMKL.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the strength in our manuscript  as quote: “Overall, this work not only deepens our understanding of PRMT1's role in leukemia progression but also opens new avenues for targeting metabolic pathways in cancer therapy.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness :</p>
<p>(1) The findings rely heavily on a single AMKL cell line, with no validation in patient-derived samples to confirm clinical relevance or even another type of leukemia line. Adding the discussion of PRMT1's role in other leukemia types will increase the impact of this work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We mentioned in the introduction that PRMT1 is known to be the driver for leukemia with diverse types of mutations. In a related paper published in Cell Reports (Su et al. 2021), we demonstrated that PRMT1 is upregulated in MDS myeloid dysplasia syndrome patient samples and that the inhibition of PRMT1 promotes megakaryocytic differentiation of a few MDS samples. AMKL is very rare. Via Children’s Oncology group consortium, we have obtained five AMKL samples with Down’s syndrome and AMKL with RBM15-MKL1 translocation out of 32 samples in the bank over the last 20 years. Interestingly, these patient samples also contain trisomy 19. As PRMT1 is localized on chromosome 19, we speculate that PRMT1 is the significant driver for AMKL leukemia, although we have very limited genetic evidence. However, these human frozen samples derived from peripheral blood cannot be grown in a cell culture system. Although we did not perform metabolic analysis for other AMKL cell lines, we did validate in our unpublished studies that PRMT1 drives down CPT1A expression in normal bone marrow cells and platelets in mice and in human leukemia cell line called MEG-01, which can be differentiated into megakaryocytes upon PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) treatment. Therefore, we expect that the PRMT1-mediated metabolic reprogramming we described here should apply to other types of hematological malignancies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The observed heterogeneity in Prmt1 expression is noted but not further investigated, leaving gaps in understanding its broader implications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The expression level of PRMT1 is heterogeneous within leukemia cell populations, making it intriguing to study. We can sort the cells based on high versus low PRMT1 expression using a fluorescent dye called E84. However, we have not conducted transcriptome analysis on these two populations, mainly due to resource constraints. Theoretically, the E84 high-expression population may transiently utilize glucose more efficiently, as these cells do not ectopically express PRMT1. Therefore, when nutrient levels decline, these cells might switch to the low PRMT1 expression population. It will be interesting to see whether endogenous leukemia cells transiently expressing high levels of PRMT1 take advantage of their efficient usage of glucose and thus adapt to the niche environment successfully, as we observed in the Figure 1. I agree that this would be an interesting direction to pursue in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Some figures and figure legends didn't include important details or had not matching information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out these mistakes. Now we have corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Some wording is not accurate, such as line 80 &quot;the elevated level of PRMT1 maintains the leukemic stem cells&quot;, the study is using the cell line, not leukemia stem cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Leukemic stem cells are often referred to as cells that can initiate leukemia when transplanted into recipient mice, a concept first proposed by John Dick. In this study, we found that even the 6133 cell line displays heterogeneity in terms of PRMT1 expression levels. We identified a subgroup of 6133 cells as leukemia stem cells due to their ability to initiate leukemia.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In the disease model, histopathology of blood, spleen, and BM should be shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not conduct histopathology analysis. 6133 cells associated histopathology has been published in Mercher et al JCI 2009 and a recent preprint by Diane Krause’s group.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Can MS023 treatment reverse the metabolic changes in PRMT1 overexpression AMKL cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, We demonstrated in figure 4 in the seahorse assays that prmt1 inhibitor can increase the oxygen consumption.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be helpful to provide a summary graph at the end of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we now provide a graphic abstract.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for finding the manuscript novel and important.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript lacks detailed molecular mechanisms underlying PRMT1 overexpression, particularly its role in enhancing survival and metabolic reprogramming via upregulated glycolysis and diminished oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). The findings primarily report phenomena without exploring the reasons behind these changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the introduction, we highlighted that numerous studies have demonstrated how PMT1 directly interacts with several key enzymes involved in glycolysis. These studies provide a mechanism for the observed upregulation of PMT1 in leukemia. Additionally, our previous research published in eLife 2015 {Zhang, 2015 #5031} demonstrated that PRMT1 methylates the RNA-binding protein RBM15, which can bind to the 3' UTR of mRNAs encoding various metabolic enzymes. Therefore, we propose that PMT1 may also regulate metabolism indirectly through the RBM15 protein.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The article shows that PRMT1 overexpression leads to augmented glycolysis and low reliance on the OxPhos. However, the manuscript also shows that PMRT1 overexpression leads to increased mitochondrial number and mitochondrial DNA content and has an elevated NADPH/NAD+ ratio. Further, these overexpressing cells have the ability to better survive on alternative energy sources in the absence of glucose compared to low PMRT1-expressing parental cells. Surprisingly, the seashores assay in PRMT1 overexpressing cells showed no further enhancement in the ECAR after adding mitochondrial decoupler FCCP, indicating the truncated mitochondrial energetics. These results are contradicting and need a more detailed explanation in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have explained the metabolic changes in more detail now. Increasing mitochondria number is not equivalent to increasing fatty acid oxidation and oxygen consumption, as the mitochondria have many other functions. PRMT1 only downregulates CPT1A, which is a rate-limiting step for long-chain fatty acid oxidation. The data suggest that PRMT1 promotes the biogenesis of mitochondria maybe via PGC1alpha as published by Stallcup’s group. The seahorse assays were performed in the high concentration of glucose instead of alternative carbon sources.  FCCP treatment under high glucose conditions did not increase the ECR and OCR, which is normal for leukemia cells as shown in other people’s publications {Sriskanthadevan, 2015 #3944}{Kreitz, 2019 #2133}. PRMT1 could dampen the activities of TCA cycle and the electron transportation chain as the proteomic data from our unpublished data and published data {Fong, 2019 #1185} suggested. The elevated NADPH/NAD+ ratio is another indication that glycolysis and anabolism are enhanced by PRMT1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) How was disease penetrance established following the 6133/PRMT1 transplant before MS023 treatment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the data was in figure 1f, demonstrating that the penetrance is 100%.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The 6133/PRMT1 cells show elevated glycolysis compared to parental 6133; why did the author choose the 6133 cells for treatment with the MS023 and ECAR assay (Fig.3 b)? The same is confusing with OCR after inhibitor treatment in 6133 cells; the figure legend and results section description are inconsistent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry for the mistakes while we are preparing the manuscript.  We used 6133/PRMT1 cells to be treated with MS023 in figure 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The discussion is too brief and incoherent and does not adequately address key findings. A comprehensive rewrite is necessary to improve coherence and depth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. Now we added comprehensive review of PRMT1-mediated metabolism. The PRMT1 homolgous in yeast is called hmt1. In yeast, hmt1 is upregulated by glucose and enhance glycolysis. So PRMT1 enhanced glycolysis is a conserved pathway in eukaryocytic cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The materials and methods section lacks a description of statistical analysis, and significance is not indicated in several figures (e.g., Figures 1C, D, F; Figures 2D, E, F, I). Statistical significance must be consistently indicated. The methods section requires more detailed descriptions to enable replication of the study's findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added extra details on the methods and statistical analysis for the figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Figures are hazy and unclear. They should be replaced with high-resolution images, ensuring legible text and data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have prepared separate figure files with high resolution.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Correct the labeling in Figure 2I by removing the redundant &quot;D.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer and fixed the figure.</p>
