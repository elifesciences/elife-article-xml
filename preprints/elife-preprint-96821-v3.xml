<title>Abstract</title><p>Cell migration towards stiff substrates has been coined as durotaxis and implicated in development, wound healing and cancer, where complex interplays between immune and non-immune cells are present. Compared to the emerging mechanisms underlying the strongly adhesive mesenchymal durotaxis, little is known about whether immune cells - migrating in amoeboid mode - could follow mechanical cues. Here we develop an imaging-based confined migration device with stiffness gradient. By tracking live cell trajectory and analyzing the directionality of T cells and neutrophils, we observe that amoeboid cells can durotax. We further delineate the underlying mechanism to involve non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) polarization towards the soft-matrix-side but may not require differential actin flow up- or down-stiffness gradient. Using the protista <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, we demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of amoeboid durotaxis. Finally, these experimental phenomena are theoretically captured by an active gel model capable of mechanosensing. Collectively, these results may shed new lights on immune surveillance and recently identified confined migration of cancer cells, within the mechanically inhomogeneous tumor microenvironment or the inflamed fibrotic tissues.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>Compensatory upregulation of myosin expression in the NMIIA and NMIIB KD cells is needed to be considered if we want to clearly distinguish between the roles of NMIIA and NMIIB in amoeboid durotaxis. Thus, we investigated the compensatory upregulation using Western blot. We found that the protein level of NMIIB in NMIIA KD cells doubled while there was no compensatory upregulation of NMIIA in NMIIB KD cells (Fig. R2.1 and Fig. S4B, C). This further strengthens our conclusion that NMIIA rather than NMIIB is necessary for amoeboid durotaxis since in NMIIA KD cells, compensatory upregulation of NMIIB did not rescue the durotaxis-deficient phenotype. Besides, the results also demonstrated that when NMIIB is lacking, NMIIA at basal level is sufficient to maintain amoeboid durotaxis.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell migration is essential to myriads of physiological and pathological processes including cancer dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). As the mechanical properties of tumor microenvironment being gradually unveiled, waves of studies have focused on the contribution of mechanical force - in forms of proliferation generated cell jamming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) and fibrosis induced tissue stiffening - on tumor expansion as well as invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The ability of cells to sense and navigate along higher substrate stiffness has been coined as âdurotaxisâ in the early 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) with important pathophysiological implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Over the past two decades, accumulating in vitro and in vivo evidence has demonstrated durotaxis in tumor epithelial sheets and single mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), and revealed mechanisms including focal adhesion tugging or probing of the local substrate by actin-based protrusions to underlie this specialized directional cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). However, compared to tumor cells that harness the capacity to durotax, little is known about whether microenvironmental stiffness difference could determine the destination of immune cells.</p>
<p>In contrast to mesenchymal migration adopted by some tumor cells, immune cells mainly undergo rapid single cell crawling referred to as âamoeboidâ migration, without formation of stable focal adhesions but can achieve migration ten times faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Modeling on amoeboid migration suggested that myosin contractility may play an important role when mechanical anchoring are less evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). In this model, actomyosin was described as an active gel whose polarity dictates the alignment of actin fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Moreover, in silico simulation suggested that actomyosin contractility can lead to collective internal flows of actin, which, in turn, propels the cell body forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Meanwhile, experiments have also revealed that protrusive flowing of the anterior actin network drives the adhesion-independent cell migration.</p>
<p>During development and immune surveillance, chemotactic cues have been reported to globally prescribe the migratory direction and destination of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Using mammalian leukocytes and lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) as well as the protista <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), mechanisms of amoeboid chemotaxis have been extensively studied . Instead, little is known about whether these amoeboid cells would undergo durotactic migration. Previous studies have shown that inflamed, stiffened endothelial cells could induce more neutrophil transmigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), and that once adhered to the endothelium, transmigrating neutrophils may exert durotactic sensing to search for stiffer sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). In addition, lymphocytes such as CD4<sup>+</sup> NaÃ¯ve T cells increased spreading area when plated on stiffer substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), indicative of the capacity to sense external mechanical signal. The above evidence argue that amoeboid cells, albeit without strong adhesions, are able to sense and respond to environmental stiffness.</p>
<p>Here we developed an imaging-based cell migration device that provided both spatial confinement and stiffness gradient. By tracking live cell trajectory and analyzing the directionality of CD4<sup>+</sup> NaÃ¯ve T cells and neutrophils, we observed that amoeboid cells can durotax. We further uncovered the underlying mechanism to be NMII (non-muscle myosin II) dependent. Based on our observations that NMIIA was polarized towards the soft-end in cells on stiffness gradient gel, we mathematically simulated amoeboid cells as active droplets, predicting that durotaxis can be strengthened on the softer region of the gradient substrate which was then verified experimentally. Moreover, we demonstrated the evolutionary conservation of amoeboid migration in the protista <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Together, the identification that rigidity-guided migration existed in low-adhesive, fast moving amoeboid cells may provide new insights in focal adhesion-independent mechanosensing, and may shed new lights on immune surveillance and cancer metastasis.</p>

<title>T cells and neutrophils undergo durotactic migration</title>
<p>T cells and neutrophils exert amoeboid migration in vivo and in vitro under confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). To probe whether amoeboid cells would undergo durotaxis, we manufactured an imaging-based cell migration device which provided spatial confinement to maintain amoeboid cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) and stiffness gradient to provide durotactic cue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Typically, cells were sandwiched between two polyacrylamide (PA) gels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A iv</xref>) with stiffness gradient (20.77 kPa/mm, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>) or uniform stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Cell migration trajectories from time-lapse imaging were then generated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A v</xref>) and analyzed for directionality (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A vi</xref>). We employed the Forward Migration Index (FMI), for which the displacement value was divided by the total displacement the cell underwent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A vi</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). This FMI is decoupled with cell velocity and differed from persistence (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-C</xref>).</p>

<p>We then performed time-lapse imaging to record CD4<sup>+</sup> NaÃ¯ve T cell motility and generated trajectories for direction analysis. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), we observed that T cells underwent typical amoeboid migration with relatively high speed (the mean velocity was 16.21 Î¼m/min) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, E</xref>, Movie 1, 2), distinguished from mesenchymal migration which is usually below 1 Î¼m/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). When we stained these T cells for focal adhesion marker paxillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), we detected diffused signals by ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>), distinguished from the plaque-like structure in mesenchymal cells such as the MDA-MB-231 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The trajectories of T cells on the uniform gel did not show biased direction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>, Movie 1), while in striking contrast, a majority of cells on the gradient gel exhibited movement towards the stiff-end (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>, Movie 2). FMI for cells on the uniform gel was around zero (indicating random motility) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), while it displayed a positive value for cells on the stiffness gradient gel and significantly exceeded that of cells on the uniform gel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Angular displacement comparison also revealed that T cells migrated towards the stiff end in this experimental setting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Besides, no obvious difference in velocity was detected when comparing T cells moving on uniform vs gradient gel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), indicating that stiffness gradient did not enhance motility but rather increased forward migratory tendency.</p>
<p>Having identified durotaxis in T cells, we next sought to evaluate in other amoeboid cells such as neutrophils whether they also possess the durotactic capacity. Bone marrow-derived neutrophils were isolated by Percoll gradient and confined between two stiffness gradient gels. In line with our observations with T cells, neutrophils displayed random gliding on the uniform gel while appeared to durotax on the gradient gel, as revealed by the FMI and angular displacement analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F-I</xref>, Movie 3). This prominent stiff-end directed movement may result from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) initial cell polarization upon seeding, exemplified by subsequent persistent migration towards the cell front; or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) cells frequently exploring and re-steering to the stiffer side of the substrate. When analyzing live cell trajectories, we found that some cells indeed exhibited highly persistent migration (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>, Track 1, 7, 9, 14, Movie 4). However, we also detected cells that frequently changed directions but showed stiff-end biased migration on the whole (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>, Track 4, 5, 8, 10, Movie 4). These observations indicated that neutrophils were able to sense stiffness difference and re-polarize to durotax. Analysis of the bulk cell population revealed that neutrophils on stiffness gradient gel did not elevate their persistence compared to those on the uniform gel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). We also employed an immortalized promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 in addition to the mouse derived neutrophils. In agreement with previous reports, we detected that HL-60 employs amoeboid migration when differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (dHL-60) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>, Movie 5). dHL-60 cells migrated randomly on the uniform gel while moved towards the stiff end on gradient gel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J-M</xref>, Movie 5) under confinement.</p>
<p>Together, these phenomena indicate that amoeboid cells such as T cells and neutrophils, although lacking stable focal adhesions, are capable to sense the stiffness gradient and orchestrate directional migration towards the stiffer side.</p>

<title>Amoeboid durotaxis may not be propelled by differential actin flow</title>
<p>Having observed that amoeboid cells can exert durotactic migration, we then interrogated the molecular underpinnings. Classic molecular clutch model attributed both single and collective mesenchymal durotaxis to the differential adhesion strength on distinct substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Enhanced traction strain energy on stiffer matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) indicates the presence of increased motors and clutches, which may then slow down the actin flow at adhesion sites by friction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In this sense, actin flow is mechanosensitive â with low speed on stiff substrate and high speed on soft matrix. To test the rigidity sensitivity of actin flow in amoeboid cells, we performed quantitative fluorescent speckle microscopy (qFSM) to monitor fluorescent particle movement in dHL-60 cells stained with the actin-specific dye SiR-Actin. Retrograde flow analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) revealed that actin flow velocity dropped sharply when cells were plated on stiffer substrate (160 kPa) compared to the soft gel (4 kPa) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Movie 6, 7). Moreover, a descending trend of actin flow speed was detected with increasing substrate stiffness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Movie 6-10), suggesting that actin flow in amoeboid cells can indeed respond to stiffness.</p>

<p>Actin flow is generated by monomer assembly at the leading edge and myosin contraction at the cell rear, while is slowed down by traction stress between the cell bottom and the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Strain energy from the halting of actin flow then transduces into protruding force to counteract membrane tension at the cell front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Thus, the protrusion rate is inversely related to the actin retrograde flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). It has been suggested that continuous cycles of protrusion support forward cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Considering the negatively correlated actin flow speed and substrate stiffness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), we postulated that differential actin flow velocity (high speed in the down-gradient vs low speed in the up-gradient region) may promote stiff end biased cell migration by inducing more protrusive events in the up-gradient cell region. To test this, we divided the cell body area into up- and down-gradient halves for respective actin flow analysis. However, against our hypothesis, actin flow in these two regions appeared similar in speed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, Movie 11). To further explore the role of actin flow in durotaxis, we took advantage of CK-666, an Arp2/3 complex inhibitor that prevents branched actin formation, to decrease actin flow speed without changing NMII localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Upon CK-666 treatment, we observed significant decrease in actin flow speed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) while the durotactic behavior were not impacted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), indicating that actin flow may not play a crucial role in amoeboid durotaxis.</p>

<title>Durotaxis of T cells and neutrophils is regulated by polarized actomyosin activity</title>
<p>Current mechanistic models explaining directional cell migration along or against a stiffness gradient such as focal adhesion tugging are not plausible in the setting of amoeboid cells. The microtubule dynamics has been reported to impact amoeboid migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Besides, we previously found that perturbation of the microtubule network - especially loss of the Golgi microtubules - abrogated single cell durotaxis in HRPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). However, no obvious alterations in durotactic FMI were detected under treatments of either the microtubule polymerization inhibitor Nocodazole or the depolymerization inhibitor Taxol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>, Movie 12, 13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), indicating that similar influence of the microtubule network on mesenchymal cells may not apply to amoeboid durotaxis.</p>
<p>Recently, the cell rear-localized actomyosin network has been inferred to determine polarity re-establishment by mediating contractility underneath the plasma membrane and propels the locomotion of the cell body. We then asked whether this machinery could provide steering force for focal adhesion-independent durotaxis. Interestingly, treating T cells or neutrophils with the NMII inhibitor blebbistatin to disrupt cell contraction drastically reduced durotactic FMI towards zero (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, G</xref>, Movie 14). In contrast, Rho activator II, which can enhance myosin contractility, elevated the FMI of durotactic T cells and neutrophils (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, G</xref>), supporting the notion that NMII activation may play an important role in amoeboid durotaxis. Pharmacological perturbations in dHL-60 cells with blebbistatin or Rho activator II showed similar effects with what we observed in T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, H</xref>), agreeing with myosin activity being pivotal for amoeboid durotaxis.</p>
<p>It has been documented that NMIIB is more sensitive to stiffness gradient than NMIIA in mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Having observed that NMII inhibition significantly decreased FMI in T cells and neutrophils, we next set to explore the roles of specific NMII isoforms in amoeboid durotaxis. We generated HL-60 cells knocked down of NMIIA or NMIIB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). Interestingly, cell trajectories on gradient gel revealed that loss of NMIIA rather than NMIIB abolished dHL-60 durotaxis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-E</xref>, Movie 15), which was not in accordance with what has been reported in mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). To exclude functional compensation between these two NMII isoforms, we performed Western blot to detect protein levels of these two isoforms in NMIIA<sup>KD</sup> and NMIIB<sup>KD</sup> cells. The results showed that NMIIB protein level in NMIIA<sup>KD</sup> cells doubled while there was no compensatory upregulation of NMIIA in NMIIB<sup>KD</sup> cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>, C), further suggesting NMIIA rather than NMIIB is responsible for amoeboid durotaxis since in NMIIA<sup>KD</sup> cells, compensatory upregulation of NMIIB did not rescue the durotaxis-deficient phenotype.</p>

<p>Previous studies showed that when mesenchymal cells crawl on rigid glass, NMIIB is enriched at the cell rear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), whereas NMIIA appears uniformly distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). To examine the mechanism underlying the requirement for NMIIA but not NMIIB in amoeboid durotaxis, we assayed their distribution in cells on gradient gel. Strikingly, NMIIA was concentrated at the down-gradient side of dHL-60 cells, regardless of the front-rear axis of the cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F, G</xref>). On the contrary, NMIIB showed much less correlation with the stiffness gradient (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>), consistent with it playing a minor role in the establishment of durotactic direction. Similar distribution of NMIIA was also seen in T cells and neutrophils on gradient gel (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D, E</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies suggested that localizing NMIIA to the cell rear is required to set cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). We then hypothesized that the down-gradient concentrated NMIIA may leverage the cell front towards the stiffer side, thus enabling efficient amoeboid durotaxis. To test this, we transfected HL-60 cells with GFP-NMIIA and monitored the fluorescent signal in durotaxis assays. We captured events when cells turned to align with the stiffness gradient and in these cases, the GFP-NMIIA signal stayed concentrated at the soft side, preceding re-polarization of the cell to form a new front-rear axis (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>, Movie 16).</p>

<p>Our model suggests that basal diffusion rate of NMIIA is larger on stiffer substrate, improving the mechanosensity of cells to substrate gradient. In addition, the model predicts that cells initially placed on softer region of gradient substrates exhibit stronger durotaxis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C-E</xref>). Furthermore, the initial local substrate stiffness may reverse cell durotaxis to adurotaxis. For example, under cell contractility <italic>Î¶Ì</italic> =0.002, cells on softer region of gradient substrate, i.e., initial stiffness of cell centroid <italic>E</italic>=30 and 70 kPa, migrate directionally following the stiffness gradient (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), whereas the strong durotaxis gives way to random migration when the initial stiffness of cell centroid is 200 kPa (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>), resulting in an FMI close to zero (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). To test our theoretical predictions, we segregated the gradient gel (ranging from 30 kPa to 210 kPa) into three equal regions (soft, middle and stiff) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>) for cell trajectory analysis. FMI of cells on the soft region topped, while cells in the stiff region displayed more random motility (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Cell velocity and persistence showed no difference among these regions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H, I</xref>). These experiments agreed with our theoretical predictions, thereby confirming the robustness regulation of amoeboid durotaxis by local stiffness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Durotaxis based on focal adhesion dependent mechanosensing has been well studied for decades. However, whether cells can durotax using amoeboid migration strategies was asked only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). In this study, we developed an imaging-based cell migration device that provided both spatial confinement and stiffness gradient, and with this device we demonstrated that amoeboid cells can durotax. We further uncovered the underlying mechanism to involve NMIIA polarization towards the soft-matrix-side but may not require differential actin flow up- or down-stiffness gradient.</p>
<p>An intriguing question remains is how cells manage to retain NMIIA on regions that downward the stiffness gradient. One likely explanation would be that NMIIA could sense substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) and then locates itself to the soft end. In our modeling, we assigned NMIIA with an initial diffusion rate which increases with higher substrate stiffness. Under this consideration, NMIIA is more diffusive on the stiff end and intended to accumulate on the soft end. To experimentally verify this, future work using single particle tracking is required to analyze NMIIA diffusion rate on substrate with different stiffness. Another possible mechanism may be that NMIIA is recruited by its upstream factors which prefer to locate at softer area. Mst1 kinase is a key component of Hippo pathway that could be regulated by substrate stiffness. It has been reported that Mst1 directly regulate NMIIA dynamics to organize high and low affinity LFA-1 to the anterior and posterior membrane during T cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Whether Mst1 is mechanosensitive and has the capacity to recruit NMIIA to the soft end still need to be testified. The mDia1-like formin A, IQGAP-related proteins and actin-bundling protein cortexillin localize like NMII to the rear of polarized, migrating <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells, promoting the formation of cortical actin in the rear and allowing efficient cell migration in 2D-confined environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Whether these proteins localize to the soft end of durotactic amoeboid cells and recruit NMIIA is an intriguing question. We have used formin inhibitor SMIFH2 in our durotaxis assay and found this treatment slightly decreased migration velocity but did not impact durotactic behavior of T cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). The possibility that IQGAP-related proteins and cortexillin act as upstream factors that recruit NMIIA to the softer area is still open.</p>
<p>Aside from NMIIA, other mechanisms may also facilitate amoeboid durotaxis. Inorganic droplets can move directionally on surfaces with stiffness gradient due to the intrinsic wettability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Droplets with smaller and wetting contact angles move towards the soft end, while those with larger and non-wetting contact angles can durotax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). We also measured the contact angles of dHL-60 cells at both the stiffer and softer sides on gradient gel and observed non-wetting contact angles (greater than 90 degrees) on both sides (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>) albeit the angles on the softer side are larger (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D</xref>). Hence, it can be postulated that the smaller, non-wetting contact angle on stiffer side are also likely contribute to amoeboid durotaxis to certain extent.</p>
<p>Immune cell activation is regulated not only by biochemical factors, but also by the mechano-microenvironment including substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Substrate rigidity influences differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), gene expression, cell migration, morphology, and cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) in T cells. Interestingly, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) has been shown to enhance killing response when encountering stiffer target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Whether stiff tumor cells can act as a mechanical guidance for CTL durotaxis is tentative to test. Immune cells are recruited and play a crucial role in tissue repair. Tissue injuries of varying origins, including chemical, mechanical, or microbiological, initiate the processes that ultimately result in fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Fibrosis is characterized by tissue stiffening due to excessive extracellular matrix protein deposition and cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). It will be intriguing to investigate whether the rigidity cues in fibrotic area may regulate immune cell migration.</p>
<p>The search for molecular mechanisms underlying cell durotaxis has been paralleled by the development of different types of theoretical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The well-established motor-clutch model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) and random walk model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) demonstrate that cell durotaxis is attributable to traction or cell-substrate adhesion difference. Vertex model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) and continuum model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) are widely used in collective durotaxis, focusing on long-range environmental stiffness difference and force generation between adjacent cells and suggesting far more efficiency in collective durotaxis than single-cell durotaxis. The active nematic model employs active extensile or contractile agents to push or pull the fluid along their elongation axis to simulate cell flowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). These models, which usually ignore the asymmetric distribution of polarity markers, are more suitable for mesenchymal cells forming obvious stress fibers, but might not be applicative in low adhesive amoeboid cells. The mechanosensing active gel model established here highlights the role of polarity markers in migration of cells with low adhesion. It also provides us a novel perspective that the diffusion rate difference dependent on substrate stiffness can polarize NMIIA and subsequently induce polarized actin flow along the stiffness gradient, followed by amoeboid durotaxis.</p>
<p>Our study also has technical and mechanistic limitations. Cells live in complex, three-dimensional physiological or pathological microenvironments. Thus, the phenomena observed in our 2D confinement assay may not faithfully recapitulate the behavior of amoeboid cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further measurement of <italic>in vivo</italic> stiffness gradient sensed by immune cells and more <italic>in vivo</italic> studies can broaden our understanding of amoeboid durotaxis. In addition, mechanistic studies of amoeboid durotaxis in our research is limited. We found that soft end polarized NMIIA is crucial to amoeboid durotaxis but how NMIIA is recruited to the soft area remains to be further explored. Migrating amoeboid cells commonly form spherical protrusions called blebs at their leading edges, which facilitate cell locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Whether these cell front positioned blebs are involved in mechanosensing and determination of migrating direction also deserves further investigation.</p>

Specially, 40% acrylamide and 2% bis-acrylamide solutions were combined at 11.73% and 0.33%, respectively, to make a 55 kPa gel. 0.5% (w/v) Irgacure 2959 was added to catalyze cross-linking when exposed to UV light. Gels were cast on cover glasses which was treated with bind-silane (BioDee, Beijing, China) followed by treatment with 0.5% glutaraldehyde (Sangon Biotech, Beijing, China) solution. To ensure complete polymerization, the whole acrylamide mix solution was first exposed to the UV light for 10 min without covering (for the initial nucleation in the polymerization reaction). To make gradient stiffness, an opaque mask was put between the gels and UV light. Then the mask was removed slowly by a microinjection pump with constant speed (40 Î¼m/s for 10 min) to produce the steep stiffness gradient gels. After polymerization, the upper coverslip was peeled off the gel, leaving a thin layer of gel on the activated surface. The PA gel was then washed extensively in PBS. The PA gel was functionalized with 2 mL soak solution (137 mM NaCl and 5% (v/v) glycerol) for 1 h at room temperature. After that, 2 mL mixed buffer (pH = 4.5) containing 15 mM 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), 25 mM N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS), 100 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid (MES) and 10% (v/v) glycerol were added.

At the beginning, the unit polarity field <bold>P</bold> is randomly generated and the fluid velocity <bold>v</bold> is zero. A fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with time step Î <italic>t</italic> = 0 . 1 is employed to implement the time integration.

<p>In their paper, Kang et al. investigate rigidity sensing in amoeboid cells, showing that, despite their lack of proper focal adhesions, amoeboid migration of single cells is impacted by substrate rigidity. In fact, many different amoeboid cell types can durotax, meaning that they preferentially move towards the stiffer side of a rigidity gradient.</p>
<p>The authors observed that NMIIA is required for durotaxis and, buiding on this observation, they generated a model to explain how durotaxis could be achieved in the absence of strong adhesions. According to the model, substrate stiffness alters the diffusion rate of NMAII, with softer substrates allowing for faster diffusion. This allows for NMAII accumulation at the back, which, in turn, results in durotaxis.</p>
<p>The evidence provided for durotaxis of non adherent (or low-adhering) cells is strong. I am particularly impressed by the fact that amoeboid cells can durotax even when not confined. I wish to congratulate the authors for the excellent work, which will fuel discussion in the field of cell adhesion and migration.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors developed an imaging-based device, that provides both spatial confinement and stiffness gradient, to investigate if and how amoeboid cells, including T cells, neutrophils and Dictyostelium can durotax. Furthermore, the authors showed that the mechanism for the directional migration of T cells and neutrophils depends on non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) polarized towards the soft-matrix-side. Finally, they developed a mathematical model of an active gel that captures the behavior of the cells described in vitro.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The topic is intriguing as durotaxis is essentially thought to be a direct consequence of mechanosensing at focal adhesions. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first report on amoeboid cells that are not dependent on FAs to exert durotaxis. The authors developed an imaging-based durotaxis device that provides both spatial confinement and stiffness gradient and they also utilized several techniques such as quantitative fluorescent speckle microscopy and expansion microscopy. The results of this study have well-designed control experiments and are therefore convincing.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors developed an imaging-based device that provides both spatialconfinement and stiffness gradient to investigate if and how amoeboid cells, including T cells, neutrophils, and Dictyostelium, can durotax. Furthermore, the authors showed that the mechanism for the directional migration of T cells and neutrophils depends on non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) polarized towards the soft-matrix-side. Finally, they developed a mathematical model of an active gel that captures the behavior of the cells described in vitro.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The topic is intriguing as durotaxis is essentially thought to be a direct consequence of mechanosensing at focal adhesions. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first report on amoeboid cells that do not depend on FAs to exert durotaxis. The authors developed an imaging-based durotaxis device that provides both spatial confinement and stiffness gradient and they also utilized several techniques such as quantitative fluorescent speckle microscopy and expansion microscopy. The results of this study have well-designed control experiments and are therefore convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall this study is well performed but there are still some minor issues I recommend the authors address:</p>
<p>(1) When using NMIIA/NMIIB knockdown cell lines to distinguish the role of NMIIA and NMIIB in amoeboid durotaxis, it would be better if the authors took compensatory effects into account.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have investigated the compensation of myosin in NMIIA and NMIIB KD HL-60 cells using Western blot and added this result in our updated manuscript (Fig. S4B, C). The results showed that the level of NMIIB protein in NMIIA KD cells doubled while there was no compensatory upregulation of NMIIA in NMIIB KD cells. This is consistent with our conclusion that NMIIA rather than NMIIB is responsible for amoeboid durotaxis since in NMIIA KD cells, compensatory upregulation of NMIIB did not rescue the durotaxis-deficient phenotype.</p>

<p>(2) The expansion microscopy assay is not clearly described and some details are missed such as how the assay is performed on cells under confinement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have updated details of the expansion microscopy assay in our revised manuscript in line 481-485 including how the assay is performed on cells under confinement:</p>
<p>Briefly, CD4+ NaÃ¯ve T cells were seeded on a gradient PA gel with another upper gel providing confinement. 4% PFA was used to fix cells for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation, the upper gradient PA gel is carefully removed and the bottom gradient PA gel with seeded cells were immersed in an anchoring solution containing 1% acrylamide and 0.7% formaldehyde (Sigma, F8775) for 5 h at 37 Â°C.</p>

<p>(3) In this study, an active gel model was employed to capture experimental observations. Previously, some active nematic models were also considered to describe cell migration, which is controlled by filament contraction. I suggest the authors provide a short discussion on the comparison between the present theory and those prior models.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Active nematic models have been employed to recapitulate many phenomena during cell migration (<italic>Nat Commun.</italic>, 2018, doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-05666-8.). The active nematic model describes the motion of cells using the orientation field, Q, and the velocity field, u. The director field n with (nâ=âân) is employed to represent the nematic state, which has head-tail symmetry. However, in our experiments, actin filaments are obviously polarized, which polymerize and flow towards the direction of cell migration. Therefore, we choose active gel model which describes polarized actin field during cell migration. In the discussion part, we have provided the comparison between active gel model and motor-clutch model. We have also supplemented a short discussion between the present model and active nematic model in the main text of line 345-347:</p>
<p>The active nematic model employs active extensile or contractile agents to push or pull the fluid along their elongation axis to simulate cells flowing (61).</p>

<p>(4) In the present model, actin flow contributes to cell migration while myosin distribution determines cell polarity. How does this model couple actin and myosin together?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this question. In our model, the polarization field <inline-formula id="sa3equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-96821-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> is employed to couple actin and myosin together. It is obvious that actin accumulate at the front while myosin diffuses in the opposite direction. Therefore, we propose that actin and myosin flow towards the opposite direction, which is captured in the convection term of actin <inline-formula id="sa3equ2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-96821-sa3-equ2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>) and myosin (<inline-formula id="sa3equ3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-96821-sa3-equ3.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>) density field.</p>
