<title>Abstract</title><p>The M protein is an essential virulence factor of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, or group A streptococci (GAS), one of the most common and dangerous human pathogens. Molecular and functional characterization of M protein variants and their interactions with host components is crucial for understanding streptococcal pathogenesis and vaccine development. The M3 protein is produced by the prevalent <italic>emm</italic>3 GAS serotype, which is frequently associated with severe invasive diseases. Here we characterize the interaction of M3 with human collagens through detailed structural and biochemical binding analysis. High-resolution structures of the N-terminal M3 domain in the free state as well as bound to a collagen peptide derived from the Collagen Ligands Collection reveal a novel T-shaped protein fold that presents binding sites complementing the characteristic topology of collagen triple helices. The structure of the M3/collagen peptide complex explains how <italic>emm</italic>3 GAS and related streptococci, such as the emerging human pathogen <italic>Streptococcus dysgalactiae</italic> subsp. <italic>equisimilis</italic>, can target collagens to enable colonization of various tissues. In line with this, we demonstrate that the M3/collagen interaction promotes enhanced biofilm formation of <italic>emm</italic>3 GAS in an <italic>emm</italic> type specific manner, which can be inhibited with the recombinant M3 N-terminal domain fragment. Further, <italic>emm</italic>3 GAS, but not an <italic>emm</italic>1 strain, are shown to colocalize with collagen in tissue biopsies from patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections, where GAS biofilms are common. This observation is reproduced in organotypic skin models. Together, these data provide detailed molecular insights into an important streptococcal virulence mechanism with implications for the understanding of invasive infections, strategies for treating biofilm and M-protein based vaccine design.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (group A streptococcus, GAS) is one of the most prevalent human pathogens. It causes acute diseases ranging from trivial to life-threatening, such as pharyngotonsillitis (strep throat), scarlet fever, impetigo, meningitis, necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The highest disease burden is caused by the post-infection sequelae acute rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease and glomerulonephritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] but there is also a worrying global rise of severe invasive infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. A key virulence factor involved in many if not all these diseases is the GAS M protein. Encoded by the chromosomal <italic>emm</italic> gene, the M protein is covalently anchored at its C-terminus to the cell wall, covering the GAS surface at high density and acting as an adhesin and a potent immune evasion factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. M proteins are known, or can confidently be predicted, to form linear fibrils extending approximately 50 nm from the bacterial surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Their hair-like architecture is based on dimerization of α-helical chains into parallel coiled coils, the defining and dominant structural feature of this class of proteins. Whilst sharing similar overall structure, M proteins are sequentially highly diverse, with over 220 distinct known variants of the <italic>emm</italic> gene defining GAS serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. The C-terminal regions of M protein variants are highly conserved and predicted to form well-defined coiled coils. Sequences diverge increasingly towards the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) that is projected away from the bacterial surface. Experimental high-resolution structural information for M proteins is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to their role in adhesion and subverting the host’s immune response, M proteins have also been implicated in biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Bacterial biofilms are a major cause of difficult-to-treat infections largely contributed by their recalcitrance to antibiotics and immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. They are classified as either surface-attached biofilms, typically associated with implants and medical device-associated infections, or non-surface-associated biofilms. The latter are commonly observed in respiratory infections of patients with impaired mucociliary function, and in persistent soft tissue infections seen in chronic wounds resulting from diabetes or impaired vascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Biofilm is also a potentially complicating feature associated with severe invasive GAS diseases. Analyses of biopsies collected during the acute phase identified biofilm in over 30% of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections caused by GAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Some GAS types, such as <italic>emm</italic>1 and <italic>emm</italic>3, are over-represented among isolates from severe invasive infections, i.e. necrotizing soft tissue infections and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], but no clear association between biofilm formation and <italic>emm</italic> type is known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Köller <italic>et al.</italic> highlighted that the propensity of GAS to form biofilm <italic>in vitro</italic> was directly dictated by the experimental setting where both the medium and coating with specific extracellular matrix proteins influenced the outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
<p>M proteins have been reported to interact with a wide range of host proteins, such as fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], C4-binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], plasminogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], collagens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and immunoglobulins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Importantly, binding activities vary between <italic>emm</italic> types. Phylogenetic clusters of M proteins broadly share binding propensities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. However, very few M protein interactions have been confirmed through biophysical and structural analyses. The M1 protein binds to the fibrinogen D domain in the variable “B-repeat” region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Several M protein types have the ability to bind to the C4-binding protein through their HVRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. While these two molecular complexes rely on the dimeric coiled-coil topology of the M proteins, the plasminogen kringle-2 domain binds to monomeric, non-coiled segments of certain M proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>
<p>In a screening of GAS strains belonging to 43 <italic>emm</italic> types, only <italic>emm3</italic> and <italic>emm18</italic> strains were identified by Dinkla <italic>et al.</italic> to bind collagen IV to their surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. For <italic>emm3</italic> isolates, this interaction was demonstrated to depend on direct binding of collagen to the M3 protein. For <italic>emm18</italic> GAS strains, binding was mediated by the hyaluronic acid capsule rather than the M18 protein. Direct collagen binding has also been reported for M1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Based on available evidence collagen binding is not a universal property of GAS M proteins, but appears to be common among M proteins of group C and G streptococci (<italic>Streptococcus dysgalactiae</italic> subsp. <italic>equisimilis</italic>, SDSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], which are emerging as important human pathogens that share disease manifestations and virulence traits with GAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Collagens are commonly targeted by a wide range of pathogenic bacteria for the purposes of tissue colonization and dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. They have been shown to interact directly with several bacterial adhesins, such as CNA from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], YadA from <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], and CNE from <italic>Streptococcus equi</italic> subsp. <italic>equi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. In the latter two cases, adhesin binding has been mapped using the peptide libraries applied in the present study. While the biological role of collagen binding by GAS is unknown, it has been linked to the induction of an autoimmune response associated with post-streptococcal sequelae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The collagen binding site in M3 was mapped to the HVR. A sequence motif that is conserved in related M proteins of group A, C and G streptococci has been identified – the “peptide associated with rheumatic fever” (PARF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. This motif is found in a region predicted to deviate from the canonical coiled coil structure in M3, several other M proteins and their homologs in non-group A streptococci (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Binding of M3 protein to other collagen types has not been reported, but the M protein FOG (aka Stg11) of SDSE was found to bind to collagens I and IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].</p>

<p>To gain insights into mechanism and biological role of streptococcal collagen binding, we characterised the interaction of M3 with the Collagen Ligand Collections (CLCs, triple-helical collagen peptide libraries formerly known as Toolkits), and determined crystal structures of the M3 N-terminal domain (M3-NTD), encompassing the HVR, alone and in complex with a CLC-derived collagen peptide. We find that M3-NTD folds into a novel T-shaped domain that binds promiscuously to collagen triple helices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the M3-collagen interaction underpins biofilm formation by GAS <italic>emm3</italic> isolates from necrotizing soft tissue infections, which can be inhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> by recombinant M3 protein and collagen peptides.</p>

<title>Recombinant M3 protein binds to the triple-helical domain of collagens II and III</title>
<p>The first aim of this study was to confirm the collagen binding activity of streptococcal M3 protein, and to identify any specific binding sites in collagen. To reduce the complexity of the experimental system we chose collagens II and III, as these are homotrimers, in contrast to, for instance, heterotrimeric collagens I and IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Recombinant M3 protein, lacking the N-terminal secretion signal and the C-terminal membrane-spanning region was produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Binding to collagens II and III was investigated using CLCs, libraries of 56 and 57 overlapping triple-helical peptides, respectively, covering the entire triple-helical tropocollagen domain of these two collagen types (1014 and 1029 amino acids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Recombinant M3 was found to bind to CLC peptides to various degrees, as quantified by an ELISA-like approach using an anti-GST antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). While there were clear differences in binding between the CLC peptides, it was impossible to identify sequence features that were conserved in good binders (high apparent affinity) but absent from peptides that gave rise to signals comparable to negative controls. Neither sequence motifs, nor composition of the peptides (e.g., presence of hydroxyprolines, charged, hydrophobic or aromatic residues) were distinct in good binders. To investigate further the sequence requirements for M3 binding, we ranked the CLC peptides in decreasing apparent affinity, measured as A<sub>450</sub> determined in the solid-phase binding assay, and then analyzed the distribution of particular amino acids in the entire set, pooling data from CLC-II and CLC-III. After background subtraction, we defined three binding groups: high affinity, having A<sub>450</sub> between 0.5 and 0.75; medium affinity, A<sub>450</sub> from 0.25 to 0.5; and low affinity, A<sub>450</sub> from 0 to 0.25.</p>

<title>M3-NTD harbors the collagen binding site</title>
<p>Full-length M proteins are not amenable to high-resolution structural characterization due to their anisotropic shape and potential conformational dynamics. We therefore designed a construct representing the M3 N-terminal domain (M3-NTD), which comprises the HVR and a short region predicted to adopt a dimeric coiled-coil structure. This fragment would not only allow structural characterization but could also be used to confirm the previously suggested localization of the collagen binding site at the HVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. M3-NTD includes the 110 N-terminal residues of mature M3 (residues 42-151 of the M3 protein precursor sequence). To stabilize a dimeric conformation, Leu151 was replaced with a cysteine for disulfide bond formation at the C-terminus. Leu151 is predicted to occupy a “d” position in the canonical coiled coil heptad pattern, forming part of the hydrophobic interface between the α-helices, a position ideally suited for disulfide bond formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. A <sup>15</sup>N isotopically labelled version of M3-NTD was made for NMR spectroscopic analysis. From a comparison of <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra it is evident that a significant structural change occurred upon oxidation (resulting in disulfide bond formation) of the protein. The higher dispersion of signals, most noticeably in the <sup>1</sup>H dimension, indicates disulfide-linked M3-NTD adopts a folded conformation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, the reduced, monomeric form gives rise to a poorly resolved spectrum with signals falling within the random-coil chemical shift range, and big differences in crosspeak intensities that suggest dynamic behavior (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This demonstrates the C-terminal disulfide bond is required to stabilize a dimeric, folded structure that differs from extended unfolded or linear α-helical conformations.</p>

<p>To test if M3-NTD harbors the collagen binding site, binding to selected CLC triple-helical peptides was studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We selected two peptides that showed medium to high apparent affinity in the CLC screening (II-27 and II-44) and a low affinity peptide (II-16). These three peptides all interacted with M3-NTD in solution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>). II-27 and II-44 binding was characterized by dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) in the low micromolar range (7 and 5 µM, respectively). II-16 had an approximately ten times lower affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 70 µM) for M3-NTD. These <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s reflect the differences in binding of full-length M3 evident from the CLC solid-phase binding assay. Fitting of the sigmoidal binding curves for II-27 and II-44 suggested binding of one triple-helical peptide per M3-NTD monomer, i.e., two indistinguishable collagen binding sites per M3 dimer. To assess if the interaction was dependent on the triple-helical conformation of the CLC peptides, we titrated M3-NTD into a monomeric version of II-44 with scrambled GPP repeat sequences at the termini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. No binding was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>In conclusion, the collagen binding site of M3 was confirmed to reside in M3-NTD. CLC solid-phase binding results obtained for full-length M3 align with in-solution interaction analyses by ITC using M3-NTD. Binding of M3-NTD to collagen peptides depends on their triple-helical structure.</p>

<p>The fold represents a novel T-shaped architecture with no significantly similar structures identifiable by the protein structure comparison server DALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Each monomer is composed of three α-helices, H1-H3. The H3 helices comprise the C-terminal 38 residues of M3-NTD (M3 residues 114-151) and form a coiled coil stem. This, in the full-length protein, would be extended into a ∼50 nm long coiled coil characteristic of M proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Helices H1 and H2 form hairpins that pack against each other to form the slightly kinked bar of the T-shape, effectively a three-helix bundle. A key residue is Gly113, which resides at the T-junction, separating H2 and H3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). It is completely conserved in M proteins identified in our sequence similarity search (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The T-junction structure is defined by conserved leucine and isoleucine residues that form a small hydrophobic core (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The T-bar structure is stabilized by a network of polar interactions of several conserved residues, most notably inter-chain salt bridges of Arg52 with Asp102 and Glu105, and an inter-chain hydrogen bond between the side chains of Glu49 and Asn101 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Asn101 is one of the completely conserved residues in the PARF motif, previously implicated in collagen binding. This motif is located on H2 at the bottom of the T-bar (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Some but not all conserved PARF residues contribute to the formation of the T-bar structure of M3-NTD. Leu97 and Asn101 are the only completely conserved residue of PARF with a structural role. Leu97 is buried at the interface between the H1-H2 hairpin of one monomer and H1 of the other monomer, packing against the Tyr81 sidechain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>An N-terminal T-shaped fold is predicted to be a feature of other M proteins</title>
<p>AlphaFold3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] predictions were carried out for the proteins identified in our sequence similarity search (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) to support the structural role of the conserved residues. In validation of this approach, the AlphaFold3 predicted model of M3 is almost perfectly superimposable with the experimental M3-NTD structure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). All other proteins included in this study are predicted to have T-shaped N-terminal domains, with exception of proteins M133 and M228, where deletions break the topology of the T-bar fold (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref rid="figs6f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some of the predictions for GAS M protein variants, such as M12 and M55, carry low confidence and may well not adopt the T-fold. HVRs of M proteins that are phylogenetically more distant to M3, such as M1 and M28, are not predicted to fold into any distinct tertiary structure deviating from coiled coil (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). On the other hand, M proteins of SDSE and the SzM protein of <italic>Streptococcus equi</italic> subsp. <italic>zooepidemicus</italic> (SESZ) are predicted with high confidence to adopt a structure similar to M3.

<title>M3-NTD binds promiscuously to the collagen triple helix</title>
<p>M3-NTD is a structurally tractable fragment that retains the collagen binding activity of the full-length protein. We chose II-27, a CLC peptide with good affinity for M3-NTD, as the basis for structural characterization of an M3-collagen complex. II-27 contains an atypical α1β1 integrin-selective motif, GVOGEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. To increase chances of crystallization, a shorter 24-residue peptide, JDM238, was synthesized which contains the GVOGEA motif flanked by three glycine-proline-4-hydroxyproline</p>
<p>(GPO) repeats at each terminus. Crystals formed in conditions containing JDM238 and M3-NTD at a 1.5:1 ratio and diffracted synchrotron X-rays to 2.3 Å resolution. Molecular replacement with M3-NTD yielded a high-quality structural model for the complex (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In agreement with our ITC data for CLC II-27 binding to M3-NTD, the M3-NTD dimer is bound to two copies of triple-helical JDM238. While both copies occupy equivalent binding sites on opposite faces of the M3-NTD T-bar, they contact the protein with two different regions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). One copy contacts M3-NTD through residues 15-21 of the C-terminal GPO repeats, the other is bound at its more central GPOGVO region (residues 6-12) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8A</xref>). The presence of two different binding registers in the same crystal is likely an effect of crystal packing, but it also reflects a lack of specificity of collagen binding by M3, in line with the CLC screening data. Superposition of the two binding sites highlights how the M3-NTD T-bar complements the characteristic and uniform surface topology of triple helices in both binding registers in the same fashion (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>

<p>The M3 collagen binding site includes the PARF region on H2 (residues 94-101), extending beyond it to include the C-terminal half of H1 and most of H2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). This confirms previous reports on the involvement of PARF in collagen binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Interfaces between the binding partners largely comprise hydrophobic interactions between highly complementary surfaces. M3 residues Tyr96 and Trp103 play prominent roles: they pack against Hyp and Pro sidechains, filling grooves on the collagen triple helices and form polar contacts with the peptide backbone. The indole amino group of Trp103 interacts with the carbonyl of Ala15 or Hyp6 (depending on the register), while Tyr96 forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of Hyp9 or Hyp18. In one binding mode, M3 Gln42 hydrogen bonds with the same water molecule as Tyr96. Direct polar contacts also include M3 residues Lys35 and Arg49 which interact with the hydroxyl group of Hyp9 and the backbone carbonyl of Hyp12, respectively. In addition, in one binding mode M3 residue Gln46 forms a hydrogen bond with Gly22 of the peptide via a water molecule.</p>
<p>Tyr96 is a conserved residue of the PARF motif. We tested its role in collagen binding using two site-specific variants, Tyr96Ala and Tyr96Phe. When titrating M3-NTD Tyr96Ala into CLC peptide II-44, which bound to wild type M3-NTD with low micromolar <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>, no binding was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The more conservative substitution of Tyr96 with Phe also severely reduced the affinity for II-44 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 100…300 µM) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that the water-mediated interaction between Tyr96 and the peptide backbone strongly contributes to binding. This supports the critical role of Tyr96 in collagen binding, both via forming van der Waals interactions with the collagen peptide triple helix as well as forming the water-mediated polar interaction with the peptide backbone. In conclusion, we present the first structural evidence for an M-protein collagen complex. The structure indicates a general binding mechanism that might explain the promiscuity of M3 for diverse CLC peptides and explains how M3 is able to bind non-selectively to different collagens.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>No obvious or simple connection can be made between M protein sequences and the differential abilities of the over 200 variants to interact with host factors. At least some activities of this major streptococcal virulence factor may be encoded in hidden sequence patterns, as identified for the M4-binding protein interaction with HVRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. In this study, we show that the HVR of the M3 protein deviates from the canonical coiled-coil structure generally assumed to be adopted by M proteins. The novel T-shaped fold identified here is required for the collagen binding activity of M3. While this fold may be limited to a few phylogenetically close variants of M proteins in GAS, it is more abundant in SDSE. The discovery of a folded HVR may inform vaccine design. Although immunization with short and therefore monomeric M protein HVR peptides may be sufficient for most GAS serotypes, immunogenic epitopes of M3 may only be present in the folded, dimeric form of the protein.</p>
<p>The structures of M3-NTD alone and in presence of a collagen peptide give a rational basis for the role of the PARF motif, which was previously implicated in collagen binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The role of conserved residues within PARF is predominantly to stabilize the T-fold of M3-NTD. The motif alone, encompassing eight residues (Ala94 to Asn101) as defined by Barroso <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], does not present all structural features involved in collagen binding based on our structure. This depends on a larger region spanning residues Gln92 to Leu107 on the H2 helix, with some minor contributions of residues in H1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). The complex structure identifies Tyr96 and Trp103 as key interface residues. They provide shape complementarity and stack against proline and hydroxyproline rings of the collagen triple helix. Our mutational analysis confirms a role in collagen binding for Tyr96. Conclusions from the crystal structure are consistent with our analysis of the binding propensities of the different amino acids in the CLC peptides. The observed prominent roles for hydrophobic residues and for hydroxyproline in the solid-phase binding assays would be predicted from the complex structure. The negative effects on binding rank of glutamate and of proline are less easy to explain. Proline is restricted to the X position of the GXY triplet, which is also the position usually occupied by glutamate. The effect of both residues may be to exclude more productive hydrophobic amino acids from the X position. The positive role of hydroxyproline in the Y position is amply demonstrated in the crystal structure. In addition to its ability to form hydrogen bonds, this may derive from its greater extension from the helix axis than proline. Our findings are reminiscent of those obtained for YadA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], in that we also observed promiscuous binding to the CLC peptides, which was strongly dependent on hydrophobic residues. However, in the case of YadA, the number of GPO triplets and number of both Pro and Hyp also correlated with affinity.</p>
<p>The molecular complex described here explains how GAS of the M3 type achieve very strong binding to collagens. While the affinity for the triple helical peptides measured here by ITC is moderate, the presence of two binding sites on the HVR that is found at the distal end of each M3 protein suggests cooperative binding in the context of larger collagen assemblies. Most likely the bacteria do not encounter isolated triple-helices, but higher-order collagen structures made of bundles of triple helices. It can be envisaged how M3 proteins probably intercalate between triple helices in such higher-order assemblies. Given the high density of M proteins on GAS surfaces, this would generate a highly polyvalent host-bacteria interface with the HVR acting as an anchor binding M3 perpendicularly to collagen fibrils/fibers. It is also at this higher-order structural level that an explanation for the ability of M3 to induce an anti-collagen autoimmune response might be found. In the rare autoimmune disease Goodpasture syndrome, an anti-collagen response is thought to be caused by collagen IV neoepitopes, with infections being suggested as one possible cause for their exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. It is conceivable that such neoepitopes could be generated as a result of collagen structural changes caused by M3 protein binding. However, such structural rearrangements could not be observed in our simplified molecular system, and our data cannot provide evidence backing the anti-collagen hypothesis of post-streptococcal rheumatic sequelae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] beyond providing the molecular basis for collagen recognition by M3 protein.</p>
<p>The structural data presented here allow us to conclude that collagen binding by M proteins relies on the presence of a T-shaped helical bundle domain combined with key residues to provide shape complementarity to tropocollagen triple helices. But even if all GAS M protein variants included in our sequence analysis bound collagens in a similar manner to M3, this would still indicate that M3-like collagen binding mechanism is rare among GAS M protein variants. Based on data published for M55, which was found to bind comparably weakly to collagen IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], it seems likely that M3 and closely related serotypes have a unique ability to bind collagens in the way described here. AlphaFold3 predictions support this, yielding converging structural models for the M3-collagen peptide complex that closely resembled our experimental structure. This was also true for M31 and M222. However, predictions with M12 and M55 resulted in low-confidence, non-converging structural models with poorly defined binding sites, and/or disruption of the T-fold (<xref rid="figs6f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, highly confident structural predictions together with conservation of key residues suggests the M3-like collagen binding mechanism is shared by SDSE and SESZ M proteins (<xref rid="figs6f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This has previously been experimentally validated for the FOG (or Stg11) protein of SDSE, which was found to bind to collagens I and IV with high affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. SDSE, in the past often associated with animal infections, is increasingly recognized as a highly prevalent human pathogen closely resembling GAS in terms of virulence traits and pathologies, including invasive infections, post-infection autoimmune sequelae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] and biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Collagen binding by M proteins may be therefore a far more common virulence mechanism in human streptococcal infections than the prevalence of <italic>emm</italic>3 GAS alone would suggest. It should be noted, too, that a new <italic>emm</italic>3 variant, <italic>emm</italic>3.93, is currently emerging in the UK and the Netherlands, with a high prevalence in invasive infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>].</p>
<p>The interaction between M protein and collagen has implications for several biological functions, including bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. In this study, we investigated biofilm formation due to the high prevalence of <italic>emm</italic>3 strains in necrotizing soft tissue infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], in which biofilm is complicating feature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Our findings reveal that the M3 protein-collagen interaction promotes biofilm in <italic>emm</italic>3 strains. Notably, for other <italic>emm</italic> types the presence of collagen appears to have an opposing effect, reducing bacterial attachment and biofilm <italic>in vitro</italic> for other <italic>emm</italic> types. This type-specific difference is further supported by observations within infected tissue where <italic>emm</italic>3 but not <italic>emm</italic>1 strains co-localize with collagen fibers. These findings highlight the importance of collagen for <italic>emm</italic>3 biofilm development in the tissue setting, while other GAS <italic>emm</italic> types likely utilize other mechanisms. Further studies are warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms of biofilm formation in streptococcal tissue infections, including not only GAS but also SDSE strains.</p>

The cells were grown in LB media containing 100 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> ampicillin at 37 °C for 3 h after growth to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6, and induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The fusion protein was purified from bacterial cell lysate using a GSTrap 4B column according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Cytiva). The recombinant protein comprised GST fused to a proteolytic cleavage site (not used in this study) and the N-terminus of M3 (UniProt entry A0A0H2UWN1), lacking N-terminal secretion signal, cell wall anchor and membrane spanning region (residues 42-546).</p>
<p>M3-NTD constructs were overexpressed from pEHISTEV plasmid in <italic>E. coli</italic> soluBL21 cells (Genlantis), in a standard LB medium supplemented with 50 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> kanamycin. An overnight culture was used to inoculate flasks containing 1 L of the growth medium which were incubated at 37 °C with shaking. When the optical density at 600nm was 0.5-0.8 expression was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1mM. After 3-4 h of further incubation with shaking the cells were harvested and frozen. For selenomethionine labelling the pHT-M3-NTD [Ile60Met, Ile141Met] plasmid was introduced into the methionine auxotroph strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>, B834, which was obtained from Dr Clarissa Melo Czekster. The cells from the overnight culture were washed twice with M9 minimal media, resuspended in 0.2x the initial volume and used to inoculate (10 mL per L) of SelenoMet medium (Molecular Dimensions) supplemented with 0.04 mg L<sup>-1</sup> L-selenomethionine (ThermoFisher). Following induction of expression, the cells were incubated with shaking for 5 h.</p>
<p>Cell pellets were resuspended in 50-100 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500 mM NaCl lysis buffer supplemented with one cOmplete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche) and 1 mg DNAse I (Merck). The suspension was passed twice through a Cell Disrupter (Constant Systems) at 30 kpsi and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 25 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a HisTrap column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated in the lysis buffer and the bound protein was washed with 10 column volumes of the wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) and eluted in a linear gradient (20-250 mM imidazole). To remove imidazole and the N-terminal purification tag, the eluate was mixed with TEV protease (produced in-house) at approximately 30:1 stoichiometric ratio and dialyzed overnight at room temperature against PBS supplemented with 1 mM DTT. The digested protein solution was passed through the HisTrap column again, with PBS as the mobile phase, and M3-NTD collected in the flow-through. Following concentration in 10 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore) the protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using Superdex75 10/300 column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated in PBS. Purity and oxidation state were verified by SDS-PAGE. If some monomeric protein was still evident on the gel the fractions from size exclusion chromatography were left overnight at 4 °C. Fully oxidised protein was concentrated, aliquoted and flash frozen.</p>

<p>Crystallization trials were conducted using the vapor diffusion sitting drop method and several sparse matrix screens. M3-NTD protein construct was freshly purified by size-exclusion chromatography and concentrated to ∼700 µM. For co-crystallization with JDM238 peptide, the protein was concentrated to 1 mM and then diluted by adding reconstituted peptide so that the final concentration of M3-NTD was ∼700 µM with triple-helical peptide at ∼1.1 mM (1:1.5 ratio). The crystals of M3-NTD grew at 20 °C within 1-2 weeks in 40-50% MPD, and the best one diffracted to 1.92 Å resolution. They were used for streak-seeding the selenomethionine-labelled protein, which resulted in shard-like crystals diffracting to 2.67 Å with the data collected at the selenium K absorption edge.

Data from both CLCs were pooled, and the amino acid abundance in the three groups was compared. For each peptide from CLC-II and CLC-III, the number of occurrences of each amino acid of interest was noted.

<p>In this paper, the authors report <bold>important</bold> structural and functional findings on the interaction of how the group A streptococci (GAS) M3 protein (expressed on GAS strains emm3, which are associated with invasive disease) binds to human collagens. They demonstrate an unusual T-shaped structure within the N-terminal hypervariable region of M3 protein that can bind two copies of collagen triple helix in parallel. These <bold>solid</bold> data advance understanding of how GAS M3 interacts with human collagen, information relevant to understanding and developing treatments for GAS infection. A major limitation of the work is the lack of mutational work to test if the T-shaped structure is necessary for binding collagen.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wojnowska et al. report structural and functional studies of the interaction of Streptococcus pyogenes M3 protein with collagen. They show through X-ray crystallographic studies that the N-terminal hypervariable region of M3 protein forms a T-like structure and that the T-like structure binds a three-stranded collagen-mimetic peptide. They indicate that the T-like structure is predicted by AlphaFold3 (with varying confidence level) in other M proteins that have sequence similarity to M3 protein and M-like proteins from group C and G streptococci. For some, but not all, of these related M and M-like proteins, AlphaFold3 predicts complexes similar to the one observed for M3-collagen. Functionally, the authors show that emm3 strains form biofilms with more mass when surfaces are coated with collagen, and this effect can be blocked by an M3 protein fragment that contains the T-structure. They also show the co-occurrence of emm3 strains and collagen in patient biopsies and a skin tissue organoid.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is well-written and the data presented is mostly sound.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, a major limitation of the paper is that it is almost entirely observational and fails to draw a causal relationship. This is mainly due to the near-total absence of mutational studies.</p>

<p>Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A streptococci (GAS) can cause diseases ranging from skin and mucosal infections, to plasma invasion, and post-infection autoimmune syndromes. M proteins are essential GAS virulence factors that include an N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR). M proteins are known to bind to numerous human proteins; a small subset of M proteins were reported to bind collagen, which is thought to promote tissue adherence. In this paper, the authors characterize M3 interactions with collagen and its role in biofilm formation. Specifically, they screened different collagen type II and III variants for full-length M3 protein binding using an ELISA-like method, detecting anti-GST antibody signal. By statistical analysis, hydrophobic amino acids and hydroxyproline were found to positively support binding, whereas acidic residues and proline negatively impacted binding (Table 1). The authors applied X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the N-terminal domain (42-151 amino acids) of M3 protein (M3-NTD). M3-NTD dimmer (PDB 8P6K) forms a T-shaped structure with three helices (H1, H2, H3), which are stabilized by a hydrophobic core, inter-chain salt bridges and hydrogen bonds on H1, H2 helices, and H3 coiled coil. The conserved Gly113 serves as the turning point between H2 and H3 (Figure 5). The M3-NTD is co-crystalized with a 24-residue peptide, JDM238, to determine the structure of M3-collagen binding. The structure (PDB 8P6J) shows that two copies of collagen in parallel bind to H1 and H2 of M3-NTD. Among the residues involved in binding, conserved Try96 is shown to play a critical role supported by structure and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The authors also apply a crystal-violet assay and fluorescence microscopy to determine that M3 is involved in collagen type I binding, but not M1 or M28 (Figure 9). Tissue biopsy staining indicates that M3 strains co-localize with collagen IV-containing tissue, while M1 strains do not. The authors provide generally compelling evidence to show that GAS M3 protein binds to collagen, and plays a critical role in forming biofilms, which contribute to disease pathology. This is a very well-executed study and a well-written report relevant to understanding GAS pathogenesis and approaches to combatting disease; data are also applicable to emerging human pathogen Streptococcus dysgalactiae. One caveat that was not entirely resolved is if/how different collagen types might impact M3 binding and function. Due to the technical constraints, the in vitro structure and other binding assays use type II collagen whereas in vivo, biofilm formation assays and tissue biopsy staining use type I and IV collagen; it was unclear if this difference is significant. One possibility is that M3 has an unbiased binding to all types of collagens, only the distribution of collagens leads to the finding that M3 binds to type IV (basement membrane) and type I (varies of tissue including skin), rather than type II (cartilage).</p>

<p>Many thanks for assessing our submission. We are grateful for the reviews and recommendations that will inform a revised version of the paper, which will include additional data and modified text to take into account the reviewers’ comments.</p>
<p>We appreciate Reviewer #1’s suggestion regarding the use of mutational work to demonstrate that collagen binding is indeed dependent on the T-shaped fold. However, we believe that this approach is neither feasible nor necessary for our study. Instead, we propose to measure collagen binding to a monomeric form of M3, which preserves all residues including the ones involved in binding, but cannot form the T-shaped structure. This will achieve the same as unravelling the T fold through mutations, but at the same time removes the risk of directly affecting binding through altering residues that are involved in both binding and definition of the T fold.</p>
<p>Structural biology is by its nature observational, which is not a limitation but the very purpose of this approach. Our study goes beyond observing structures. We identify a critical residue within a previously mapped binding site, and demonstrate through mutagenesis a causal link between presence of this residue on a tertiary fold and collagen binding activity. We will firm up our mutational experiments with a characterisation of the M3 Tyr96 variants to confirm that these mutations did not affect the overall fold. We further demonstrate that the interaction between M3 and collagen promotes biofilm formation as observed in patient biopsies and a tissue model of infection. We show that other streptococci, that do not possess a surface protein presenting collagen binding sites like M3, do not form collagen-dependent biofilm. We therefore do not think that criticising our study for being almost entirely observational is justified.</p>
<p>We thank Reviewer #2 for the thorough analysis of our reported findings. The main criticism here concerns the question if binding of emm3 streptococci would differ for different types of collagen. We will address this point in the revised manuscript. Our collagen peptide binding assays together with the structural data identify the collagen triple helix as the binding site for M3. While collagen types differ in their functions and morphology in various tissues, they all have in common triple-helical tropocollagen regions (with very high sequence similarity) that are non-specifically recognised by M3. Therefore, our data in conjunction with the body of published work showing binding of M3 to collagens I, II, III and IV suggest it is highly likely that emm3 streptococci will indeed bind to many if not all types of collagen in the same manner. Whether this means all collagen types, in the various tissues where they occur, are targeted by emm3 streptococci is a very interesting question, however one that goes beyond the scope of our study.</p>
