<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> (<italic>S. suis</italic>) is an important zoonotic pathogen causing substantial economic losses in the swine industry. <italic>S. suis</italic> serotype 2 (SS2) is often isolated from the diseased. <italic>S. suis</italic> expresses capsular polysaccharide (CPS), a virulence factor crucial for their survival in the blood. However, the role of CPS in the pathogenesis of <italic>S. suis</italic> is incomplete. Here, we showed a dynamic regulation of CPS in <italic>S. suis</italic> pathogenesis. In a mouse infection model, an SS2 strain (05ZYH33) was detected in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as early as 30 min after intranasal inoculation without bacteremia. Histological analysis revealed that 05ZYH33 in the nasal cavity invaded the olfactory epithelium, resulting in early brain inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy showed that 05ZYH33 isolated from NALT and CSF at early infection time had a thin layer of CPS, and those detected in the blood 5 h post-inoculation showed a much thicker CPS. In addition, adoptive transfer of anti-CPS restricted 05ZYH33 in the blood but not in NALT or CSF. However, an antiserum directed to multiple non-CPS virulence factors (anti-V5) efficiently inhibited 05ZYH33 in NALT, CSF, and blood. Thus, 05ZYH33 colonizes NALT more efficiently without CPS and subsequently invades the meninges through the olfactory nerve system. These findings provide valuable information for the treatment of <italic>S. suis</italic> infection and the development of vaccines across serotypes of <italic>S. suis</italic> by targeting CPS-independent immunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>(A) <italic>S. suis</italic> is a zoonotic pathogen in the porcine industry. Thirty-three serotypes of <italic>S. suis</italic> have been described to date based on the capsular polysaccharides (CPS). The <italic>S. suis</italic> serotype most frequently isolated from diseased swine and humans is serotype 2 (SS2). <italic>S. suis</italic> is commonly found in NALT of asymptomatic piglets. Under some unknown conditions, <italic>S. suis</italic> can reach and survive in the blood and invade the brain to cause meningitis and multi-organ dissemination. Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is a cause of mortality in piglets with the disease. CPS is essential for survival of <italic>S. suis</italic> in the bloodstream and is recognized as an important virulence factor of this bacterial pathogen. However, the role of CPS in the pathogenesis of S<italic>. suis</italic> and the function of CPS-induced immunity in SS2 protection is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The opsonizing antibodies targeting CPS are protective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] but only partially protect against infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, a CPS-glycoconjugated vaccine protected parenterally challenged piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], but protection by anti-CPS has not been demonstrated in animals challenged through the intranasal route, which is a common natural infection route of <italic>S. suis</italic>.</p>
<p>Synthesis of CPS is enhanced in the bloodstream and reduced in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments revealed that the presence of CPS attenuated 05ZYH33 invasion of epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and that unencapsulated mutants displayed increased rates of invasion of the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. These observations suggest that <italic>S. suis</italic> regulates CPS synthesis to fit hosts. However, despite the proposal of this hypothesis more than two decades ago, there is still no direct evidence of such encapsulation modulation for <italic>S. suis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Two pathways have been exploited by meningeal pathogens to access the CNS: penetrating the blood–brain barrier (BBB) or the BCSFB through the blood or directly accessing the CNS via the olfactory or trigeminal nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Some human meningeal pathogens, such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, can directly transmigrate from the nasal mucosa into the CNS through the olfactory nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Similar to these meningeal pathogens, the predominant route of <italic>S. suis</italic> infection in pigs is through the upper respiratory tract (URT), which may provide the opportunity for <italic>S. suis</italic> to transmigrate directly to the CNS from the nasal cavity.</p>
<p>Studies on <italic>S. suis</italic> commonly use parenteral infection models that bypass colonization of the URT, thus this critical step of <italic>S. suis</italic> pathogenesis is largely unexplored. In the present study, mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 05ZYH33, and the infection process was monitored. We show that 05ZYH33 regulated the synthesis of CPS at different stages of infection and that 05ZYH33 migrated to the CNS from the nasal cavity independent of CPS before it entered the blood. Moreover, we revealed that immunity against non-CPS virulence factors of <italic>S. suis</italic> efficiently prevented nasal–CNS transmigration and subsequent progress of the infection.</p>

<title><italic>S. suis</italic> serotypes regulated CPS synthesis in different culture phases</title>
<p>A clinical isolate of <italic>S. suis</italic> serotype 2 wild type (05ZYH33) was cultured and collected in the lag, logarithmic (log), and stationary phases [optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.20, 0.60, and 0.80, respectively] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The CPS of 05ZYH33 collected in different growth phases was quantitated based on hydrophobicity in a bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (BATH) assay. High surface hydrophobicity leads to high bacterial adherence to hydrocarbon (high BATH value) and reflects low levels of CPS on the surface of 05ZYH33. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, the CPS-deficient strain Δ2BSS2 (05ZYH33 isogenic), used as a control, exhibited the highest BATH value (69.5 ± 6.51%). A similarly high BATH value (62.5 ± 9.73%) was found in the log phase of 05ZYH33. However, the BATH values in the lag and stationary phases of 05ZYH33 were substantially lower (37.0 ± 17% and 15.6 ± 9.2%, respectively). These data indicate that CPS of 05ZYH33 was synthesized dynamically <italic>in vitro</italic>, with the highest quantity in the stationary phase and the lowest in the log phase.</p>

<title>05ZYH33 in different cultural stages exhibited altered abilities for host cell adherence and resistance to phagocytic killing</title>
<p>05ZYH33 and Δ2BSS2 were cultured and collected at the log and stationary phases to determine the effects of CPS on the binding of 05ZYH33 to epithelial cells. The adherence assay showed that while 16.5 ± 5.2% of Δ2BSS2 was associated with epithelial cells (HEp-2), only 4.96 ± 3.26% of 05ZYH33 in the log phase and 2.05 ± 1.58% of 05ZYH33 in the stationary phase were associated with the cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The bacterial binding was Δ2BSS2 &gt; 05ZYH33 in the log phase &gt; 05ZYH33 in the stationary phase. Similar binding patterns of 05ZYH33 and Δ2BSS2 were also observed in the assay using human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs), the major component of the BBB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). These results indicate that CPS reduces adherence of the bacteria to host cells.</p>

<p>CPS of <italic>S. suis</italic> plays a critical role in the resistance to phagocytosis. 05ZYH33 in different growth phases were co-incubated with the blood from naïve mice to determine the effect of CPS on phagocytic killing. After incubation for 3 h, surviving bacteria in the blood examined by colony-forming units (CFUs) showed that substantially more 05ZYH33 in the log and stationary phases were detected compared with Δ2BSS2 in the matching growth phases. In addition, there were more surviving 05ZYH33 in the stationary phase compared with that in the log phase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results suggested that a lack of CPS may facilitate adherence in a host, while high levels of CPS confer resistance to phagocytic killing in the blood.</p>

<title>The course of 05ZYH33 infection in mice following intranasal inoculation</title>
<p>The dynamic synthesis of CPS associated with differential adherence to host cells and resistance to phagocytosis <italic>in vitro</italic> suggested that 05ZYH33 regulates CPS synthesis for pathogenesis and survival in a host. To determine the role of CPS dynamic synthesis in 05ZYH33 pathogenesis, mice were i.n. inoculated with 05ZYH33 to simulate <italic>S. suis</italic> natural infection in pigs and CFUs in various bodily compartments were assessed at different points over 120 h. By 0.5 h after inoculation, CFUs of 05ZYH33 in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), a pig tonsil homologue and the major niche for <italic>S. suis</italic> in pigs, and the lungs were similar (5 × 10<sup>5</sup>) and gradually reduced with time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>), suggesting that the CFUs in the lungs are from the nasal cavity. Up to 10<sup>5</sup> CFUs were also found in CSF samples by 0.5 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The curves of CFUs in NALT, the lungs, and CSF showed a similar trend, which was a high level for a few hours followed by a gradual reduction with increasing days. In contrast, 05ZYH33 was not detected in the blood until 5.0 h after inoculation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). As expected, CFUs in the spleen and heart at indicated times (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>) were similar to those in the blood, indicating that they disseminated from the circulation. These findings suggested that 05ZYH33 in the nasal cavity can transmigrate to the lungs and CNS before bacteremia and disseminate to other organs after entering the blood. During the five days (120 h) following inoculation, the mice did not show significant disease symptoms, and their physical conditions were similar compared to non-infected mice (body weight, appetite, and activity). No obvious disease symptoms might be due to the bacteria cleared relatively quickly.</p>

<title>The CPS of 05ZYH33 was synthesized differentially in stages of infection in mice</title>
<p>05ZYH33 was isolated from the bodily compartments of mice 12 h after inoculation. The 12 h of infection allows the detection of the bacteria in different body compartments of the infected mice. Following enriched by culturing the isolates in TSB to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.7 CPS synthesis <italic>in vivo</italic> was determined by BATH assay. The hydrophobicity of isolates from NALT and the CSF was lower compared with that of Δ2BSS2, but higher than that of the isolates from the blood (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). This indicates that 05ZYH33 downregulates CPS synthesis when it colonizes the nasopharyngeal mucosa or enters the CNS and upregulates CPS synthesis upon entering the blood. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed directly on 05ZYH33 isolated from mice without <italic>in vitro</italic> culture to confirm the BATH assay results. For cultured strains without mouse infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4Ba, b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">c</xref>), similar to Δ2BSS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4Ba</xref>), there was no CPS observed on one side of dividing 05ZYH33 cell and only a thin and partial layer of CPS on the other side of the cell in the log phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4Bb</xref>) and a thicker layer of CPS was observed in the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4Bc</xref>). For 05ZYH33 isolated directly from infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4Bd, e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">f</xref>), the CPS was much thicker in the blood isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4Bf</xref>) compared with that of the NALT isolates where it was thinner and much sparser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4Bd</xref>). In contrast, the outermost layer of the isolates from the CSF was highly dense without an apparent CPS layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4Be</xref>), suggesting that CPS is downregulated, and the membrane components of the CSF isolates are changed. These findings support that CPS is downregulated for colonization and upregulated in the blood to avoid phagocytic killing.</p>

<title>An antiserum against non-CPS virulence factors of <italic>S. suis</italic> reduced 05ZYH33 colonization in NALT, CSF, and lungs</title>
<p>We have previously demonstrated that immunization with multiple non-CPS virulence factors of <italic>S. suis</italic> (named V5) prevents 05ZYH33 colonization of the nasal mucosa and neuropathological symptoms in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. We hypothesized that the serum against V5 would inhibit the nasal–CNS transmigration of 05ZYH33. Mice were i.n. infused with anti-V5 or anti-CPS serum, inoculated i.n. with 05ZYH33 6 h later, then euthanized 12 h post-inoculation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) to detect the bacteria in different body compartments of the infected mice. In mice that received antisera through the i.n. route, CFUs reduced in all examined compartments of anti-V5 recipients but only reduced in the lungs and blood of anti-CPS recipients (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). These results indicated that 05ZYH33 survival in the blood depends on CPS and nasopharyngeal colonization and nasal–CNS transmigration are more dependent on non-CPS molecules of 05ZYH33. In addition, when mice received either anti-V5 or anti-CPS through the intravenous (i.v.) route, CFUs were reduced in the lungs and blood but not in NALT and the CSF (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), compared with mice received naïve serum through the i.v. route. These results indicate that systemic immunity can efficiently protect against infection in the lungs and blood but not against colonization in the nasal mucosal and CNS, at least at the early infection time.</p>

<title>Early 05ZYH33 colonization in the CNS was reduced by anti-V5 but not anti-CPS serum</title>
<p>The simultaneous early 05ZYH33 colonization in NALT and CNS support a nasal– CSF transmigration. To exclude the possibility that CFUs in the CNS at 12 h post-infection is disseminated from the circulation, mice received antisera via the i.n. route and were inoculated with 05ZYH33 as before, then CFUs were determined 1 h post-inoculation before the bacteria entered the blood (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, CFUs in NALT and the CSF of anti-CPS recipients were similar to those in naïve-serum recipients; however, those in NALT and the CSF of anti-V5 recipients were 10-fold lower compared with those of the naïve-serum recipients. To confirm that the nasal–CNS transmigration is independent of CPS, mice received naïve serum or anti-V5 via the i.n. route, then were inoculated with Δ2BSS2. One hour later, we found 4.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> CFUs in NALT and 2.1 x 10<sup>5</sup> CFUs in the CFS of naïve-serum recipients. However, CFUs were 10-fold and 100-fold lower in NALT and the CSF, respectively, of anti-V5 recipients compared with those in naïve-serum recipients (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). These results demonstrate that 05ZYH33 in the CNS in the early infection is from the nasal cavity independent of CPS.</p>

<title>The olfactory nerve is the invasion route of 05ZYH33 for nasal<bold>–</bold>CNS transmigration</title>
<p>The olfactory nerve is a port of entry to the meninges for some human meningeal pathogens and is the likely the route of the early CNS dissemination by 05ZYH33. Histological analysis of the anatomical structures in the distal nasal cavity and olfactory epithelium in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> showed that 1 h post-infection, the bacteria were closely associated with ciliated respiratory epithelium in the nasal cavity (NC) and grouped bacteria were spread in the subepithelial tissue with significant tissue damage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A<italic>, b</italic></xref>). Scattered bacteria were in close contact with the olfactory epithelium (OE) and lamina propria (LP), accompanied by severely destroyed tissue (indicated by the loss of immunofluorescence signal in the area) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A<italic>, d</italic></xref>). Large groups of bacteria were observed within the olfactory bulb (OB) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A, <italic>f</italic></xref>). These observations suggest that 05ZYH33 in the nasal cavity could invade the olfactory epithelium through the sensory neurons protruding into the NC and subsequently enter the brain along the sensory neurons at the cribriform plate. Histological analysis of the brain in 05ZYH33-infected mice revealed that inflammatory cells were infiltrated in the brain tissue with surrounding edema at 1 h post-inoculation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B, <italic>c</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">d</xref>). The pathological changes were more severe 9 days after 05ZYH33 inoculation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B, <italic>e</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">f</xref>), which could be resulted from both nasal–CNS transmigration and 05ZYH33 dissemination from the blood. Thus, nasal–CNS transmigration is an efficient route of <italic>S. suis</italic>-mediated CNS infection.</p>

<p>Mice were pretreated with acetic acid to increase the sensitivity to 05ZYH33 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. To exclude that nasal-CNS transmigration results from irritation of the nasopharyngeal mucosa by acetic acid, mice were infected without acid treatment (pretreated with PBS). One hour post-inoculation CFUs were found in the CSF of the mice even though the numbers were lower than those of acidic acid-treated mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). CFUs were also detected in the CSF when mice were infected with Δ2BSS2 without acid treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). These results indicated that nasal-CSF transmission takes place without acidic acid and independent of CPS and that irritation of the nasopharyngeal mucosa facilitates nasal-CNS transmission.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CPS is an important virulence factor of <italic>S. suis</italic>, but its role in <italic>S. suis</italic> pathogenesis is controversial. Most animal models in studies of <italic>S. suis</italic> employ the intraperitoneal (i.p.) or i.v. route for infection, which bypass the nasopharynx, the natural infection route of <italic>S. suis</italic>. In this study, CPS thickness of <italic>S. suis</italic> SS2 strain 05ZYH33 was monitored in an i.n. infection mouse model. The results indicate that 05ZYH33 downregulates CPS synthesis to promote nasopharyngeal colonization and nasal–CNS transmigration at early time and upregulates CPS to escape phagocytic killing later in the blood. The study also indicates that CPS-independent immunity can prevent nasal–CNS transmigration and the progression of 05ZYH33 infection.</p>
<p>Clinical CNS symptoms in pigs are often preceded by a phase of bacteremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], indicating that <italic>S. suis</italic> meningitis results from the dissemination of bacteria from the blood through the BBB or the blood–CSF barrier. Our study revealed that, like some human meningeal pathogens, the olfactory nerve epithelium provides an alternative route for 05ZYH33 invasion to the CNS. Swine influenza virus (SIV) infection was reported to promote <italic>S. suis</italic> invasion of deeper tissues by damaging epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Nasopharyngeal inflammation by co-infected <italic>S. suis</italic> and SIV could cause tissue damage to the olfactory epithelium, which may exacerbate nasal–CNS entry. As the mouse is not a natural host of <italic>S. suis</italic> and is insensitive to the infection, a relatively high dosage is needed for optimal bacterial retention in NALT, which can lead bacteria into the lungs. Thus, early 05ZYH33 colonization in the lungs of this model may not reflect the state of S. suis infections in pigs. The early 05ZYH33 colonization in NALT and the CSF with similar dynamics suggests that meningitis could be early manifestations of <italic>S. suis</italic> disease before multi-organ dissemination through the blood. The findings in the study indicate that restriction of <italic>S. suis</italic> proliferation in NALT is critical to prevent the severity and lethality of <italic>S. suis</italic> disease.</p>
<p>Although CPS plays an important role in <italic>S. suis</italic> survival in the blood, it is not the only component required for the event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Similar to that observed with anti-CPS, infusion of anti-V5 through the i.v. route reduced 05ZYH33 in the blood and lungs, indicating that blocking CPS-independent mechanisms can restrain the progression of 05ZYH33 infection and suggests that non-CPS virulence factors, such as those in V5, are required for 05ZYH33 survival in the blood and lungs. Furthermore, although anti-CPS promoted 05ZYH33 clearance in the blood, it did not prevent 05ZYH33 colonization of the nasal cavity and invasion of the CNS. However, anti-V5 reduced 05ZYH33 in all examined compartments when administered via the i.n. route, supporting that inhibition of nasal colonization by CPS-independent immunity is critical to prevent the progression of the disease. Moreover, the nasal-CNS route may not be the main pathway for clinical meningitis compared to the blood-CNS route. However, mucosal blockage of nasal colonization reduces CFU in the CSF more effectively than systemic antibody, indicating reduction of nasal colonization at early time would significantly prevent the bacteria from entering the CNS through the early nasal and later blood route.</p>
<p>In summary, this study supports an updated <italic>S. suis</italic> infection model. Briefly, 05ZYH33 downregulates CPS to colonize the URT mucosa, where it can transmigrate to the CNS through the olfactory epithelium early in the infection process. 05ZYH33 upregulates CPS to avoid phagocytic killing when it enters the blood, leading to multi-organ dissemination. The regulation of CPS at different stages of 05ZYH33 pathogenesis and the protection offered by CPS-independent immunity provide valuable information for clinical treatment and development of vaccines across serotypes of <italic>S. suis</italic>.</p>

<p>A female New Zealand white rabbit (SPF, 2.0–2.5 kg) was purchased from JinMuYang Laboratory Animal Center (Beijing, China) and kept in the SPF animal facility for 1 week. V5 (1 mg) was mixed with 1 mL incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and subcutaneously injected into the rabbit 4 times at 1-week intervals. Blood samples were harvested 10 days after the last immunization, and the serum was isolated. Anti-CPS (anti-<italic>S. suis</italic> serotype 2) serum was purchased from SSI Diagnostica (Hillerød, Denmark) and purified by absorption with V5 by Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, catalog no. 30210) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Wang et al. investigates the interesting relationship between Streptococcus suis (S. suis) growth phases and levels of virulence factor, specifically the capsular polysaccharide (CPS), in the bacterial cell wall. S. suis is a gram positive bacterial pathogen that causes important losses in the swine industry worldwide. Interestingly, S. suis is also a resident bacteria in the pig tonsils. Vaccination against bacterial infections such as S. suis can be difficult, and understanding how the serotype of a bacterial pathogen impacts what body sites are infected and the dynamics of pathogen dissemination is critical. In this case, this manuscript looks at neuroinvasion of S. suis following intranasal delivery because this pathogen causes meningitis in infected hosts. Further, understanding host - pathogen interactions at early time points in the upper respiratory tract may have broad implications for vaccine development.</p>
<p>The authors use an understudied mouse intranasal infection model of S. suis to connect growth phase related CPS abundance to the pathogenicity of the bacteria in the nose and blood.</p>
<p>Adoptive transfer of serum against either CPS or V5 (five other virulence factors) supports the idea that S. suis CPS levels are an important factor that shapes how this bacterium reaches different organs.</p>
<p>Some conclusions are not completely supported by the present data, and at times the manuscript is disjoint and hard to follow. While the work has some interesting observations, additional experiments and controls are warranted to support the claims of the manuscript .</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The model of intranasal infection is compelling to expand upon work previously done in vitro and with systemic routes of infection. The histology and fluorescent imaging of the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb complement work in figure 2 about the attachment of S. Suis to epithelial cells and the bacterial burden over time in different organs of figure 3. Histology was performed at 1 hour and 9 days after intranasal infection with stationary phase S. Suis and drives home that this pathogen can invade the olfactory nerve and may potentially cause bacterial meningitis seen in some infected swine.</p>
<p>The adoptive transfer of either anti-CPS or anti-V5 to mice before infection at both longer (12 hr), and shorter (1 hr) time points is useful to demonstrate that the changes in cell wall composition between the NALT/CSF and blood compartments result in different efficacy in clearing bacteria from those locations. This is fundamental for the development of vaccines for the swine industry and begs those developing other bacterial vaccines to consider what virulence factors are the most useful as neutralizing antibody targets at the sight of bacterial invasion.</p>
<p>Demonstrating that the amount of CPS within the cell wall of S. suis is related to the growth phase of the bacteria is an important consideration for vaccine development. While others had previously shown that CPS levels were higher in the blood than in the CNS, and that CPS decreases the invasion of epithelial cells, the close look at the olfactory epithelium at an early time point of 1 hr ties together in vitro findings. The control of a CPS-negative strain was critical to understanding their findings. The location and the microbial community that bacterial pathogens live within may change the growth phase and therefore also the cell wall components.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors present compelling data that is relevant to the development of anti-bacterial vaccinations, the data does not completely match their assertions and there are places where some further investigation would further the impact of their interesting study.</p>
<p>Major concerns for the manuscript:</p>
<p>-The intranasal infections were done with S. suis in the stationary phase which has been shown to have less CPS on the cell wall. While this mimics the literature that shows S. Suis to have less CPS in the CNS, the difference in the pathogenesis of a log phase vs. stationary phage intranasal infection would be interesting. Especially because the bacteria is a part of the natural microbial community of swine tonsils, it is curious if the change in growth phase and therefore CPS levels may be a causative reason for pathogenic invasion in some pigs.</p>
<p>-The authors should consider taking the bacteria from NALT/CSF and blood and compare the lag times bacteria from different organs take to enter a log growth phase to show whether the difference in CPS is because S. suis in each location is in a different growth phase. If log phase bacteria were intranasally delivered, would it adapt a stationary phase life strategy? How long would that take?</p>
<p>-Authors should be cautious about claims about S. suis downregulating CPS in the NALT for increased invasion and upregulating CPS to survive phagocytosis in blood. While it is true that the data shows that there are different levels of CPS in these locations, the regulation and mechanism of the recorded and observed cell wall difference are not investigated past the correlation to the growth phase.</p>
<p>- The mouse model used in this manuscript is useful but cannot reproduce the nasal environment of the natural pig host. It is not clear if the NALTs of pigs and mice have similar microbial communities and how this may affect the pathogenesis of S. Suis in the mouse. Because the authors show a higher infection rate in the mouse with acetic acid, they may want to consider investigating what the mouse NALT microenvironment is naturally doing to exclude more bacterial invasion. Is it simply a host mismatch or is there something about the microbiome or steady-state immune system in the nose of mice that is different from pigs?</p>
<p>-I have some concerns regarding the images shown for neuroinvasion because I think the authors mistake several compartments of the mouse nasal cavity as well as the olfactory bulb. These issues are critical because neuroinvasion is one of the major conclusions of this work.</p>

<p>In this manuscript from Wang et al., the authors seek to examine the role of capsular polysaccharides (CPS) in invasive S. suis pathogenesis. They show that CPS thickness variations associate with isolation from different compartments within the infected mouse and that CPS promotes resistance to blood borne immune mechanisms. The authors conclude that thick CPS inhibits colonization/invasion of the NALT and rather antisera against non-CPS. These results are interesting and thought provoking and provide the continued basis for future experiments that delve further into immune mechanisms. However, there are serious concerns about data collection and interpretation that require further data to provide an accurate conclusion. Some of these concerns are highlighted below:</p>
<p>In figure 2, the authors conclude that high levels of CPS confer resistance to phagocytic killing in blood exposed S. suis. However, it seems equally likely that this is resistance against complement mediated killing. It would be important to compare S. suis killing in animals depleted of complement components (C3 and C5-9).</p>
<p>Intranasal administration non-CPS antisera provides a nice contrast to intravenous administration, especially in light of the recently identified &quot;blood-olfactory barrier&quot;. Can the authors provide any insight into how long and where this antibody would be located after intranasal administration? Would this be antibody mediated cellular resistance, or something akin to simple antibody &quot;neutralization&quot;</p>
<p>The micrographs in Figure 7 depict anatomy from the respiratory mucosa. While there is no histochemical identification of neurons, the tissues labeled OE are almost certainly not olfactory and in fact respiratory. However, more troubling is that in figures 7A,a,b,e, and f, the lateral nasal organ has been labeled as the olfactory bulb. This undermines the conclusion of CNS invasion, and also draws into question other experiments in which the brain and CSF are measured.</p>
<p>Micrographs of brain tissue in 7B are taken from distal parts of the brain, whereas if olfactory neuroinvasion were occurring, the bacteria would be expected to arrive in the olfactory bulb. It's also difficult to understand how an inflammatory process would be developed to this point in the brain -even if we were looking at the appropriate region of the brain -within an hour of inoculation (is there a control for acetic acid induced brain inflammation?). Some explanations about the speed of the immune responses recorded are warranted.</p>
<p>The detected presence of S. suis in the CSF 0.5hr following intranasal inoculation is difficult to understand from an anatomical perspective. This is especially true when the amount of S. suis is nearly the same as that found within the NALT. Even motile pathogens would need far longer than 0.5hr to get into the brain, so it's exceedingly difficult to understand how this could occur so extensively in under an hour. The authors are quantifying CSF as anything that comes out of the brain after mincing. Firstly, this should more accurately be referred to as &quot;brain&quot;, not CSF. Secondly, is it possible that the lateral nasal organ -which is mistakenly identified as olfactory bulb in figure 7- is being included in the CNS processing? This would explain the equivalent amounts of S. suis in NALT and &quot;CSF&quot;.</p>
<p>To support their conclusions about neuroinvasion along the olfactory route and /CSF titer the authors should provide more compelling images to support this conclusion: sections stained for neurons and S. suis, images of the actual olfactory bulb (neurons, glomerular structure etc).</p>
