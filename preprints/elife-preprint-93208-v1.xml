<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The RNA world hypothesis proposes that during the early evolution of life, primordial genomes of the first self-propagating evolutionary units existed in the form of RNA-like polymers. Autonomous, non-enzymatic and sustained replication of such information carriers presents a problem, because product formation and mutual hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication speed. Kinetics of growth is then parabolic with the benefit of entailing competitive coexistence, thereby maintaining diversity. Here, we test the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under the constraints of constant total population size and chemostat conditions. We found that large population sizes and small differences in the replication rates favor the coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species (“genes”), while the error-threshold problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification. In addition, sequence effects (GC content) and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic parabolic growth could thus have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Current knowledge of nucleotide chemistry as well as a large body of indirect evidence from recent organisms support the RNA-world hypothesis; a concept that once RNA fulfilled the role of an evolvable primordial informational polymer and biochemical reaction catalyst at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Woese, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Crick, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Orgel, 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gilbert, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benner et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Joyce, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). However, the initial weaknesses of the original RNA-world hypothesis, such as those concerning the lack of a reliable replication mechanism and the consequential loss of heritable information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bernhardt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Szostak, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Le Vay &amp; Mutschler, 2019</xref>) have prompted scientists studying the origin of life to devise a wide variety of physicochemically refined models of the RNA-world. A remarkable concept among these suggests that prior to template replication of complex polymers catalyzed by an RNA polymerase ribozyme (i.e., replicase), genetic information and catalytic functions were distributed among short sequence modules that could be occasionally ligated to increase molecular complexity in a stepwise manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vlassov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Manrubia &amp; Briones, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Briones et al., 2009</xref>). Replication of these short sequence modules, although they may have already showed some catalytic properties, could have occurred in the absence of a replicase ribozyme, driven by some template directed, non-enzymatic replication mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">von Kiedrowski, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zielinski &amp; Orgel, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Patzke &amp; von Kiedrowski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Leu et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2013</xref>). Consistent with this, it has been experimentally demonstrated that activated oligonucleotides can act as catalysts for nonenzymatic replication of RNA containing all four nucleotides, with the fidelity sufficient to sustain a genome size large enough to encode active ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Prywes et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>If enzyme-free replication of oligomer modules with a high degree of sequence variability were attainable from prebiotic chemistry, then it becomes a vital issue how a critical level of diversity of the associated genetic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Szostak, 2011</xref>) would be preserved under ecological competition conditions with which distinct replicator types with different competitive abilities (e.g., replicabilities) inevitably encountered to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eigen, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Szathmáry, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maynard Smith &amp; Szathmáry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jiménez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2017</xref>). This recognition highlighted the importance of deciphering the coexistence mechanisms that can alleviate the competition among independently replicating information carrying modules in such systems. For instance, parabolic growth dynamics, a kinetic behavior observed in non-enzymatic self-replicating systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">von Kiedrowski, 1986</xref>), has been proposed as an ideal candidate mechanism to sustain a large amount of prebiotic genetic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Szathmáry &amp; Gladkih, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scheuring &amp; Szathmáry, 2001</xref>). In this kinetics, the growth order <italic>p</italic>, which reflects how easily the template-reaction product complex dissociates, is equal or close to 0.5 (i.e., the dynamics is sub-exponential) because dissociation is rate-limiting for the reaction product formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">von Kiedrowski et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">von Kiedrowski &amp; Szathmáry, 2001</xref>). This is in sharp contrast to exponential growth, where <italic>p</italic> = 1 implies maximum dissociation that allows for fast autocatalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tjivikua et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">von Kiedrowski et al., 1991</xref>). Thus, replicating individuals in populations displaying parabolic growth kinetics are inherently prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation; a feature that can efficiently alleviate competition and therefore promoting coexistence. Indeed, parabolic population growth can sustain an unlimited number of competing replicator species in the infinite population size limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Szathmáry &amp; Gladkih, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Varga &amp; Szathmáry, 1997</xref>). However, molecular evolution of the Darwinian type is thought to necessitate exponential, rather than parabolic amplification, because in the latter case robust coexistence of the competing replicator species generally limits the selectivity of the dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sievers &amp; von Kiedrowski, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Szilágyi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Strazewski, 2019</xref>). Therefore, a major current focus in models of parabolic replication is how to incorporate Darwinian selection into its dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lifson &amp; Lifson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scheuring &amp; Szathmáry, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">von Kiedrowski &amp; Szathmáry, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>While the latter models considerably improved the parabolic replication model framework in terms of its potential to incorporate evolvability, they did not account for the copying error threshold of their respective systems; an error rate of the replication mechanism at which the system’s ability to propagate genetic information from generation to generation is ceased resulting in irreversible loss of sequence-coded information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eigen, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Joyce, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Szostak, 2012</xref>). The possibility that high mutation rates could lead to such an “error catastrophe” is one of the major caveats surrounding the RNA-world hypothesis, given that the first RNA replication mechanisms have probably been inherently error-prone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Manrubia &amp; Briones, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Leu et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, practically no study is known to have focused on parabolic replication in a manner that physicochemical details and ecological constraints together with stochastic effects, which supposedly also have considerable impact on finite systems, would have been taken into consideration. The present study aims to remedy these deficiencies by quantifying the heritable information-maintaining potential of finite populations of unlinked, RNA-like template replicators displaying parabolic growth embedded into a stochastic dynamics. We individually represent the replicator sequences and copying error as well as energetic constraints in strand separation are also taken into account explicitly. Using a constant population model version of this framework, we first investigate how the diversity-maintaining mechanisms operate in the parabolic regime in a finite population of replicators, while sequence effects are also taken into consideration. Then we demonstrate that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates assumed for template-directed, enzyme-free replication, thereby proposing a simple biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in hypothetical information storage systems of the RNA-world. In order for our stochastic simulation results to be comparable with the theoretical error threshold of parabolic dynamics, we analytically calculate the equilibrium master (i.e., fittest sequence) concentrations as the function of the copying fidelity and the reproductive superiority of the master sequences relative to the mutants. In this analysis, we also compare the error threshold of parabolic dynamics to that of the exponential dynamics; an extensively used reference model for investigating the genetic information maintaining ability of early replicator systems in the context of copying fidelity. Finally, in order to validate that Darwinian selection by competitive exclusion is also feasible in this framework, we consider a chemostat model of parabolic replication, where monomer building block resources are additionally taken into account. Using this approach, we demonstrate that increased competition, mediated by a decrease in the resource influx rate, can induce a switch from the coexistence ensured by parabolic dynamics to survival of the fittest variant.</p>

<title>Parabolic replicator model framework</title>
<p>We consider populations of oligomer molecules based on nucleotide-like monomer constituents (to preserve generality for potential informational polymers other than RNA). Individual molecules are represented by their primary (monomeric sequence) structure and are assumed to be involved in a template-directed, non-enzymatic replication mechanism. This replication mode converts a single-stranded plus-, or minus-strand template into a template-copy duplex. Strand separation rates of these duplexes are relatively low compared to strand association (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">von Kiedrowski et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, replication cycles are strongly inhibited and as a result, the population dynamics displays parabolic characteristics. We define a set of replicators with higher fitness relative to mutant genotypes, which we refer to as “master” types, representing the genetic information to be maintained. To analyze the diversity-maintaining ability of parabolic dynamics in a competitive setting, the master replicator types are characterized by different replicabilities. This assumption reflects the fact that, at least in case of RNA, the rate of copying of short templates by polymerization of activated monomers inherently varies with template composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Szostak, 2012</xref>). In order to make our model framework to be more suitable for focusing on different aspects of parabolic dynamics, we considered two different model versions of parabolic replication (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1AB</xref></italic>).</p>

<p>Accordingly, each newly synthesized strand replaces a sequence randomly chosen from the population (that can be either in simplex or duplex state; in the latter case the population size decreases by one until the next replication). The dynamics is based on the following three reaction categories: replication of a single strand <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> (<italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1A">Equation 1A</xref></italic>); association of a single strand <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> with another strand <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> (<italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2A">Equation 2A</xref></italic>), and dissociation of a double strand <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>S</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> (<italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3A">Equation 3A</xref></italic>). The rate constants corresponding to these three reactions are <italic>c</italic><sub>r</sub>, <italic>c</italic><sub>a</sub>, <italic>c</italic><sub>d</sub>, respectively. Mutation events are taken into account during replication. These simple assumptions are in line with the kinetics of template-directed enzyme-free nucleic acid replication (for an experimental system, see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sievers &amp; von Kiedrowski, 1998</xref>).

<title>Chemostat model of parabolic replication</title>
<p>In case of the chemostat model (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></italic>), a constant inflow of monomer building blocks is assumed to supply the synthesis of the new strands, i.e., the dynamics describes an open system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schuster, 2011</xref>). This inflow component, together with type-specific replicability rate constants and a decay component on the replicators as well as outflow of the excess production, determines the time-dependent total number of replicators during the dynamics. The three basic reaction categories are the same as in the constant population model, namely: replication (<italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1B">Equation 1B</xref></italic>), association (<italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2B">Equation 2B</xref></italic>), and dissociation (<italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3B">Equation 3B</xref></italic>), however, the dynamics of the resources is explicitly represented. The common inflow rate of all the four RNA nucleobases is <italic>c</italic><sub>in</sub> (<italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4B">Equation 4B</xref></italic>).

In both model versions, a population consists of replicators with equal length <italic>L</italic> = 10, composed of A, U, G, C nucleobases. We consider randomly generated master sequence sets; however, we impose the constraint that the Hamming distance between any two master sequences must be at least equal to two, to avoid a source-sink type dynamics.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Replication and mutation</title>
<p>To analyze the diversity-maintaining ability of the system, we generate a <italic>T</italic>-membered set of master sequences. The ϕ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> replicability of master sequence type <italic>i</italic> is
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="565370v1_eqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>i</italic> = 1,2, …, <italic>T</italic>. Note that the difference between the lowest and highest replicability is (<italic>T</italic> − 1) · δ, thus, δ can be interpreted as <italic>replicability distance</italic>. Mutations reduce the replicability of master sequences by a predefined error factor: <italic>ϕ</italic> = <italic>ε</italic> · <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, where in case of one mutation, <italic>ε</italic> = 0.2, and with two mutations, <italic>ε</italic> = 0.05 . A <italic>j</italic> sequence with more than two Hamming-distance to <italic>any i</italic> master sequence (Δ<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> &gt; 2) has a baseline replicability: <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> = 0.05<italic>ϕ</italic><sub>min</sub>. To determine the replicability of a given replicator, we compute its replicability against all master types and choose the highest value (for instance, if a replicator is a one-error copy of master type 5, a two-error copy of master type 3 and has more than two errors to all other master types, the replicability of the replicator is 0.2<italic>ϕ</italic><sub>5</sub>). This rule is implemented into the model to treat the (very rarely occurring) situation, when the Δ<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> Hamming-distance of a newly synthesized <italic>j</italic> strand is smaller than 3 to more than one <italic>i</italic> master sequences. For simplicity we assume that the rate constant of replication (see <italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1A">Equation 1A</xref></italic> and <italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1B">Equation 1B</xref></italic>) is equal to the replicability: <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = <italic>ϕ</italic> . Substitution mutations can occur during the replication with the probability <italic>p</italic><sub>mut</sub> per base.

<p>Binding energy (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>) of a duplex (in arbitrary units) is determined by the number of Watson-Crick pairs present in the double strand according to

</disp-formula>
where <italic>n</italic><sub>AU</sub> a nd <italic>n</italic><sub>GC</sub> a re the numbers of A-U and G-C pairs, respectively (frameshift is not allowed). The relatively high melting temperature of GC-rich double-stranded RNAs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Freier et al., 1986</xref>) is considered here by including a prefactor 2 in the H-bond strength of a G-C pair, which renders the binding energy of this pairing to be the double that of an A-U pair. Note that the maximum binding energy is consequently 2<italic>L</italic>. If <italic>n</italic><sub>AU</sub> + <italic>n</italic><sub>GC</sub> &lt; 2, association is not possible due to low duplex stability. As in our model, dissociation of the replicators is an enzyme-free process, the main driving force of the strand-separation mechanism is temperature. Consequently, the dissociation probability (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>diss</italic></sub>) of a duplex with binding energy <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> follows the Boltzmann distribution:
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="565370v1_eqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where κ incorporates the (inverse) temperature and other possible environmental factors that can have potential effects on duplex separation (e.g., ionic concentration, <italic>p</italic>H, etc.), see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Le Vay &amp; Mutschler (2019)</xref>. In order to speed up the convergence, we set the κ value so that the dissociation probability of a duplex with maximum binding energy is 0.01 (i.e., <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>diss</italic></sub>(2<italic>L</italic>) = 0.01). For sake of simplicity we assume that the rate constant of dissociation is equal to the dissociation probability: <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>diss</italic></sub>, see <italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3A">Equation 3A</xref></italic> and <italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3B">Equation 3B</xref></italic>.</p>
<p>The degradation rate of single strands <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565370v1_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is constant, regardless of the sequence. The decay rate of duplex molecules is affected by the binding energy according to
<disp-formula id="eqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="565370v1_eqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where the duplex decay factor parameter <italic>f</italic> allows us to scale the duplex decay rates relative to that of the simplexes. By assuming 0 &lt; <italic>f</italic> ≤ 1 and satisfying the condition of <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> ≥ 2 for every duplex (which is ensured by the <italic>n</italic><sub>AU</sub> + <italic>n</italic><sub>GC</sub> ≥ 2 condition), simplex molecules have higher decay rate than duplexes. This model assumption reflects the fact that the structure of doublestranded RNA provides a certain degree of stability against alkaline hydrolysis in solutions relative to that of single-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The association rate constant is sequence-independent: <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> = 1 for all pairs of single strands. Cross-hybridization between not fully complementary strands is allowed, the binding energy in this case is also computed according to <italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Equation 9</xref></italic>.</p>

<title>Stochastic simulation algorithm</title>
<p>In order to take finite population sizes and stochastic effects into account, we consider an individual-based, stochastic approach of parabolic dynamics. Accordingly, the model is implemented as a Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gillespie, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">1977</xref>) adapting the optimized direct method (ODM) formulation (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cao et al., 2004</xref>; for details). The algorithm randomly chooses a reaction to take place, based on a propensity function that is specified for every <italic>μ</italic> reaction channel as:
<disp-formula id="eqn12">
<graphic xlink:href="565370v1_eqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where μ = 1, …, <italic>M</italic>, and <italic>M</italic> is the number of possible reaction channels, <italic>c</italic><sub>μ</sub> denotes the corresponding rate constant, <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>μ</italic></sub> is the number of the combinatorically distinct potential configurations of <italic>μ</italic> reaction-compatible molecules at time <italic>t. τ</italic> denotes the time when the next reaction occurs after <italic>t</italic>.

</disp-formula>
where <italic>r</italic> is a uniformly distributed random number from the [0, 1] interval. After one of the reactions is chosen and takes place, the frequencies of the corresponding chemical species are updated based on the reaction kinetic equations (<italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1A">Equations 1</xref></italic>−<italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7B">7</xref></italic>).

<p>In all simulations, initially each master type is present in equal copy numbers in simplestranded form and the termination condition is 10<sup>7</sup> replication events, except stated otherwise. During the dynamics, we monitor the frequency of the master types, the replicability of all replicators including mutant copies of the masters, the number of surviving master types (a type is considered extinct if its relative frequency drops below 10<sup>−3</sup>), the simplex-duplex asymmetry and the total number of replicators (in the chemostat system).

<title>Coexistence of the replicators</title>
<p>First, we investigated the diversity-maintaining ability of the parabolic dynamics at different population sizes and replicability distances. <italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></italic> shows the results of individual runs with <italic>T</italic> = 10 master types in case of small (<italic>N</italic> = 10<sup>3</sup>), medium (<italic>N</italic> = 10<sup>4</sup>) and large (<italic>N</italic> = 10<sup>5</sup>) population size and small (δ = 0.001), medium (δ = 0.005) and large (δ = 0.01) replicability distances. In all cases, the smallest replicability of the master types is <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>min</sub> = 0.005. Note that, the ratio of the smallest and largest master replicabilities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565370v1_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in the cases of three different δs are 2.8, 10 and 19, respectively. These enormously large fitness ratios and fitness differences result in a highly competitive regime in Darwinian sense and also provide the opportunity to investigate the diversity-maintaining capacity of the parabolic regime. The other key parameter of the system is the population size. It is known that in the infinite population size limit, the sustainable diversity has no upper bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Szathmáry &amp; Gladkih, 1989</xref>), but we are interested in how the sustained diversity decreases with decreasing population size. As a general observation, we can state that with decreasing population size, the effect of demographic stochasticity increases and can drive some of the master types extinct. <italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic> shows that increasing the population size reduces the fluctuations in the frequencies and a higher population size together with smaller replicability distance increases the number of sustained master types. We measured the average and standard deviation of the number of maintained master types as the function of population size and replicability distance (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic>).</p>

<p>In case of small population size, the parabolic regime can maintain 43.8%, 29.8% and 25.6% of the master types at an average, assuming small, medium and large replicability distance, respectively.

<title>Compositional effects</title>
<p>The composition of a set of survived master replicator types and thus the selectivity of a parabolically replicating system can be characterized by the replicability rank indices of the coexisting master population. According to <italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Equation 8</xref></italic>, the master type with the highest replicability has rank 10, the second highest has rank 9, while the master type with the lowest replicability has rank 1. If <italic>T</italic><sub>surv</sub> different types of master replicators survive (coexist), the maximum of the sum of their ranks is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565370v1_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, (1 ≤ <italic>T</italic>≤ <italic>T</italic>). The expected value of the sum of ranks, when the masters are distributed randomly with respect to their replicabilities is <italic>ρ</italic><sub>rand</sub> = 5.5 · <italic>T</italic><sub>surv</sub>. According to our simulation results, the sum of replicability ranks of the coexisting types is typically lower than the theoretical maximum (<italic>ρ</italic><sub>max</sub>), but higher than the random composition (<italic>ρ</italic><sub>rand</sub>), indicating that the fitness of a replicator does not only depend on its replicability and therefore the dynamics does not <italic>only</italic> selects for relatively high replicabilities (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></italic>). We found that the key factor leading to this deviation from the theoretical maximums is the GC content (the sum of G and C nucleobases) of the sequences. The direct effects of GC content on the replicator dynamics and thus the selectivity of a parabolically replicating system with regard to sequence effects were investigated by observing the time evolution of <italic>T</italic> = 10 master sequences generated along a GC-content gradient assuming equal replicabilities. For this investigation, we allocated the same number of G+C nucleobases (with 50-50% probability of G and C) to the master types as their indexes. Then A or U nucleobases (also with 50-50% probability) were allocated to the remaining loci. Finally, random shuffling of the nucleobases among the loci was carried out until the Hamming distance &gt; 3 condition was satisfied for every distinct master-master and master-complementary sequence pair as well as for the 10 master-complementary sequence pair of the same type, thereby excluding palindromes. This analysis showed that equilibrium master sequence frequencies follow an inverse relation with the GC content gradient, with increasing stochastic fluctuations in the frequencies at relatively large GC content values (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic>).</p>

<p>To investigate how parabolic dynamics operates when the above-described sequence effects are excluded (in other words, to indirectly infer the sequence effects on the dynamics from their absence), we examined master sequence abundances under the assumption of equal GC contents, along a replicability gradient and with cross-hybridization between different master types not being allowed. In this scenario, master sequences were generated in the following way: equal GC-content of the sequences was ensured by allocating G or C (with 50-50% probability) nucleobases to the first half of the loci. Then, A or U nucleobases (also with 50-50% probability) were allocated to the remainder second half of the loci. Finally, random shuffling of the nucleobases among the loci was carried out until the Hamming distance &gt; 3 condition was satisfied for every distinct master-master sequence and master-complementary sequence pair as well as for the 10 master-complementary sequence pair of the same type, thereby excluding palindromes. Another restricting condition considered during this investigation is that master-master and complementary-complementary sequence associations are not allowed, nor master-complementary hybridization of different types, thereby preventing the formation of cross-hybrid duplexes with different binding energies. This investigation showed that if sequence effects and cross-hybridization are excluded, (<italic>i</italic>) equilibrium master sequence frequencies are directly proportional to their replicabilities and exactly follow the replicability gradient, (<italic>ii</italic>) survival of each master sequence is ensured because of the fact that in this way each master inhibits (regulates) only itself and not other masters, i.e., the dynamics is “purely” parabolic (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Meszéna &amp; Szathmáry, 2002</xref>), (<italic>iii</italic>) despite a relatively low total population size (<italic>N</italic> = 10<sup>4</sup>), stochastic fluctuations have negligible effects on the dynamics (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></italic>).</p>

<title>Lack of error threshold in case of parabolically replicating infinite populations</title>
<p>As a reference case, we analyzed the behavior of a simplified dynamics of parabolic replication (<italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15A">Equation 15A</xref></italic> and <italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15B">Equation 15B</xref></italic> in <italic>Appendix 1</italic>). For analytic tractability, we assume infinite population size and a single peak replication landscape in which a single genotype has high replication rate, all others have the same baseline value, the ratio of these two values (denoted by <italic>A</italic>) is the reproductive superiority. Furthermore, we consider the essential requisite that ensures parabolic dynamics, namely that the growth rate of the population is proportional to the square root of the actual size of the population.</p>
<p>Our analytical results show that in this simple model – except for <italic>Q</italic> = 0, where <italic>Q</italic> denotes the probability of the error-free replication of a master sequence – there is no error threshold: the master type will persist at any level of mutation rate (<italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></italic>, right panel).

<title>Diversity-maintaining ability</title>
<p>The chemostat model, by taking into account the components of replicator decay, inflow of nucleobases into the system and outflow of the molecules, shows a richer dynamical repertoire compared to the constant population model. The total population size and the diversity maintaining ability of the system are jointly affected by both the inflow rate of the nucleobases (<italic>c</italic><sub>in</sub>) and the decay rate of replicators in simplex <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565370v1_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and duplex <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565370v1_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> form, cf. <italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Equation 11</xref>. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></italic> shows individual realizations of this dynamics with the parameter values that lead to comparable equilibrium population sizes to those investigated in the constant population model (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></italic>). Note that in the chemostat model, the total population size (<italic>N</italic>) changes in time, and therefore population sizes shown in <italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></italic> are approximate measures. Consistent with the constant population model, the dynamical outcome approaches the complete coexistence case, when large population sizes are combined with relatively similar replicabilities (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></italic>, upper right panel) under the assumption of small duplex decay rates relative to that of the simplexes (<italic>f</italic> = 0.01). In line with the expectations, decreasing <italic>c</italic><sub>in</sub> reduces the average total population size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565370v1_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and this simultaneously decreases the number of sustainable master types (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6AB</xref></italic>). Our results show that decreasing <italic>c</italic><sub>in</sub> by one order of magnitude, as expected, leads to approximately one order of magnitude drop in the average total population sizes (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></italic>). Relatively large replicability distance parameter (δ) values, however, while narrowing down the range of the coexistence, increase the average total population sizes at the same time (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></italic>) due to the fact that they imply larger mean master replicabilities. For further analysis, we introduce the simplex-duplex asymmetry measure: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565370v1_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, whose negative values indicate duplex, positive values indicate simplex dominance, -1 (+1) value means that the whole population is in duplex (simplex) state. Along an increasing gradient of the duplex decay factor (<italic>f</italic>), the average total population sizes are again lowered (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></italic>). The mechanistic explanation for this population shrinking effect at relatively large values of <italic>f</italic> is well demonstrated by the population compositions from which one can see that the overwhelming majority of the replicators tend to be in double-stranded state independent from <italic>δ</italic> (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></italic>).

<p>In case of a strongly resource-limited regime, the diversity maintaining potential of the dynamics can ultimately drop to a level at which the system can maintain only one master type (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></italic>). Our results show that such a single-species equilibrium generally occurs under the assumption of the smallest resource inflow rate (<italic>c</italic><sub>in</sub> = 0.01), combined with large replicability distance (δ = 0.01) and duplex decay factor (<italic>f</italic> = 1). In the chemostat model, binding energy of a duplex (and thus its sequence composition) is also taken into account in the decay probability distribution (c.f. <italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Equation 11</xref></italic>). Therefore, a higher GC content results in a lower decay rate, compensating to some extent the otherwise disadvantageous effect of a relatively high GC content (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic> and <italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></italic>) and the consequential low dissociation probability (only dissociated, single-stranded sequences are available as templates for complementary strand synthesis). This sequence effect-mediated trade-off between lowered decay rate in duplex state and templating affinity in simplex state, together with type-specific replicabilities, determines the identity of the surviving master types and thus the selectivity of the system in single species equilibria.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this modelling study, we focused on the coexistence of polymer variants involved in a template-directed, non-enzymatic replication mechanism. Prior to the emergence of a helicase ribozyme that could have facilitated strand separation in RNA duplexes (or a similar, relatively effective strand-separation mechanism, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Szostak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Müller, 2006</xref>), such an enzyme-free replication mode was likely to result in parabolic growth profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">von Kiedrowski et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, parabolic population growth is of conceptual relevance to the origin and the subsequent evolution of heritable chemical information. Within this framework, we demonstrated that – depending on the total replicator population size, GC content, the extent of replication rate differences and copying error as well as resource influx rates – parabolic dynamics can sustain a large variety of sequence modules.</p>
<p>A small total population size (10<sup>3</sup>) combined with large replication rate differences (<italic>δ</italic> = 0.01), on average, can only maintain 26% of all species (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic>). These results corroborate Davis’s (2000) analytical findings that steady-state replicator variant frequencies in a finite, sublinear system are truncated in such a way that variants with insufficient fitness are eliminated. In contrast, large population sizes and smaller between-species fitness differences are expected to approach the deterministic, unlimited coexistence limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Szathmáry &amp; Gladkih, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Varga &amp; Szathmáry, 1997</xref>). This is confirmed here by considering the combination of a relatively large total population size (10<sup>5</sup>) and small equidistant difference in the replication rates (<italic>δ</italic> = 0.001), which leads to the coexistence of almost 90% of the variants, on average (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic>). The replicability (fitness) distance dependency of the number (or the proportion) of the coexisting variants in dynamical equilibrium (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic>) is viewed as the manifestation of fitness-driven (Darwinian) selection during competitive replication at sublinear propagation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Davis, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">1996b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">2000</xref>). Analytical and numerical results show that the threshold fitness for coexistence depends on the fitness sum in such a system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davis, 2000</xref>). Consistent with this, elevation in the sum of species fitness – that can be expressed in the present model in terms of the increasing sum of replication rates of master species with increasing replicability distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="565370v1_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> – raises the fitness threshold for survival and thus the number of subthreshold species that are eliminated (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2AB</xref></italic>) due to the fact that master species with higher fitness are present in higher copy numbers (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>With regard to demographic stochasticity, we considered order of magnitude-scaled distances between the investigated population sizes, while a constant cut-off relative frequency for survival (10<sup>-3</sup>) was applied, implying that the minimum copy number to avoid exclusion also increased by an order of magnitude with increasing population size (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic>). The rationale behind this assumption is that in this way the average number of the maintained variants is expected to change linearly as a function of population size, if fluctuations associated with population size changes affect the diversity-maintaining potential linearly. In contrast to linear dependence, however, we found that the slope of this function is steeper between the smallest and the medium population sizes than between the medium and the largest one and that this non-linearity is becoming more pronounced with decreasing fitness differences (i.e., with smaller δ, <italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic>). Accelerating species extinction at the smallest population size, resulting from increased variability in relative species frequencies over time (i.e., increased amplitude of stochastic fluctuations), is consistent with prior predictions and analytical findings that suggested the existence of a critical total replicator population size above which parabolic coexistence is guaranteed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Epstein, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scheuring &amp; Szathmáry, 2001</xref>). These remarks emphasized that effective diversity maintenance by parabolic replication should have required sufficiently large population sizes during early molecular evolution, which, according to our results, must have been &gt;10<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, we found evidence that under sublinear dynamics, GC content of the replicator sequences has also a significant effect on the steady-state master frequencies (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic>) and, thus, on the identity of the surviving master types (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></italic> and <italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></italic>). Consequently, this feature also plays a decisive role in determining the number of the surviving variants in equilibrium in a manner that a balanced GC content favors a larger number of coexisting variants (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></italic>), whereas, for example, an extremely low GC content of a few master sequences is expected to lead the survival of this narrow subpopulation of the sequences with low GC content. This finding can be interpreted in the light of the lifetime reproductive ratio of the replicators. Reproductive ratio in this case can be defined as the expected number of copies (“offspring”) produced by a single strand or, in case of complementary template replication, the number of complementary strands synthesized from a given sequence during its lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Meszéna &amp; Szathmáry, 2002</xref>). According to this interpretation, a relatively high dissociation probability and the consequential higher propensity of being in a simple stranded form provides an advantage for sequences with relatively low GC content in terms of their replication affinity, that is, the expected number of offspring in case of such variants will be relatively high. Surprisingly, this model characteristic is also in accordance with the results of a computational study on RNA folding from randomly generated sequences, showing that abundant and topologically simple fold structures tend to arise from sequences depleted in G, thereby suggesting that the first catalytic RNA sequences could have been characterized by a somewhat reduced GC content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Briones et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We demonstrated that during competitive replication of parabolically growing replicator variants, monomer resource inflow rate (<italic>c</italic><sub>in</sub>) can act as a control parameter of selectivity. As such, by changing the values of this parameter, the dynamics can switch from a non-Darwinian steady state attractor that ensures coexistence towards a Darwinian attractor state, where one competitively superior species prevails, other variants are competitively excluded. In an analogous replicator competition model, Szilágyi and co-workers applied Gause’s principle of competitive exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gause, 1934</xref>) to replicator populations and showed both analytically and numerically that if resources (nucleotides) affect the growth linearly, then the number of coexisting replicator species cannot be more than that of the nucleotide building block types (note that plus and minus copies of the same replicator count as one species: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Szilágyi et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, the present study provides evidence that within the context of sublinear propagation, at high monomer resource concentrations that ensure large population sizes (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></italic>), the average number of the maintained replicator types can be higher than the number of resource types (4) (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></italic>). However, with small monomer inflow rate, sublinear population growth also becomes resource limited concomitant with a considerable drop in the average total population size (<italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></italic>), leading to the survival of the fittest variant.</p>
<p>We also investigated the consequences of errors in the replication mechanism in the context of the theoretical error threshold of parabolic dynamics. Our analytical results show that a master sequence vanishes from the system, only if the replication accuracy is zero (<italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></italic>, right panel). Thus, in this deterministic scenario, the error threshold problem is seemingly circumvented, because persistent maintenance of essential genetic information by nonenzymatic, template-directed synthesis of short RNA-like information carrying sequence modules is not an irresolvable task for a putative rudimentary replication mechanism, even if it is highly inaccurate. However, when finite population sizes and stochastic effects are taken into account, at the largest investigated per-base mutation rate (<italic>p</italic><sub>mut</sub> = 0.15), the summed relative steady-state master frequencies approach zero (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></italic>) with accelerating, phase transitionlike species extinction (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></italic>), indicating that this value (corresponding to the <italic>Q</italic> = (1 − 0.15)<sup><italic>L</italic></sup>, (<italic>L</italic> = 10) = 0.196 replication accuracy of a master sequence) is close to the system<bold>?</bold>s empirical error threshold. We note that this value is above the one that can be anticipated, if one applies the inverse genome length rule of thumb for the error threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eigen, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Joyce, 2002</xref>) to our system, which gives 1/<italic>L</italic> = 0.1 error rate of replication per nucleotide. Moreover, the constant cut-off relative master frequency for survival (10<sup>-3</sup>) that we applied makes our empirical error threshold to be a rather conservative approximation. Former studies suggest that the 0.1 per-base error rate, at which we measured a decent diversitymaintaining potential (more than 40% of all variants), is a reasonable assumption for nonenzymatic RNA copying. Although the average error rate in this process was estimated to be ∼0.17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Leu et al., 2011</xref>), using optimized nucleotide ratios could potentially lower this measure below ∼0.1 with a possibility for a further reduction to ∼0.05 on GC-rich templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Szostak, 2012</xref>). However, all of the average error rates reported by the above outlined studies pertain to non-enzymatic polymerization reactions that involve primers. Triplet substrates, albeit in an enzymatic context (i.e., with in vitro evolved ribozymes), have proven to be able to successfully bypass the requirement of primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Attwater et al., 2018</xref>). A similarly primer-free and therefore – under prebiotic conditions – more realistic replication mode has been proposed for nonenzymatic RNA replication in which complementary strand synthesis takes place by oligonucleotide ligation together with gap filling reactions, making use of monomers and shorter oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Szostak, 2012</xref>). Although the fidelity of this RNA replication mechanism is largely unknown, a pilot experimental study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">James &amp; Ellington, 1997</xref>), which was performed with constant-sequence DNA templates, suggests a surprisingly high accuracy of complementary strand synthesis during this process.</p>

<title>Ideas and Speculation</title>
<p>As we have demonstrated, template-directed, non-enzymatic replication of oligomer modules leading to parabolic growth profiles is an effective genetic information maintaining mechanism which may thus have constituted an indispensable bridge from the very first abiotic synthetic pathways for RNA to a ribozyme-dominated stage of the RNA world. It is, however, noteworthy that besides the “information first” view of the RNA world hypothesis, there are other concepts as to how life arose; for example, the “metabolism first” or autotrophic origins view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wächtershäuser, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Joyce, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Martin et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, this view does not exclude the possibility of the existence of a pre-RNA world, in which genetic information resided in polymer structures similar to RNA, such as peptide- or tetrose nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schöning et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bada, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Orgel, 2004</xref>). Considering that we applied a rather broad approach to replicator representation, we believe that the results of the present model are general enough for being naturally applicable to these pre-RNA systems as well. It is also worthwhile to mention that although short oligonucleotides like those we have investigated in the present study are not characteristically prone to intramolecular 2D folding and therefore typically bear with limited catalytic activities, miniribozymes with surprisingly short sequence lengths can still catalyze a wide variety of chemical reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vlassov et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, catalytic aid and/or metabolic cooperation among independently replicating sequences (i.e., <italic>cooperative coexistence</italic>, see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Epstein, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mizuuchi &amp; Ichihashi, 2018</xref>) can considerably broaden the parameter space in which we reported <italic>competitive coexistence</italic> of different replicator variants. In this study, we considered kinetic constants that correspond to the <italic>p</italic> ≈ 0.5 growth order. Further investigations into the 0.5 &lt; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Issac &amp; Chmielewski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li &amp; Chmielewski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lincoln &amp; Joyce, 2009</xref>) are expected to show that an increase in the kinetic growth order decreases the scope of competitive coexistence and drives the system more toward the Darwinian regime. Such studies may help gain a deeper insight into the question whether the emergence of an effective strand separation mechanism, or other conditions implying kinetic constants that shift the dynamics toward exponential amplification, allowed for a still subexponential diversity maintaining mechanism during later phases of chemical evolution and thus a gradual evolutionary transition from non-enzymatic replication to ribozyme-aided amplification.</p>
<p>The two key components of evolutionary algorithms are exploration and exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bäck et al., 2000</xref>). If diversity decreases too fast under selection, this can lead to premature convergence, resulting in a population getting stuck at a local adaptive peak. In order to avoid premature convergence, various diversity-maintaining mechanisms have been introduced. We call attention to the fact that parabolic growth is an organic form of diversity maintenance. Referring to the chemostat model, we call attention to the fact that a periodically changing environment with alternating resource abundance and shortage can drive, and in the distant past could have driven, an efficient exploration-exploitation algorithm.</p>

Note that the master type vanishes if and only if <italic>Q</italic> = 0 (<italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></italic>, right panel), and mutants cannot vanish because of parabolic competition.

<p>Summary: Szathmary and colleagues explore the parabolic growth regime of replicator evolution. Parabolic growth occurs when nucleic acid strain separation is the rate-limiting step of the replication process which would have been the case for non-enzymatic replication of short oligonucleotide that could precede the emergence of ribozyme polymerases and helicases. The key result is that parabolic replication is conducive to the maintenance of genetic diversity, that is, the coexistence of numerous master sequences (the Gause principle does not apply). Another important finding is that there is no error threshold for parabolic replication except for the extreme case of zero fidelity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
I find both the analytic and the numerical results to be quite convincing and well-described. The results of this work are potentially important because they reveal aspects of a realistic evolutionary scenario for the origin of replicators.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are no obvious technical weaknesses. It can be argued that the results represent an incremental advance because many aspects of parabolic replication have been explored previously (the relevant publications are properly cited). Obviously, the work is purely theoretical, experimental study of parabolic replication is due. In the opinion of this reviewer, though, these are understandable limitations that do not actually detract from the value of this work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A dominant hypothesis concerning the origin of life is that, before the appearance of the first enzymes, RNA replicated non-enzymatically by templating. However, this replication was probably not very efficient, due to the propensity of single strands to bind to each other, thus inhibiting template replication. This phenomenon, known as product inhibition, has been shown to lead to parabolic growth instead of exponential growth. Previous works have shown that this situation limits competition between alternative replicators and therefore promotes RNA population diversity. The present work examines this scenario in a model of RNA replication, taking into account finite population size, mutations, and differences in GC content. The main results are (1) confirmation that parabolic growth promotes diversity, but that when the population size is small enough, sequences least efficient at replicating may nevertheless go extinct; (2) the observation that fitness is not only controlled by the replicability of sequences, but also by their GC content ; (3) the observation that parabolic growth attenuates the impact of mutations and, in particular, that the error threshold to which exponentially growing sequences are subject can be exceeded, enabling sequence identity to be maintained at higher mutation rates.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The analyses are sound and the observations are intriguing. Indeed, it has been noted previously that parabolic growth promotes coexistence, its role in mitigating the error threshold catastrophe - which is often presented as a major obstacle to our understanding of the origin of life - had not been examined before.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although all the conclusions are interesting, most are not very surprising for people familiar with the literature. As the authors point out, parabolic growth is well known to promote diversity (Szathmary-Gladkih 89) and it has also been noted previously that a form of Darwinian selection can be found at small population sizes (Davis 2000). Given that under parabolic growth, no sequence is ever excluded for infinite populations, it is also not surprising to find that mutations have a less dramatic exclusionary impact.</p>
<p>A general weakness is the presentation of models and parameters, whose choices often appear arbitrary. Modeling choices that would deserve to be further discussed include the association of the monomers with the strands and the ensuing polymerization, which are combined into a single association/polymerization reaction (see also below), or the choice to restrict to oligomers of length L = 10. Other models, similar to the one employed here, have been proposed that do not make these assumptions, e.g. Rosenberger et al. Self-Assembly of Informational Polymers by Templated Ligation, PRX 2021. To understand how such assumptions affect the results, it would be helpful to present the model from the perspective of existing models.</p>
<p>The values of the (many) parameters, often very specific, also very often lack justifications. For example, why is the &quot;predefined error factor&quot; ε = 0.2 and not lower or higher? How would that affect the results? Similarly, in equation (11), where does the factor 0.8 come from? Why is the kinetic constant for duplex decay reaction 1.15e10−8? Are those values related to experiments, or are they chosen because specific behaviors can happen only then?</p>
<p>The choice of the model and parameters potentially impact the two main results, the attenuation of the error threshold and the role of GC content:</p>
<p>Regarding the error threshold, it is also noted (lines 379-385) that it disappears when back mutations are taken into account. This suggests that overcoming the error threshold might not be as difficult as suggested, and can be achieved in several ways, which calls into question the importance of the particular role of parabolic growth. Besides, when the concentration of replicators is low, product inhibition may be negligible, such that a &quot;parabolic replicator&quot; is effectively growing exponentially and an error catastrophe may occur. Do the authors think that this consideration could affect their conclusion? Can simulations be performed?</p>
<p>Regarding the role of the GC content, GC-rich oligomers are found to perform the worst but no rationale is provided. One may assume that it happens because GC-rich sequences are comparatively longer to release the product. However, it is also conceivable that higher GC content may help in the polymerization of the monomers as the monomers attach longer on the template (as described in Eq.(9)). This is an instance where the choice to pull into a single step the association and polymerization reactions are pulled into a single step independent of GC content may be critical. It would be important to show that the result arises from the actual physics and not from this modeling choice.</p>
<p>Some more specific points that would deserve to be addressed:</p>
<p>- Line 53: it is said that p &quot;reflects how easily the template-reaction product complex dissociates&quot;. This statement is not correct. A reaction order p&lt;1 reflects product inhibition, the propensity of templates to bind to each other, not slow product release. Product release can be limiting, yet a reaction order of 1 can be achieved if substrate concentrations are sufficiently high relative to oligomer concentrations (von Kiedrowski et al., 1991).</p>
<p>- Population size is a key parameter, and a comparison is made between small (10^3) and large (10^5) populations, but without explaining what determines the scale (small/large relative to what?).</p>
<p>- In the same vein, we might expect size not to be the only important parameter, but also concentration.</p>
<p>- Lines 543-546: if understanding correctly, the quantitative result is that the error threshold rises from 0.1 in the exponential case to 0.196 in the parabolic. Are the authors suggesting that a factor of 2 is a significant difference?</p>
<p>- Figure 3C: this figure shows no statistically significant effect?</p>
<p>- line 542: &quot;phase transition-like species extension (Figure 4B)&quot;: such a clear threshold is not apparent.</p>
