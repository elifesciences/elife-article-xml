<title>Abstract</title><p>BRCA1 is a critical tumor suppressor, mutations in which greatly increase risks for many tumors in carriers, most notably breast cancer. Luminal progenitor cells (LPs) are the currently recognized cells origin of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers. However, the reason why LPs are prone to transform with BRCA1 deficiency has not been elucidated. Here, using single-cell sequencing of human BRCA1 mutant breast cancers and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of BRCA1-deficient normal mammary cells, we reveal that replication stress is a feature of LPs and a driving factor during BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, replication stress and BRCA1 deficiency lead to significant upregulation of ELF3 expression. ELF3 can help suppress excessive genomic instability and promote LP transformation with BRCA1 deficiency. Moreover, ELF3 emerged as a core transcription factor regulating LP genes, leading to LP expansion.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>BRCA1 is one of the most important tumor suppressor genes. Carriers of BRCA1 germline mutations are at greatly increased risks for developing various tumors, including breast, ovarian, prostate, colon, pancreatic, and gastric cancers (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>).Notably, BRCA1 is most closely associated with breast cancer. However, why BRCA1-associated tumors exhibit significant tissue specificity is unknown, and the effects of BRCA1 defects in normal human mammary cells are largely obscure.</p>
<p>In addition to the tissue specificity of tumors caused by BRCA1 deficiency, breast cancers associated with BRCA1 deficiency exhibit a set of other distinctive features. Most BRCA1 mutation carriers develop triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), in which tumors show negative expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Her2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), and these cancers are usually also classified as basal-like breast cancers. The currently recognized cells of origin of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers are the luminal progenitor cell (LPs) in the mammary gland (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>). LPs show abnormal expansion in the normal mammary tissue of BRCA1 mutation carriers (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>), which might be caused by a differentiation blockade (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>). Investigating the traits of LPs is important for tumor prevention and treatment in BRCA1 mutation carriers and a wider range of patients with TNBCs and basal-like breast cancer. However, the reason LPs are prone to transform into cancer cells when BRCA1 is deficient is unclear.</p>
<p>ELF3 is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. Early reports suggested that ELF3 may regulate the development and differentiation of mammary tissue (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></italic>). Intriguingly, ELF3 has opposite functions in tumorigenesis in different tissues. In breast cancers, ELF3 shows high expression (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></italic>), plays an oncogenic role by promoting EMT (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>) and forms a positive feedback loop with Her2 to maintain the transformation phenotype of Her2+ breast cancers (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). However, the mechanism of high ELF3 expression in certain types of breast cancer and its association with breast cancers beyond the Her2+ subtype is currently unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, utilizing single-cell sequencing of BRCA1 mutant breast cancers and time-resolved RNA-seq of BRCA1-deficient normal mammary cells, we revealed that LPs have a trait of higher replication stress compared to other cell populations in the normal mammary tissue, endowing them with the potential for transformation when BRCA1 is deficient, and ELF3 plays a key role in the process. Mechanistically,</p>
<p>ELF3 expression is significantly upregulated by replication stress and BRCA1 deficiency, dependent on the ATR-Chk1-E2F axis and the transcriptional regulation function of BRCA1, respectively. In addition, ELF3 can help suppress excessive genomic instability, promoting the tolerance of LPs to BRCA1 deficiency. Notably, BRCA1 deficiency causes cells to display LP transcriptional profile characteristics, leading to dedifferentiation and expansion of LPs, and ELF3 is a core transcription factor during this process. Our study reveals why BRCA1 deficiency is prone to result in tumorigenesis in LPs and elucidates the key role of replication stress and ELF3 during this process, suggesting that ELF3 could be a promising target for BRCA1-associated breast cancers.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>LPs have higher levels of replication stress compared with other mammary cell populations</title>
<p>LPs in the mammary gland are the currently recognized cells of origin of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers. However, the reason for LPs are prone to transform with BRCA1 deficiency has not been elucidated. To address this question, we attempt to investigate from two aspects that may influence the process of tumorigenesis. Firstly, we considered that LPs, which are stimulated by upstream progesterone paracrine signals through RANKL (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>), may have higher levels of replication stress, which can trigger tumorigenesis by increasing genomic instability. We utilized both published data and our published single-cell sequencing data (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>) to address this question. We analyzed the data of Lim et al. (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>) by scoring multiple DNA replication pathway gene expression to infer the replication stress in different mammary cell populations as previously studied (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). The result showed that LPs have the highest level of replication stress among all subgroups of normal human mammary cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Our single-cell sequencing data were obtained from the tumor cells and normal mammary cells of four BRCA1 mutation carriers (case #1-4) and normal mammary cells of three matched non-carriers (case #5-7). According to our previous analysis, case #3 BRCA1 mutant carrier developed basal-like breast cancer, which was derived from LPs. Importantly, in this case of BRCA1 mutant carrier, single-cell sequencing data revealed that tumor cells had the highest levels of replication stress, and LPs had the second-highest levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, we applied Monocle to reconstruct the transformation trajectories from normal mammary cells to tumor cells in the BRCA1 mutation carrier and found that the levels of replication stress showed an increasing trend during the process of LP transformation into tumor cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. S1A</xref>). These data demonstrate that replication stress is an important trait of LPs and might be a key driver of BRCA1-deficient tumorigenesis, which is consistent with the previous report that BRCA1 mutant mammary epithelial cells are defective in replication stress suppression (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>).</p>

<p>Next, we aimed to find other key regulators during BRCA1-deficient tumorigenesis in LPs. In addition to inducing replication stress, BRCA1 deficiency also profoundly affects the transcriptional profile of normal mammary cells by disrupting the transcriptional function of BRCA1, which may further boost the process of tumorigenesis. To investigate the transcriptional impact of BRCA1 deficiency in normal human mammary epithelial cells, we took advantage of the Tet-on system to build an inducible knockdown model in MCF10A cells. By adjusting the treatment condition of DOX (doxycycline), different time points of BRCA1 deficiency can be controlled. Treatment with DOX causes a constant and efficient knockdown of BRCA1, verified at mRNA and protein levels (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. S1B</xref>). We showed that DOX treatment induces significant growth arrest (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. S1C</xref>) and an increase in genomic instability (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. S1D</xref>), consistent with the phenotypes of BRCA1-deficient cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>), confirming that our system functioned as expected. We then performed time-resolved RNA-seq with different durations of DOX treatment (2, 5 and 10 days; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. S1E</xref>). Notably, 10 days of DOX treatment resulted in growth arrest, thus cells collected for sequencing have gained growth advantage. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that BRCA1 was efficiently knocked down during the whole experiment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Importantly, the principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that samples showed a time-course distribution in the dimension of PC1, which has the dominant power of explanation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. S1F</xref>). These data demonstrate that the variations between samples can be largely attributed to time. To further investigate the modes of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that change over time, we carried out the DEG cluster analysis using Mfuzz (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>). Analysis of the Day 10 DEGs showed that genes could be divided into 5 clusters with different expression change patterns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). We mainly focused on Cluster 1, for these sharply upregulated genes may play more important roles in cells gaining growth advantage with BRCA1 deficiency at Day 10, mimicking the initiation of BRCA1 deficiency associated tumorigenesis. To find out the most potent regulator upregulated both by replication stress and BRCA1 deficiency, we performed RNA-seq in HU-treated MCF10A cells and overlapped the upregulated genes in HU RNA-seq and Cluster1 genes in BRCA1 deficiency RNA-seq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). The results showed that ELF3, a transcription factor, is one of the most dominant genes in this analysis. ELF3 has been reported to be involved in functions including EMT in human breast cancer and promotes the transformation of normal human mammary cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>). Therefore, we speculated that ELF3 could be an important driving factor during the tumorigenesis of BRCA1-deficient and basal-like breast cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.</label><title>ELF3 is upregulated in BRCA1-associated breast cancer and is related to a worse prognosis</title>
<p>We next explored the expression of ELF3 in breast cancers in the TCGA and METABRIC databases to further investigate the association between ELF3 and BRCA1 and validate our previous analysis. In both clinical databases, ELF3 expression is significantly higher in BRCA1-associated breast tumors than in non-BRCA1-associated breast tumors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, the expression levels of BRCA1 and ELF3 showed a significant negative correlation, consistent with our findings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Since most BRCA1 mutation carriers develop basal-like breast cancers, we next investigated the association between ELF3 and basal-like breast cancers. We exploited the TCGA and METABRIC databases to compare ELF3 expression levels among different breast cancer subtypes. As we expected, ELF3 showed the highest expression levels in basal-like breast cancer in both databases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We took advantage of novel subgroups identified by the METABRIC (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>) and further explored ELF3 expression in ten IntClusts of the METABRIC database. Among all subgroups, IntClust 5 was enriched with Her2+ cancers, and IntClust 10 was enriched with basal-like cancers. These two subgroups showed the highest expression levels of ELF3, with no significant difference between them (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The higher levels of ELF3 expression in Her2 subtype breast cancer are consistent with previous studies showing that ELF3 may be a downstream transcription target of Her2 and that there might be a positive feedback loop between them (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></italic>). On the other hand, IntClust 4 shows a favorable outcome and has a âCNA-devoidâ feature, which has the lowest level of ELF3 expression. These data are consistent with our findings that ELF3 is upregulated by BRCA1 loss, indicate that ELF3 may play an important role in basal-like breast tumorigenesis, and moreover, the expression of ELF3 may be related to genomic stability status. Furthermore, among human breast cancer tissue samples, ELF3 expression levels were significantly higher in TNBCs than in other subtypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E and F</xref>). Additionally, TNBCs have higher ELF3 expression levels than the Her2 subtype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E and F</xref>), revealing a tighter connection between ELF3 and BRCA1-associated breast cancers.</p>

<p>ELF3 shows significant copy number amplification in breast cancer (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></italic>). Thus, we wondered that whether the high expression levels of ELF3 in BRCA1-associated breast cancers are due to copy number variation. Therefore, we analyzed the proportion of ELF3 copy number amplification in different subtypes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S2</xref>) and found that this was not the case. In TCGA basal-like breast cancer, the ELF3 amplification proportion was not higher than that in other subtypes but was only 3.5%, which was lower than the total level (7.3%). These data demonstrate that the upregulation of ELF3 in BRCA1-associated breast cancer is not caused by copy number amplification.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we investigated whether ELF3 expression could be a biomarker for breast cancer prognosis. Consistent with our hypothesis, higher ELF3 expression is correlated with worse prognosis in TNBC and basal-like breast cancer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). In the Her2 subtype, higher ELF3 expression is also related to shorter overall survival, consistent with previous reports that as a Her2 target gene, ELF3 may help promote tumor invasion (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></italic>). Interestingly, ELF3 expression shows less or no prognostic prediction value in luminal A and luminal B subtypes, suggesting that ELF3 plays a more powerful role in TNBC and basal-like breast cancer. These data imply that in BRCA1-associated breast cancer, ELF3 tends to be upregulated and plays a âdriverâ role, promoting tumor progression and leading to a worse prognosis.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<label>3.</label><title>ELF3 upregulation is induced by replication stress via the ATR-Chk1-E2F axis and by BRCA1 deficiency via GATA3 transcription</title>
<p>We next focused on the mechanisms of ELF3 upregulation in the presence of replication stress and BRCA1 deficiency. Consistent with the HU RNA-seq analysis, our single-cell RNA-seq data showed that in both BRCA1 WT and mutant carriers, the levels of replication stress and ELF3 expression showed a significant positive correlation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). ELF3 was also upregulated by HU-induced replication stress in MCF10A cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Since ATR is the key kinase that responds to replication stress, we treated cells with ATRi and found that it could efficiently block ELF3 upregulation induced by HU, while ATMi had no such effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Moreover, downstream of ATR, ELF3 expression upregulation depended on Chk1 activation but not Chk2 activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). It has been reported that the transcriptional activation induced by replication stress-ATR-Chk1 pathway largely depends on E2F transcription factor activation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>). Under replication stress, ATR-Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of E2F6 blocks its inhibitory function on E2F and activates E2F transcription. Thus, we overexpressed E2F6 and found that E2F6 blocks the upregulation of ELF3 under HU treatment conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), validating that ELF3 upregulation relies on E2F6 inactivation and E2F de-suppression. Moreover, utilizing ENCODE ChIP-seq data, we found that the ELF3 promoter is indeed bound by E2F1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). These data demonstrate that ELF3 is upregulated by the ATR-Chk1-E2F axis under replication stress conditions.</p>

<p>Then we investigate the mechanism of ELF3 upregulation induced by BRCA1 deficiency. ELF3 expression gradually increased during 10 days of DOX treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). ELF3 upregulation was further confirmed by siRNA-mediated BRCA1 knockdown in MCF10A cells to strictly exclude the unknown influence of the Tet-on system (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). BRCA1 has transcription regulation functions by interacting with other transcription factors to bind to gene promoters and regulate gene expression (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></italic>). Therefore, we explored transcription factors associated with BRCA1, including GATA3 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>) and Myc (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></italic>), for whether the binding motifs of these transcription factors appear in the ELF3 promoter sequence utilizing the JASPAR database (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S3A</xref>). We found that E2F1 was present in the prediction list with a high relative score, consistent with our results. The prediction results show that the motif of GATA3 appeared in the ELF3 promoter multiple times with an overall high relative score. Indeed, knockdown of GATA3 in MCF10A cells also strongly induced ELF3 expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). Similarly, we found multiple GATA3 binding peaks at the promoter of ELF3 in two independent ChIP-seq datasets from the ENCODE database, consistent with two of the GATA3 binding sequences predicted in the JASPAR database (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). These data suggest that ELF3 is a GATA3 downstream target gene. Importantly, when both BRCA1 and GATA3 were knocked down, there was no significant superimposed effect on ELF3 upregulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S3B</xref>), implying that BRCA1 and GATA3 act in the same pathway for ELF3 induction.</p>
<p>Notably, we found that and BRCA1 knockdown and HU treatment have a superimposed effect on upregulating ELF3 expression levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S3C</xref>). Furthermore, GATA3 knockdown and HU treatment also had a significant superimposed effect in upregulating ELF3 expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S3D</xref>). These data validate that the BRCA1-GATA3 axis and replication stress regulates ELF3 expression independently.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>ELF3 helps suppress excessive genomic instability</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the impact of ELF3 upregulation under replication stress conditions and BRCA1 deficiency. Based on the association between ELF3 and the worse prognosis in BRCA1-associated breast cancer patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), we hypothesized that upregulation of ELF3 could help cells deal with replication stress and suppress excessive genomic instability, facilitating cancer initiation and cancer evolution. As expected, ELF3 knockdown greatly increased the sensitivity of MCF10A cells to HU and cisplatin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A and B</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S4A</xref>). This finding suggests that ELF3 can suppress genomic instability and help normal cells deal with replication stress. Furthermore, ELF3 knockdown in HCC1937 and SUM149PT cells, both of which are BRCA1 mutant human breast cancer cell lines, also caused a significant decline in cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C and D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S4B and C</xref>), suggesting that ELF3 is essential for BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cell survival. Moreover, HCC1937 and SUM149PT cells became more sensitive to HU and cisplatin when ELF3 was deficient (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E and F</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. S4D and E</xref>). Since PARP inhibitors can induce replication fork stalling by PARP1 trapping and lead to replication stress in BRCA1-deficient cells, we also tested olaparib sensitivity in HCC1937 cells and obtained similar results (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S4F</xref>). These results demonstrate that in BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cells, ELF3 can help suppress excessive genomic instability.</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition, utilizing the CellMiner database, we found that among nearly sixty diverse human cancer cell lines, lower ELF3 expression is correlated with higher drug sensitivity to cisplatin and etoposide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Consistent results were obtained using the GDSC database (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. 4G</xref>). Moreover, in nude mice, SUM149PT tumors with ELF3 deficiency were significantly smaller than those in the control group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). These data indicate that ELF3 can help suppress excessive genome instability in the presence of replication stress, helping normal cells tolerate replication stress and subsequent DNA damage, allowing the cells to transform into malignant tumors. During cancer progression, BRCA1 mutant cancer cells gradually become reliant on high ELF3 expression to preserve a certain degree of genomic stability, making ELF3 a promising therapeutic target and biomarker in BRCA1-associated breast cancers.</p>

<label>5.</label><title>ELF3 helps maintain the stability of DNA replication</title>
<p>We then investigated the mechanism by which ELF3 preserves genomic stability. ELF3 deficiency leads to more endogenous DNA damage in MCF10A cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S5</xref>). In HCC1937 cells, knockdown of ELF3 resulted in a significant increase in spontaneous Î³H2AX foci (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), indicating that ELF3 deficiency leads to more endogenous DNA damage in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells. Moreover, with HU treatment and release for repair, ELF3 deficiency resulted in a significant increase in the number of Î³H2AX and 53BP1 foci per cell and the proportion of cells with damage foci (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-D</xref>). Under replication stress conditions, Î³H2AX and 53BP1 foci represent DNA double-strand breaks formed by collapsed replication forks (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>). These data suggest that ELF3 deficiency results in a defective ability to repair stalled replication forks; thus, more DNA damage is generated. The resulting upregulation of ELF3 expression during replication stress helps cells better manage stalled replication forks and prevents excessive DNA damage.</p>

<p>To further explore how ELF3 contributes to replication stress management, RNA-seq on ELF3-knockdown MCF10A cells was performed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that multiple pathways associated with DNA replication were significantly downregulated in ELF3-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), which was further verified by RTâqPCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). These data indicate that DNA replication pathways are affected by ELF3 deficiency.</p>
<p>DNA fiber assay was performed to more closely investigate the effects of ELF3 deficiency on DNA replication. ELF3 deficiency significantly slowed down the DNA replication progression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>), with significantly reduced symmetry of replication forks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>), suggesting that more replication forks were stalled or unstable. Moreover, with HU treatment, ELF3 knockdown undermined the stability of stalled replication forks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). Notably, double-knockdown of ELF3 and BRCA1 led to a further decrease in replication fork stability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). These data reveal that ELF3 expression upregulation when BRCA1 is deficient can help cells deal with replication stress, while simultaneous ELF3 deficiency leads to intolerable levels of genomic stability.</p>

<label>6.</label><title>ELF3 is a core transcription factor inducing LP genes expression under BRCA1 deficiency</title>
<p>Finally, we explored the possible reasons for the tissue specificity of BRCA1-associated tumors. It has been reported that BRCA1 deficiency disturbs the development and differentiation of mammary tissue and causes abnormal expansion of the LP population (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>). We hypothesized that BRCA1 deficiency might affect the normal differentiation process of LPs by disturbing the transcriptional profile, thus leading to abnormal expansion and transformation of LPs. We analyzed the time-course RNA-seq data using a published signature gene set from LPs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>) and found that over time with BRCA1 deficiency, normal mammary cells gradually show a higher signature score of LP gene expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Similarly, using the sets of genes up-and downregulated in the LP population compared to in other mammary cell populations obtained from the data of Pellacani et al. (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>), we found that genes upregulated in LPs also tended to be upregulated in BRCA1-deficient conditions, whereas genes downregulated in LPs tended to be downregulated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). These results suggest that BRCA1 may broadly affect the transcription profile of mammary cells, and therefore, when BRCA1 is deficient, LPs may tend to maintain a dedifferentiated state, leading to the abnormal expansion and tumorigenic properties of these cells in BRCA1 mutant carriers.</p>

<p>Multiple ETS family transcription factors were shown to be involved in human mammary development and differentiation in previous reports. However, the function of ELF3 in LPs has not yet been elucidated. We used GSEA to explore the transcriptional profiles of BRCA1-deficient mammary cells, ELF3-overexpressing mammary cells and human LPs from previous reports (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>). Surprisingly, these three transcriptional profiles have significant correlations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), indicating that ELF3 is not only a core transcription node under BRCA1 deficiency conditions but also, more importantly, that ELF3 plays significant roles in the transcriptional regulation of human LPs. In addition, in our single-cell sequencing data, the expression of ELF3 in LPs is the highest among all mammary cell populations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S6A</xref>). Same results were obtained analyzing the published data from Pellacani et al. (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S6B</xref>). To investigate ELF3 functions in regulating LP genes transcription, we used SEA (simple enrichment analysis) of MEME to perform motif enrichment of ESE and ELF subfamilies transcription factors in promoters of LP genes, as these transcription factors are more closely related to ELF3 in the ETS family, and several, such as ELF5 and EHF, have been reported to regulate LPs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). ELF3 was at the top of the list (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), demonstrating that ELF3 has higher affinity for the promoters of LP genes. Moreover, our single-cell data revealed that ELF3 expression levels were the highest in LPs compared to other members of the ESE and ELF subfamilies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), including ELF5, which has been reported to play vital roles in LP differentiation. In addition, we analyzed the ATAC-seq data in Brca1-deficient mouse LPs from Bach et al. (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>). The ATAC-seq compared the chromatin accessibility of LPs in Brca1/p53-deficient mice with WT mice, and motif enrichment analysis of transcription factors was performed in regions with increased accessibility of Brca1-deficient mouse LPs. ELF3 was among the top genes (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplement Fig. S6C</xref>) and is significantly enriched among all ETS transcription factors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). These data further confirm our hypothesis that ELF3 plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of LPs.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we revealed that LPs have the trait of higher replication stress, an important factor for their potential to transformation. The difference of LPs from other cell populations in normal mammary tissue has received considerable attention in the field. Research in mouse mammary tissue has revealed that the overall luminal epithelial cell population is enriched in mitotic, cell cycle and DNA repair-related pathways under estrogen-and progestogen-stimulated conditions relative to the basal and stromal cell populations (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></italic>). Subsequently, Casey et al. (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>) found that LPs of mouse mammary tissue are enriched in DNA repair and cell division pathways. A recent preprint from the same group (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>) continued the analysis of mouse tissue sequencing data and found that in LPs, DNA repair and replication pathways are significantly upregulated, indicating that LPs are more capable of DNA damage repair and thus more tolerant to BRCA1 deficiency. Furthermore, Nolan E et al. (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></italic>) found that RANK+ LPs are highly proliferative and prone to DNA damage. These studies did not reveal the reason for LP tendency to transform. In our study, we focus on the characteristic of LPs compared to other cell populations and using sequencing data from normal human mammary tissues (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></italic>), we reveal that the DNA replication pathways and the cellular response to replication stress pathways are significantly upregulated in LPs compared to those in other cell populations. We argue that high levels of replication stress may be the major source of DNA damage in LPs, resulting in DDR gene upregulation in these cells, and the high proliferation feature of LP could be the main reason for the high replication stress.</p>
<p>Replication stress is a hallmark of cancer, fueling cancer evolution by increasing genomic instability (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></italic>). LPs have inherently higher replication stress levels, and when BRCA1 is deficient, replication stress is further elevated during the transformation from normal LPs to tumor cells, suggesting that replication stress is an important driver of BRCA1-deficient tumorigenesis and the suppression of replication stress could be a new approach for preventive intervention in BRCA1 mutation carriers with the advantages of being less damaging than prophylactic resection. Moreover, we found that both replication stress and BRCA1 deficiency itself can induce high expression of ELF3, which also plays an important role in the tendency of LPs to transform with BRCA1 deficiency. First, ELF3 can help suppress excessive genomic instability, which is crucial for cell tolerance and survival with BRCA1 deficiency. We speculate that high ELF3 expression can help LPs maintain moderate levels of genomic instability that allow cells to proliferate and is sufficient to fuel cancer evolution, including subsequent events such as p53 mutation and BRCA1 loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Second, ELF3 upregulation can boost LP gene transcription, leading to LP dedifferentiation and expansion. Finally, as an EMT promoter in mammary tissue, ELF3 can accelerate the transformation of LPs to malignant cells. Therefore, high levels of replication stress and ELF3 expression are important factors resulting in the high tendency for LPs to transform (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). A key feature of BRCA1-associated tumors is the tissue specificity, the mechanism of which has long been a research focus. The transcriptional regulation functions of BRCA1 are critical for the development and differentiation of normal mammary tissue. LPs with abnormal expansion have been observed in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Several important differentiation pathways, such as WNT, Notch and Hedgehog, were downregulated in these abnormal LPs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>), suggesting that BRCA1 deficiency may lead to a differentiation blockade in LPs and, therefore, abnormal expansion. Our RNA-seq data revealed that the transcriptional profile of BRCA1-deficient MCF10A cells has a striking similarity to that of LPs in normal human mammary tissue, and ELF3 might be a core mediating transcription factor. This finding suggests that BRCA1 has a broad regulatory effect on gene expression in normal mammary cells and has specific functions in LPs; thus, its deficiency causes LPs to maintain a dedifferentiated state, leading to abnormal expansion of this cell population, and ELF3 may be a core transcription factor inducing these changes. In addition, our study reveals another layer of the mechanism underlying the tissue specificity of BRCA1-associated tumorsâthe capability of BRCA1 to regulate ELF3 expression. ELF3 is an epithelial-specific transcription factor, but the functions of ELF3 in different epithelial tissues vary. For example, ELF3 promotes tumor development in breast, prostate, and lung cancers (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>), whereas it suppresses tumorigenesis in bladder and oral squamous cancers (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>). In addition, ELF3 itself plays an important role in the development and differentiation of normal mammary tissue; thus, dysregulation of ELF3 may disturb these processes. Therefore, we suggest that replication stress caused by BRCA1 deficiency leads to upregulation of ELF3 expression in LPs, thus promoting the tissue-specific oncogenic functions of ELF3 and breast tumorigenesis.</p>

<p>This study also has some limitations. First, we used the MCF10A cell line, which is widely used for investigations into normal human mammary epithelial cells with the advantage of being easy to manipulate and modify, and compared to patient-derived cells, unknown genetic backgrounds in addition to BRCA1 mutations are avoided. However, the transcriptional profile and epigenetic characteristics of this cell line are distinct from those of normal human mammary cell populations and LPs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>). Although our data show that MCF10A cells can reflect the actual functions of BRCA1 in terms of maintaining genomic stability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B and C</xref>) and our RNA-seq data demonstrate enrichment in the known transcriptional target genes of BRCA1, the effect of BRCA1 defects in LPs needs to be further verified in primary human mammary cell populations. Second, the higher replication stress levels in LPs may lead to altered expression or modifications of molecules other than ELF3, affecting the development and progression of BRCA1-associated breast cancer, which also needs to be further explored. In addition, there are likely other DEGs in our BRCA1-deficient RNA-seq that play important roles in the progression of BRCA1-associated breast cancer, and these genes also have potential research value.</p>
<p>Taken together, we revealed that LPs have a trait of higher replication stress, endowing them with the potential for transformation with BRCA1 deficiency. Moreover, the levels of replication stress gradually increase during tumorigenesis, indicating that replication stress is a driving factor of BRCA1-associated malignant transformation. Mechanistically, ELF3 is significantly upregulated upon replication stress and BRCA1 deficiency, which can help suppress excessive genomic instability by stabilizing the DNA replication process, empowering LPs to tolerate and to transform with BRCA1 deficiency. Notably, BRCA1 deficiency causes a tendency for cells to display characteristics of the LP transcriptional profile, and ELF3 is a core transcription factor mediating this process. Our study reveals why BRCA1 deficiency is prone to result in tumorigenesis in LPs and elucidates the key role of replication stress and ELF3 during this process, and suggests promising targets for BRCA1-associated breast cancers.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study reveals ELF3 as a putative candidate driver of luminal progenitor (LP) transformation. Up-regulation of ELF3 during replicative stress conditions and in BRCA1 deficient cells may permit cell proliferation by suppressing genome instability. While the hypothesis is <bold>compelling</bold>, the experimental support is still <bold>incomplete</bold>, as it does not adequately demonstrate the role of ELF3 in LP cells per se. The mechanistic underpinnings by which ELF3 promotes cell tolerance to DNA damage were not fully explored either. With improvements, the work has the potential to enhance our understanding of how BRCA1 deficiency fuels LP transformation and thereby breast tumorigenesis.</p>

<p>The authors set out to define the molecular basis for LP as the origin of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers. They showed that LPs have the highest level of replicative stress, and hypothesise that this may account for their tendency to transform. They went on to identify ELF3 as a candidate driver of LP transformation and showed that ELF3 expression is up-regulated in response to replicative stress as well as BRCA1 deficiency. They went on to show that ELF3 inactivation led to a higher level of DNA damage, which may result from compromised replicative stress responses.</p>
<p>While the manuscript supports the interesting idea wherein ELF3 may fuel LP cell transformation, it remains obscure how ELF3 promotes cell tolerance to DNA damage. Interestingly the authors proposed that ELF3 suppresses excessive genomic instability, but in my opinion, I do not see any evidence that supports this claim. In fact, one might think that genomic instability is key to cell transformation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript focuses on a persistent question of why germline mutations in BRCA1 which impair homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks predispose to primarily breast and ovarian cancers but not other tissues. The authors propose that replication stress is elevated in the luminal progenitor (LP) cells and apply the gene signature from Dreyer et al as a measure of replication stress in populations of cells selected by FACS previously (published by Lim et al.) and suggest an enrichment of replication stress among the LP cells. This is followed by single-cell RNA seq data from a small number of breast tissues from a small number of BRCA1 mutation carriers but the pathogenic variants are not listed. The authors perform an elegant analysis of the effects of BRCA1 knockdown in MCF10A cells, but these cells are not considered a model of LP cells.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript suffers from significant gaps and leaps in logic among the datasets used. The connection to luminal progenitor cells is not adequately established because the models used are not representative of this population of cells. Therefore, the central hypothesis is not sufficiently justified.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The inducible knockdown of BRCA1 provided compelling data pointing to an upregulation of ELF3 in this setting as well as a small number of other genes. It would be useful to discuss the other genes for completeness and explain the logic for focusing on ELF3. Nonetheless, the connection with ELF 3 is reasonable. The authors provide significant data showing a role for ELF3 in breast epithelial cells and its role in cell survival.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The initial observations in primary breast cells have small sample sizes. The mutations in BRCA1 seem to be presumed to be all the same, but we know that pathogenic variants differ among individuals and range from missense mutations affecting interactions with one critical partner to large-scale truncations of the protein.</p>
<p>The figure legends are missing critical details that make it difficult for the reader to evaluate the data. The data support the notion that ELF3 may participate in relieving replication stress, but does not appear to be limited to LP cells as proposed in the hypothesis.</p>

<p>We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions on our manuscript. We appreciate the time and effort they have devoted to evaluating our work. In response to their valuable feedback, we will undertake a comprehensive revision of our manuscript to address their concerns and enhance the clarity of our findings.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1 has raised the important point of the need for a more thorough exploration of how ELF3 promotes cell tolerance to DNA damage.</p>
<p>Just as mentioned by the reviewer, we totally agreed that genomic instability is key to cell transformation. In the original manuscript, we proposed that ELF3 might be an important factor for cells to tolerate the lethal genomic instability caused by BRCA1 deficiency, keeping an âappropriateâ level of genomic instability, thus fueling cell transformation. And we acknowledge the limitation that the mechanism of how ELF3 promotes cell to tolerate DNA damage remains further exploration. To address this, ELF3 overexpression and knockdown experiments in more BRCA1 wildtype or deficient breast cell lines are planned. In addition, since ELF3 is an inherent transcription factor, we suspect the function of ELF3 to promote cell tolerance to DNA damage is mediated by transcription, and more downstream genes of ELF3 will be explored as well.</p>
<p>Regarding the concerns raised by Reviewer #2, we acknowledge that our manuscript may have contained gaps and limitations of the datasets used.</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback regarding the limitations of our cell models and their representativeness of LP cells. While we have utilized MCF10A cells for the knockdown experiments, we understand that these may not be a perfect representation of LP cells. To address this concern, we will incorporate a discussion on the limitations of our cell models and their relevance to LP cells, along with potential plans in LP cells that may be included in future studies.</p>
<p>We will also clarify the rationale for focusing on ELF3 and discuss the other genes identified in our analysis for completeness. Regarding to ELF3 functions in cells other than LP, in our analysis, ELF3 is highly expressed in LPs compared to other cell populations in mammary gland, making ELF3 a previously undefined LP gene. Thus, we suspect that ELF3 functions may be more significant in LP cells. We are also interested in ELF3 functions in cells other than LP cells and will further explore</p>
<p>We agree that different pathogenic variants of BRCA1 may cause diverse impacts on its function and tumorigenesis. We will add detailed information and discussion about BRCA1 pathogenic variants of patients in our single-cell RNA-seq. Also, to enhance the overall clarity of our manuscript, we will revise the figure legends to include critical details that were previously omitted. This will ensure that readers can better evaluate the presented data.</p>
