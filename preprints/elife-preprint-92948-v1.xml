<title>Abstract</title><p>Liver Type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) comprise conventional natural killer (cNK) cells and ILC1s. The main functions of Type 1 ILCs not only include directly killing target cells but also regulating the local immune microenvironment of the liver through the secretion of cytokines. Uncovering the intricate mechanisms by which transcriptional factors regulate and influence the functions of Type 1 ILCs, particularly within the context of liver tumors, presents a significant opportunity to amplify the effectiveness of immunotherapies against liver malignancies. Using Ncr1-drived conditional knockout mouse model, our study reveals the regulatory role of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in shaping the composition and maturation of liver Type 1 ILCs. Notably, Prdm1 regulates the ratio between NK cells and ILC1s, promoting a shift in the balance towards the direction of NK cells. Although <italic>Prdm1</italic> did not affect the killing function of cNK cells in an <italic>in vivo</italic> cytotoxicity model, a significant increase in cancer metastasis was observed in <italic>Prdm1</italic> knockout mice. IFN-γ, granzyme B, and perforin secretion decreased significantly in <italic>Prdm1</italic> deficient Type 1 ILCs. scRNA sequencing data also provided evidence that Prdm1 sustains functional subsets of liver type 1 ILCs and facilitates communications between Type 1 ILCs and macrophages. The present study unveiled a novel regulatory mechanism of Prdm1 in liver Type 1 ILCs, showing promising potential for developing innovative immune therapy strategies against liver cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Liver Type 1 ILCs consist of cNK cells and ILC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), with distinct developmental trajectories and effect molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Both NK cells and ILC1s play indispensable roles in combatting viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), maintaining local immune homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), eradicating malignant transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), and fostering cross-talk with adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). NK cells demonstrate potent cellular cytotoxicity, facilitating direct elimination of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). On the contrary, a defining attribute of ILC1s is their predominant cytokine-mediated functions, with limited cellular killing capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In a state of homeostasis, liver Type 1 ILCs (CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>NKp46<sup>+</sup>) can be discriminated into cNK cells and ILC1s by the differential expression of CD49a and CD49b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>): liver cNK cells are marked by the expression of CD49b, while liver ILC1s exhibit a distinctive positivity for CD49a. Tumor Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is also expressed on liver ILC1s, but not on liver NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Transcriptional factors (TFs) such as T-bet, Nfil3, PLZF, and ID2 are also required for Type 1 ILCs development or generation of their progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Eomes is considered to be necessary for NK cell maturation, but not for ILC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). On the contrary, deficiency of Hobit results in the depletion of ILC1s, while only leaving little impact on liver NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). These studies suggest that TFs may, or usually, play different roles in NK cells and ILC1s.</p>
<p>During the development of liver cancers, the functions of immune cells are often inhibited, resulting in the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and sometimes even systemic immune suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Transforming a cold tumor into a hot tumor with a stronger immune response is one of the goals of many cancer immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Research targeting the immune system is showing increasing clinical promise in liver cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Our recent study also found that Toll-like receptor agonists can significantly enhance the anti-tumor effect of Sorafenib by reconstructing the tumor immune microenvironment and reshaping the vascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>The anti-tumor activity of NK cells in the liver is relatively well-established, whereas the relationship between ILC1 and tumors is still a topic of controversy. Clinical research findings have shown that liver tumors with a higher infiltration of NK cells are associated with a better prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Decreased NK cell activity is closely correlated with the malignancy of liver tumors and represents a significant risk factor for recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The tumor microenvironment orchestrates the transformation of NK cells into ILC1s in a TGF-β-dependent manner, resulting in their diminished capacity to control tumor growth and metastasis. This process ultimately promotes tumor immunoevasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). However, research has also revealed that, distinct from directly inhibiting tumor growth, the primary function of ILC1 is to suppress the seeding of metastatic tumor cells in liver tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Comprehensive research in this field is essential to harness the precision of Type 1 ILCs targeted immunotherapy for liver cancers.</p>
<p>The transcription factor network governs the function of Type 1 ILCs and the balance between NK and ILC1. Our research team, along with others, has observed that Smad4 promotes the shift in balance from NK cells towards ILC1 in a TGF-beta-independent pathway. This study also revealed that Smad4 positively regulates the expression of another transcription factor, Prdm1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). PR domain 1 (Prdm1/Blimp1) plays a crucial role in the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and the homeostasis of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The function and regulatory network of Prdm1 in NK cells is distinct from B cells and T cells, for its expression is independent of B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6) and Interferon Regulatory actor 4 (IRF4) but relies on T-bet. In the study that identified Prdm1 as an essential transcriptional factor for NK cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), no significant differences were observed in IFN-γ production or cytotoxicity between Prdm1-deficient and wild-type NK cells. Although Prdm1 expression is dependent on IL-15 in immature NK cells and can be further upregulated by IL-12 or IL-21, it plays a role in downregulating the expression of certain cytokine receptors, such as CD25, consequently diminishing the responsiveness of NK cells to IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Notably, some studies have even suggested that Prdm1 suppresses the secretion of IFN-γ by NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). These findings imply that, although Prdm1 promotes NK cell development, it may function as a negative regulator of their activity. However, direct evidence supporting the impact of Prdm1 on NK cell anti-tumor capabilities is still lacking. Furthermore, there has been no investigation into its influence on the homeostasis of NK cells and ILC1s in the liver, nor has there been an exploration of the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>In the current study, we found that the deletion of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in Ncr1<sup>+</sup> cells resulted in an imbalance in the homeostasis of liver Type 1 ILCs, with a shift towards cNK cells. The data also support the essential role of Prdm1 in the cancer surveillance mediated by NK cells. While Prdm1 positively regulates genes associated with cellular cytotoxicity, it concurrently exerts inhibitory control over certain positive regulators of NK cell development and functionality, such as JunB. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we have identified a subset of NK cells within the liver characterized by elevated JunB expression. These cells exhibit decreased expression of genes associated with cellular cytotoxicity, and their abundance significantly increases following Prdm1 knockout.</p>

<title><italic>Prdm1</italic> promotes Type 1 ILCs homeostasis and terminal maturation</title>
<p>Examination of 363 liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed a positive correlation between the expression of NK cell-associated genes (<italic>NCR1</italic>, <italic>NCR3</italic>, <italic>KLRB1</italic>, <italic>CD160</italic>, and <italic>PRF1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and <italic>PRDM1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Patients with top and bottom quartiles of <italic>NK-PRDM1</italic> signature expression were chosen for survival analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, patients with the <italic>NK-PRDM1</italic><sup>hi</sup> signature had better overall survival compared to the these with NK-<italic>PRDM1</italic><sup>lo</sup> signature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar results were also found in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM, n=454) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD, n=497) patients (Supplemental Figure 1, A-F). These data suggested that <italic>PRDM1</italic> in NK cells might be essential for immune surveillance in some solid tumors, including liver cancer. These findings prompted us to investigate the impact and mechanism of <italic>PRDM1</italic> in NK cells and ILC1 within the context of liver cancer.</p>

<p>To achieve this, we developed a conditional knockout mouse model to specifically deplete <italic>Prdm1</italic> in Type 1 ILCs. <italic>Ncr1-Cre</italic> mice were crossed with <italic>Prdm1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice to generate <italic>Ncr1-cre Prdm1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, which specifically knockout exons 6-8 of <italic>Prdm1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) in NKp46 positive cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The mice carrying <italic>Ncr1<sup>Cre/+</sup>Prdm1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> were referred to as <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice, and the mice carrying <italic>Ncr1<sup>+/+</sup>Prdm1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>were referred to as <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice or wild-type (WT) mice. To further validate the deletion of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells of <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice, CD3<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted and the expression of <italic>Prdm1</italic> was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. The expressio n of <italic>Prdm1</italic> was almost undetectable in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref><bold>)</bold>, indicating successful knockout of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells.</p>
<p>Proportion and absolute number of cNK cells in blood, bone marrow, lung, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Compared with <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>mice, the percentage of cNK cells (CD3<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>NKp46<sup>+</sup>) among lymphocytes was decreased in all of these tissues except bone marrow and lymph nodes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>; Supplemental Figure 2A). However, no significant difference was observed in the percentage of cNK cells among bone marrow-derived lymphocytes between <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> and <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>mice. The absolute number of cNK cells in blood, lung, liver, and spleen also decreased in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>; Supplemental Figure 2A). Only a slight decrease in the number of cNK cells was observed in the lymph nodes of <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice, which did not reach statistical significance either (Supplemental Figure 2A). In contrast, the absolute number of cNK cells in <italic>Prdm1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice bone marrow is moderately higher than <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>NK cell terminal maturation can be divided into four stages according to the expression of CD11b and CD27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Stage IV (CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>-</sup>) NK cells show higher level of effector molecules than any other stages and are considered as the most mature NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Based on the expression of CD11b and CD27, the maturation of cNK cells from blood, bone marrow, lung, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes were assessed. Compared with <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, the proportion of most mature CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>-</sup> NK cells were significantly decreased in all of the analyzed tissues in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice, without any exceptions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>; Supplemental Figure 2B). Remarkably, an increase in immature CD11b<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> NK cells was also observed in these tissues. Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1) is a lectin-like receptor which was considered as another marker of NK cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). In both <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice, cNK cells from the liver and lung had the highest expression of KLRG1, following by blood and spleen (Supplemental Figure 2, C and D). The lowest KLRG1 expression was observed in cNK cells derived from lymph nodes and bone marrow, indicating the presence of the most immature cNK cells in these tissues. Consistent with CD11b/CD27 based maturation analysis, a significant loss of KLRG1<sup>+</sup> NK cells in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice was observed compared to <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (Supplemental Figure 2, C and D). Together, these data showed that <italic>Prdm1</italic> is required for the terminal maturation of cNK cells among various tissues.</p>

<p>Two subpopulations of liver Type 1 ILCs (gated by CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>NKp46<sup>+</sup>) were further analyzed based on the expression of CD49a and CD49b (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Compared with <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, the <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice exhibited an increased percentage of cNK cells (CD49a<sup>-</sup>CD49b<sup>+</sup>) and reduced proportion of ILC1s (CD49a<sup>+</sup>CD49b<sup>-</sup>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Of note, the absolute number of both cNK cells and ILC1s were decreased in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice, with a more robustly reduction in ILC1s (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This underscored the crucial role of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in maintaining the homeostasis of both liver cNK cells and ILC1s.</p>

<p>The disruption of NK cell homeostasis and maturation due to <italic>Prdm1</italic> loss motivated us to further explore whether deficiency of Prdm1 impaired NK cell cytotoxicity. A B2M-deficient cell-based <italic>in vivo</italic> cytotoxicity assay was used to evaluate the effect of <italic>Prdm1</italic> on the cytotoxicity of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). B2M-deficient cells do not have detectable Major Histocompatibility Complex I (MHC-Ⅰ) on the cell surface, making them the target of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Health NK cells will reject B2M-deficient donor cells efficiently and the elimination was used to quantify the cytotoxicity of NK cells. Although significant impaired homeostasis and maturation of NK cells were observed in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice, no significant difference in the <italic>in vivo</italic> cytotoxicity assay were observed between <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">C</xref>).</p>
<p>While our B2M-deficient cell-based assay did not reveal a significant impact of <italic>Prdm1</italic> on NK cell cytotoxicity, both our results and those of other researchers have demonstrated <italic>Prdm1</italic>’s role in positively regulating NK cell development and homeostasis. Besides direct cytotoxicity, other factors influence the anti-tumor capability of NK cells, such as the ability to counteract tumor-induced immune suppression and exhaustion, the secretion of cytokines to activate other immune cells for tumor elimination. Moreover, the cytotoxicity assay, due to its relatively short duration, might not fully represent the anti-tumor activity of NK cells when continuously exposed to immune inhibitory signals in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, we initiated an <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor model to further investigate the impact of <italic>Prdm1</italic> on NK cell anti-tumor capabilities. B16F10 is a melanoma cell line with low expression of MHC-Ⅰ, which was susceptible to NK cell killing and usually used to evaluate NK cell anti-tumor capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The B16F10 cells were intravenously (for lung metastasis) or intrasplenic (for liver metastasis) administrated in the mice. The melanoma nodes were quantified three (intravenous injection) or two (intrasplenic injection) weeks after tumor inoculation. Compared with <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, deficiency of <italic>Prdm1</italic> resulted in more metastasis nodules in both lung (∼ 2-fold) and liver (∼ 4-fold) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref>). Histological analysis further confirmed the increased frequency of metastasis tumor foci in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">G</xref>).</p>
<p>In agreement with our <italic>in vivo</italic> data, we also observed decreased IFN-γ secretion in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice-derived splenic cNK cells, liver cNK cells, and liver ILC1s when stimulated by IL-18 alone or IL-12/IL-18 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>; Supplemental Figure3), which indicated that <italic>Prdm1</italic> is required for full activation of cNK cells and ILC1s in the context of IFN-γ production. These data implying that although similar cellular killing capacity was observed between <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice, <italic>Prdm1</italic> is indispensable for NK cell mediated tumor surveillance.</p>

<p>Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed the enrichment of glucuronate metabolism and lymphocyte differentiation in upregulated genes in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice derived NK cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), both of which were associated with cellular growth and development. In contrast, leukocyte mediate cytotoxicity, immune receptor activity, and integrin binding was enriched in the genes which decreased their expression level in in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed enriched NF-kappa B signaling pathway and negative regulation of IL-6 production pathway in <italic>Prdm1-</italic>deficient cNK cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">E</xref>), suggesting the potential targets by <italic>Prdm1</italic> to regulate NK cell function. Increased expression of multiple TFs such as <italic>Junb</italic>, <italic>Batf3</italic>, <italic>Nfkb1</italic>, <italic>Tcf7</italic>, and <italic>Nr4a2</italic> was observed in <italic>Prdm1</italic> knockout cNK cells, suggesting they might be suppressed by <italic>Prdm1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Downregulation of granzyme B (<italic>Gzmb</italic>), Perfroin (<italic>Prf1</italic>) were observed in <italic>Prdm1</italic> deficient NK cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), implied decreased anti-tumor ability, which was consistent with increased melanoma metastasis in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref>). <italic>Cxcr6</italic>, and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> were also decreased in the NK cells derived from <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), which was considered to play an important role in promoting the egress of NK cells from bone marrow. This might be the reason for the quantity of NK cells increased in bone marrow while decreasing in other peripheral tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). As a result of the reduced expression levels of <italic>Cxcr6</italic> and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>, NK cells were unable to egress from the bone marrow and accumulated therein. Consistent with decreased production of IFN-γ after stimulated by IL-12/IL-18 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), decreased expression of <italic>Il18rap</italic> and <italic>Il12rb2</italic> were observed in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> cNK cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), implying impaired response to cytokine stimulation.</p>
<p>To confirm the result of RNA-sequencing, the expression of granzyme B and perforin were also analyzed by flow cytometry. Lower granzyme B and perforin production was observed in <italic>Prdm1</italic>-deficient splenic cNK cells, liver cNK cells and ILC1s (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">I</xref>; Supplemental Figure 4, A and B). Notably, granzyme B decreased among all of the maturation stages of cNK cells. Probably because of relatively low level of perforin in CD11b<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> cNK cells, there is not statistical difference between <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> cNK cells. However, significantly decrease in Perforin was observed in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice derived CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>-</sup> NK cells, which have the highest level of Perforin. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">J</xref>; Supplemental Figure 4C). These data implied that <italic>Prdm1</italic> directly regulates NK cells to exert cytotoxicity, not only due to the less mature phenotype in <italic>Prdm1</italic>-deficient NK cells.</p>

<title>scRNA-seq reveals unique properties of two clusters from liver type I ILCs following <italic>Prdm1</italic> knockout</title>
<p>To further investigate the effect of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in liver cNK cells and ILC1s, as well as the changes in the haptic immune microenvironment caused by the deficiency of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in Type 1 ILCs, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed for CD45<sup>+</sup> cells sorted from the liver (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; Supplemental Figure 5A). Initial quality control revealed high-quality of cell purity, library assembly, and sequencing (Supplemental Figure 5B). 10978 cells passed the quality criteria and were selected for further analysis (6161 from <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, 4,817 from <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice). Unsupervised clustering of all sequenced cells based on transcript signatures identified twelve distinct clusters, including B cells, Macrophages, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), NKT cells, cNK cells, ILC1s, Neutrophils, Monocytes, Basophils, and a small number of undefined cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). A higher percentage of Macrophages, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Monocytes, DCs, and a lower percentage of NK cells, ILC1s, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and NKT cells was observed in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice (Supplemental Figure 5C). Liver cNK cells and ILC1s were identified based on the expression of surface markers and TFs (Supplemental Figure 5D).

<p>To better understand the specific function of <italic>Prdm1</italic> played in liver cNK cells and ILC1s, the two subpopulations of liver Type 1 ILCs were further analyzed separately using unsupervised clustering. Liver cNK cells and ILC1s were grouped into three clusters respectively and visualized by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, D-I</xref>). Based on the cluster specific gene expression signature (Supplemental Figure 6, A and B), the subpopulation of liver cNK cells were referred as “<italic>Prf1</italic><sup>hi</sup>”, “<italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> ”, and “<italic>Cxcr3</italic><sup>hi</sup>” cNK cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Prf1</italic><sup>hi</sup> cNK cell cluster was defined by high expression of cytolysis-related genes, including <italic>Ncr1</italic>, <italic>Gzma</italic>, <italic>Gzmb</italic>, <italic>Prf1</italic>, and <italic>Fgl2</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>; Supplemental Figure 6C), indicating the strong target-killing ability of this cluster. GO analysis further revealed the enrichment signatures of cytolysis, response to virus, and lymphocyte mediated immunity in the genes upregulated in <italic>Prf1</italic><sup>hi</sup> cNK cell cluster, further confirming the cytotoxic effects of this cluster (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). While this cluster is present in both <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> and <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>mice, there is a significant reduction in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

<p>The <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> liver cNK cell cluster distinguished themselves by higher expression of <italic>Junb</italic> compared to other clusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). The expression of <italic>Junb</italic> was also upregulated in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>derived cNK cells and ILC1s (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The predominant majority (92.98%) of <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> liver cNK cells are derived from <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice, with less than ten percent (7.02%) originating from <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Many signal transduction elements, gene expression regulator, and transcriptional factors, such as <italic>Nfkbia</italic>, <italic>Tnfaip3</italic>, <italic>Nr4a1/2/3</italic>, <italic>Batf3</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Fosb</italic>, <italic>Tcf7</italic>, and <italic>Kit</italic> were upregulated in the <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> liver cNK cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>; Supplemental Figure 6C). The expression of cytotoxicity related genes, such as <italic>Gzmb</italic> and <italic>Prf1</italic>, in <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> cluster was also lower than other cNK cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). GO analysis showed that the genes upregulated in <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> liver cNK cells enriched in cell differentiation, cell activation, and transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). GSEA indicates that the NF-kappa B, IL-17, MAPK, and TNF signaling pathways were upregulated in this clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, E-H</xref>). GSEA also showed that mitochondrial related pathways, such as mitochondrial protein, oxidative phosphorylation, and respiratory electron transport chain were suppressed in <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> cNK cell cluster (Supplemental Figure 6, D-F). Increased proportion of <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> cluster in <italic>Prdm1</italic> deficient cNK cells suggested impaired anti-tumor activity, which was consistent with more melanoma metastasis in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice and lower expression of cytotoxicity-related genes in splenic cNK cells based on bulk RNA-sequencing.</p>
<p>The <italic>Cxcr3</italic><sup>hi</sup> cNK cell cluster was characterized with high expression of <italic>Cxcr3</italic>, <italic>Ccr2</italic>, and some genes encoding ribosomal subunits such as <italic>Rps7</italic> (Supplemental Figure 6C). The enrichment of chemokine receptors in the genes upregulated in the <italic>Cxcr3</italic><sup>hi</sup> cluster implying a greater likelihood of them being tissue-resident compared with other cNK cell clusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). The significant enrichment of ribosomal subunits and cytoplasmic translation in <italic>Cxcr3</italic><sup>hi</sup> cluster (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>) revealed their distinct and active metabolic profile and the capability to mount immune responses. The <italic>Cxcr3</italic><sup>hi</sup> cNK cell cluster had a remarkably decreased proportion in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), which emphasized the critical role of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in maintaining this cluster of liver cNK cells. Consisting with the flow cytometry result that showed an increase in the number of NK cells in the bone marrow and a decrease in NK cells in peripheral tissues, bulk RNA sequencing data also found that the expression of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> and <italic>Cxcr6</italic> decreased in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> cNK cells. These findings supported the hypothesis that <italic>Prdm1</italic>, through regulating chemokine receptor expression levels, influenced the distribution of NK cells in the bone marrow and peripheral tissues, particularly within the liver tissue.</p>
<p>Three clusters of ILC1s were identified from liver ILC1s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, G-I</xref>), comprising “<italic>Il7r</italic><sup>hi</sup>”, “<italic>Klra</italic><sup>hi</sup>”, and “<italic>Gzma</italic><sup>hi</sup>” ILC1s. The first two clusters of ILC1s were characterized by higher expression of <italic>Il7r</italic> (CD127) and <italic>Klra5</italic> separately, while the <italic>Gzma</italic><sup>hi</sup> ILC1 cluster was identified by elevated expression of both <italic>Gzma</italic> and <italic>Gzmb</italic> (Supplemental Figure 7, A-C). The <italic>Il7r</italic><sup>hi</sup> ILC1s cluster was distinguishable from other ILC1 clusters by its high expression of <italic>Il7r</italic>, IL18RA (<italic>Il18r1</italic>), and IFN-γ (<italic>Ifng</italic>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; Supplemental Figure 7C). The high expression of <italic>Il18r1</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic> in <italic>Il7r</italic><sup>hi</sup> ILC1s indicated this cluster of cells was highly responsive to IL-18. Module scores, calculated based on the expression of feature genes within the <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> cNK cell cluster, revealed a comparable <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> signature expression pattern within the <italic>Il7r</italic><sup>hi</sup> ILC1 cluster (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). GO analysis and GSEA showed that IL-17, NF-kappa B, TNF, MAPK signaling pathway and T cell differentiation were activated in the <italic>Il7r</italic><sup>hi</sup> ILC1 cluster (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D, I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">J</xref>; Supplemental Figure 7D-F). Considering the close relationship between IL-17 mediated immunity response and ILC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), it is plausible that the observed heterogeneity within this cluster may be attributed, at least in part, to potential plasticity between ILC1 and ILC3 subsets. These two clusters appear reminiscent of an intermediate stage in the conversion process from cNK cells to ILC1s, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). There was no significant difference in the proportion of this cluster between WT and in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice.</p>
<p>The second liver ILC1 cluster, characterized by high expression of Ly49E (<italic>Klra5</italic>) and Ly49G (<italic>Klra7</italic>), was designated as the <italic>Klra</italic><sup>hi</sup> ILC1 cluster (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Notably, there was an elevated proportion of <italic>Klra</italic><sup>hi</sup> ILC1s in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> ILC1s (39.7%) compared to <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> ILC1s (28.1%). Liver Ly49E<sup>+</sup> ILC1s have been identified as possessing greater cytotoxic potential and a more robust viral response compared to liver Ly49E<sup>-</sup> ILC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). The <italic>Klra</italic><sup>hi</sup> cluster exhibited notably high expression of <italic>Ccl5</italic> (Supplemental Figure 7C). Previous research has underscored the pivotal role of CCL5, produced by both cNK cells and ILC1s, in facilitating the accumulation of DCs within the tumor microenvironment, thereby impeding tumor immune evasion, as highlighted in studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The expression of <italic>Ccl5</italic> was reduced in the <italic>Klra</italic><sup>hi</sup> cluster of <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> ILC1s compared to <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> ILC1s (Supplemental Figure 7C). This decrease in <italic>Ccl5</italic> expression could potentially have a detrimental impact on the ability of <italic>Klra</italic><sup>hi</sup> ILC1s to develop a connection between innate and adaptive immune responses.</p>
<p>The <italic>Gzma</italic><sup>hi</sup> ILC1 cluster was identified according to the high expression of <italic>Gzma</italic>, <italic>Gzmb</italic>, and <italic>Fgl2</italic> (Supplemental Figure 7C), compared to other ILC1 clusters. GO analysis also revealed the enrichment in cytolysis and stimulus-response capacity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) of the <italic>Gzma</italic><sup>hi</sup> ILC1 cluster. Consistent with the <italic>Prf1</italic><sup>hi</sup> cNK cell cluster, the proportion of the <italic>Gzma</italic><sup>hi</sup> cluster among liver ILC1s exhibited a considerable reduction in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, and the expression of <italic>Gzma</italic> also downregulated in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

Interactions between ILC1s and macrophages were higher than that between cNK cells and macrophages (Supplemental Figure 9, A and B). There is a significant decrease in the interaction number between liver Type 1 ILCs (including cNK cells and ILC1s) and macrophages (∼2 fold) in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">C</xref>). A reduction in the interaction of ligand-receptor, such as Mif-CD74, Cxcl16-Cxcr6, and Cxcl10-Cxcr3 was observed in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (Supplemental Figure 10). Liver cNK cells and ILC1s contributed equally to macrophages through most pathways, while CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL), Thy-1 cell surface antigen (THY1), and C-type lectin (CLEC) pathways participated more in ILC1-Mac interaction than cNK-Macrophage interaction (Supplemental Figure 9, C and D). Compared to <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, the information flow of CXCL and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) pathways significantly decreased in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">E</xref>). These pathways play a crucial role in facilitating macrophage migration.

These changes could be linked to a decreased population of ILC1s and <italic>Cxcr3</italic><sup>hi</sup> cNK cell cluster in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice, implying that the homeostasis of <italic>Cxcl2</italic><sup>hi</sup> macrophages required sufficient signals from cNK cells and ILC1s.

<p>The suppression of mitochondrial related pathways in <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> cNK cell cluster, along with a significant increase of this cNK cell cluster in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice, encouraged us to explore mitochondrial function through flow cytometry.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using Ncr1-driven conditional knockout transgenic mice, which specifically delete <italic>Prdm1</italic> in Type 1 ILCs, we not only validated <italic>Prdm1</italic>’s positive regulation of NK cell maturation, but also demonstrated its indispensable role in NK cell anti-tumor activity. The compromised mitochondrial function and reduced IFN-γ, granzyme B, and perforin production appear to be potential contributing factors to Prdm1-mediated cancer surveillance. Decreased expression of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> and <italic>Cxcr6</italic> was observed in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> splenic cNK cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), both of which are essential for NK cells egressing from bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). The quantity of cNK cells increased exclusively in the bone marrow, with reductions observed in all other tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). This indicated that <italic>Prdm1</italic> might regulate chemokine receptors to facilitate the egression of cNK cells from the bone marrow to peripheral tissues. In addition, higher expression of <italic>Cxcr6</italic> compared to cNK cells is also a key factor for liver tissue residence of ILC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Decreased expression of <italic>Cxcr6</italic> in <italic>Prdm1</italic> deficient Type 1 ILCs may also contribute to the balance shift towards cNK cells.</p>
<p>scRNA sequencing analysis reveals that both liver cNK cells and ILC1s can be further divided into three subgroups based on their gene expression patterns. Within the cNK cells, the abundance of <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> cluster substantially increased in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice (75.8%). Notably, these cells account for less than 5% of WT cNK cells. High <italic>Junb</italic> expression stood out as a prominent feature of this subgroup. Junb is a crucial transcriptional factor for the cytotoxic function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells. However, excessive <italic>Junb</italic> expression has been found to promote T cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Our previous study showed that as NK cells mature, the expression level of <italic>Prdm1</italic> increased while the expression level of <italic>Junb</italic> gradually decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Our data demonstrated that in NK cells, the expression level of <italic>Junb</italic> significantly increases upon the deletion of Prdm1, indicating that <italic>Junb</italic> expression is suppressed by Prdm1. As <italic>Junb</italic> expression decreases with NK cell maturation, and it is inhibited by the gradually increasing Prdm1 during maturation. This implies that constraining <italic>Junb</italic> expression is likely a fundamental prerequisite for NK cell maturation. However, the precise mechanism by which Prdm1 downregulates <italic>Junb</italic> in NK cells still needs further research. Furthermore, <italic>Junb</italic><sup>hi</sup> NK cells exhibit lower expression levels of cytotoxic genes and reduced mitochondrial-related signaling pathways. Mitochondrial fragmentation has also been confirmed to be closely associated with NK cell exhaustion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). While our current data is not sufficient to definitively classify these cells as exhausted NK cells, it supports that this particular group of NK cells demonstrates an exhausted phenotype. The significant increase in this cell population following <italic>Prdm1</italic> knockout in NK cells may potentially be one of the reasons why <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic>mice lose their tumor-killing capacity.</p>
<p>Our scRNA-seq data revealed that <italic>Prdm1</italic> plays distinct roles in regulating cNK cells and ILC1s despite being required for both lineages. Specifically, <italic>Prdm1</italic> appears to be more involved in promoting the resistance against exhaustion in cNK cells, whereas in ILC1s, it may play a role in the plasticity between ILC1s and ILC3s. In both our previous study and a study by Colonna et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), it was demonstrated that <italic>Smad4</italic>, a transcriptional factor involved in TGF-β signal pathway, upregulated <italic>Prdm1</italic> in NK cells and depletion of <italic>Smad4</italic> resulted in a decreased ratio of NK cells to ILC1s in the liver. However, knocking out <italic>Prdm1</italic> in Ncr1<sup>+</sup> cells increased the ratio of NK cells to ILC1s in liver type 1 ILCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These findings suggest the possibility of a Smad4-independent pathway through which <italic>Prdm1</italic> promotes the maintenance of ILC1s, or that <italic>Prdm1</italic> plays a more significant role in maintaining ILC1s compared to its role in NK cells.</p>
<p>Chronic inflammation is a crucial factor in promoting tumorigenesis, and macrophages play a significant role in this process. Macrophages interact with both cNK cells and ILC1s. However, the TFs that regulate these interactions are poorly understood. Fortunately, recent advances in scRNA-seq technology and the CellChat software tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) have allowed us to gain a better understanding of the <italic>Prdm1</italic> signaling pathway in Type 1 ILCs and its impact on macrophage function at the transcriptional level. It is worth noting that normal ILC1-macrophage interactions are more prevalent than those with NK cells (Supplemental Figure 9, A and B). Moreover, the finding of increased liver metastasis in <italic>Prdm1<sup>ΔNcr1</sup></italic> mice indicated the crucial role of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in maintaining homeostasis between Type 1 ILCs and macrophages. Specifically, <italic>Prdm1</italic> may be critical in preventing the overactivation of macrophages that can lead to cancer development.</p>

<p>He et al. investigate the requirement and function of Blimp1 (encoded by Prdm1) in murine NK cells and ILC1. Employing a conditional knockout mouse model (Prdm1flox x Ncr1cre), the authors describe impaired abundance and maturation of Prdm1-deficient NK cells and ILC1 in different tissues. Blimp1-deficient NK cells have reduced expression of cytotoxic molecules (Gzmb, Prf1) and, in some instances, Ifng production, and Prdm1flox x Ncr1cre mice show impaired tumor control in experimental metastasis models. Using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, the authors propose that Prdm1 regulates JunB expression and NK cell maturation. Based on in silico analyses, the authors suggest manifold intercellular communication between NK/ILC1 and macrophages. Without following up on any of these potentially interesting suggestions, the authors conclude their study reiterating that Prdm1 regulates IFNg-production of tumor-infiltrating NK cells and ILC1.</p>
<p>Many of the reported functions of Blimp1 in NK cells have previously been identified using a mixed-chimera strategy comparing Prdm1 WT and KO NK cells (Kallies et al., Blood 2011). Here, the authors expand on these findings using a conditional model to delete Prdm1 in NK/ILC1 and single-cell sequencing and provide a more refined analysis of the functions of Blimp1 in these cells. Cell-chat analysis suggests close interactions of Blimp-dependent NK/ILC1 subsets with hepatic macrophages, but these suggestions are not followed up by experiments. Potentially interesting differences in the macrophage compartment of Ncr1-Cre x Prdm1-fl/fl mice are suggested by the scc-RNA-Seq data but are not validated e.g. by FACS. The study falls short in providing new mechanistic insights. Nevertheless, it is an interesting confirmation of &quot;old&quot; suggestions in a more refined setting, and the provided single-cell mRNA-Seq data represents a potentially valuable resource for the community. There are some control analyses that are required to support the conclusions of the authors, and I have a few suggestions that would help to improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>- The authors do not control for the potential effects of Cre expression. Expression of Cre from within the Ncr1 locus (using the mouse model established by Narni-Mancinelli et al.) has significant effects on NK cells and especially ILC1s (reducing their frequency and absolute numbers and altering their functionality. The authors should characterize the Ncr1cre mice used here (developed by Shanghai Model Organism Center) in this regard and should use proper controls (Ncr1Cre+ Prdm1wt/wt as control for Ncr1Cre+ Prdm1fl/fl, instead of WT littermates) for all of their key data, e.g. those depicted in Fig 1FG, 2ADFH, 7D, S2,3,4.</p>
<p>- Several of the phenotypic findings on NK cells have been described before by Kallies et al. in 2011 (Ref 29), although using a different genetic Prdm1-ablation model (Prdm1-GFP/GFP knockin/knockout model). This study reported impaired NK cell maturation, reduced Gzmb expression, impaired in vivo cytotoxicity against subcutaneous RMA-S cells, impaired in vitro proliferation, comparable in vitro killing, increase in BM NK cell numbers. The authors should discuss/mention this more prominently in their manuscript, and highlight where they confirm or refine these previous findings, and where they actually provide new information.</p>
<p>- What is the reason to refer to the enriched cluster in Blimp1-deficient NK cells as &quot;Junbhi&quot;? There is no follow-up for a function of Junb, and there are many other genes upregulated in these cells. Most critically, these cells seem to represent exactly the c-Kithi cells that Kallies et al. already showed and discussed in their paper. The authors should stain for Kit, and also refer to this. Also, MacKay et al. performed Blimp1-Chip-Seq (in T cells), maybe it would be interesting to check to which of the identified DEGs Blimp1 can bind.</p>
<p>- cNK cells are considered circulating cells, that transiently pass through the liver. Previous studies have suggested almost identical gene expression patterns in hepatic and splenic NK cells. In functional tests, they often &quot;perform&quot; identically. I am therefore a bit surprised that the authors find a differential dependency of Blimp1 for the IFNg production of splenic (no role of Blimp1) versus hepatic (Blimp1 regulating IFNg production) NK cells (Fig S3). Do the authors have any suggestions on that? The analyses are performed by 12+4h stimulations with IL12/18, which could involve the effects of altered bystander cells (as suggested by Figure 6). Therefore, these analyses should be provided upon standard 4h stimulations with IL12/18 and also with PMA/I under BFA. Note: liver and splenic cNK cells look quite different in the chosen histograms in Figures 7 A, B, C, yet there is massive variability in these analyses - is there any systematic/technical problem?</p>
<p>- Figure 4 H/I - In contrast to NK cells in Fig 4E, F, the KO and WT ILC1s seem to co-cluster largely. Authors should validate differentially expressed genes. How strong is the effect of Blimp1 in ILC1s? Or is Blimp1 a critical TF driving effector differentiation in NK cells, while it has only subtle effects in ILC1 (these may be regulated by Hobit?)? This seems an interesting finding that should at least be discussed. For these types of small differences in ILC1, FACS confirmation analyses should be performed and findings be reevaluated using Cre-expressing controls (see above).</p>
<p>The authors describe and discuss some of Figure 1 and 2 data as if Blimp1 would be involved in alternative NK versus ILC1 fates, but there is no evidence for this.</p>
<p>- There are several recent studies suggesting a role for Hobit, homologue of Blimp1, in NK cells and in ILC1, and in the control of liver metastases. The authors should discuss similar and unique functions of Hobit and Blimp1, also in the regulation of gene expression patterns, and should refer to these studies.</p>
<p>- Figure 4: The authors should discuss (and cross-validate) their liver gene expression analyses in the context of published datasets of NK and ILC1, such as the ones by Lopez et al, Friedrich et al, Ducimetiere et al and Yomogida et al.</p>

This study offers a significant advancement in understanding liver innate lymphoid cell (ILC) biology by elucidating the role of the transcription factor Prdm1. It shows that Prdm1 is crucial in maintaining the balance between conventional natural killer (cNK) cells and ILC1s in the liver, with knockout models revealing a vital role in cancer defense mechanisms. Despite not affecting direct cytotoxicity, Prdm1 deficiency leads to increased cancer metastasis and reduced secretion of key molecules like IFN-γ, pointing to its importance in immune regulation. The use of single-cell RNA sequencing further underscores Prdm1's role in cellular communication within the liver's immune milieu. This study is a robust contribution to the field, providing insights that could inform new immunotherapy approaches for liver cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study's strength lies in its comprehensive approach, combining the specificity of Prdm1 conditional deletion in Ncr1-cre mice with integrative omics analyses and cutting-edge cytometry to delineate Prdm1's role in liver Type 1 ILC biology and its functional implications in tumor immunity. This multifaceted strategy not only clarifies Prdm1's influence on ILC composition and maturation but also conveys potential therapeutic insights for liver cancer immunotherapy.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
A notable weakness of the study is the limited scope of in vivo disease models, primarily relying on the B16F10 melanoma model, which may not fully capture the complex behavior of Type 1 ILCs across diverse cancer types. Furthermore, the absence of direct human data, such as the effects of PRDM1 deletion in human NK cells or stem cells during their differentiation into NK and ILC1, leaves a gap in translating these findings to clinical settings.</p>
