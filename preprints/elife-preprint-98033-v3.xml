<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Protein engineering is a pivotal aspect of synthetic biology, involving the modification of amino acids within existing protein sequences to achieve novel or enhanced functionalities and physical properties. Accurate prediction of protein variant effects requires a thorough understanding of protein sequence, structure, and function. Deep learning methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in guiding protein modification for improved functionality. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on protein sequences, which face challenges in efficiently encoding the geometric aspects of amino acids’ local environment and often fall short in capturing crucial details related to protein folding stability, internal molecular interactions, and bio-functions. Furthermore, there lacks a fundamental evaluation for developed methods in predicting protein thermostability, although it is a key physical property that is frequently investigated in practice. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel pre-training framework that integrates sequential and geometric encoders for protein primary and tertiary structures. This framework guides mutation directions toward desired traits by simulating natural selection on wild-type proteins and evaluates variant effects based on their fitness to perform specific functions. We assess the proposed approach using three benchmarks comprising over 300 deep mutational scanning assays. The prediction results showcase exceptional performance across extensive experiments when compared to other zero-shot learning methods, all while maintaining a minimal cost in terms of trainable parameters. This study not only proposes an effective framework for more accurate and comprehensive predictions to facilitate efficient protein engineering, but also enhances the <italic>in silico</italic> assessment system for future deep learning models to better align with empirical requirements.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The diverse roles proteins play in nature necessitate their involvement in varied bio-functions, such as catalysis, binding, scaffolding, and transport. Advances in science and technology have positioned proteins, particularly those with desired catalytic and binding properties, to pivotal positions in medicine, biology, and scientific research (<xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2024a</xref>). While wild-type proteins exhibit optimal bio-functionality in their native environments, industrial applications often demand adaptation to conditions such as high temperature, high pressure, strong acidity, and strong alkalinity. The constrained efficacy of proteins in meeting the stringent requirements of industrial functioning environments hinders their widespread applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Woodley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ismail et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Jiang et al., 2023</xref>). Consequently, there arises a need to engineer these natural proteins to enhance their functionalities, aligning them with the demands of both industrial and scientific applications.</p>
<p>Analyzing the relationship between protein sequence and function yields valuable insights for engineering proteins with new or enhanced functions in synthetic biology. The intrinsic goal of protein engineering is to unveil highly functional sequences by navigating the intricate, high-dimensional surface of the fitness landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), which delineates the relationship between amino acid (AA) sequences and the desired functional state. Predicting the effects of AA substitutions, insertions, and deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Riesselman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Notin et al., 2022a</xref>) in proteins, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., mutation, thus allows researchers to dissect how changes in the AA sequence can impact the protein’s catalytic efficiency, stability, and binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shin et al., 2021</xref>). However, the extensive, non-contiguous search space of AA combinations poses challenges for conventional methods, such as rational design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aprile et al., 2020</xref>) or directed evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), in efficiently and effectively identifying protein variants with desired properties. In response, deep learning has emerged as a promising solution that proposes favorable protein variants with high fitness.</p>
<p>Deep learning approaches have been instrumental in advancing scientific insights into proteins, predominantly categorized into sequence-based and structure-based methods. Autoregressive protein language models (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Notin et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Madani et al., 2023</xref>) interpret AA sequences as raw text to generate with self-attention mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vaswani et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, masked language modeling objectives develop attention patterns that correspond to the residue-residue contact map of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Meier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rives et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Vig et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brandes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lin et al., 2023</xref>). Other methods start from a multiple sequence alignment, summarizing the evolutionary patterns in target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Riesselman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Frazer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rao et al., 2021b</xref>). These methods result in a strong capacity for discovering the hidden protein space. However, the many-to-one relationship of both sequence-to-structure and structure-to-function projections requires excessive training input or substantial learning resources, which raises concerns regarding the efficiency of these pathways when navigating the complexities of the vast sequence space associated with a target function. Moreover, the overlooked local environment of proteins hinders the model’s ability to capture structure-sensitive properties that impact protein’s thermostability, interaction with substrates, and catalytic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Koehler Leman et al., 2023</xref>). Alternatively, structure-based modeling methods serve as an effective enhancement to complement sequence-oriented inferences for proteins with their local environment (<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2024e</xref>; <xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2024c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2024b</xref>; <xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2024c</xref>). Given that core mutations often induce functional defects through subtle disruptions to structure or dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Roscoe et al., 2013</xref>), incorporating protein geometry into the learning process can offer valuable insights into stabilizing protein functioning. Recent efforts have been made to encode geometric information of proteins for topology-sensitive tasks such as molecule binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Myung et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kong et al., 2023</xref>) and protein properties prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2024d</xref>,a). Nevertheless, structure encoders fall short in capturing non-local connections for AAs beyond their contact region and overlook correlations that do not conform to the ‘structure-function determination’ heuristic.</p>
<p>There is a pressing need to develop a novel framework that overcomes limitations inherent in individual implementations of sequence or structure-based investigations. To this end, we introduce ProtSSN to assimilate the semantics and topology of <bold>Prot</bold>eins from their <bold>S</bold>equence and <bold>S</bold>tructure with deep neural <bold>N</bold>etworks. ProtSSN incorporates the intermediate state of protein structures and facilitates the discovery of an efficient and effective trajectory for mapping protein sequences to functionalities. The developed model extends the generalization and robustness of self-supervised protein language models while maintaining low computational costs, thereby facilitating self-supervised training and task-specific customization. A funnel-shaped learning pipeline, as depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, is designed due to the limited availability of protein crystal structures compared to observed protein sequences. Initially, the linguistic embedding establishes the semantic and grammatical rules in AA chains by inspecting millions of protein sequences. The topological embedding then enhances the interactions among locally connected AAs. Since a geometry can be placed or observed by different angles and positions in space, we represent proteins’ topology by graphs and enhance the model’s robustness and efficiency with a rotation and translation equivariant graph representation learning scheme.</p>

<p>The pre-trained ProtSSN demonstrates its feasibility across a broad range of mutation effect prediction benchmarks covering catalysis, interaction, and thermostability. Mutation effects prediction serves as a common <italic>in silico</italic> assessment for evaluating the capability of an established deep learning framework in identifying favorable protein variants. With the continuous evolution of deep mutation scanning techniques and other high-throughput technologies, benchmark datasets have been curated to document fitness changes in mutants across diverse proteins with varying degrees of combinatorial and random modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Moal and Fernández-Recio, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nikam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Velecký et al., 2022</xref>). <bold>ProteinGym v1</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Notin et al., 2024</xref>) comprehends fitness scoring of mutants to catalytic activity and binding affinity across over 200 well-studied proteins of varying deep mutational scanning (DMS) assays and taxa. Each protein includes tens of thousands of mutants documented from high-throughput screening techniques. While <bold>ProteinGym v1</bold> initiates the most comprehensive benchmark dataset for mutants toward different properties enhancement, these fitness scores are normalized and simplified into several classes without further specifications. For instance, a good portion of protein assays is scored by their stability, which, in practice, is further categorized into thermostability, photostability, pH-stability, <italic>etc</italic>. Moreover, these stability properties should be discussed under certain environmental conditions, such as pH and temperature. Unfortunately, these detailed attributes are excluded in <bold>ProteinGym v1</bold>. Since a trade-off relationship emerges between activity and thermostability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>), protein engineering in practice extends beyond enhancing catalytic activities to maintaining or increasing thermostability for prolonged functional lifetimes and applications under elevated temperatures and chemical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, there is a need to enrich mutation effect prediction benchmarks that evaluate the model’s efficacy in capturing variant effects concerning thermostability under distinct experimental conditions. In this study, we address the mutation effect prediction tasks on thermostability with <bold>DTm</bold> and <bold>DDG</bold>, two new single-site mutation benchmarks that measure thermostability using ΔTm and ΔΔG values, respectively. Both benchmarks group experimental assays based on the protein-condition combinations. These two datasets supplement the publicly available DMS assay benchmarks and facilitate ready-to-use assessment for future deep learning methods toward protein thermostability enhancement.</p>
<p>This work fulfills practical necessities in the development of deep learning methods for protein engineering from three distinct perspectives. Firstly, the developed ProtSSN employs self-supervised learning during training to obviate the necessity for additional supervision in down-stream tasks. This zero-shot scenario is desirable due to the scarcity of experimental results, as well as the ‘cold-start’ situation common in many wet lab experiments. Secondly, the trained model furnishes robust and meaningful approximations to the joint distribution of the entire amino acid chain, thereby augmenting the <italic>epistatic effect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sarkisyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Khersonsky et al., 2018</xref>) in deep mutations. This augmentation stems from the model’s consideration of the nonlinear combinatorial effects of amino acid sites. Additionally, we complement the existing dataset of DMS assay with additional benchmark assays related to protein-environment interactions, specifically focusing on thermostability–an integral objective in numerous protein engineering projects.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This section starts by introducing the three mutational scanning benchmark datasets used in this study, including an open benchmark dataset <bold>ProteinGym v1</bold> and two new datasets on protein thermostability, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., <bold>DTm</bold> and <bold>DDG</bold>. We establish the proposed ProtSSN for protein sequences and structures encoding in Section Proposed Method. The overall pipeline of model training and inference is presented in Section Model Pipeline. The experimental setup for model evaluation is provided in Section Experimental Protocol.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Dataset</title>
<p>To evaluate model performance in predicting mutation effects, we compare ProtSSN with SOTA baselines on <bold>ProteinGym-v1</bold>, the largest open benchmark for DMS assays. We also introduce two novel benchmarks, <bold>DTm</bold> and <bold>DDG</bold>, for assessing protein thermostability under consistent control environments. Details of the new datasets are provided in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Considering the significant influence of experimental conditions on protein temperature, we explicitly note the pH environment in each assay. Refer to the following paragraphs for more details.</p>

<title>ProteinGym</title>
<p>The assessment of ProtSSN for deep mutation effects prediction is conducted on <bold>ProteinGym v1</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Notin et al., 2024</xref>). It is the most extensive protein substitution benchmark comprising 217 assays and more than 2.5<italic>M</italic> mutants. These DMS assays cover a broad spectrum of functional properties (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., ligand binding, aggregation, viral replication, and drug resistance) and span various protein families (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., kinases, ion channel proteins, transcription factors, and tumor suppressors) across different taxa (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., humans, other eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a2">
<title>DTm</title>
<p>The assays in the first novel thermostability benchmark are sourced from single-site mutations in <bold>ProThermDB</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nikam et al., 2021</xref>). Each assay is named in the format ‘<italic>UniProt_ID-pH</italic>’. For instance, ‘<italic>O00095-8</italic>.<italic>0</italic>’ signifies mutations conducted and evaluated under pH 8.0 for protein O00095. The attributes include ‘mutant’, ‘score’, and ‘UniProt_ID’, with at least 10 mutants to ensure a meaningful evaluation. To concentrate on single-site mutations compared to wild-type proteins, we exclude records with continuous mutations. To avoid dealing with partial or misaligned protein structures resulting from incomplete wet experimental procedures, we employ UniProt ID to pair protein sequences with folded structures predicted by AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk">https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk</ext-link>. In total, <bold>DTm</bold> consists of 66 such protein-environment pairs and 2, 520 mutations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a3">
<title>DDG</title>
<p>The second novel thermostability benchmark is sourced from <bold>DDMut</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>), where mutants are paired with their PDB documents. We thus employ crystal structures for proteins in <bold>DDG</bold> and conduct additional preprocessing steps for environmental consistency. In particular, we group mutants of the same protein under identical experimental conditions and examine the alignment between mutation sites and sequences extracted from crystal structures.

<p>Compared to protein language models (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, colored circles), ProtSSN benefits from abundant structure information to more accurately capture the overall protein characteristics, resulting in enhanced thermostability and thus achieving higher correlation scores on <bold>DTm</bold> and <bold>DDG</bold>. This is attributed to the compactness of the overall architecture as well as the presence of stable local structures such as alpha helices and beta sheets, both of which are crucial to protein thermostability by providing a framework that resists unfolding at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Robinson-Rechavi et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, the other two structures-involved models, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., ESM-if1 and MIF-ST, also exhibit higher performance on the two thermostability benchmarks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, although protein language models can typically increase their scale, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., the number of trainable parameters, to capture more information from sequences, they cannot fully replace the role of the structure-based analysis. This observation aligns with the mechanism of protein functionality, where local structures (such as binding pockets and catalytic pockets) and the overall structure (such as conformational changes and allosteric effect) are both crucial for binding and catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sheng et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike the thermostability benchmarks, the discrepancies between structure-involved models and protein language models are mitigated in <bold>Prote-inGym v1</bold> by increasing the model scale. In summary, structure-based and sequence-based methods are suitable for different types of assays, but a comprehensive framework (such as ProtSSN) demonstrates superior overall performance compared to large-scale language models. Moreover, ProtSSN demonstrates consistency in providing high-quality fitness predictions of thermostability. We randomly bootstrap 50% of the samples from <bold>DTm</bold> and <bold>DDG</bold> for ten independent runs, the results are reported In <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> for both the average performance and the standard deviation.

<p>ProtSSN utilizes noise sampling at each epoch on the node attributes to emulate random mutations in nature. This introduction of noise directly affects the node attribute input to the graphs. Alongside the ‘mutate-then-recode’ method we implemented in the main algorithm, we examined four additional strategies to perturb the input data during training. The construction of these additional strategies is detailed below, and their corresponding Spearman’s <italic>ρ</italic> on <bold>ProteinGym v0</bold> is in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(e)</xref>.</p>

<title>Global Average</title>
<p>Suppose the encoded sequential representation of a node is predominantly determined by its residue. In essence, the protein sequence encoder will return similar embeddings for nodes of the same residue, albeit at different positions within a protein. With this premise, the first strategy replaces the node embedding for perturbed nodes with the average representations of the same residues. For example, when perturbing an AA to glycine, an overall representation of glycine is assigned by extracting and average-pooling all glycine representations from the input sequence.</p>

<sec id="s3c2">
<title>Sliding Window</title>
<p>The presumption in the previous method neither aligns with the algorithmic design nor biological heuristics. Self-attention discerns the interaction of the central token with its neighbors across the entire document (protein). The representation of a residue is influenced by both its neighbors’ residues and locations. Thus, averaging embeddings of residues from varying positions is likely to forfeit positional information of the modified residue. For this purpose, we consider a sliding window of size 3 along the protein sequence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c3">
<title>Gaussian Noise</title>
<p>The third option regards node embeddings of AA as hidden vectors and imposes white noise on the vector values. We define the mean= 0 and variance= 0.5 on the noise, making the revised node representation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="569522v4_inline9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c4">
<title>Mask</title>
<p>Finally, we employ the masking technique prevalent in masked language modeling and substitute the perturbed residue token with a special &lt;mask&gt; token. The prefix language model will interpret it as a novel token and employ self-attention mechanisms to assign a new representation to it.</p>
<p>We utilize the same hyperparameter settings as that of BERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Devlin et al., 2018</xref>) and choose 15% of tokens per iteration as potentially influenced subjects. Specifically, 80% of these subjects are replaced with &lt;mask&gt;, 10% of them are replaced randomly (to other residues), and the remaining 10% stay unchanged.</p>

<title>Folding Methods</title>
<p>The analysis of protein structure through topological embeddings poses challenges due to the inherent difficulty in obtaining accurate structural observations through experimental techniques such as NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wüthrich, 1990</xref>) and Cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Elmlund et al., 2017</xref>). As a substitution, we use <italic>in silico</italic> folding models such as AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) and ESMFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lin et al., 2023</xref>). Although these folding methods may introduce additional errors due to the inherent uncertainty or inaccuracy in structural predictions, we investigate the robustness of our model in the face of potential inaccuracies introduced by these folding strategies.</p>
<p><xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> examines the impact of different folding strategies on the performance of DMS predictions for ESM-if1, MIF-ST, and ProtSSN. Although the performance based on ESMFold-derived protein structures generally lags behind structures folded by AlphaFold2, the minimal difference between the two strategies across all four benchmarks validates the robustness of our ProtSSN in response to variations in input protein structures. We deliberately divide the assays in <bold>ProteinGym v0</bold> (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Notin et al., 2022a</xref>) into two groups of interaction (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., binding and stability) and catalysis (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., activity), as the former is believed more sensitive to the structure of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Robertson and Murphy, 1997</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>ProtSSN emerges as the most robust method, maintaining consistent performance across different folding strategies, which underscores the importance of our model’s resilience to variations in input protein structures. The reported performance difference for both ESM-if1 and MIF-ST is 3−5 times higher than that of ProtSSN. The inconsistency between the optimal results for <bold>DDG</bold> and the scores reported in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> comes from the utilization of crystal structures in the main results. Another noteworthy observation pertains to the performance of ESM-if1 and MIF-ST on <bold>DDG</bold>. In this case, predictions based on ESMFold surpass those based on AlphaFold2, even outperforming predictions derived from crystal structures. However, the superior performance of these methods with ESMFold hinges on inaccurate protein structures, rendering them less reliable.</p>

<title>Performance Enhancement with MSA and Ensemble</title>
<p>We extend the evaluation on <bold>ProteinGym v0</bold> to include a comparison of our zero-shot ProtSSN with few-shot learning methods that leverage MSA information of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Meier et al., 2021</xref>).

For ProtSSN, we employ an ensemble of nine models with varying sizes of <italic>k</italic>NN graphs (<italic>k</italic> ∈ {10, 20, 30}) and EGNN hidden neurons ({512, 768, 1280}), as discussed previously. The MSA depth reflects the number of MSA sequences that can be found for the protein, which influences the quality of MSA-based methods.</p>

<p>ProtSSN demonstrates superior performance among non-MSA zero-shot methods in predicting both single-site and multi-site mutants, underscoring its pivotal role in guiding protein engineering towards deep mutation. Furthermore, ProtSSN outperforms MSA-based methods across taxa, except for viruses, where precise identification of conserved sites is crucial for positive mutations, especially in spike proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Katoh and Standley, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mercurio et al., 2021</xref>). In essence, ProtSSN provides an efficient and effective solution for variant effects prediction when compared to both non-MSA and MSA-based methods. Note that although MSA-based methods generally consume fewer trainable parameters than non-MSA methods, they incur significantly higher costs in terms of search time and memory usage. Moreover, the inference performance of MSA-based methods relies heavily on the quality of the input MSA, where the additionally involved variance makes impacts the stability of the model performance.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The development of modern computational methodologies for protein engineering is a crucial facet of <italic>in silico</italic> protein design. Effectively assessing the fitness of protein mutants not only supports cost-efficient experimental validations but also guides the modification of proteins toward enhanced or novel functions. Traditionally, computational methods rely on analyzing small sets of labeled data for specific protein assays, such as FLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Dallago et al., 2021</xref>), PEER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Xu et al., 2022</xref>), and PETA (<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2024b</xref>). More recent work has also focused on examining the relationship between models and supervised fitness prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2024</xref>). However, obtaining experimental data is often infeasible in real-world scenarios, particularly for positive mutants, due to the cost and complexity of protein engineering. This limitation renders supervised learning methods impractical for many applications. As a result, it is crucial to develop solutions that can efficiently suggest site mutations for wet experiments, even when starting from scratch without prior knowledge. Recent deep learning solutions employ a common strategy that involves establishing a hidden protein representation and masking potential mutation sites to recommend plausible amino acids. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting protein representations from either their sequential or structural modalities, with many treating the prediction of mutational effects merely as a secondary task following inverse folding or <italic>de novo</italic> protein design. These approaches often overlook the importance of comprehensive investigation on both global and local perspectives of amino acid interaction that are critical for featuring protein functions. Furthermore, these methods hardly tailored model designs for suggesting mutations, despite the significance of this type of task. In this work, we introduce ProtSSN, a denoising framework that effectively cascades protein sequence and structure embedding for predicting mutational effects. Both the protein language model and equivariant graph neural network are employed to encode the global interaction of amino acids with geometry-aware local enhancements.</p>
<p>On the other hand, existing benchmarks for evaluating computational solutions mostly focus on assessing model generalization on large-scale datasets (e.g., over 2 million mutants in <bold>ProteinGym v1</bold>). However, such high-throughput datasets often lack accurate experimental measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Frazer et al., 2021</xref>), leading to significant noise in the labels. Furthermore, the larger data volumes typically do not include environmental labels for mutants (e.g., temperature, pH), despite the critical importance of these conditions for biologists. In response, we propose <bold>DTm</bold> and <bold>DDG</bold>. These low-throughput datasets, which we have collected, emphasize the consistency of experimental conditions and data accuracy. They are traceable and serve as valuable complements to ProteinGym, providing a more detailed and reliable evaluation of computational models. We have extensively validated the efficacy of ProtSSN across various protein function assays and taxa, including two thermostability datasets prepared by ourselves. Our approach consistently demonstrates substantial promise for protein engineering applications, such as facilitating the design of mutation sequences with enhanced interaction and enzymatic activity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors introduce a denoising-style model that incorporates both structure and primary-sequence embeddings to generate richer embeddings of peptides. My understanding is that the authors use ESM for the primary sequence embeddings, take resolved structures (or use structural predictions from AlphaFold when they're not available), then develop an architecture to combine these two with a loss that seems reminiscent of diffusion models or masked language model approaches. The embeddings can be viewed as ensemble-style embedding of the two levels of sequence information, or with AlphaFold, an ensemble of two methods (ESM+AlphaFold). The authors also gather external datasets to evaluate their approach and compare it to previous approaches. The approach seems promising and appears to out-compete previous methods at several tasks. Nonetheless, I have strong concerns about a lack of verbosity as well as exclusion of relevant methods and references.</p>
<p>Advances:</p>
<p>I appreciate the breadth of the analysis and comparisons to other methods. The authors separate tasks, models, and sizes of models in an intuitive, easy-to-read fashion that I find valuable for selecting a method for embedding peptides. Moreover, the authors gather two datasets for evaluating embeddings' utility for predicting thermostability. Overall, the work should be helpful for the field as more groups choose methods/pretraining strategies amenable to their goals, and can do so in an evidence-guided manner.</p>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<p>Primarily, a majority of the results and conclusions (e.g., Table 3) are reached using data and methods from ProteinGym, yet the best-performing methods on ProteinGym are excluded from the paper (e.g., EVE-based models and GEMME). In the ProteinGym database, these methods outperform ProtSSN models. Moreover, these models were published over a year---or even 4 years in the case of GEMME---before ProtSSN, and I do not see justification for their exclusion in the text.</p>
<p>Secondly, related to comparison of other models, there is no section in the methods about how other models were used, or how their scores were computed. When comparing these models, I think it's crucial that there are explicit derivations or explanations for the exact task used for scoring each method. In other words, if the pre-training is indeed the important advance of the paper, the paper needs to show this more explicitly by explaining exactly which components of the model (and previous models) are used for evaluation. Are the authors extracting the final hidden layer representations of the model, treating these as features, then using these features in a regression task to predict fitness/thermostability/DDG etc.? How are the model embeddings of other methods being used, since, for example, many of these methods output a k-dimensional embedding of a given sequence, rather than one single score that can be correlated with some fitness/functional metric. Summarily, I think the text is lacking an explicit mention of how these embeddings are being summarized or used, as well as how this compares to the model presented.</p>
<p>I think the above issues can mainly be addressed by considering and incorporating points from Li et al. 2024[1] and potentially Tang &amp; Koo 2024[2]. Li et al.[1] make extremely explicit the use of pretraining for downstream prediction tasks. Moreover, they benchmark pretraining strategies explicitly on thermostability (one of the main considerations in the submitted manuscript), yet there is no mention of this work nor the dataset used (FLIP (Dallago et al., 2021)) in this current work. I think a reference and discussion of [1] is critical, and I would also like to see comparisons in line with [1], as [1] is very clear about what features from pretraining are used, and how. If the comparisons with previous methods were done in this fashion, this level of detail needs to be included in the text.</p>
<p>To conclude, I think the manuscript would benefit substantially from a more thorough comparison of previous methods. Maybe one way of doing this is following [1] or [2], and using the final embeddings of each method for a variety of regression tasks---to really make clear where these methods are performing relative to one another. I think a more thorough methods section detailing how previous methods did their scoring is also important. Lastly, TranceptEVE (or a model comparable to it) and GEMME should also be mentioned in these results, or at the bare minimum, be given justification for their absence.</p>

<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>My concerns have been addressed. What seems to remain are some semantical disagreements and I'm not sure that these will be answered here. Do MSAs and other embedding methods lead to some notable type of data leakage? Does this leakage qualify as &quot;x-shot&quot; learning under current definitions?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>To design proteins and predict disease, we want to predict the effects of mutations on the function of a protein. To make these predictions, biologists have long turned to statistical models that learn patterns that are conserved across evolution. There is potential to improve our predictions however by incorporating structure. In this paper the authors build a denoising auto-encoder model that incorporates sequence and structure to predict mutation effects. The model is trained to predict the sequence of a protein given its perturbed sequence and structure. The authors demonstrate that this model is able to predict the effects of mutations better than sequence-only models.</p>
<p>As well, the authors curate a set of assays measuring the effect of mutations on thermostability. They demonstrate their model also predicts the effects of these mutations better than previous models and make this benchmark available for the community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors describe a method that makes accurate mutation effect predictions by informing its predictions with structure.</p>
<p>The authors curate a new dataset of assays measuring thermostability. These can be used to validate and interpret mutation effect prediction methods in the future.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the review period, the authors included a previous method, SaProt, that similarly uses protein structure to predict the effects of mutations, in their evaluations. They see that SaProt performs similarly to their method.</p>
<p>ProteinGym is largely made of deep mutational scans, which measure the effect of every mutation on a protein. These new benchmarks contain on average measurements of less than a percent of all possible point mutations of their respective proteins. It is unclear what sorts of protein regions these mutations are more likely to lie in; therefore it is challenging to make conclusions about what a model has necessarily learned based on its score on this benchmark. For example, several assays in this new benchmark seem to be similar to each other, such as four assays on ubiquitin performed in pH 2.25 to pH 3.0.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I think the rounds of review have improved the paper and I've raised my score.</p>

<p>Thank you for your recognition of our revised work.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be useful to have a demonstration of where this model outperforms SaProt systematically, and a discussion about what the success of this model teaches us given there is a similar, previously successful model, SaProt.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As two concurrent works, ProtSSN and SaProt employ different methods to incorporate the structure information of proteins. Generally speaking, for two deep learning models that are developed during a close period, it is challenging to conclude that one model is systematically superior to another. Nonetheless, on DTm and DDG (the two low-throughput datasets that we constructed), ProtSSN demonstrates better empirical performance than SaProt.</p>
<p>Moreover, ProtSSN is more efficient in both training and inference compared to SaProt. In terms of training cost, SaProt uses 40 million protein structures for pretraining (requiring 64 A100 GPUs for three months), whereas ProtSSN requires only about 30,000 crystal structures from the CATH database (trained on a single 3090 GPU for two days). Despite SaProt’s significantly higher training cost, its pretrained version does not exhibit superior performance on low-throughput datasets such as DTm, DDG, and Clinvar. Furthermore, the high training cost limits many users from retraining or fine-tuning the model for specific needs or datasets.</p>
<p>Regarding the inference cost, ProtSSN requires only one embedding computation for a wild-type protein, regardless of the number of mutants (n). In contrast, SaProt computes a separate embedding and score for each mutant. For instance, when evaluating the scoring performance on ProteinGym, ProtSSN only needs 217 inferences, while SaProt needs more than 2M inferences. This inference speed is important in practice, such as high-throughput design and screening.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Please remove the reference to previous methods as &quot;few shot&quot;. This typically refers to their being trained on experimental data, not their using MSAs. A &quot;few shot&quot; model would be ProteinNPT.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The definition of &quot;few-shot&quot; we used here is following ESM1v [1]. This concept originates from providing a certain number of examples as input to GPT-3 [2]. In the context of protein deep learning models, MSA serves as the wild-type protein examples.</p>
<p>Also, Reviewer 1 uses the concept in the same way.</p>
<p>“Readers should note that methods labelled as &quot;few-shot&quot; in comparisons do not make use of experimental labels, but rather use sequences inferred as homologous; these sequences are also often available even if the protein has never been experimentally tested.”</p>
<p>In the main text, we also included this definition as well as the reference of ESM-1v in lines 457-458.</p>
<p>“We extend the evaluation on ProteinGym v0 to include a comparison of our zero-shot ProtSSN with few-shot learning methods that leverage MSA information of proteins (Meier et al., 2021).”</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, I don't think it is fair to state that your method is not comparable to these models -- one can run an MSA just as one can predict a structure. A fairer comparison would be to highlight particular assays for which getting an MSA could be challenging -- Transcription did this by showing that they outperform EVE when MSAs are shallow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We recognize that there are often differences in the definitions and classifications of various methodologies. Here, we follow the definitions provided by ProteinGym. As the most comprehensive and large scale open benchmark in the community, we believe this classification scheme should be widely accepted. All classifications are available on the official website of ProteinGym (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://proteingym.org/benchmarks">https://proteingym.org/benchmarks</ext-link>), which categorizes methods into PLMs, Structure-based models, and Alignment-based models. For example, GEMME is classified as an alignment-based model, and MSA Transformer is considered a hybrid model combining alignment and PLM features.</p>
<p>We believe that methodologies with different inputs and architectures can lead to inherent unfairness. Also, it is generally believed that models including evolutionary relationships tend to outperform end-to-end models due to the extra information and efforts involved during the training phase. Some empirical evidence and discussions are in the ablation studies of retrieval factors in Tranception [3]. Moreover, the choice of MSA search parameters can introduce uncertainty, which could have positive or negative impacts.</p>
<p>We showcase the impact of MSA depth on model performance with an additional analysis below. Author response image 1 visualizes the Spearman’s correlation between the scores of each model and the number of MSAs on 217 ProteinGym assays, where each point represents one of 217 assays. The summary correlation of each model with respect to all assays are reported in Author response table 1. These results demonstrate no clear correlation between MSA depth and model performance even for MSA-based models.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors state that DTm and DDG are conceptually appealing because they come from low-throughput assays with lower experimental noise and are also mutations that are particularly chosen to represent the most interesting regions of the protein. I agree with the conceptual appeal but I don't think these claims have been demonstrated in practice. The cited comparison with Frazer as a particularly noisy source of data I think is particularly unconvincing: ClinVar labels are not only rigorously determined from multiple sources of evidence, Frazer et al demonstrates that these labels are actually more reliable than experiment in some cases. They also state that ProteinGym data doesn't come with environmental conditions, but these can be retrieved from the papers the assays came from. The paper would be strengthened by a demonstration of the conceptual benefit of these new datasets, say a comparison of mutations and signal for a protein that may be in one of these datasets vs ProteinGym.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the work by Frazer et al. [4], they mentioned that</p>
<p>&quot;However, these technologies do not easily scale to thousands of proteins, especially not to combinations of variants, and depend critically on the availability of assays that are relevant to or at least associated with human disease phenotypes.&quot;</p>
<p>It points out that the results of high-throughput experiments are usually based on the design of specific genes (such as BRCA1 and TP53.) and cannot be easily extended to thousands of other genes. At the same time, due to the complexity of the experiment, there may be problems with reproducibility or deviations from clinical relevance.</p>
<p>This statement aligns with our perspective that high-throughput experiments inherently involve a significant amount of noise and error. It is important to clarify that the noise we discuss here arises from the limitations of high-throughput experiments themselves, instead of from the reliability of the data sources, such as systematic errors in experimental measurements. This latter issue is a complex problem common to all wetlab experiments and falls outside the scope of our study.</p>
<p>Under this premise, low-throughput datasets like DTm and DDG can be considered to have less noise than high-throughput datasets, as they have undergone manual curation. As for your suggestion, while valuable, unfortunately, we were unable to identify datasets in DTM and DDG that align with those in ProteinGym after a careful search. Thus, we are unable to conduct this comparative experiment at this stage.</p>
